All strains are loaded in triplo, with 1% phosphorylated cellulose, in a final volume of 200 µl. The positive control strains also contain 0.5% final concentration of glucose.
Who: Jan Marten
Aim Analyze results of cellulose degradation assay
The plate is removed from the plate reader, and the data is downloaded. Immediately a problem is clear. When looking at the plate it is obvious that all the cellulose in the cellulose samples has sticked to one corner of the well, and hasn’t been mixed through the sample properly. This likely happened during the loading of the 96-well plate, as the carbon sources were the first liquids pipetted into the wells. Since these were only 10-20 µl drops, they would have sticked to one corner and not mixed properly throughout the sample. No effort is made to process the data, as no useable information on cellulose will be available.

Aim Colony PCR of restreaked colony pSB1C3-Zcas 5-10-18
See Colony PCR protocol . Primers: VF2, RV. Annealing temp: 55 degrees C. 18 colonies are tested. See agarose gel protocol .
Results
All numbered lanes contain colony PCR product. A band can be observed at the desired height of 1600 bp, but also at approx 300 bp. The band at 300 bp corresponds to an empty vector. These results show that both plasmids are integrated into the transformant, but to verify this samples are send for sequencing.
Who: Owen
Aim Restriction analysis of pSB1C3-PAL2 plasmids obtained during transformation 30-9-18
See restriction analysis protocol . EcoRI and SpeI used as restriction enzymes.
Results
Lane 1-6 contain restriction analyses of pSB1C3-PAL2. Restriction of the plasmid should form a fragment of 2kB and 2300bp. Samples from lane 1, 4 and 5 show a broader band than the other lanes, this is a good indication of the presence of the correct fragment.

Groningen,2009,Team:Groningen#Brainstorm#Buoyant Bacteria_-_-_TEXT.html," a small 70AA long protein which forms a linear crystalline array of ribs to form the cylindrical shell and conical ends. GvpC is usually on the outside of the gas vesicle to make it stronger and stabilizes the structure.
In B. megaterium a gas vesicle gene-cluster was found, which contained 14 gvp genes (gas vescicle polycitonic genes) which were functionally expressed in E. coli by Ning Li and Maura Cannon (Li and Cannon, 1995). The best bouyant fenotype was found when  gvpA, gvpP, gvpQ and ORF-1 were excluded. It was suggested that gvpB on the gvp-cluster of B. megaterium is an homolog of gvpA. 900px
Gas vesicles in iGEM
In iGEM 2007, Melbourne created a biobrick for gas vesicle formation. In iGEM 2008 Kyoto had the idea to lift the titanic from the bottom of the sea with the help of bouyant bacteria.
Melbourne iGEM 2007 team constructed a bouyant E. coli and also they added a BioBrick of the short version of the gvp-cluster (without gvpA,P,Q, ORF-1 and AraC). This BioBrick is available and also in the microtiter plate send by HQ to us, so we can use this. Melbourne changed the gvp-cluster by cleaning it from 3 EcoRI sites and 1 PstI site, this leaded to a accidental addition of a 10x repeat of ""TCTGCAAATTA"". They mention that they added the BioBrick prefix and suffix to the BioBrick, though the restriction sites of these additions cannot be found by CloneManager in the sequence available on the Partregistry. Hopefully the part is available on a standard vector, which has the pre- and suffix for BioBricks. For cloning this part we can use the optimized protocol (restriction on part with XbaI and SpeI, on the vector with SpeI) for ligation of the gvp-cluster and a vector BBa_J61035 (3539bp, copy nr??), this unluckaly leads to ligation of the gvp-cluster in an unspecific direction. This can of course be tested by restriction, PCR or sequencing, but it takes more time as another step will be introduced. The vector has two selection markers: Ampicillin and Gentamycin.

Biosensor Competing Technologies
Microtox® CTM - The Microtox® Continuous Monitoring (CTM) system allows for on-line autonomous monitoring for 4 weeks without requiring maintenance, and will take continuous readings of toxicity levels in an environmental site. We believe that the method by which this technology has accomplished this continuous monitoring using live bacteria could be something that our system could be adapted to in the future. As well, other methods are being explored theoretically in order to adapt our system so that it can provide the same complement to the Microtox® technology that the portable version provides. The continuous monitoring system answers a call specifically to the requirement for long-term monitoring of sample sites. Our technology provides a solution for rapid spot-testing rather than continuous systems.
DeltaTox®II and ToxTrackP - Both of these systems are portable methods for general detection of toxins in the environment. These are direct competitors to our product line and hold a stake within the global general toxin sensing market. Market adoption of our technology will be critical in achieving our product success. Our system provides several key advantages over these systems including a fast response, more reliable reads, and decreased cost.
Portable Analytical Devices
Portable GC/MS, HPLC, and FTIR Systems - These technologies for portable sensing using traditional analytical methods are also being developed, as well as smaller systems for easier analysis. However, we believe that cost and ease of use of these systems will continue to be a barrier to their widespread use in field testing applications. This has been seen in the market since many of these technologies have not been widely utilized by industry.
Emerging Technologies
In addition to this direct monitoring technology, other means of collecting samples over time are being developed. SPMDs (Semi‐Permeable Membrane Device) are composed of a membrane lined with a thin film of lipid, and are put onto a metal frame to be deployed into the environment. These devices will be deployed into water systems in order to capture the bioavailable, lipophilic pollutants present. Contaminants that can be captured by such a system belong to hydrophobic classes of chemicals (aliphatic hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons). These compounds are capable of penetrating and disrupting cell membranes, and often cause acute and chronic toxic effects to wildlife.
Another system known as POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler) will be used to capture polar, hydrophilic, water soluble toxins. This system is composed of microporous polyethersulfone membranes, between which a solid absorbent compound is held."

The cocktail
We concluded the event by having a rooftop cocktail on top of the building. The cocktail, prepared by ourselves, was a V.I.P event in order to thank the speakers for coming. Some professionals were also there, along with some school directors, and of course, the team members !
This cocktail was the perfect opportunity for us to have more in-depth discussions with the professionals, and we really enjoyed it. Shortly after that, we headed out to the place where the party would be located.
Partying with the IGEMers
This party was the pinnacle of our event. We organized it in a dedicated hall, and invited everyone to come ! Some suprises were also planned, such as the retransmission of the Quarterfinals Euro Cup match (Germany vs. Italy), a beautiful balloon ark and even some fire-breathing fun !
Again, the safety and comfort of everyone was our top priority during the whole event. That is why we managed to get a partnership with Heetch, a French version of Uber, allowing everyone to come safely to the hotel by car for less than 3€ per person.
Thanks to Heetch, everyone could party all night long, and no one had any issue with the Parisian transportations ! Al the people had to do was to have fun and to call a taxi.
Visiting Paris
As Sunday was the day of departure for all the iGEM teams, we wanted to give them some free time to enjoy France in general, and Paris in particular. However, we thought it would be nice for those who wanted it to have the occasion to discover the city with their fellow iGEMers, and we therefore organized a set of tours for everyone to enjoy ! Led by the Evry students, these tours were centered about some specific areas of Paris, such as the Jardins du Luxembourg and the Museum of Natural History.

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT#Biosensor_-_-_TEXT.html," intracellular cadmium ion
Before measuring the data of mater model, we have measured a series of quantitative data about the concentration of extracellular and intracellular cadmium ion. We attempt to build a sub model. [2]
But we felt pity that because of extremely low concentration of intracellular cadmium ion, we have no idea how to measure that data accurately. Therefore, we are forced to give up our work of building this sub model. We have to replace the concentration of intracellular cadmium ion with its extracellular concentration directly as an independent variable.
After that, we have measured the quantitative data of mater model primarily. By analyzing the tendency of these data, we draw a conclusion that the abandonment of this sub model almost have no influence when building master model.
However, if time permits, we still hope to improve our measuring method, making it possible for us to build the sub model. We think this will make the master model to be more accurate.
3)Sub Model for measuring RFP fluorescence
The common light bulb gives out constant, stable light whose intensity doesn’t change a lot. However, the situation of RFP fluorescence is not like that. Because the expression of polypeptides and the maturation of RFP protein need certain time, so there is a lag phase between the activation of PcadA and the present of fluorescence. In addition, the constant expression of RFP protein, the degradation of RFP protein and dilution of RRP protein due to cell division make fluorescence quantity of RFP changes. [3]
In order to measure the quantitative data of the strength of PcadA more accurately, we must build a sub model for measuring RFP fluorescence.
III.Parameter Measuring and Data Processing
1) Parameter Measuring
We have designed a quantitative experiment and measured a series of data primarily.
2)Data Processing [3]
Sp1.work out the fluorescence value per OD based on the total fluorescence value and total OD number.
Sp2.draw the curve of the fluorescence value per OD vs the incubating time.
Sp3.choose the data in stable phase from aforementioned curve.
Sp4.draw the curve of the fluorescence value per OD vs the incubating time during the stable phase. And calculate its slope, that is
.
Sp5.draw the curve of ln[OD] vs incubating time and calculate its slope, namely,
.
Sp6.work out the strength of the promotor:
Sp7.use the Logarithmic mapping method to work out m and Xm, then we let PMAX equal with the strength of promotor when the concentration of Cd2+ is 10-4 mol/L"

Crust promoter evaluation
The figure below shows the result of the evaluation of the three promoters (PcgeA, PcotV, PcotYZ) for the spore crust proteins with a previous version of the luminescence reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE . For each promoter two independent clones were evaluated three times. To link the promoter activities to the growth phase, the optical density (OD600) was measured throughout the whole experiment.
Fig. 1: The result of the measurement of the three promoters PcgeA, PcotV and PcotYZ fused to the lux operon. The left vertical axis displays the luminescence divided by the OD600 and the left one shows the OD600. On the horizontal axis the time is illustrated. The continuous lines show the luminescence which correlates with the promoter activity and the dotted lines display the growth curve of each clone.
The native promoters of cotZ, PcotYZ and  PcotV, show a clear signal late in stationary phase, as expected. PcotYZ is activated two hours earlier than PcotV and both promoters are active for about 12 hours. In contrast, PcgeA does not show any activity.

We use a variant of the mCherry red fluorescent protein (RFP). The variant sequence was codon-optimized for the expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as yeast-enhanced mRFP (yEmRFP) and can combine fluorescence and a purple visible phenotype. Unfortunately, the RFP can’t be directly observed by bare eyes, we decided to use the Fluorescence spectrophotometer(F-2500) and use OD600 to determination cell concentration. Meanwhile, we will observe using Fluorescence microscopy for fluorescent proteins expression. The red color can be observed if yEmRFP is expressed.
5) Construction of Vika System
We use a common expression vector plasmid, pRS416, to load Vika part. First of all, we use corresponding restriction endonuclease Sal1 and Not1 to cut plasmid pRS416 and plasmid pRS415-Vika, a gift from Y.J lab, and then use T4 DNA ligase to link them together, we can obtain the complete device we want. Finally, we transform this device into BY4742 by the lithium acetate conversion method, and we screen for the correctly transformed cell by using the Sc-Ura plate. BY4742 is a haploid with mating type of α.
We also use another plasmid pRS413 with previous method.
6) The Induction of Mating
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae called PVRVC is haploid with mating type of a. At first, we cultivate pRS416-Vika in Sc-Ura medium without glucose for three hours. To induce the expression of Vika, they will be cultured to saturation in Sc medium with raffinose and galactose for twelve hours. After that, recombinase Vika are induced to express and we make α-pRS416-Vika cell and a-TVRVC cell mate in YPD medium for eight hours. Two types cells are fused and form diploid yeasts, in which recombinase Vika bind with vox locus, and then delete yEmRFP gene and Adh1 terminator flanked by vox sites. After the Mating Switcher, β-carotene expresses and the color of cell will transform from white to orange. At last we smear yeast solution on Sc-Ura-Leu plate to screen for the correctly mating cell. We can judge the existence of recombinase Vika by the color of the colony, and obtain the efficiency of mating.

1. Goals for the week
Our goals for this week are to correctly prepare and successfully extract phage from a CsCl gradient.
2.Experiments and results
After our first attempt at purification using PEG, we decided to perform a phage titer to check for phage viability. The titers were successful. Both plates showed plaques. On the plate of W3110 infected with T4 phage, there was contamination. Plaques were still visible and it was determined that the team should continue on, as the next step of a CsCl gradient should remove any contaminants.
w3110
BL21
When performing the next step of the CsCl gradient, we added the incorrect amount of CsCl to phage suspension buffer, causing the gradient to be half as dense as it should have been. We had layered in very little phage to begin with, and the team determined it would be better to restart with a larger amount of phage particles to purify.
We completed the first step in PEG purification for the second time. With the doubled amount of phage, we had much more to layer in the CsCl gradient and there were visible bands in the gradient since the correct concentrations were used.
The CsCl gradient was successful the second time it was ran. There were visible bands of bacterial debris and phage particles.
3. Next Steps
Successfully extract phage particles from the CsCl gradient, remove from CsCl using phage suspension buffer.
Perform the third and final step of purification with an equilibrium CsCl gradient.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

1. ASTA biosynthesis
Astaxanthin (3, 3′-dihydroxy-β-carotene-4, 4′-dione) is a natural keto-carotenoid which is found in some microalgae, shrimps and salmons (Figure 1). This compound is insoluble in water while soluble in most of organic solvent. Astaxanthin is synthesized merely in some specific species such as algae (Haematococcus pluvialis) , and yeast (Phaffia) . It cannot be synthesized in animals, but many marine animals uptake astaxanthin in via their diets of algae and acquire the red pigmentation. Astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant. Thus, astaxanthin has been claimed a good commercial prospect for its value in medical and health care.
 
 
Figure 1   Astaxanthin wildly exists in microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis（left） , shrimps (middle) and salmons (right), but only some microalgae can synthesize astaxanthin.
 
Currently, the industrial productions of astaxanthin are extracted from microalgae H.pluvialis, Phaffia yeast, shrimp processing waste and chemical product. However, these ways are not safe enough and the purification is difficult. While higher plants are supposed to be an efficient and safe bioreactor to produce astaxanthin, because it has advanced protein processing system to produce complex products, such as senior terpenoids. In nature, many precious products are terpenoid, such as carotenoid, microbial A, paclitaxel, etc. But many complex products could not be synthesized by animals.
 
Although higher plants such as Zea mays are capable to synthesize zeaxanthin, which is the metabolic precursor of astaxanthin. However, due to their lack of β-carotene ketolase, astaxanthin still cannot be synthesized in these higher plants.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#ProjectDiscription_-_-_TEXT.html," 3D structure modeling were conducted to analyze the collected information. Then appropriate topology candidates for needed function were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish expected bioreporter or bioabsorbent function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. Therefore, We opened up an alternative approach to efficient and robust biosensor and bioabsorbent engineering.
    We analyzed the function and operation of a MerR family TF, MerR into detail via bioware experiments and modeling. We found that the TF expression level in cytosol and the binding affinity between TF and its operator site have great influence on bacterial sensitivity to mercury. Then, rational design of genetic circuits was conducted to confer mercury sensor and regulator components high efficiency and robustness. As is expected, these constructed bioreporters are capable of discriminating mercury concentration ranging from 10^-8 M to 10^-6 M in water, regardless of incubation time and bioreporter activity in a wide window. In other words, there is no necessity to calibrate before detection. This means that the field application of bioreporter can be carried out without costly equipment while fidelity and sensitivity are still conserved.

    Meanwhile, we took a closer look into the structure of MerR family TFs(Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007; Hobman et al., 2005). The metal binding domain of MerR is a 48-residue, named alpha-helix 5(Guo et al.; Song et al., 2007). A strategy to engineer MerR TF proteins was developed baedsed previous work (Qin et al., 2006; Song et al., 2004). We directly fused two copies of metal binding domain into a single-chain, antiparallel coiled coil, called Metal Binding Peptide ( MBP). And then high-performance bioabsorbent was implemented by expressing MBP on the surface, in periplasm and in cytosol of E.coli, former 2 of which were accomplished by fusion of MBP with special translocation protein, OmpA and DsbA. The following function test results showed that our bacteria can absorb more than 50% of 10-6 mol/L Hg (II) in 2 hours; WHICH IS in consistent with previous work that artificial MBP chain can simulate the in vivo metal-binding ability of dimeric, full-length MerR.

    Additionally, we noticed that MerR family TFs share a highly conserved"

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html,"osa this exopolymer matrix is effective at denying macrophages access and preventing them from digesting the dormant bacteria. Should antibiotic-susceptible members of the biofilm population be wiped out, the space enclosed by the exopolymer can be repopulated by any individual bacteria which carry resistance genes once therapy is discontinued. The persistence of these bacteria as a biofilm within the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and in chronic wounds is well known. In addition, the CDC estimates that 65% of infections in developed nations like the United States are caused by persistent bacterial biofilms. (2)

Signaling
The ability of bacteria to lie low is an indispensable evolutionary adaptation for P. aeruginosa, M. tuberculosis, and V. cholerae. In effect these bacteria have the ability to wait out and evade our immune systems or persist contrary to adverse environmental factors. Is there a unifying factor to these seemingly similar latent behaviors?
The chemical Bis-(3’-5’)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) was discovered in the late 1980s. (7) The compound is created when two molecules of guanosine triphosphate are joined in a reaction catalyzed by diguanylate cyclase (DGC). Originally found in Gluconacetobacter xylinus, natural and synthetic versions of the molecule were shown to activate the bacterium’s membrane-bound cellulose synthase. (8) In other bacteria it has been shown to promote the synthesis of adhesins and exopolymers necessary for biofilm formation. (5) (8) In order to test the effects of c-di-GMP research groups working with a range of bacterial species have upregulated the production of DGC enzymes responsible for the secondary messenger’s synthesis. (8) This modification caused the transgenic strains to become sessile and less virulent, implicating that the secondary messenger is the signal which informs the cells to switch to an inactive, sessile, and persistent state. (8) On the other hand, artificially stimulating the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes which break down c-di-GMP resulted in motile populations unable to form a biofilm. (8) (See Figure)

Additional work has also provided further information about the mode of action of the c-di-GMP molecule itself. In silico computations predicted that the PilZ protein domain present in G. xylin"

Transfer the supernatant to other Eppendorf.                             Add 75μL of Na-Ac 3M (approximately 1/10 of the                             volume) and 0.5mL of isopropanol (around 60% of                             volume). Mix well and centrifuge 2-3 minutes at                             10000rpm. If no pellet is produced, it will be a                             DNA concentration in the bottom; in this case, the                             supernatant should be removed with a pipette being                             extremely careful to not lose the DNA.
Wash the sediment once or twice with 70%                             ethanol (200-100 μL and centrifuge). Dry on                             speed-vac and resuspend in 0.1mL of mili-Q water.                             If with this amount of water it is not well                             dissolved, add more water each time. To dissolve it                             is left on ice, shaking from time to time, during                             approximately one hour.

The type of surgery is currently not taken in charge by the French health care system due to the high risk of infection, and breaking of the bone and the prosthesis, and only one surgeon is doing this type of operation in the country: Dr. Marion Bernard. Mr. Hons-Olivier did raise up some concerns about our project being too innovative since only a few industries in the USA are working on bionic prostheses and this type of surgery costs more around 100 000 euros at the moment.
CERAH
Thanks to Jean-Pascal Hons-Olivier’s generosity and his prosthetist, Didier Azoulay, we visited CERAH, the center of studies and research on equipment for disabled persons. We attended a course on prostheses with students in physical therapy. Also, we had the opportunity to see a step of prosthesis fabrication: namely stump molding for its sleeve. During this afternoon, we discovered osseointegration as a surgical technique to implant the prosthesis. Most of the time, the arm or leg’s prostheses aren’t integrated into the body but just attached to the body by a silicon sleeve which maintains the device by creating the vacuum. We understood that this method causes an excessive transpiration due to the sleeve and can generate pain on the bone’s end. Encouraged by these observations and due to the fact that we need a physical link between the body’s inside and the prosthesis, we chose osseointegration to NeuronArch project.

i.CERAM based in Limoges, France, was founded in 2005 and is designing, manufacturing and marketing high-tech implants for various joints of the human body. The marriage of different ceramic materials and processes is one of the main features of the company.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched and there may be more than one regions. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the task is reduced to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. In each combination, matchings of different chains should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are ("

Overview
Electron transfer
Construction
Construction of an electrophilic E. coli strain
Our first module deals with the construction of an E. coli strain, which is able to accept electrons stimulating its metabolism. We considered two different electron transfer systems: direct and indirect electron transfer.
Direct electron transfer in bacteria is a very complex and not completely cleared up so far. Due to this we focused on the indirect electron transfer via a mediator, which is reduced at the electrode in a electrobiochemical reactor and would be reoxidized again by bacterial cells.( Park et al., 1999 ) In gram-negative bacteria E. coli there are two membranes with a periplasmatic space between them, which has to be overcome in the course of the electron transfer.
We worked on three different mediators: neutral red, bromphenol blue and cytochromes. Additionally we constructed an electropholic E. coli strain, which shows an increased metabolic activity growing with electric power, which has been proven in our H-cell reactor ( Park et al., 1999 ).
The electron transfer system consists of different steps. First of all the reduced mediator has to cross the outer membrane of the E. coli cell. For that we used the outer membrane porine OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ) provided by the iGEM Team Bielefeld-Germany 2013 . Crossing the periplasmatic"

Implementation: Mating Factor Alpha
Our communication circuit is also driven by the TET promoter — doxycycline induction results in expression of a secreted signaling molecule. We have repurposed an endogenous yeast signaling system for this circuit, the mating pathway. Our yeast strains contain the receptors and downstream signaling cascade to be able to respond to the presence of mating factor alpha; however, the only alpha production gene is controlled by our communication circuit [ 5 , 6 ].

Alpha factor is secreted by all of the cells in the population, and can be similarly sensed by all cells.

Binding of alpha factor to its receptor, Ste2, triggers a signaling cascade that stimulates induction at alpha factor responsive promoters, of which we characterized and submitted 11 to the Parts Registry (see below ).

To confirm that our circuits behave as we have designed them to behave, we set up two different experiments:
1. Simple doxycycline dose response to test cell autonomous behavior. The results of this experiment can be found here .
2. Mixing experiment (on the right), where we test the ability of our circuit to produce convergent behavior with artificially induced divergence. In our experiment, we mix our lowest responding cell autonomous circuit with rtTA expressed by pTEF1(m7) with our higest responding circuit with pTEF1. We expect that through intercellular signaling and the community circuit, the two populations will look in distinguishable by the community response reporter.

Abstract
To transform the lysine signal to the kind of signal which is easy to be detected, we chose to use a lysine deficient E.coli. It can hardly grow without lysine. But when the medium contains lysine released from the complementary chain, the E.coli ΔLysA begins to grow. Meanwhile, we transformed a plasmid with fluorescent protein gene into the E.coli ΔLysA. So with the growth of the E.coli ΔLysA, there will be fluorescence which is easy to be detected.       In this way, we can transform the lysine signal to the fluorescence signal. Consider that the lysine concentration could be weak, we decided to use a strong promoter(BBa_J23100) and a cyclic amplifier to improve the signal, and a dual fluorescence system to improve the sensitivity.
Introduction
1
After the lysine has been dissociated from complementary chain, it will induce the growth of E.coli ΔLysA, which can hardly grow without the addition of lysine. Thus we have transformed our own-designed circuit to the E.coli ΔLysA, which can express fluorescent protein as it grows. In this way, we can transform the concentration of lysine to the fluorescent intensity which can be detected through the machine.
4.
Besides the luxR and luxI generator, there are also lacI generator and GFP reporter downstream the plux promoter. LacI represses plac promoter, leading to an inhibition to the RFP expression. So with the induction of plux promoter, there will be a higher GFP fluorescence and a lower RFP fluorescence.
2.
But the concentration of the lysine is very low, resulting in a low fluorescent intensity. To solve this problem, we designed a strong promoter, cyclic amplifier system and a dual fluorescence system in our genetic circuit to ensure a much higher signal strength and sensitivity, which is definitely beneficial to our detection of AFP.

3.
As shown, pcat is a strong constitutive promoter, which can promote the induced promoter plux. Promoter plux can be induced by the compound of LuxR and AHL. Downstream the plux, we designed the a cyclic amplifier system: luxR generator codes LuxR, and LuxI generator codes luxI, which can catalyze the synthesis of AHL. When the concentration of AHL has reached the threshold value,"

Pri-miRNA
Conditional RNAi
RdRP
Cancer Gene Therapy
Pri-miRNA
MiRNAs are a group of short non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Binding of a miRNA to its target mRNA mediates mRNA degradation and blocks translation. MiRNA biogenesis initiates with the transcription of the pri‑miRNA. General domains of a pri-miRNA is shown on the right. These long pri‑miRNAs are then cleaved by Microprocessor, which comprises the double‑stranded RNase III enzyme DROSHA and its essential cofactor, the double‑stranded RNA (dsRNA)‑binding protein DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8). DROSHA requires long single-stranded regions flanking the short hairpin structure in its substrates. If the basal ssRNA is somehow blocked, the cleavage reaction would also be blocked.
For more information, please see Reference(1) . The figure General domains of a pri-miRNA and Schematic diagram of the base-anchor model come from Reference (2) and (3) .
Conditional RNAi
Historically, PTGS can now be called RNA interference (RNAi).Because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest, RNAi is now a valuable research tool.More recently, oligonucleotides and various RNA molecules based on RNA interference (RNAi) have proven their potential as reagents for gene therapy applications. However, RNAi itself has no selectivity over the sites of interest. For cancer therapy to be discussed below,RNAi impairs not only the tumor cells but also the normal cells. Besides, constitutive knock-down of genes may result in undesirable outcomes in such biomedical applications.Therefore, spatial and/or temporal regulation of RNAi is of significant importance for basic research as well as practical applications of RNAi. This is the basic idea of conditional RNAi and what we CPU_CHINA this year are trying to do.
For examples of condition RNAi, please see Reference (4) and (5) .

Abstract

Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Beginning of Cell Lysis
The start-up culture incubated overnight in 1 L of LB is removed from the shaking incubator. An OD check is performed, and reported to be 0.65. The contents from the flask are divided up into 20 Falcon tubes, with each one containing approximately 45 mL of start-up culture in LB. The tubes are centrifuged for 15 minutes at 5,000g at 4 degrees Celsius. The liquid is decanted and the cell pellet is weighed. The cell pellet is then suspended in 1X lysis buffer in a 1 to 3 weight (g) to volume (mL) ratio. The tubes are stored at -80 degrees Celsius.
Preparation of 1X Lysis Buffer
-5 mL of 8X Lysis Buffer
-35 mL of DI H2O
NOTE: An error occurred when weighing the cell pellets. The weight of the Falcon tube was not cancelled out. Thus the weights of the cell pellets are highly inflated, resulting in much more lysis buffer added than necessary. The cell pellets are much more diluted. However, this is not a huge issue as the quantities of reagents used in the next steps of lysis can be adjusted accordingly."

After that, we detected RNA’s concentration by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. At last we chose the best one in three samples. We conserved the sample for reverse transcription tomorrow.
Monday 31/8
We extracted the RNA from cells which were used different concentration of virus to transfect the cell to silence gene. The concentration gradients of virus were 4μl, 8μl, 12μl, 16μl, 20μl and control. And then we ran the gel electrophoresis. The plastic figure was less than satisfactory.
Tuesday 1/9
Today we screened the cells which had been stable transfected. And measured the fluorescence.
Wednesday 2/9
We measured the concentration of sGC by Elisa today. The result is exciting. The alpha+beta group was significantly higher than the control group.
On the other side, we wanted to find out optimum concentration of cDNA which was added to PCR.
Thursday 3/9
We extracted the RNA from cells which were over expressed bothαsubunit andβsubunit. And we used the RNA to do reversed transcription. And we used those samples to do general PCR method. We ran the gel electrophoresis in the final step. We found that the expression ofαsub unit increased significantly. But, unfortunately, the expression of βsubunit was required to confirm since its control group is not available. To our surprise, the group which was added Nuclease-free water and primers appeared strip. We thought that it must have something wrong in our experiment today and we needed to find out the mistake.
Friday 4/9
We chose the best primers which we designed the day before yesterday. We added different concentration of sample and found the best concentration in the experiment.
Saturday 5/9
Today we redid the experiment on Friday. But we did the real-time PCR this time. We extracted the RNA from cells which were over expressed bothαsubunit andβsubunit. And we used the RNA to do reversed transcription. And we used those samples to do real-time PCR method. And then we ran the gel electrophoresis. The result made us disappointed. The group which added Nuclease-free water and primers appeared strip again.

HKUST-Rice,2015,Team:HKUST-Rice#Expression#ParaBAD_-_-_TEXT.html,"ov et al., 2001; Siegele and Hu, 1997). It refers to the phenomenon that an increase in arabinose concentration does not result in an increase in promoter / gene activity per se, but rather, increases the proportion of population that are fully induced.
In concordance with literatures, we observed an all-or-none induction when BBa_I0500 is placed on a high copy plasmid, where induced cells were mostly distributed among two bins of fluorescence. Yet on low copy plasmid, the induced populations remain homogenous along the arabinose concentration gradient. Since all literatures before have been using high copy plasmids for the study of ParaBAD, we believe the  homogenous expression of ParaBAD promoter from a low copy plasmid has been a long overlooked issue.
Our misuse of BBa_I0500 and its part documentation issue
Lastly, we would like to warn potential users of this part not to drive expression of riboregulators (Isaacs et al., 2004) using BBa_I0500. This ParaBAD promoter promoter contains a 19bp sequence after the transcription start site, which would produce a taRNA with additional nucleotides at its 5’ end, and rendering it incapable to activate crRNA. Relative Promoter Unit measurement (Kelly et al., 2009) for this BioBrick is also inappropriate because the mRNA produced from BBa_I2031 would contain these extra 19nt when compared to that from BBa_I20260 . To avoid misuse of this part due to incognizance of its sequence information, we recommend users to look up BBa_K1067007 for annotations.

In the meantime, we made 2,000 brochures about Employing Synthetic Biology, To Combat Antimicrobial Resistance to showcase how synthetic biology influence and make our life better in its safety way. During the exhibition, the audiences were so enthusiastic that we were frequently asked about synthetic biology and our project.
5.signature wall
In addition, we made a ""signature wall"" to let the public express their supporting for the application of synthetic biology in our daily life. We are surprised that audiences have already signed the whole wall after the first day of the exhibition.
Conclusion
For the first a-week holiday, we totally receive approximately 20,000 people from different places at different ages. According to the number of people (the number in weekday is about 10,000 per day, and in weekends is about 20,000 per day), We predict there can be approximately 400,000 people who can learn something from our exhibition more or less. It is the efforts we pay that gave us a great return, and we are also grateful for the SCAU team helping us design photo models and do video propagandizing. In a conclusion, we can say that we make a great success on outreaching synthetic biology by combined our project.

For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C, covered in aluminium foil with continuous shaking for 3 to 8 hours. After 3 to 8 hours shaking, a reddish colour was observed on the solution that is characteristic for the correct size nanoparticle formation. The solution was observed every 30 minutes to check for red color formation.
Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution of the d-AuNPs. the suspension of d-AuNPs in distilled water (ratio 1:4) and sonicate it for 5 min. Then, after plasma treatment this solution was be transferred to a copper grid for imaging. The correct size of the d-AuNPs be in the order of 10 nm.
We observed d-AuNPs in relatively low concentrations. However, the sizes were as the expected within a range of 7 nm to 11 nm, which is sufficient for the d-AuNP analysis. In the future however, the protocol should be optimized to generate more uniform batches.

Mechanism: FXR based activation: - use eukaryotic transcription factors in bacterial gene expression - suggested use of FXR (known structure and DNA sequence) with constitutive promoter expression - a receptor protein of a number of bile acids, which would bind to ligand-bile acid - can act as a repressor or an activator, we would use it as an activator, binding to a promoter region B4-BARE (2.4 kb) taken from a gene UGT2B4, (known primers for promoter region) - specified exact FXR binding site, therefore possibility of integrating FXR binding site into another regulatory region - upon binding to bile acid it would activate output gene - In the experiment using FXR as transcription factor in human cells 30mM DCA was used, however presumably lower concentration should be sufficient for triggering of FXR.
Output:
- GFP: fluorescence = light indicator = hard to quantify <>- ligaments: colour = clear indicator = influenced by the red colour of blood cells = cell free mechanism for hospital use = accurate measurement = filter/ membrane mechanism for home use
- protein expressed on surface of bacteria causing aggregation (either of bacteria or of bacteria to a substance in blood)
Modelling:
- Binding of activator to GFP gene is a positive cooperative reaction.
- Once activator molecule is bound to the enzyme, its affinity for other activator molecules increases.
- Hence, Hill equation can be used as a model. Hill function for transcriptional activation: k1: Maximal transcription rate Km: Activation coefficient n: Hill coefficient A: [activator]

They then had the opportunity to look at the specimens under the microscopes and see for themselves how there is an entirely different world living right under our noses... literally! They then had a go at streaking their own agar plates and we explained some examples of basic genetic engineering techniques.
We were pleased to see that by the end of the day, the students could comfortably discuss and debate new ideas on a range of subjects and even begin to design their own synthetic biology projects.
International Outreach
Raising public awareness of synthetic biology in science and society has been an integral part of the Warwick Team’s iGEM experience. We produced several educational YouTube videos, in an easy-to-follow format, which are accessible to all. Check out our YouTube channel to see more.
Recently, one of our engineers travelled to Honduras to work on developing a new water system for an area deprived of clean water. Whilst designing the system, Omar delivered a talk on synthetic biology, and how it could be used to develop new water testing methods, amongst a whole range of other applications which could help their community in the future.
We also delivered live mini online lectures to Engineering students at Monash University, Australia. We spoke about the promising future of the field within industrialized engineering and held short debates on the ethics of SynBio. The aim was to provide the engineers with a different, more biological approach to solving current problems.
“BLUEPRINT 361” App
Synthetic biology has been on the rise in recent years, but it is not receiving as much recognition as it should. Not everyone is aware of the discipline and don't understand the huge benefits we will receive from this research in the future. As a result, and alongside our project, we have developed a 2D gaming app for the public. The purpose of this app is to advertise synthetic biology through gaming and to educate the public the recent progress that has been made in a more interactive way.
In the game, the player has the choice of five different levels which vary in difficulty. Once in the game, the player has a limited time to collect gold coins. If a player has succeeded in collecting all the coins, they will learn an interesting development that has been made in Synthetic Biology.
The game was developed using the Unity game engine. The gaming app is available for PCs and touchscreen devices. The app can be found in Google Play Store and Apple's App Store.

Safety
Our labs are at Risk Level 1, meaning all reagents used in lab are well characterized and known not to cause disease within humans. These labs are equipped with safety showers, eye washes, and fire extinguishers if any emergency were to occur. All members have gone through extensive training to work in these labs, which included a detailed tour of facilities and numerous quizzes over safety standards. No member was allowed to be in lab alone unless under supervision of a graduate student.
Our labs used the following E. coli strains: DH10B, BL21, MG1655, JM109, and WM1788. All strains are Group I organisms, which have been proven not to cause disease in humans. In working with these organisms, we used fume hoods and ensured no contamination occurred through bleaching any area these organisms come into contact with. Gloves were worn at all times while in lab. Group members disposed reagents used in experiments into their respective waste bins for proper disposal.
We wanted to develop nitrogen fixation within E. coli to understand how this biochemical process could be translated to plants. To date, hazardous effects of introducing these genes into E. coli have not been observed.

Plug 'n' Play Assembly Standard and BioBricks
We believe that the restriction-enzyme based assembly methods have too many drawbacks for creating advanced synthetic biology - especially in higher eukaryotes as mammals and fungi. Therefore, we have developed a novel assembly standard called Plug 'n' Play  with DNA based on uracil-specific excision reagent cloning. The Plug 'n' Play assembly standard allows construction and customization of multi-part devices fast and easy.
In combination with our new assembly standard, we introduce a novel approach for the principal of BioBricks. Our vision is that each iGEM team receives a kit containing ready to use PCR products of every single BioBrick. These BioBricks are ready for assembly by just performing a USER enzyme reaction and subsequently a traditional E. coli transformation. Hereby, the cumbersome process with restriction enzymes and ligases is avoided. This further allows time to be spent on creating innovative ideas within synthetic biology, leaving more time for characterization of BioBricks and creating innovative Genetically Engineered Machines.
The Plug 'n' Play  with DNA kit contains pre-produced PCR products and back-up plasmids for each part in the kit. So far the Plug 'n' Play  with DNA kit contains 50 BioBricks and 21 plasmids for mammalian cells and Aspergilli.
How it works
PCR products are first mixed together with USER enzyme. The USER enzyme generates a single nucleotide gap at the location of the uracil in the PCR product thereby generating a 8-9 bp long complementary overhang. These overhangs can anneal each other to form a stable hybridization product. The nicks in the assembled plasmid are repaired by E. coli.
As proof of concept of our assembly standard, we designed a reporter system for Aspergillus nidulans and mammalian cells. The figure shows an example of"

Creative Classroom:
We participated in a lecture of School of Art and Design of Anhui University of Technology, which is a lecture full of art and innovation. Students sat in the classroom in twos and threes and designed and exchanged ideas in the large sheet of white paper. As a result, we were impressed by their creative passion. In the lecture, we introduced ourselves and learned from each other. After that, we briefly introduced our project and the synthetic biology knowledge in order to let them learn more about it. Then we showed the logo of the Maze, which is our theme. Finally we put forward our request of designing a poster according to the maze and our project content. During the process of designing, the team members answered their questions about the content of the project. Finally the students showed us their wonderful works. We listened to their designing ideas, put forward our suggestions, and finally accepted their suggestions and took photos together.
iGEM Questionnaire Survey:
Developed for Some Students in Wuwei Middle School
Before we visited Wuwei Middle School, we intended to know a little bit about their mastery of biology. In order to know the degree of understanding and interest of high school students, we get the following data in the form of questionnaire survey.

A I don’t know anything about it.
B I know a little bit, at least I know what it is.
C I know a lot about what it is.
D I know exactly what it has to do.

The likelihood that a wildtype bacteria would take up both plasmids at once is highly unlikely - and the strains would be unable to survive with only a single plasmid. A system resembling this idea has been previously described in the holin/anti-holin biobrick ( BBa_K515106 / BBa_K515104 ).
Picture by iGEM team from SDU 2012; Depicting a toxin/antitoxin system
A second possibility is to make the bacteria dependant on a substance only available in the lab: an essential gene could be deleted from the chromosome and inserted on our plasmids. This gene would then be put under the regulation of an inducible promoter. For this to be effective, the substance must be exclusive to the lab environment.

AQA_Unesp,2017,Team:AQA Unesp#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"RNA regulation. The input is glucose and the output is the insulin.
In order to be able to test and detect the signak from our sytem, we used the sfGFP(Bs) (BBa_K2270010) as gene reporter, previously inserted into the pSEUDO plasmid [4], which was used in our constructions. So, we designed the sRNA to target the sequence of the sfGFP(Bs) mRNA from the RBS sequence to the start codon to ensure its specificity to the target and an efficient hybridization.
To design the sRNA, we used the software RiboMaker, which gave us the sequence, hybridization energy values and the possible secondary structure of the sRNA. Analyzing the data, we selected the best two results and then performed a new analysis using the software NUPACK. By this new analysis we were able to choose the best sRNA and build our final construction. To learn more, see our modeling section.
Our final construction ( BBa_K2270008 ) was then composed by:
the gal operon promoter from L. lactis, which contains the cre site and has already been well studied [3];
the designed sRNA;
the terminator from Escherichia coli rrnb and Bacillus subtilis rrnb;
Figure 3 summarizes our construction and its mechanism of action.
Figure 3. Our glucose-responsive control system. (A) When glucose is present the carbon catabolite repression system will repress the sRNA expression, leaving the GFP mRNA free to be translated into protein. (B) When glucose is absent, there will be no carbon catabolite repression and the sRNA will be expressed. The sRNA then will hybridizes to the GFP mRNA and block its translation.

The holdase effect of GroES is unknown, but a potential holdase effect has been implemented in the model. When testing the model we have seen that the more the protein is prone to aggregation and difficult to fold the greater the ability GroES has to possibly have a positive effect. If the protein is easy to fold and is not an aggregation prone protein, the model shows that GroES does not have any positive effect and does not help the protein to fold but rather hinders it. In summary, the model suggests that GroES would have the ability to interact with proteins that are prone to misfold. This is also a suggestion in our laboratory experiments and results, see Project → Demonstrate

Characterising the Biobrick
With our biobrick made, we then needed to establish whether it worked, and over what range. We began by checking simply whether it responded to nitrate at all. Then, having determined that it did, conducted a more detailed assay across the range of nitrate levels for which the biobrick is most sensitive.
Having established the biobrick was definitely switched on by 20mM of KNO3, we wanted to conduct a broader test of its behaviour across a range of different nitrate levels
Does it work? Yes!
To begin with we simply wanted to determine whether the biobrick worked as expected - producing GFP in the presence of  nitrates, but not without.
Two 5mL overnights were set up, one without any nitrogen and one with 20mM of Potassium Nitrate KNO3, made up according to the table below. This level was chosen as previous work by the Edinburgh 2009 iGEM team had shown the promoter strongly active by this point.

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#modelorganism_-_-_TEXT.html," Xenopus tropicalis’ genome was fully sequenced [7] and the frog is entering the realm of postgenomic model organisms. This frog is slowly replacing its counterpart Xenopus laevis presenting interesting features for various kinds of research. Xenopus laevis was widely used as a model organism in developmental biology, cell biology, toxicology and neurology since the 1950s, being a particularly attractive model because of its easy handling, and the size of its embryo, visible by naked eye. Without being a mammal, this vertebrate is evolutionary close enough with human to give us expandable results [8]. However, Xenopus laevis is a tetraploid and has a quite slow rate of reproduction, reaching its sexual maturity around one or two years, whereas Xenopus tropicalis is a diploid reproducing twice as fast [9] which makes it a more practical model, especially for genetics and for an iGEM project.  Though the size of the egg is a bit smaller (< 1mm), it still is visible by naked eye and quite easy to microinject.
Xenopus as a chassis?
Thus Xenopus tropicalis clearly fits the characteristics defining a good model organism. A large amount of data exists on it as its genome has been sequenced, a large variety of studies are already done on Xenopus tropicalis and it is known to be easy to manipulate (characteristics b), c) and d)). If we keep an eye on Burian’s criteria, being a chassis is a specific mode of the first one: being useful to realize a specific objective of research. As a chassis is a specific kind of a model organism, directed toward a specific use, we have to investigate more closely what it is expected from a chassis to get the interest of bringing Xenopus in the realm of engineering. Xenopus is not only interesting for fundamental research, indeed it is an important vertebrate for medical and environmental purposes, like gene therapy [10], drug discovery and environmental risk assessment (it is used this way by the Watchfrog company).
Synthetic biology introduced the term “chassis” as a new way to refer to an organism. The metaphor is quite suggestive, in French the term appeared in the end of XVIIth century in joinery and is today more specifically known when talking about cars: the chassis is the rigid structure on which the various elements constituting the vehicle are fixed. This definition of a chassis can be kept and slightly developed when talking about living things: in synthetic biology, the term chassis primarily concerned bacteria, and specifically Escherichia coli. A chassis is meant to"

Kingsford Scoring System
In 2007, Carleton L Kingsford et al. [1] described TransTermHP, a new computational method to rapidly and accurately detect Rho-independent transcription terminators.
They put forward an algorithm to predict Rho-independent terminators.
The first 15 bases of the potential tail sequence are scored using a function:
(1)
where
(2)
for n=1...15 and  =1.
The energy of potential hairpin configurations adjacent to a reference position can be found efficiently with a dynamic programming algorithm. The table entry hairpin_score[i,j] gives the cost of the best hairpin structure for which the base of the 5' stem is at nucleotide position i and the base of the 3' stem is at position j. The entry hairpin_score[i,j] can be computed recursively as follows:
(3)
The function energy(i,j) gives the cost of pairing the nucleotide at i with that at j, and loop_pen(n) gives the cost of a hairpin loop of length n. The hairpin's loop is forced to have a length between 3 and 13 nt, inclusive, by setting loop_pen(n) to a large constant for any n outside that range. The constant 'gap' gives the cost of not pairing a base with some base on the opposite stem and thus introducing a gap on one side of the hairpin stem.

SUSTC-Shenzhen-A,2013,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," when the concentration of Zeocin is not too high, the cells can grow well. It shows us that the Zeocin does harm to cells but the parts we design can resistant the effect of the Zeocin so that cells can grow well. We can use this part and the external Zeocin to tune the cell growth rate. It is fun and meaningful.
We then generated another biobricks by conbining the Zeo-R and GFPuv into an pSB1C3 backbone without promoter so that other people could use it.
Modeling
What we have done are the plasmid construction and the early experiments, due to the time constrains. We would use mathematic modeling to help understand the system and design new experiments.
Here is the minimal model capture the essence of the biological processes (for completed one please see Modeling section of our wiki).
The relationship between the two cells is that the expression of AHLs will greatly help the other cell but harm itself. The function forms are consistent with our experimental data and related projects published previously.
Starting with this model, we can easily find out the relationship between each part of our system. We explored the parameter space, and found that the results are not very sensitive to parameters.  In summary, it not just tells us the results of the three conditions of the classical prisoner’s dilemma, which we are eager for, but also bring us some surprise.
Firstly we see the effect of a large expression of AHL in both cells by place a constitutive promoter with highly efficient in front of LuxI/LasI gene, which corresponds to the case both prisoners cooperate with each other. We get a quickly increasing growth curve.
Then we replace one promoter with a low efficient one to reduce the expression of one AHL. In this way we see the second case of the dilemma that one man choose to defect, as you can see, the curve representing the cooperator concentration go down while the traitors raise up. In addition, we come across some surprise of the behavior and we elaborate it in detail in the modeling section, and use it to develop new biosafety idea
To achieve the last case where both men try to defect each other. We turn off both promoters. As was expected, the curves go down quickly, as no cell can survive.
Though having successfully simulating the prisoner’s dilemma, we have to say that we just play the little trick on the promoters. What if we could modulate other part of circuit?
We want to find if we can find  more complex situation, for instance how we could create a repeated dilemma between our two prisoners? We are lucky"

Preparation of glutathione sepharose beads. You may add 1X protease inhibitor to all used PBS.
Gently shake the bottle of sepharose to resuspend the matrix.
Use a pipet to remove sufficient slurry for use and transfer to an 15 ml falcon tube. (Dispense 1.33 ml of original sepharose slurry per ml of final volume required.)
Sendiment the matrix by centrifugation at 500xg for 5 min. Carefully decant the supernatant.
Wash the sepharose by adding 10 ml of cold 1xPBS per 1.33 ml of the original slurry of glutathione sepharose dispensed. Invert to mix. (Sepharose must be thoroughly washed with PBS to remove the 20% ethanol storage solution. Residual ethanol may interfere with subsequent procedures).
Sediment the matrix by centrifugation at 500xg for 5 minutes. Decant the supernatant.
For each 1.33 ml of the original slurry, add 1 ml of 1xPBS. This produces a 50% slurry. Mix well prior to the subsequent pipetting steps. (Sepharose 4B equilibrated with PBS may be stored at 4°C for up to a month.

In other conditions, this trend was not so significant,  which inferred that the condition for our sweet pressure part to work must be  finely tuned. What is more, we have proved that tryptophan addition greatly  inhibited growth of cells. Therefore,  the trend of better growth induced by tryptophan addition was very strong proof  for the successful construction and function of our sweet pressure part,  although it only worked in this particular condition.

Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Notebook#Biohack_-_-_TEXT.html," The digested UV+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 with KpnI and XhoI (input and output backbones) were run on a gel. They were then cut out and purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit following the ""QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Protocol"" protocol. However, we didn't have PB, so W9 from the Invitrogen kit was used instead. Each sample was split into two because the agarose gel pieces were too large for one. So, each of the four was eluted using 30uL EB buffer, for a total volume of each backbone a little less than 60uL. They were nanodropped, and the results were: Input backbone: 11.5ng/uL and Output backbone: 9.3ng/uL. Although these were MUCH lower than expected, we're just happy there's anything there.  The inoculated HSP+pACYC184 colonies 1&3 were mini prepped as was done yesterday. They were each poured into 50mL conical tubes, spun down at 3900 for 15 minutes, discarded the supernatant, resuspended the pellet in 25mL PBS, split into four 25mL conical tubes with approximately 5mL in each. Then the protocol ""Plasmid DNA Purification Using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and a Microcentrifuge"" was followed for all of them. Each set of four epindorfs were combined when the elution was complete. They were each eluted with 50uL for a total volume of each around 200uL. They were nanodropped and the results were: HSP+pACYC184 colony #1: 109.3ng/uL and HSP+pACYC184 colony #3: 95.9ng/uL.  We received our pBad and Vio operon primers that were designed to use for colony PCR and that add KpnI and XhoI sites to the BioBrick parts. Nolana made 1 in 10 dilutions of all four (forward and reverse for each).   The PCR machine was run on setting #130 (""PCR settings 6/20/14"") for the pBad primers. We couldn't run it with Vio Operon also, because Vio Operon is around 7Kb so it needs a longer extension time. The PCR was set up by poking one colony on the plate: 2014P3:W19O (pBad),"
Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," or predicted by advanced software to have slow insertion time (slow insertion time-G5).
Next, we chose a gene to optimize, and came up with superfolder GFP, a well studied reporter gene that was described by the 2008 Cambridge iGEM team (part BBa_I746916) . We optimized the gene using our five criteria, then assembled plasmids containing all the necessary parts for the gene to be expressed. The ""fast"" optimized GFP has been submitted as a part to the registry, as it is the only variant that we have finished characterizing (part BBa_K1506002) .
In order to find out more about the translational efficiency of our GFPs, we designed a degenerate ribosome binding site (dRBS) to be inserted in our construct before all five variants. By measuring the expression plateaus at high translation initiation rates (TIR), we will be able to see how efficiently our GFPs are translated. Raising or elimenating plateaus at high TIR will be a marker of how effectively we optimized the gene.
Our final design looked like this:
Includes a promoter, RBS, leader sequence, variant gene, and terminator
Our Results
Unfortunately, we were unable to progress beyond the cloning phase with G4, and beyond the insertion of dRBS with G1 and G5. Of the two variants that we characterized, only the results for G2 have been sequence verified and analyzed at this point.
Shows the adjusted average fluorescence of the cells that we measured graphed with the strength of the ribosome binding site in that strain.
The results show only vague indication that expression of GFP was increased as TIR increased. Unfortunately, only 14 strains were successfully characterized and sequenced. Characterization of the other GFPs will allow us to determine the success of our optimization.
Future Plans
First, the cloning will be completed. Once all five variants are present in the backbone with the degenerate ribosome binding site inserted, fluorescence data will be collected. Once each measured colony is sequenced, the fluorescence will be graphed alongside the predicted strength of the ribosome binding site. This will give us a good idea of the translational efficiency of each GFP. By comparing fluorescence data for a single ribosome binding site across multiple GFPs, we will be able to determine the effects of our optimization criteria.

We believe that the weird point in the 10h mark of the control curve might be result of experimental error, even tough we can't pinpoint exactly where the error might have occurred.
Oleic acid and tocopherol growth. Relative cell density x time(h) Source: Personal archive.
So now, to our last sample wave, we have the 0.128M of oleic acid ones. We had a little problem with sample handling and unfortunately lost a 1|8 sample in the process. Instead of re-doing the whole experiment, we decided it wouldn't have much value, since it would certainly have its curve somewhere near the control and 1|40 curves. We also did not make any 1|1 samples, since this quantity of substrate would exceed our 5% limit for ethanol concentration in these samples. Besides these absences we can once again see the 1|2 sample towering the other curves and we can also suppose that a 1|1 would have this behaviour too.
These results give us total confidence to affirm that tocopherol present in a rich fatty medium have a pretty relevant role in protecting the cell and stimulate cell growth very effectively proving our initial idea of synthethizing tocopherol to protect the cells.

On top of the problems of local acceptance, Golden Rice faced many many ""regulatory hurdles"" . Despite securing intellectual property rights in 2000, the Golden Rice website states that the project will only get final regulatory approval sometime in 2012.  One of these requirements is to have a 'regulatory clean event,' which means that the inserted DNA must have been inserted 'cleanly' as defined by regulatory bodies.  Examples of 'unclean' events are when the DNA inserts itself multiple times in the host genome, when the arrangement of multiple genes is different from the original plan, or when residual or 'ballast' DNA integrates with the desired genes. To find clean lines, one must screen 100's of colonies. Utilizing a private partnership, the first viable regulatory clean event in Indian rice varieties was procured in 2003.
The striking color of golden rice resulted in a mixed reception. Source
Although the original intention was to conduct the first agricultural trial in a developing country, it was conducted at Louisiana State University in 2004.  The reason was that no suitable regulatory bodies for new GM crops are in place in developing nations.  The US have such bodies in place so the first agri trials were conducted there in accordance with their requirements.
Taken from a ""Nature Opinion paper"" written by the Head of the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board, the remaining hurdles to pass are essentially repeats of what was gone through before.  They are now creating new varieties for different farming situations and will need regulatory clean events for each new strain.
Differences
Our team feels that our VitaYeast is different in many ways that may be crucial to a well-received response from the general public. A tiny fraction of the bread recipe is yeast.  A VitaBread will likely be the same color as normal bread that one may buy in the supermarket. Theoretically, one could have largely organic bread, where the only GM portion is our VitaYeast. That little portion will provide the necessary biofortification.
As per government policy, US supermarket varieties of white bread do employ fortification, but not biofortification.  This means that the necessary micronutrients such as folic acid are added to the bread mix directly.  The advantage we see in biofortification of organisms is the ability for developing nations to adopt the organism for little extra cost.

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", we therefore decided to concentrate on developing a vaccine that could be orally administered. Our strain as previously mentioned has the hylA gene integrated in it, the LLO protein is highly immunogenic and has been previously described as being capable of being an adjuvant (Sun R et Liu Y. 2013). This therefore improves the ability of our vaccine to elicit an immune-response and avoid the issue of tolerance which has been associated with some oral vaccines.
An oral vaccine is desirable from a clinical point of view as it does not require a skilled professional to administer the vaccine. This will reduce the economic cost of employing the vaccine on a large scale. The doctor also emphasised that distribution of the vaccine would be an important consideration, he spoke about the instability of certain medical products in the Honduran summer when temperatures can reach as high as forty degrees celsius. Following this recommendation, we investigated the possibility of freeze-drying our vaccine. Once freeze-dried, the requirement for a cold chain is mitigated and the stability at these higher temperatures is increased. Dr Alvaro Acosta also emphasised the need for the vaccine to be stable at high temperatures and the desirability for low cost distribution.
The doctor also highlighted that current therapies are inadequate due to poor patient compliance. Many patients were reported to stop visiting the hospital for the pentavalent antimony IM injections in the middle of the treatment because of the pain associated with the injection. One way in which they are trying to tackle this problem is through patient education, however this has only shown limited efficacy so far. When treatment is stopped, the parasite has a chance to recover as it wasn’t fully eliminated from the host and therefore can continue to spread. As previously highlighted Cristian Vallediares also focused on this and spoke about how many people stop taking the treatment. Several stakeholders have highlighted the importance of ensuring that any new medicines or vaccines must ensure patient compliance. Our L.lactis vaccine has the capabilities to be given in a capsule formulation which is easy to use and appealing for the patients.
One key issue which we identified in our discussions with stakeholders was that education is a factor in the spread of the disease. Our team tried to think of ways to tackle this problem. Having spoke to both officials in our university in Ireland and the National University of Honduras, we decided to organise the collection and donation of old, unwanted or unused equipment and consumables from our university. We organised transportation of the equipment with Fyffes.

iGEM Cas9, 5080 bp
pSB1K3, 2204 bp
pSB6A1, 4022 bp
pSB4K5, 3419 bp
pSB1K3 certainly did not have the correct length, and the other two backbones were unclear, as they should have a different size but they did not. The digested iGEM Cas9 looked fine.
iGEM Cas9, pSB1K3 and pSB4K5 were cut from the gel and purified (Machery-Nagel nucleospin kit). Samples were kept in the freezer.
After a few days, I tried ligating iGEM Cas9 in pSB6A1 and pSB4K5 according to the standard protocol, transformed 2 µL into heat-shock competent cells (the ones mentioned above).
The ligation of Cas9 in pSB4K5 gave 7 colonies, but Colony PCR (primers: VF2 and VR) revealed there was no insert (expected band: 5080).
Another approach was was PCR amplifying Cas9 and backbones with VF2 and VR primers. Only the pSB1K3 backbone and iGEM Cas9 (5380 bp) gave a convincing band, so these PCR products were purified (hyperlink), digested with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF, ligated and transformed into electrocompetent cells (made by Linea).

pdCas9 was verified using digestion with SacI-HF & SalI-HF, as well as digestion with SacI-HF and XbaI.

Pasteur_Paris,2016,Team:Pasteur Paris#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," our fusion protein is able to bind to cellulose and to catalyze biosilification.
Prediction of the influence of silification on the mechanical properties of the patch
Using the modeling approach described in the Protocols section ( Patch mechanical properties modeling ), we assumed that silica could increase by 48% the Young’s modulus and by 75% the shear modulus of the patch. Thus, our patch would be as rigid as plastics after silification. However, we have to be cautious about our model since we assumed that our protein is linear, which is not the case. Moreover, the rule of mixtures can be applied only when the two materials have the same Poisson’s ratio, but we do not have any evidence of this for C2 and silified C2. Additionnaly, we assumed that all integrated proteins are silified, but we only observed 84% yield, thus generating two states in the system.
Assembly of the composite patch
Composite patches were obtained with a mix of cellulose and silica gel, either by mechanical mixing or produced in the one pot experiment. The resulting composite patches are easier to handle than those with cellulose alone or a mix of cellulose and water. The former resist to manipulation whereas the latter break when they are manipulated.
At the time of this writing, we  have sent the patches to the iGEM TU Delft 2016 team to be characterized, by electron microscopy.
Immunodetection
Our patch aims at detecting mosquito-borne pathogen antigens. Since the composite patch-protein was not completely assembled, we characterized the efficiency of our detection method by using commercial membranes of PVDF or nitrocellulose. The detection method we designed was based on the conjugation of antigens with the Horse radish peroxydase enzyme HRP, and the capture of these conjugated antigens by specific antibodies.  We revealed the interactions by incubating membranes with the HRP’s substrate. First, we tested whether our detection method was working by using single purified viral protein of yellow fever virus (YFVp). By incubating coated membranes with conjugated HRP-BSA, single EZ, or non conjugated YFVp, we didn’t observe any signal (Fig. 11). However, in presence of conjugated HRP-YFVp, a dark spot appeared (Fig. 11). Thus showing that we were able to detect YFVp by this immunodetection technique.

The β-barrel Assembly Machinery Complex
Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Gram-negative bacteria are synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported across the inner membrane by SecYEG translocon into the periplasm. The survival factor A (SurA) chaperones carry the unfolded membrane proteins across the periplasm to the BAM complex, which is responsible for the insertion and assembly of OMPs into the outer membrane [1].
In E. coli BAM complex consists of a membrane protein BamA and four lipoprotein subunits BamBCDE. These subunits associate with BamA through periplasmic POTRA domains. In vitro reconstitution of the E. coli BAM complex and functional assays showed that all five subunits are required to achieve the maximum activity of BAM [1].
In theory, recruiting the BAM complex in a cell-free system could be extremely beneficial as it could integrate OmpA and lgA protease beta-domain into the membranes of liposomes from the inside without requiring any additional protein complexes. Also, this would make a cell-free system more ubiquitous, because BAM complex does not require any signal sequence for proper protein insertion. In order to ensure quick integration, BamA needs to be consistently present at high yields throughout the expression of OmpA and lgA. For this reason, it is essential to stimulate its expression by an initial addition of mRNA, ensuring rapid expression of BamA. For this reason, with the help of Edinburgh iGEM team (special thanks to Freddie Starkey), a mathematical model for BamA kinetics was created.

We used '505 Sally Green' for the 450 nm and '010 Medium Yellow' for the 480 nm LEDs. The filters are shown on the right.
Software
The software consists of several parts which provide an user interface and manage the connection to the hardware. It is also hosted in the github igemsoftware repository.
GUI (Graphical User Interface)
On the graphical interface, the user can take images and time lapses of the chips inside the device. The software is written in C++. It makes use of the Qt-Library to provide a clear interface and a comfortable way to manage various software aspects such as handling images and establishing network connections. An advantage resulting from the utilization of Qt-Library is the multi-platform support for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Additionally, Qt is available with an Open Source license which can be used for free. The software can be used locally on the Raspberry Pi or remotely from a device in the same network.
The scheme below shows the different components of the software:
Features of the GUI include:
Change settings [1]:
The user can specify the iso-value and the shutter speed of the camera.
Custom settings can be labeled and saved for future reference.
Existing settings can be updated or deleted unless they are default configurations.

How does TNT pollution occur?
Exposure to TNT occurs in many places across the world. The main cause of TNT pollution is through waste created at TNT production sites. A significant level of pollution is also created through military exercises and mining activities. There are hundreds of TNT polluted sites in America alone , with thousands of sites worldwide.
Health risks are posed by old TNT Production/Disposal facilities, owing to a lack of regulation and care taken in the past when working with these compounds; common practice around the world was to allow all “pink water”, heavily contaminated waste water produced during the creation of TNT, to run off into lagoons built into the environment. Current TNT production facilities do not pose a significant threat to health, due to higher safety standards.
The legacy of TNT pollution is widespread:
In Germany, an ammunition factory from WWII produced over 5 million litres of TNT. This resulted in polluted ground water, and there is a risk to health which must be dealt with by the water treatment plant.
Closer to home, England was supplied by 12 munitions factories during WWI and another 16 in WWII, all producing toxic TNT waste. In addition to this during the war years, many bombs containing TNT-based explosives were dropped on the country; in one year alone during WWII, this accounted for approximately 100 tons of TNT.
Unused munitions are difficult to dispose of. This has resulted in dumping sites. At Beaufort’s Dyke, Scotland, over one million tons of used munitions have been dumped into the ocean. Many of these munitions are contaminated with explosives and risk causing exposure to these compounds around the Scottish coastline. There are a further 9 smaller-scale dumping sites in Scotland and another 12 in England.
Current Degredation Methods
Current methods of degradation rely on incineration of waste. However, this is impractical as toxic ash and other dangerous chemicals are produced. This is also very expensive.
Some techniques also rely on the use of naturally occurring bacteria that are capable of degradation in a controlled situation such as a composting or bio-slurry plant to cleanse large areas of soil.
In our project we hope to improve this process by synthesising our own bacteria with more effective degradation abilities – meaning faster degradation, with non-toxic bi-products and the potential for kill switches and fluorescent markers. There is also the added benefit that we can include proteins that will allow the degradation of other explosives"

Potential disadvantages of inhalation medication in CF patients compared to other drug administrations are:
Uncertainty about drug dose at the target site, severely affected lung areas may not be reached, drug delivery depends on inhalation technique and device performance, local side effects (e.g., cough, airway narrowing, hoarseness), variable systemic drug absorption, time-consuming drug administration, need for education and training, limited information on drug interactions in the lung, specific drugs may need specific delivery devices, poor adherence, potential pollution of the environment, potential device contamination and patient infection, need for hygiene control and maintenance of the equipment and limits social functioning4.

In comparison to qualitative assays, quantitative assays are more informative as they provide cell count based on different attractant concentrations and therefore allow identification of the optimal attractant concentration for chemotaxis. Our analyses were based on the high-throughput capillary assay[3]. We wanted to perform data collection using two different cell count methods. One was the traditional CFU (colony forming unit) count, which allows us to normalise the data to a number of cells chemotaxing per mililitre.
The other method was based on modern flow cytometry using BD FACScan, which allows us to refer to number of cells per capillary. We tried to use both methods, however due to the high sensitivity of the flow cytometer and the small size of E. coli cells, it was difficult to identify the cells among the particles of the same size which occured in the flow count. Due to this fact we used CFU count for quantification. The assay itself is based on a number of capillary tubes filled with different concentrations of attractant placed into bacterial suspension for a period of 60 minutes. During this period, bacteria containing the PA2652 construct ( BBa_K515102 ) are expected to swim up the capillary and the cell count can be measured. When performing the capillary assay, the capillaries with different attractant concentrations were exposed to bacterial suspensions containing 6x108 cells/mL.

Figure 11: Dependence of bacterial chemotaxis to varied malate concetrations. Cells containing PA2652 ( BBa_K515102 ) have shown inreased number of cells in capillaries with inreasing malate concentration, with a peak at 1 mM. The number of cells drops sharply after 1 mM due to saturation. Negative control were cells without contruct. The cell count for negative control in each of the capillaries with increasing attractant concentration has not increased. Data collected by Imperial iGEM 2011.
