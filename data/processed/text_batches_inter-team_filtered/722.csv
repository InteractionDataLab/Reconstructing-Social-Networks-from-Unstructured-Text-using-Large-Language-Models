Therefore, during the event, students had access to Arduino programming with Hack.Atomic, and then they were instructed by Free Hardware representatives to build lab equipment with cheap and affordable parts. Among the equipment, we can mention: greenhouse, shaker, a sensor of luminosity and water bath.
The Children’s Yogurt Day
According to World Health Organization , osteoporosis affects approximately Ten millions of Brazilians, mainly related with calcium deficiency and ageing, and so the CBSIN made The Children’s Yogurt Day. Yogurt is originated from the milk fermentation and is known by its properties: Yogurt is rich in vitamins, minerals (main calcium), proteins, helps to lose weight, natural probiotic and can be easily used in a large range of culinary.
Everybody know that children have a big persuasive power, that is why CBSIN went to UNIFATEA (Centro Universitário Teresa D'Ávila) in order to teach children from different ages how to make a delicious homemade yogurt in a simple way, broadening some concepts of biology and talking about the importance of bacterias and microorganisms in our lives.
Through this project we were aiming to propose a food education, instigate that children convince their parents to have healthier habits, we tried to instigate their curiosity and introduced them the concept of Synthetic Biology.
Partnership with AIESEC
""AIESEC is a global platform for young people to explore and develop their leadership potential. They are a non-political, independent, not-for-profit organization run by students and recent graduates of institutions of higher education. Its members are interested in world issues, leadership, and management. AIESEC does not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national/social origin.'' AIESEC Official Website.
Aknowledging that AIESEC has similar values, mission and purpose, we decided to make a partnership with them. CBSIN requested AIESEC to give us the opportunity to participate in a class of children they teach, in order to introduce them some scientific experiments. AIESEC has a recognized work with low-income family, so most parts of those kids are poor, thus they have to overcome a lot obstacles in order to get access to school, education and others basic social rights.
During the winter holidays, we dedicated some days to teach and demonstrate some concepts of chemistry and biology. The kids had experienced how to make a sodium bicarbonate and vinegar volcano,"

The change from the lysogenic to the lytic cycle may be triggered by an external stimulus such as temperature or UV light, but some phages experience only the lytic cycle without the lysogenic. In the lytic stage, phages hijack the host’s cell     machinery and resources and replicate themselves rapidly until they reach a critical population size – prompting the lysis of the host bacterium (Wittebole et al., 2014).
Figure 2: The structure of a T4 bacteriophage. Figure from Miller et al., 2003.
Bacteriophages & Phage Therapy
Lytic bacteriophages have been used as a treatment against bacterial infections since the early 20th century, but they fell out of fashion by the 1940s when antibiotics were invented and the comparable efficacy of phages was called into question (Sulakvelidze     et al., 2001). So-called “phage therapy” involves the in vivo use of phages to kill pathogenic bacteria. Phage therapy is advantageous over broad spectrum antibiotics in several ways. Its specificity for particular bacteria reduces     the negative impact of treatment on the patient microbiome (Drulis-Kawa et al., 2012), and studies have shown that resistance to phages is less likely to develop than antibiotic resistance (Nobrega et al., 2015).
However, there are also a number of difficulties with phage therapy. Current legislation is not set up to deal with administration of phages to patients – it is based upon antibiotics with detailed structures and known activities but many phages     are poorly characterised and their behaviour hard to predict (Cooper, Mirzaei and Nilsson, 2016). The in vivo nature of phage therapy comes with the risk of the patient recognising the phages as foreign and removing them before they can kill the pathogen (Wittebole et al., 2014), or the triggering of an aggressive     immune response which can harm the patient (Pires et al., 2016). To overcome these problems, an ex vivo approach should be considered.
Bacteriophages & CRISPR

Why microfluidics?
Microfluidics is a powerful technology that can integrate a number of functions in a tiny plate, which is well matched with the size of C.elegans. Scientists have successfully achieved high-through imaging and screening of worm populations with this technology [13] Inspired by this, we design two microfluidic chips to study the development of learning behaviors of C.elegans by observing their phisical responses at the population level and measuring the signal of individual neuron after optical stimulations.
Despite the fact that worms are confined in chips and pushed by the fluid, the channels are specially designed to effectively simulate their normal movements. PDMS, the material of the chips, is transparent and has no influence on the quantification of light signals in optogenetics experiment. Gas molecules, diacetyl and 2-nonanone, can diffuse in PDMS so that worms can sense the odor of such molecule. As a result, we can observe their preference to these odors.
About light
Our optical design of protein and devices
In our design, we use a group of optogenetic proteins and optical devices. Channelrhodopsins protein CoChR and Chrimson are coupled with dual-Color fluorescence protein GEM-GECO and expressed in the pair of neurons AWA and AWB. This combination is used to lower the cross-talk and to get clearer image during experiments. Excited by blue light and red light separately, CoChR or Chrimson can induce the change of calcium ion concentrations inside the nerve cells. Then it can cause the blue-shift of fluorescences of GEM-GECO. To enhance preciseness, we modified the projector and design our own software of microscope. New filters are installed in the device so that we can simultaneously control the intensity and period of light when stimulating the individual C. elegans during manipulation.
Why is the platform important?
Along with the development of neuroscience, more and more techniques have been used to study the behavior psychology. However, the original platform of the behavior psychology research, Skinner box, is not suitable for modern researches because its “black-box” model cannot reveal the changes in the organisms during the process of their learning new ability. Meanwhile, the former research of learning ability based on C.elegans were more focused on chemical signals. These can demonstrate the existence of the learning behaviors but seems untenable, since the residues of the stimuli are hard to erase. Thus, if we aim to study the learning ability associated with neuroscience and behavior psychology, we need to develop a new platform which allowss us to explore the internal mechanism."

Further adjustment of the parameters and the resulting updated “Reconstructed Images” will be shown for comparison.
Achievements
After taking pictures using our hardware setup, we ran HoloPyGuy software to reconstruct the sample object images. We tested three different sample objects: microscope resolution slide, bubbles, and blood cells respectively.
Figure 1. From left to right: average background image, recorded hologram with microscope resolution slide, moving through reconstructed stack images
According to the above figure, HoloPyGuy first takes the average of the import background images, subtracts the average background from the recorded hologram to remove noise, and then computes the reconstructed images. We can see from the reconstruction of the microscope resolution slide, that our hardware setup and HoloPyGuy software solution can resolve up to 2 micrometer resolution. However we also observe some dust within the resolution slide, which can't be cleaned and results in excessive inteference patterns in the reconstructed images. The excessive interference is also observed in the following figure, where the sample object is a bubble.
Figure 2. From left to right: average background image, recorded hologram with a bubble, moving through reconstructed stack images
In the following figure the sample object are blood cells, however there're too many cells in the field of view, resulting in quite noisy interference patterns in the reconstruction.
Figure 3. From left to right: average image, recorded hologram with blood cells, moving through reconstructed stack images
Multiple objects in the field of view and excessive interference patterns partly destroy the 3D information. Thus with out current hardware setup and alignment, 3D imaging using Fiji is not yet feasible. However, we have successfully tested the sample images from HoloPy documentation in the point source set up. The resampling is set to 1, and threshold set to 74 to remove remaining background noise. The resulting 3D object is shown below:

To mimic the expression of  RelB, a reporter system composed of the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter and GFP was assembled. Hereby, the appropriate concentration of IPTG required to induce the promoter on a low copy vector, was identified. During the cloning, it was discovered that the site between the LacI-regulated, lambda hybrid promoter and this particular construct under the tested conditions had formed a hotspot for transposons. In the light of this finding, another inducible promoter was chosen. The HKUST-Rice iGEM 2015 team demonstrated that induction of the AraC-regulated promoter, pBAD, caused a gradual increase in gene expression when cloned into the low to medium copy plasmid, pSB3K3, in contrast to an all-or-none behavior when cloned into the high copy vector, pSB1K3. Taking these results into consideration, the pBAD promoter was used in combination with the pSB3K3 vector to regulate the expression of the antitoxin RelB. Again, a reporter system was used to mimic the expression of RelB, as the part, BBa_I6058 , containing YFP controlled by pBAD, was assessed on different vectors.
The Final Approach for the Three Components Comprised Three Different Vectors
Based on the modelling the system approaches reviewed in the preceding part, the final design, which is illustrated on Figure 4, was established. Ultimately, the dormancy system was composed of the photocontrol device controlled by the PenI-regulated promoter on a high copy vector, RelB controlled by pBAD, BBa_K2449031 , on a low copy vector  and RelE controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter on either a low copy vector or the chromosome.

RelE under control of the OmpR-regulated promoter on the chromosome or a low copy vector, RelB under the control of the pBAD promoter on a low copy vector, and the photocontrol device controlled by the PenI-regulated promoter on a high copy plasmid.

In Summary the whole device works great but there seems to be a limitation concerning the size of proteindomains that can be presented with the EspP autotransporter. We are curious to see what future iGEM teams will use the EspP Autotransporter in the future.

This page shows all the parts we have made or used in our whole project. Click on the links below to see our constructs on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts in detail. Please visit our characterization page for an overview of our measurements with those parts and our result page for other results.
How our system works:
Data For Our Favorite New Parts:
σx, BBa_K1379004 : gene sequence of competence protein ComX which produces σx factor. σx factor induces promoter containing Com-Box sequence (PcelA and PcomFA).
PcelA promoter, BBa_K1379000 : a σx-inducible promoter (containing Com-Box sequence) which initiates the transcription of competence CelA protein.
PcomFA promoter, BBa_K1379001 : a σx-inducible promoter (containing Com-Box sequence) which initiates the transcription of ComFA protein.
Data for Pre-existing Parts:
Strong promoter, strong RBS combination, BBa_K880005 (Team Michigan iGEM, 2012): combination of strong constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23100 ) and strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) was used as a backbone for a very high level of expression of ComX protein (σx factor).
GFP generator, BBa_E0240 (Antiquity Boston University iGEM, 2004): green fluorescent protein reporter ( BBa_E0040 ) with RBS ( BBa_B0032 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) was used as a reporter for characterization of PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
We Also Built and Characterized the Following Parts:
σx Generator, BBa_K1379006 : comX gene sequence was assembled with constitutive promoter, RBS and double terminator so ComX protein is produced constitutively.

To achieve our lab work, we split up into different teams, each working on different aspects of the experimental procedure. Three teams were then formed :
Team coli: this team was managed by Younes and included Marion. Their goal was to achieve the production and characterization of Cerberus and Sirius in Escherichia coli
Team pastoris: this team was ruled by Angeline and included Gaëlle. Their mission was to reproduce the experiments planned on Escherichia coli in Pichia pastoris
Team biotin: this team was ruled by Amandine and included Jean and Julien. Their objective was to construct and to test our in vivo biotinylation system.
Team callulose: this team was managed by Callum (and so was dubbed Callulose) and got help from Younes. Its mission was to launch and optimize our bacterial cellulose production.
LABBOOK: JUNE
18/06 - 22/06:
For the first week in the lab, we received and amplified our plasmids (pPICz, pETDuet, pET28, pGAP) but also our bacterial strains E. coli BL21 DE3 and Tuner.

Team coli: we started with a PCR on the the gBlock Cerberus-pastoris. In order to clone this gBlock, we prepared the pGAP plasmid by amplifying it in E. coli Stellar cells before a Midiprep. Another aspect was to check the pREAV which will allow the incorporation of a unnatural amino acid in our Cerberus.
Team pastoris: pPIC, pGAP and pETDuet were good but pPIC did not match our expectations so we had to find another solution.
Team callulose: the first productions of cellulose started in culture tubes.

MSU-Michigan,2017,Team:MSU-Michigan#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," increase in current while ΔmtrB prL814 and ΔmtrB produced only .03 mA of current (Figure 1). The knockouts displaying lack of current production shows the importance of the Mtr pathway and concurrently inducing transcription of mtrB on the plasmid that creates current displays this as well. Background expression of mtrB due to the nature of the Lac operon produced current up to .75 mA (Figure 1, 2, 3) before IPTG was added. Induction comparison between when ΔmtrB prL814-mtrB is induced and when it is not induced showed the difference between background expression and IPTG induction (Figure 2, 3). IPTG induction earlier in experiment displays a more clear difference in current production between background expression and induction. Viability of cells and pH impact could play a role in that result but even late in the experiment IPTG induction still produces a current difference.
Fluorescence measurements showed repeatable IPTG induction of the GFP located on prL814. M5 media provided background fluorescence measurements and displayed sterility of the 96 well plate (Figure 4). ΔmtrB served as the negative control and showed the increase in fluorescence due to growth in cells while showing no increase based on IPTG impact (Figure 5). ΔmtrB prL814 and ΔmtrB prL814-mtrB both displayed increased GFP fluorescence with increasing IPTG concentration (Figure 6, 7). ΔmtrB prL814 produced higher fluorescence than ΔmtrB prL814-mtrB due to possible energy diversion towards producing MtrB. Both strains showed the largest increase in fluorescence between 100 μM and 150 μM IPTG and saturation starting at 250 μM (Figure 6, 7). Replicates between M5 media and the three strains show consistency within the strains and sterility within the design of the 96 well plate and plate reader set up.

SCU-China,2016,Team:SCU-China#Rihanna_-_-_TEXT.html," the complete amino acid sequence of this molecule [6]. It has been demonstrated that CecropinXJ could be expressed in eukaryotic expression system such as Pichia pastoris [7] or prokaryotic expression system such as E.coli [8]. What’s more, CecropinXJ exhibited to have various activities such as antibacterial activity against both Gram‑positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as antifungal activity [8]. These characteristics indicate that CecropinXJ is an ideal antimicrobial substance to be used to treat foot diseases caused by microbes.
In recent years, studies concerning the expression of anti­microbial peptides have mainly focused on the use of fusion partners [9]. For example, Thioredoxin, a heat-stable and low molecular weight soluble protein in the prokaryotic cytoplasm, has been shown to display chaperone‑like activity [10]. Fusion proteins of antimicrobial peptides generated in E. coli reduce the toxic effect of antimicrobial peptides to the host cells and protect the small antimicrobial peptides from proteolytic degradation.
Design
Based on the various antimicrobial activities performed by CecropinXJ, we aimed to use hire this peptide as the main antimicrobial substrate in our insole. In order to realize it, CecropinXJ was expressed in our E.coli strain Rihanna, which is the main attacker grow in our insole.
We employed 3 different promotors to construct 3 individual expression plasmids respectively. These promotors are: T7 promotors (inductive), promotor J23105 (constitutive), promotor J23106 (constitutive). Downstream of promotors, the coding sequences are consistent: TrxA tag/6 x His tag/Thrombin site/S-tag/enterokinase site/CecropinXJ CDS. The 5-tag system exists in commercial plasmid pET32a(+), which could be easily constructed through PCR. The final plasmid products are BBa_K1919001, BBa_K1919002 and BBa_K1919003
After plasmids construction, our target proteins are expressed using E.coli BL21(DE3) under appropriate conditions. Protein expression level was determined through SDS-PAGE and Western Blot (Anti-6 x His tag). Finally, the antimicrobial activities are determined through inhibition zone assay. We aimed to test the inhibition level on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus (Foot odor pathogen), Bacillus subtilis (Foot odor pathogen),"

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

The preliminary qualitative assay above shows that there is no significant difference among the samples when inoculated with Arsenic in different concentrations and the controls (no Arsenic). Optimisation of the Arsenic detection into the Sensynova framework is required.
Conclusions and Future Work
The results demonstrate that further characterisation needs to be conducted in order to optimise the Arsenic detector variant in the Sensynova platform. However, due to time constraints, we adapted the IPTG framework modelling results to the preliminary experiments conducted for the framework customised as the Arsenic biosensor. In order for future characterisation of this part, the model should be modified in order to guide in vivo efforts accordingly.

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various"
Paris_Bettencourt,2017,Team:Paris Bettencourt#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," the mechanisms of interactions between them.
Hence, we thought that by using our tools to light activate certain cells within an organism for targeted gene expression, we could observe the effect of the signal at different spatial resolutions. Furthermore, the field of developmental biology is spans all organisms and is studied in depth in a large variety of model organisms. The modularity of our tools allow for them to be implemented in many different organisms.
Going to Space
Colonising and travelling to different planets and maybe one day different solar systems is one of manhoods dream. Medusa also likes to dream big and we believe that applying 3D control in synthetic biology for space is crucial to success. To build materials in space, it would be very useful to use microbial cultures, as they could easily be transported and then grown into specific structures with lights and space resources. They would be produced in bioreactors that would shield them from hostile environments, such as the radiation and  - voila! Space could be built up sustainably using Medusa and we wouldn’t have to transport large building blocks from earth. We shared our ambition with John Cumbers, who was intrigued about our project. He explained in details the different parameters that have to be taken into account if you are thinking of growing microorganism in space.
Fermentation and Bioproduction
Speeding up Microbial production in industry remains one of the main challenges in bio-technological industry. One of the problems influencing this is the lack of control of enzyme diffusion within the cell and having high enough concentration of enzymes. By applying 3D control of enzymes within a cell using Medusa’s RNA organelle, we can create local concentrations of enzymes which could vastly speed up enzymatic pathways of production leading to higher yields and faster production.
Medusa’s light control could also be applied in Industry, where different processes could be installed in a single bioreactor using modular light patterns, this would allow for more efficiency and multi-level processes to be organised into one space.
Studying Co-Cultures
Co-cultures have become one of synthetic biology’s most promising methods for reducing metabolic loads and creating large networks. To best understand interactions between two populations and spatial interactions between them, we propose using Medusa’s optogenetic control to spatially activate expression in certain areas of certain strains to best understand interactions of co-cultures. We talked to the Imperial College 2016 iGEM team about our project and our ambition to study Co-Cultures, they were very interested in our project and they shared precious information concerning their data.

TetR binds to the p(TetR) (Part:BBa_R0040) and inhibits its operation. It regulates the light sensor Cph8 (Part:BBa_K1132015). aTc (anhydrotetracycline) binds to TetR and allows Cph8 production. Both of these two parts construct the red light responsive system, under tetR regulation.

BBa_K1132014: Promoter (OmpR, positive) followed by RFP protein generator
The monomeric RFP is a Red Fluorescent Protein with an excitation peak at 584 nm and an emission peak at 607 nm. The RFP is positively regulated by OmpR-controlled promoter. Phosphorylated OmpR binds to the operator sites and activates transcription of RFP.
This is a test Biobrick for the Red light responsive system (Part:BBa_K1132013 and Part:BBa_K1132015) with the RFP protein as output. EnvZ phosphorylates OmpR to OmpR-P that activate the promoter. It must be used in E.coli deficient in wild-type EnvZ.
On the Registry
BBa_K1132015: Cph8 (Cph1/EnvZ fusion) under TetR repressible promoter
Chimeric Cph1 light receptor/EnvZ protein requires phycocyanobilin (PCB) biosynthetic genes for PCB formation (ho1 and PcyA). The exposure to red light (660nm) inhibits the activity of the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. In the dark, the EnvZ histidine kinase phosphorylates endogenous OmpR, a transcription factor which activates transcription from the OmpC promoter. This part must be used in E.coli deficient in wild-type EnvZ.
The promoter p(TetR) is constitutively on and repressed by TetR (Part:BBa_P0440). TetR binds to the p(TetR) and inhibits its operation. It regulates the light sensor Cph8. Tetracycline or aTc (anhydrotetracycline) binds to TetR and allows Cph8 production.

Moreover, he would come to the lab on public holidays to read a novel so we can work outside of office hours.
How will we remember Ruben:
“Ruben, could you ...[enter an absurd request]..., please?”
“Sure, I think I can make that work.”
Stamatios Damalas
Stamatios is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in the department of Systems and Synthetic Biology. Synthetic biology is not just his job but also his passion. He is supervising the team working on the double dependent plasmid system that avoids horizontal gene transfer. The chances to meet Stamatios in the lab are very high any time between 1 and 11 pm on weekdays and weekends but it is wise to not approach him before he had some coffee.
How will we remember Stamatios:
“Use the SEVA plasmid, it will make it so much easier.”

Helping out another team
Collaboration with SVCE Chennai
One of our team members met Team SVCE Chennai during her vacation in India and came to know that they are participating in iGEM for the first time. Since they were from the same institute where she pursued her bachelors, she went right away to meet them during her vacation. Both our teams agreed to collaborate.
As they were completely new to the iGEM, she explained to them how iGEM actually works and provided some tips on how to organise a student project. After she got back, we were in regular contact through skype meetings and frequent email conversations. They helped us by filling the survey forms for our Policies and Practices work and we also gave suggestions on where to focus for the  same with respect to their project which is engineering mini cells to produce bacteriocin that causes gastrointestinal infections . We also helped them on passing their survey form to the doctors in Sweden to get an expert opinion related to their project.
Collaboration with SDU Denmark
After the Nordic Jamboree we were discussing a sponsor deal with the antibody producer Agrisera who wanted to find out the amount of antibodies used in iGEM. During SDU’s presentation at the Nordic Jamboree we found out that their project were focused on creating an alternative to antibodies using E. coli and we thought that a collaboration could be beneficial to them as well. SDU did an analysis of how many iGEM teams used and are using antibodies. The collected and compiled data of iGEM teams using antibodies was later on shared between Uppsala and SDU."

ENVISIONING mösbi IN SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Since 2009, public awareness of Synthetic Biology has broadly stagnated (Hart Research Associates, 2013 (1)).  Yet in about the same period of time the number of teams in iGEM has increased by 80% (igem.org), DIYbio.org was founded and its discussion forum has “grown to over 3,500 members” (The Biologist, 20143); the world’s first community lab opened (TechHive.com, 20114) and has since been joined by at least 11 others around the world; and worldwide synthetic biology research has flourished (The Wilson Centre, 20135). Something doesn’t quite stack up, and it had us thinking, “Where does this gulf between the poles of growth and general public perception come from? What can we do to open this incredible technology up to a wider audience?”  The Economist (2014)6 suggests one barrier to amateur bio-hacking: “Building a biological device is a lot more complicated than putting together a robot or designing a new circuit board.”
We think that building a biological device could be as simple as a Mendelian cross. This is the whole concept behind mösbi: a modular, open-source biosensing platform that you can custom-build from the comfort of your own home, simply by crossing pre-transformed plant lines that contain the modules you want. A process made simpler still by the physiology of Marchantia polymorpha, with gametophores that grow right up towards you in a far-red-light inducible sexual phase. So, all you’d need for your custom multi-cellular biosensor is a place to grow some small hardy plants, a red light, and a coffee stirrer.
We believe that mösbi could be a game-changer in giving more people a gateway into synthetic biology without the need for expert knowledge"
DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Achievements#Interlab study_-_-_TEXT.html," Orange is the expected values and gray indicates our measured fluorescence signal. The values indicated in the bar chart are mean values of all the measurements taken during a 3-hour period, with 4.88 min intervals. For more details on the measured values and the complete dataset look at the interlab form .
The data was analyzed by fitting a statistical mixed model to the data, using the lmerTest package in R. The different promoters were modeled as a fixed effect, and replicates were modeled as a random effect. The estimated means for each promoter and the standard error of the mean can be seen in the chart below.
Figure 1 The detected fluorescence signal, with standard deviations, from 11 different Anderson promoters, presented as orange brackets. Gray brackets illustrate the expected fluorescence signal, calculated as a value relative to J23100. I20260 is also containing the J23100 promoter, but at another backbone.
In two of the triplicate sets, one outlier was excluded: For the promoter J23100, one replicate did not show significant growth. For promoter J23102 one replicate had negligible fluorescence.
The background-subtracted values were calculated by subtracting the mean of E0240 from the other means. The replicate standard deviation was estimated to be 0.014, meaning that the effect of using multiple replicates contributes a random effect distributed with this standard deviation. The residual standard deviation was estimated to be 0.040, meaning that the random effect of taking multiple measurements on the same sample has this standard deviation.
From the data we conclude that many off the evaluated promoter activities are to some extend in agreement with the expected activity. However it seems that the weak promoters are rather difficult to measure in the BioLector. We consider it an opportunity that the J23118 and J23119 at some point can have been exchange by mistake since these show reverse tendencies. However we believe that we have been careful with marking our tubes and keeping track on our samples.
This interlab study is a contribution to the bigger research collaboration. It will be interesting to see contributions from the other labs and whether these are in agreement with our obtained data.
Single Cell Fluorescence Quantification
To measure the fluorescence associated with individual cells Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was applied on the cultures. We selected 5 promoters with significant difference in activity for measurement.   Histograms of fluorescence values for each construct are shown below. At least 100,000 cells were measured for each construct. Values on the X-axes are log10-values of the fluorescence measurements. For each construct, a threshold was determined to split the measurements"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," constitute a proof of concept
By producing bacteriocins and PHB from different BioBrick devices, we demonstrated a functional Proof of Concept . Furthermore we have a BioBrick device (K2018050) that secretes PHB.
Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab
Through MIC tests of our bacteriocins, we showed their effect towards different human pathogens that are particularly complicated to treat due to the rising resistance problem. These tests suggested the potential of these bacteriocins to be used in therapeutic practice. We have improved the production platform of PHB by introducing a secretion system for PHB in E. coli. Using PHB produced with our construct, we 3D printed an actual product; an implant prototype of the human mandible (jaw). This illustrated that PHB produced in bacteria can be used for real world applications. To read more about this, go to Demonstration & Results and Proof of Concept .
Special prizes
Education and public engagement
During the project, one of our main focuses was to engage ourselves in the community and in discussions with whomever interested in synthetic biology. We held several talks and presentations. The audiences varied from small children at the Research day at the University of Southern Denmark to professors in philosophy. We taught a lot and learned even more ourselves. One of our engagements was being teachers for a day: we educated two biotechnology classes at a local high school an entire day. We taught them about synthetic biology and made a laboratory exercise for them, which we supervised for. It was great fun. We also focused on taking a stand for scientific reproduction , which we did further research about. The biotechnology classes tried to reproduce some of our protocols, which were mostly successful.
Integrated Human practice
We talked to several experts in order to integrate new goals for the future perspective of our project and to expand our knowledge about the different sub elements. Among those are experts in the areas of therapeutic use of biodegradable plastic and experts in the use of antibiotics and bacteriocins as new antimicrobial components. We tried to integrate some of their ideas into our project in order to make our Bacto-Aid more realistic to commercialize. The interviews also reassured us, that we are dealing with a very essential problem. Furthermore, talking to the experts about PHB, we found a great interest regarding PHB as therapeutics, which we were unaware of. This expanded the potential uses of PHB in our project. This lead us to 3D print"

Symposium Wageningen – getting to know our Dutch competition
Once we decided upon our subject and made a start in the lab, in MATLAB and in the manufacturing of the device, we started wondering how the other Dutch teams were coping. We were very curious to see their approach and ideas for the iGEM competition. Perhaps we could exchange valuable experiences in the first stages of the project, especially since this is the first time the Eindhoven University of Technology participated. Also important, we might be able to set up the first collaborations. No sooner said than done, we sent an email to the four other Dutch teams to gauge their interest for a get-together.
The Wageningen-UR team were enthusiastic and offered to organize the symposium at a location in Wageningen, which is a somewhat central location for all Dutch teams. The date for the symposium was the 9th of July. The Wageningen-UR team arranged the location, a lunch and the day ended with a barbeque. The program contained a presentation by all the Dutch teams, but started with a presentation by the Wageningen-UR team 2011. They gave insights and useful tips for this year's competition.  All Dutch teams gave a presentation on the current status of their projects and there was room for worthy discussion. At the end of the day, the barbecue offered a great opportunity to get to know each other; something which wiki pages and email contact could not substitute.  The Wageningen-UR team also arranged recordings of the day, which were streamed live. They are still available online: presentations part 1 , presentations part 2 .

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Adhesion_-_-_TEXT.html," CFY, which specifically binds to and ruptures the outer cell membrane of Y. enterocolitica. [4] The main focus of the adhesion system drastically changed from expressing human like proteins to expressing the bacteriocin fused with the anchor protein.
If the bacteriocin would survive degradation in stomach like environments and later on find Y. enterocolitica, the bacteriocin, while attaching to the membrane, would  fix the probiotic to its target. Even though this connection would be much weaker than a system with collagen, it is safe and still an advantage to the Bactissile.
System Design
The Anchor
Since we want our system to be usable in a probiotic bacteria we looked for an anchor motif that works both in our well characterised prototype bacteria (E. coli) and in a well known probiotic bacteria like Lactobacillus. We also wanted the anchor motif to be usable with a wide range of protein types since this would be a great addition to the iGEM registry, since no construct for cell surface display could be found by us at the start of our project. In the end we found the gene coding for PgsA from Bacillus subtilis that had been used successfully in both E.coli and a Lactobacillus species. To prevent interaction with the fused domain we added a long (20aa) rigid linker [BBa_J176131] to the C-terminal of the anchor.
The fusion
To make the fusion protein of anchor and colicin Fy (PgsA-CFY) we chose to synthesize the genes in RFC25 standard (Freiburg). This adds two additional restriction enzyme sites (NgoMIV and AgeI) to the four standard ones, thus enabling simple assembly of the two proteins so that they are translated as one in the same reading frame.
Back up plan
We used normal assembly (RFC10) with re-ligation of XbaI and SpeI sites that leaves a TACTAG-scar where TAG can stop translation and therefore disable production of a fusion protein. A solution would then be to perform PCR-mutagenesis and remove the TACTAG-scar via point mutation.
Characterising the anchor
To test that the anchor attaches to the membrane, we tried to fuse a reporter, the blue fluorescence protein BFP, to the anchor. We chose to mutagenise B0034-BFP [BBa_K592024] to make it compatible with RFC25. It was designed to get an ATG followed by an NgoMIV site upstream of the BFP C"

TUST_China,2018,Team:TUST China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," visited north the largest antibiotic production base in China------North China pharmaceutical co. LTD, to determine the actual use degree and significance of the project. The incredible contributions from all our stakeholders, makes us feel that, no matter the outcome, our project has been an immensely rewarding experience.
Interviews With Experts
At the very beginning, we interviewed an expert, Prof. ZongZheng Yang, who specializes in sewage addressing and processing. From a more professional standpoint, he provided us with lots of suggestions, which enlightened us on how to carry out our project in a more comprehensive and meaningful way.
A better understanding about Tetracycline detection and degradation.
The following text comes from our interview:
Q:  How do you think about tetracycline abusive in China?
A:  In the early years, there was a shortage of drugs in China. Penicillin was effective for curing diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria and streptomycin was responsible for gram-negative bacteria. Many doctors used penicillin with streptomycin. However, these two types of bacteria was subject to tetracycline. At that time, tetracycline was a heat over the country, they were used in agriculture and animal husbandry without a regulated dosage and a tight supervision. Therefore, a huge amount tetracycline was wasted and the residues remain in soil and water.
Q:  In order to curb antibiotic contamination in the environment, what should we do to achieve this goal?
A: In my perspective, one of the most radical changes is to raise emission standards in our country. Maybe the we can ease the current pollution issue and alleviate the trend of environmental footprints in the future by this way.
Surveys
To make more ordinary engaged in our human practice activities, it is helpful for us to know the common viewpoint about tetracycline, so we made a questionnaire about according to our project .
The data we obtained in the questionnaire are showing below:
The proportion of respondent men and women are roughly same. The number of group aging from 18 to 25 is our target.
Question 3：When you have a fever, will you take any antibiotic drugs by yourself?
Analysis: the data shows that four out of five people will take antibiotic drug, and only one out of five will reject             to have drugs of antibiotics, indicating that there is a high level of acceptance and popularity of antibiotics to a great extent.
Question 5:Do you think you have antibiotics residue in your body or in your child's body?
Question 6: Do you think you have the water you drink? Are there antibiotics in the dishes"

Introduction
In the last lab session the team carried out a successful PCR reaction on the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick and cleaned up the products. The team also midi-prepped cotC-GFP-smtA, kinA, pGFP-rrnB, pMUTIN4 and pSB1AT3 which will prove useful for other team members too. In addition, transformant E. coli cells containing the kinA BioBrick and the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick were grown up in 5ml LB cultures and then frozen down.
However there were also things that we didn't accomplish. We had previously carried out a PCR reaction involving the two elements of our cadmium-sensitive logic AND gate - arsR and cadA. But when the products were cleaned a large amount of ethanol remained in the sample and so when placed into agarose gel the sample dispersed. We then proceded to carry out a second attempt at the same PCR reaction.
In today's practical we hope to ligate pMUTIN4 and the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick together - firstly cutting both fragments with BamHI and HindIII and then ligating the DNA together. We also hope to run the arsR and cadA promoter PCR products on agarose gel (in DNA gel electrophoresis) and if successful, clean up the sample. Then run all of the sample through agarose gel and excise the band produced, also extracting the gel from it afterwards. If all these events happen, we will also"

Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Hi, mein Name ist Corinna Krüger und ich studiere momentan im Masterstudiengang Mikrobiologie und Biochemie an der Universität Göttingen. Meinen Bachelorabschluss habe ich bereits an der Universität Göttingen 2011 in dem Feld Molekular Biologie absolviert. Nach meinem Studium habe ich für eine paar Monate in einem Labor an der Universität Göteborg gearbeitet. Bei iGEM bin ich zum ersten Mal dabei und ich bin sehr froh, ein Mitglied dieses Teams zu sein. Wir sind alle sehr motiviert und bereit viel für das Projekt zu tun. Ich erhoffe mir von iGEM, dass ich lerne selbstständiger zu arbeiten. Ich freue mich auch schon sehr auf den Wettbewerb in Amsterdam. Ich erhoffe mir dort viele andere Teams kennenzulernen und Erfahrungen auszutauschen.

Genau wie alle andern hier bin ich Student des Master of Science Studiengangs Microbiology and Biochemistry an der Universität Göttingen. Meinen Bachelor in molekularer Biotechnologie habe ich nach sechs Semestern im August 2011 an der TU München gemacht. Als ich noch in München studiert habe, hörte ich das erste Mal von iGEM. Einige meiner ehemaligen Kommilitonen waren Teil des damaligen TUM Teams und konnten mit spannenden Geschichten aufwarten. Daraufhin war auch bei mir der Wunsch geboren, einmal bei iGEM mitzumachen. Meine Bachelor Thesis habe ich am Lehrstuhl für Proteomik und Bioanalytik von Prof. Küster (Fakultät für Ernährung, Landnutzung und Umwelt) geschrieben, welche mit viel eigenständiger Arbeit verbunden war. Das alles hat mir sehr viel Spaß gemacht, und das Gleiche wünsche ich mir für unser iGEM Projekt!

They would then configure each output by inputting which control syringes from the control syringe pumps actuate it. Lastly, the user selects the wells for dispensing on the table under Output Destination.
After designing the first iteration of the UI, we received feedback from the Harvard iGEM team and scientists in the lab, in which they highlighted that it was difficult to use. The requested information was unclear and the format of the UI was confusing. In addition, initial users felt that the UI needed a slight “face lift” in terms of aesthetics. During the design process for the next iteration we decided to improve the UI by reducing the amount of information the user enters, adding a UI tutorial video, and additional focus on the UI’s aesthetics.
To do this, we first had to break down exactly what information the UI needed to gather from the user to run TERRA. This was important because it gave us an idea of how to restructure the UI and make it more efficient. We broke down the necessary input information based on key sub-functions TERRA executes to transfer the outputs of the user’s microfluidic chip into the desired locations on their vessel.
Sub-Functions
Dispense Time
Output Selection
Dispense Location
User Input
Fluid Density
Control Syringe Pump Pairs per Output
Vessel in Use (24, 96, 384 well plate)
Flow Rate
# of Output
Well Locations per Output
Microfluidic System (Continuous Flow vs Droplet)
Sample Volume
# of Outputs
Nozzle Tube Length
Vessel Dimensions
Nozzle Tube Outer Diameter
Nozzle Tube Surface Tension
Sample Volume
After aggregating the following information we highlighted user data that can be standardized to offload it from the user. The first and easiest fix was to have TERRA use tubing of known length, material, and outer diameter. In addition, the TERRA Adapter was standardized by characterizing each output in advance. By knowing the total number of outputs for the experiment, TERRA automatically configures the outputs with their respective control syringes. The user simply needs to ensure that the TERRA Adapter is connected properly to their microfluidic chip. Once inputs were offloaded, error-check functionality was incorporated to alert the user if inputted data is unfeasible or incorrect format. With error-check, the input fields are either highlighted red to prompt the user to change their input or to green to confirm that the entered data is in the proper format.

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," efficiency of gene expression and thus increasing the production of recombination protein in heterologous host cell, is expected to be addressed.
Protein folding rate
Protein is an important class of biological macromolecules. It is the main bearer of life activities and occupies a special position in vivo. Each protein has its own unique amino acid composition and sequences. Only when the amino acid chain is folded into the correct three-dimensional structure, will the protein have normal biological functions. Misfolded ones will not only lose its biological function but also even cause diseases such as mad cow disease, Alzheimer's syndrome, etc. The protein folding problem, an important biological question that the central dogma of molecular biology has not solved yet, has been listed as an important topic in twenty-first century. The folding mechanism of the protein is a challenging task, one of which is to determine factor influencing the folding rate. Although the answer can be found in a variety of biological experiments, such as various spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, these methods are time-consuming and costly. With the development of physics, mathematics, especially the progress of computer technology, how to apply a fast and accurate calculation method to predict protein folding rate attracts more and more attention.4
Introduction
Balance with single codon and codon pair
Individual codon usage optimization has been attached importance to, taking Codon optimizer,5 Gene Designer,6 OPTIMIZER7 for example. Subsequently, people found the effect of gene expression optimization cannot be perfect just by single codon optimization. Codon pair, namely the pair of k-th and (k+1)-th codons from the 5’ to 3’ end, is another crucial factor. Due to potential tRNA-tRNA steric interaction within the ribosomes,8 the usage of rare condon pairs, which correlate with translation elongation, decrease protein translation rates.9 Optimization of individual codon has an influence on the corresponding codon pair resulting in maybe-not-the-best codon pair optimization. In the same way, optimizing codon pair merely contributes to maybe-not-the-best single codon optimization. Therefore, it is a challenging way for us to apply a method considering and weighing the effects of single codon and codon pair optimization and thus make the whole best.
Our team focuses on evaluating both optimization of single codon and codon pair and thus selecting the best sequences for expression in heterologous host cell.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"Sounds like a smooth operation.
Michael Masika:
Yes it is. So we start with this one and then we start with the trainings. So next week- lots of trainings, to make sure that we prepare them to make sure that we prepare them for the smooth implementation of the program. So [we] will come back to see that everyone is trained and then we will come to support the training. The drugs have already arrived, they are at the district hospital. And next week they will be distributed in all the facilities, and from the facilities they will be distributed to all areas which are headed by heads of surveillance assistance and then the head of surveillance assistance, with the support of the village volunteers go and administer the drug. And then after we will come back to get reports and then we document and then we close the chapter. The program is over. Then, of course, after two weeks we come back to do and make  what we call coverage survey. This is an independent survey to ascertain and verify the report that came from the head office. So that’s done in the absence, we also do sampling. They go around. I think that’s the program that Salomie is conversant with. With the phone and the app thing. So we will come back to verify. And then six months we will come back with the impact survey to determine whether we still have the problem, or not. So in all the district where we were implementing, as BICO, we were in about nine districts and we did the impact surveys and we discovered that the problem is below 5%, which is the threshold. And perhaps you are asking you how do we sustain this?  Because in Chikwawa, two years ago, we declared that trachoma is no longer a public health concern. Two years later, when we came for surveillance, we found that it has gone up again. So those are some of the challenges. So I think the emphasis for the first few years was on S and A, which is the clinical side of it and the issue of the environment was not taken on board. Unless this time were it is strongly recommended that we need to also do that.
Daniel C.:
How do you do that?
Michael Masika:
There is a program, which is also funded by the trust. But it is a small program. And we are also working closely with other partners, who are already doing WASH.

Interlab Study
Introduction
This being our university’s second participation in the iGEM competition, we’ve now decided to take part in the fourth international InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.
This is optional and voluntary, not directly related to our main project (BactaSun) but nonetheless a significant component of the iGEM Bronze Medal criteria.
One major challenge in the field of engineering biology is to standardize measurements in order to compare and share data from different labs across the world using different protocols, reagents, devices, device settings …
The Interlab study is a project run by  iGEM’s measurement committee to develop a reliable and repeatable measurement procedure for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) which is one of the most used marker in synthetic biology.
Fluorescence data are usually difficult to compare since they are reported in different units or are processed differently according to various research groups. The project’s objective is therefore to improve current measurement tools by converting data into absolute units.

First of all the device needs calibrating before measuring fluorescence. The goal is to determine the optimal settings for the plate reader to detect the optical density at 600nm (OD600 reference point). In order to do so we established a correction factor using LUDOX.
Then we proceed to establish a fluorescein fluorescence standard curve using 4 replicates of fluorescein dilution series. This will allow us to convert cell based readings to an equivalent fluores"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," and biological noise. Additionally, high-throughput production of liposomes might reduce the experimental time substantially.
To achieve this goal, we chose a prokaryotic membrane protein - OmpA (Outer membrane protein A) - it was successfully used as a membrane protein which enables the display of a fused globular protein in prokaryotes1. In our case, we wanted to demonstrate two different proteins: scFv with affinity to vaginolysin2 and camelid nanobody, capable to interact with a GFP molecule3 . These membrane proteins were chosen to mimic targets of current display systems.
In nature, OmpA surface display system flips the selective protein from the inside of the living organism to the outside of its’ surface4. By achieving this in liposomes, the bottom-up approach would allow us to understand the mechanism and relevant components of the flipping process.      For this reason, we decided to model a simple system with few variables to evaluate the activity of the fusion protein containing OmpA and Anti_GFP - it seemed like a good starting point to investigate well characterized parts. This is where molecular dynamics GROMACS package came in handy. GROMACS is a powerful open-sourced tool to build simulations of protein folding and lipids interactions. With a huge help from iGEM team Groningen molecular thermodynamics model with GROMACS was built.
Setup
Sequence of particular fusion protein was built BBa_K2622029 .
Fig. 1 Sequence scheme of Lpp_OmpA and Anti_GFP nanobody fusion protein.
Next, the fusion protein was constructed. The sequences of OmpA and anti-GFP (PDB: 3OGO) were joined exactly where they will be fused according to the DNA sequence using PyMOL (Fig. 2). To start, the structure of OmpA (PDB: 1QJP) had to be reconstructed as parts of it are missing in the crystal structure. This was achieved using the “modeler” software, a python module for homology modeling. The same structure was used as the reference structure and so the filled in structure only serves to complete the molecule.
Then the fusion protein was coarse grained by the martinize script, producing a well calibrated coarse grained bead mapping for the fusion protein in the MARTINI 2 forcefield. The fusion protein was then inserted in a DOPC bilayer constructed by the insane.py script.
GFP was also coarse grained using martinize and inserted in the system containing the fusion protein and the DOPC bilayer, after which the system was solvated"

After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Nickel Affinity Chromatography. 8% SDS PAGE of dxCas9-Tn5 (expected size 214.7kDa). Lane 1 high range molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 whole lysate, lane 3 cell debris, lane 4 clarified lysate, lane 5 flow through, lane 6 wash, lane 7 elution 1, lane 8 elution 2, lane 9 elution 3, lane 10 elution 4, lane 11 elution 5, lane 12 elution 6, lane 13 elution 7, lane 14 elution 8, lane 15 elution 9.
As the figure shows, even with a increasing concentration of Imidazole during elution, the fusion protein breaks down. This can be seen in elution fractions 3-8 (lane 9-14). The conclusion is that another method needs to be thought of to purify the fusion protein.

Our final circuit uses an extremely sensitive photodiode. The diode has a peak sensitivity at 580 nm however it spans across the visible range from 330 nm to 720 nm which overlaps with the corresponding peak emission of luciferase which is at 482 nm1. It provides a range of readings for extremely low light levels. The circuit also contains a JFET Operational Amplifier2 as it is a high performance low-bias-current Operational Amplifier. This means that when it is used along with our high impedance photodiode the error of the input readings is minimized. The final major component of our circuitry is the section of low width bandpass filters. These are able to reduce the 50 Hz ambient noise created by mains electricity in the UK. We developed the idea of suppressing the 50 Hz of ambient noise that was interfering with our results further, by reducing it by a factor of 20 000. To minimize the noise in this way there are three low pass bandwidth filters in the circuit consisting of 100 kΩ resistors and 1 μF capacitors, which provide a time constant delay to the signal of 0.62 s (an improvement from our previous circuit constructs).
Building the L.A.S.S.O.
Since we had our optimized circuitry, we then moved on to building a case to house all of these components. We wanted to make sure that the L.A.S.S.O. was user-friendly and visually appealing. Essentially to make sure that future users, whether medical staff or patients themselves, could use the L.A.S.S.O. without requiring a set of complicated instructions.
When we first started building the L.A.S.S.O. we knew that we wanted our device to be completely blacked out from light. This was a technical aspect based on the sensitivity of the photodiode; it would prevent light from outside the box interfering with bioluminescent samples within the box. Hence, the only light that the photodiode circuitry would be picking up and amplifying would be the luminescence coming from the biological devices.
Other than the requirement to make the L.A.S.S.O. black, we had a lot of freedom in terms of the casing for the device. Knowing that it should be light and compact we decided to go with designing a structure ourselves. This way we could make all the compartments of our device as tiny as we wanted to, based on the dimensions of the circuitry components that we were already using. In order to execute the design, the L.A.S.S.O. was 3-D printed and the design"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Description Alkl_-_-_TEXT.html,", the alkane may make its way to the cytoplasm. The outer membrane alkane channel protein(AlkL) we plan to use is derived comes from Pseudomonas Oleovarans.  However, there is one drawback with AlkL: when overexpressed, it is toxic to the host cell. As such, we will attempt to express it with different strengths of promoters and test the effect of AlkL toxicity on the host’s growth rate before proceeding. For more details, check out our parts or our results.
Figure 1. AlkL representation.
After successfully passing through the bacterial cell wall barrier, alkane can undergo degradation. Originally, it was thought that alkane degradation could only occur in the presence of oxygen. This was soon proven to be false: discovered in a bacterial species known as Desulfatibacillium alkenivorans AK-01 found originally in water contaminated with oil spills, its native alkane degradation can operate in anaerobic conditions. It is also able to metabolize the medium to long chain alkanes. This feature is key to developing the further step of electrogenicity in the MFC part of our project.
Desulfatibacillium alkenivorans AK-01 had its genome sequenced in 2012 and a theoretical model for its alkane degradation pathway involving 4 major enzymes was proposed, which we hope to use in the second part of our project. The pathway is as follows: once the alkane fragment enters the cell cytoplasm, it combines with fumarate under the action of alkylsuccinate synthase (ASS) to form 1-methylalkylsuccinate. Then, CoA Transferase adds a CoA group to it, producing 1-methylalkylsuccinyl-CoA. Afterwards, its C-skeleton is rearranged by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to be converted it to 2-methylalkylmalonyl-CoA. Finally, it is converted to 4-Methyloctadecanoyl-CoA by Carboxyl transferase where a CO2 is removed. Upon reaching this stage of molecular rearrangement, the compound is ready to enter β-oxidation of the cell.
Figure 2. Alkane Metabolism pathway.
Our design incorporates the 4 above steps into Shewanella which is hypothesized to functionally metabolize alkanes. It is hoped that once the alkane can ultimately enter β-oxidation, it will subsequently enter the TCA cycle by the cell’s natural"

Petri dish #1(containing bacteria) and Petri dish #7(did not contain bacteria) each contained 4 copper squares immersed in a solid medium. Before washing, the squares in dish #1 were covered in a dark green film. After washing with water and 70% ethanol, they appeared tarnished and were different shades of brown in different spots. Before washing, the squares in dish #7 were mostly covered light green-blue film. After washing with water and 70% ethanol, they also appeared tarnished and were different shades of brown in different spots.
Measuring the Masses of the Samples in Liquid Media:
For the liquid media, the copper pieces were taken out of their respective flasks with sterile tongs and cleaned with deionized water and 70% ethanol. For the solid media, the copper squares were also cleaned with deionized water and 70% ethanol. They were then dried with a Kimwipe and their masses were obtained with an electronic balance. The copper squares for the liquid media were returned to their original flasks.
July 21
The solid media Petri Dish #2 (w/ bacteria) and Petri Dish #8 (without bacteria) were removed from incubator. The gel in the petri dishes was stained ochre. Petri dish#2 copper pieces were covered by a yellow green-green square layers and surrounded by a brown copper color. Petri dish #8 copper pieces were covered by a blue green layer also surrounded by a copper color. The green layer and gel were washed away with water and 70% ethanol to reveal un-etched copper pieces underneath. The copper pieces were then weighed and the masses were recorded. We then found what the mass decrease was by comparing the masses before the experiment and the masses after the experiment.
July 22
We took measurements of the masses of copper in the liquid media and the two samples of the copper in solid media (see past trials for copper cleaning procedures). When the flasks containing AFM and bacteria were removed from the shaker, they appeared a dark muddy brown. The copper samples in the flasks were completely etched away, leaving trace amounts of copper pieces which we did not mass. The masses of the copper pieces in these flasks were assumed to be 0. The solutions in the AFM flasks not containing bacteria were a cloudy white. The copper samples in one of the Petri dishes, that had the solid media without bacteria, were coated in a uniform blue-green layer which may have been copper that was etched away.

Retirement Communities
Though sometimes overlooked, older members of our community are still heavily impacted by synthetic biology advancements and their experiences can help provide unique experiences for projects. With this in mind, we wanted to create strong relationships with the retired population in our area. To create an accessible and relevant outreach program we followed the Outreach Planning Guide . An overview version of the guide can be found on the Database Page page
Find Communities
We wanted to connect with the older community that can’t always attend our in-house public forums. These individuals are still an important part of the wider community; they vote, have an impact on the integration of synthetic biology projects, and may benefit from advances in biomedical engineering.
Evaluating Interest & Understanding
To ensure our program fit the needs of this community, we connected with Patee Ramsey: the WindsorMeade Lifestyle Coordinator, Laura Mullen: the Williamsburg Landing Manager of Activities, and Melissa Degaraff: the Administrative Coordinator Christopher Wren Association. With each of these individuals we discussed the interests of their communities, the appropriate length of a program, and the background knowledge participants would be bringing into the program. Knowing the background of our community helped us prepare for the kinds of questions we would be asked during the presentation. Particularly with Williamsburg Landing, we were informed many of the residents had strong memories of the Cold War which influenced their perceptions of advancements in science. Knowing this helped us better anticipate their questions and concerns.
Consider How to Connect
These conversations also helped us to evaluate the most effective way to connect with the retirement community. In person conversations were ultimately the best way to create meaningful relationships and facilitate the most learning. Because it would be logistically challenging to coordinate the residents visiting us on campus, we arranged to visit them in their community buildings. A special consideration for this community is their age and how it impacts their hearing; it was important for our team to arrange for microphones and to practice speaking very clearly so we could be heard and understood.

The project is progressing well. We can now find our way around the lab pretty well and are getting used to the different protocols. There are still gBlocks that are proving particularly stubborn to PCR and so we're trying a gradient PCR tomorrow. We've got some of our inserts into expression vectors, which are also going for sequencing. We're considering different functional assays to use and work for interlab is well underway.

WHAT'S UP? 25/06/15
4 days in and we have successful transformations! The first week in the lab has been a steep learning curve. For the first couple of days, the whole team was doing wet lab work, learning the basics of performing PCR and doing gel electrophoresis. We extracted successful PCR bands and restriction digested our products before determining the concentrations of DNA using the nanodrop machine, after which we ligated our template DNA into the appropriate vector. We then prepared competent E. coli and transformed our DNA!
We've had to repeat a few of the protocols. 7 (one was faint so it was also repeated) of the 14 PCR lanes gave bands on the first day, the DNA from which has been ligated into pSB-1C3 plasmids and transformed into E. coli. We repeated PCR for 8 of our samples and two gave bands, the DNA from which is hopefully transforming our E. coli cells tonight. For the samples that are proving stubborn to PCR, we are adjusting concentrations of template DNA and the annealing temperatures in an attempt to coerce our samples into amplifying.
On Tuesday, we ran a workshop for high school students attending a science summer school at Corpus Christi College, during which we went over gene structure and biobricks. We discussed the applications of synthetic biology and worked in groups to come up with potential construct designs. Tomorrow we're going up to"

We reached out to the 2014 Montgomery High School iGEM Team on July 2nd, 2014, to collaborate on their project, since Montgomery’s project is also related to acne. We found the 2014 Montgomery iGEM Team had difficulty completing their experiments on time, because their team was new to the synthetic biology lab setting. To help out, we invited Montgomery iGEM to the 2014 Pittsburgh Meet-Up and showed them around our lab and our equipment. We wish them best of luck in the 2015 iGEM competition! Greg Poterewicz, founder of the 2014 Stony Brook iGEM Team, reached out to us for advice on general team management, which we were more than happy to offer! Similar to the Pitt iGEM Team, this was the first year for the Stony Brook iGEM Team, and they were struggling with the same issues we were: raising funds, delegating work, staying motivated, etc. We met with Greg on July 11th, 2014, to share our experiences starting the Pitt iGEM Team.
Early on in the team-creation process, our mentors provided strong support to help us off the ground, and we learned a lot along the way. Namely, we had read about basic management techniques, such as planning distinct goals, and assigning clear tasks with solid deadlines to everyone. We have found if you can ensure accountability, then work flows more smoothly, and deadlines seem less daunting! Our meeting with Greg, as well as discussions with the Montgomery team, were influential in creating a “How to Start an iGEM Team” guide, which can be found on our blog.
The 2014 Carnegie Mellon iGEM Team is right next door to us and made for an instinctive collaboration opportunity. Also with the Carnegie Mellon team, we presented an overview of iGEM and our 2014 projects to a group of undergraduates conducting computational biology research at the University of Pittsburgh on July 11, 2014. The presentation covered the biological, modeling, and outreach components of our iGEM projects. We specifically focused on our logical model and its relation to computational biology. Overall, our presentation was well-received and incited the spark in several undergraduates to start iGEM teams at their own"

June 14th is the World Blood Donor Day, the theme in 2018 is “Give blood to others and share life.” In order to response to this meaningful day, our team members decided to take place in some voluntary activities, so we chose to go to the local blood donation bus just near the Quancheng Square in Shandong Province.
We went there on that day. Although there were many people on the square, there were not many people in the blood donation bus. After asked the staff working there, we started to work. Our job was to help the donors to fill the form before donation, record the donor’s information in the computer and put the blood bags in the fridge, etc.
Not only we helped a lot, but also learnt that there are some detections must be performed before the blood donation. They are as follow:
Blood type of the donor
Hemoglobin quantity
ALT detection
HBV antigen and Treponema pallidum antibody
These detections are really important, if one of these items is not qualified, the donor cannot donate their blood. These tests are just primary detection, the blood needs to be sent to the blood center for further detections, including HCV and HIV detection.
But now the question is that not all of the virus infected blood could be detected. If the infected blood is during “window period”, it cannot be detected due to the limitation of technology. If those undetected blood in the “window period” are transfused to the patients, it would increas dramatically the risk of virus infection, such as HCV, HIV, etc. This is very dangerous. So, we got an idea that if we develop a method to detect the infected blood in the window period, that would be very significant. This is the original intention our project.
For deeply understand the unpaid blood donation, our team members went to the blood donation bus again at the beginning of summer vacation and we did some survey concerning the blood donation. It was upset that there were still a few people at the blood donation bus during the holiday. So we went to the local book store near the square and science museum to give out the questionnaires regarding the knowledge of blood donation. We"

If more glycogen is present, the color of stainend cultures is darker. In the picture below, the brown color of BL21 Gold (DE3) expressing glgA indicates that the enzyme has the expected activity.
Iodine staining of BL21 Gold (DE3) with glgA in pSB1K30 compared to BL21 Gold (DE3) wild type
Iodine staining was performed with overnight cultures which were adjusted to the same OD. The darker color of the strain expressing glgA shows that more glycogen is present. Therefore, the functionality of the glycogen synthase is shown.
K1585311
This is the translational unit of GlgB (glycogen branching enzyme) from E. coli. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of α-1,6-branches in glycogen synthesis.
Usage and Biology
The construct was confirmed by sequencing. The expression was tested in Bl21 Gold (DE3) strains containing BBa_K1585311 in a pSB1K30 expression vector after IPTG induction.
SDS-PAGE of GlgB in comparison to mRFP
After induction with IPTG at OD=0.6, glgB was expressed. Samples were taken 6 and 19.5 hours after induction. The small arrows indicates the expected bands for GlgB. mRFP in pSB1K30 (T7 promoter) was used as negative control.
We wanted to investigate the functionality of the strains expression glgB. Therefore, we used dinitrosalicylic acid staining (DNS) for detection of reducing ends [1] which should correspond to the branching frequency. All samples of glgB strains were compared to wild type samples. For best comparison the samples were grown to stationary phase and adjusted to the same OD before staining. Since every sugar or alkyl would have reacted with 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, we purified our samples before the staining. In order to identify the branching frequency, we analyzed the absorbance values of the purified samples compared to the absorbance values of hydrolyzed samples. By calculating the absorbance ratio of the non-hydrolyzed divided by the hydrolyzed samples, we aimed for information about the branches per glycogen unit.  The reaction principle can be described as follows.

To exploit the secretion pathway, we planned to attach the C-terminal secretion tag from RsaA to a biofilm inhibiting or degrading protein. This allows our system to produce and secrete large quantities of enzyme that are easy to isolate because there is no cell lysis that is necessary.
For the biofilm degrading enzymes that we chose to have Caulobacter secrete, we focused our efforts on a serine protease, Esp (Iwase et al. 2010), from Staphylococcus epidermidis, and a hydrolase, DspB (Kaplan 2003), from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans that have both been shown to degrade biofilms.
The general goals of our project were: 1) to introduce Caulobacter as another potential chassis for synthetic biology, especially in environmental and biomedical-related fields; 2) to create a toolbox of biobrick parts that enable easy exploitation of Caulobacter's typeI secretion system for any protein of interest through fusion to the C-terminal secretion tag; 3) and to develop a system for degrading biofilms by targeting the EPS.

Caulobacter crecentus and Type I secretion
Caulobacter crescentus is an aquatic gram-negative bacterium. It is widely used as a model organism for studying cell cycle, cell division and cell differentiation. Caulobacter divides asymmetrically to produce two morphologically different progeny, a swarmer and a stalked daughter cell (Laub et al. 2007). Only the stalked Caulobacter cells can initiate chromosome replication. The swarmer cells differentiate into stalked cells after a period of motility. The stalked cells produce an extremely strong polar adhesive called the holdfast (Toh et al. 2008) which can serve as a biofilm initiator. The Caulobacter strain we used (CB15N) is deficient in the gene that is responsible for producing the holdfast.
In the wild, Caulobacter is found in freshwater lakes and streams, where low nutrient conditions are common. However, Caulobacter cells are well equipped with various environmental sensors and transporters so that they are able to survive. For example, Caulobacter has many more TonB-dependent receptors than most bacteria, which are accountable for gathering carbohydrates from a variety of sources (Ryan et. al,  2010). Caulobacter is even capable of halting cell cycle progression in extreme dilute"
Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eukaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html,". The VDR has a very high affinity towards calcitriol (1α,25(OH)2-cholecalciferol) which is the prohormone of vitamin D3. Binding of calcitriol results in a heterodimerisation of VDR with retinoid-X receptor, the complex is transferred into the nucleus and binds to several promoters (vitamin D response elements) thereby increasing or decreasing the transcription of the appropriate genes. The genes modulated by the VDR-calcitriol complex are involved in activating the immune system, bone formation and protection of cancer [32] . Many studies for example indicate a relationship between vitamin D signalling and reduced breast cancer occurance [33] . Furthermore the transcription of the VDR gene itself is positively regulated by the presence of calcitriol.

Zink finger protein 5 (ZF5) is transcription factor playing an important role as a transcriptional repressor. ZF5 is composed of 5 zink finger motives enabling the multimerisation process and the binding of ZF5 to GC- rich DNA elements [34] .  Both the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) promoter [35] and the c-myc promoter [34] are targets of the ZF5 transcription factor. The appropriate genes are repressed as a result of the binding process. However, ZF5 is not only a transcription repressor, binding to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter leads to an enhanced transcription of the appropriate gene.

WT1
Wilms' tumor protein 1 (WT1) is a transcription factor containing three zink finger motives. The WT1 transcription factor regulates genes being involved in developmental processes (for example development of the urogenital system, kidney, blood vessel formation and heart [36] ) and cell survival [37] . The many isoforms of WT1 in different tissues are the reason for the multitude of functions.  Mutation of the appropriate gene can result in the formation of Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma).

RAR
Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a transcription factor belonging to the family of nuclear receptors. RAR builds a hetereodimer with Retinoid X receptor (RXR), this complex is able to bind to specific response elements. Transcriptional activation of the appropriate gene occurs when the ligands all-trans retinoic acid or 9-cis retinoic acid bind to the complex. Genes regulated"

INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES
To ease the use of our tool, Neptune offers several features to the user. First, the user could simply email the developers, or visit our Github page where there would be instructions on how to get started, and some documentation. This would include what the user would need to download, and the steps to get Neptune running on the biologist's computer.
When the user first enters Neptune, they could also go through a guided tour using the 'Tour' button on the dashboard page. The guided tour would step through the entire application to show the user what they need to do to make their first microfluidic chip from top to bottom.
Otherwise, the user can visit our iGEM wiki page where they can view more documentation, tutorial videos, and so on. They could also reach out to the synthetic biology community to talk to other biologists and how they used Neptune for their research experiments. This interaction using Neptune would enable biologists around the world to share their ideas, get feedback, and progress the advancement of science.
PARAMETRIC DESIGNS
All of our STL files used for 3-D printing hardware infrastructure are parametric. If the user decides to use a different servo than that which Neptune recommends, he or she may simply enter a few measurements into the  parameters listed at the top of the provided files and the designs will update automatically to reflect those changes.
Our software is designed to convert a mL amount to be dispensed into a PWM command to be sent to the arduino such that an even dispense rate is achieved for fluid movement through the microfluidic device. This conversion, however, is dependent on the specific servo/syringe combination the user has implemented. If the user decides to use a different servo/syringe setup than what is recommended by our system, he or she may still use our dispense conversion algorithm to control their system as it is also completely parametric.

LARGE FUNCTIONAL RANGE OF HARDWARE
Our Hardware system is highly adaptable for both small and large system requirements. Neptune is capable of running up to 200 servo/syringe combinations at once, fulfilling the need for the most demanding microfluidic system. This number is calculated by finding the bottleneck in data transfer from the computer to Arduino, and the transfer rate from Arduino to motor controller shield. Processing time in both the computer"

Abstract of our talk
The iGEM (international genetically engineered machine) competition enables the possibility for students to fulfil their own biological project. It is an international competition dealing with synthetic biology, in which undergraduates can participate. Once a year it is arranged by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Boston, USA. Under the umbrella term „Synthetic Biology“, teams with a multitude of backgrounds in life sciences as well as software development, design and art teams can participate. So the project topics are broadly diversified. All teams start with the same toolbox of standardized DNA parts – the Biobricks. These parts combined with new designed Biobricks are used to build novel biological systems in living cells. Further focuses of the competition are biosecurity and the bioethical aspects of synthetic biology. These aspects are taken into account in public discussions.
In 2011 more than 150 teams from all over the world will be participating. The teams have to do all the logistical and organisational work as well as public relations. This includes providing labspace, organizing a manageable time schedule and accomplishing all the fundraising on their own. Another main focus is the scientific communication of synthetic biology, the iGEM competition and the student‘s project. All in all the students will perform a self-organised project from the sketchbook to the final product.
The last year’s project of the iGEM team Bielefeld concerning a biosensor for spiciness was honoured with a gold medal. In 2011 the iGEM team Bielefeld is participating for the second time. The students will create a cell free analytical system for the detection of environmental toxics, which is fused to molecular self assembly systems (S-layers).
