CELL CULTURE
Neuron culture
Imaging was performed in collaboration with the BioImagerie Photonique platform of the Institut Pasteur. Data are presented as MEAN ± SEM. Significance between 2 different groups was determined using an Ordinary one-way ANOVA test on the software Prism6 (GraphPad). (ns: non-significant, *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01, ***: p<0.001, ****: p<0.0001)
As an alternative to our recombinant proNGF for control experiments, we performed an in vitro neural primary culture with commercial NGF. For this, a pair of E18 Sprague Dawley cortexes were purchased from BrainBits.co.uk. We digested the tissue with manufacturer provided papain according to their protocol and seeded 40 000 dissociated neurons on our microfluidic chips with different conditions of culture for six days at 37°C, and 5% CO2.
On our two-chamber microfluidic devices, we seeded neurons only on one side.  Fifteen chips were used in total. After six days, neurons are fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% and stained with DAPI. For differentiated markers: MAP2 (coupled with Alexa Fluor 555), a cytoskeletal associated protein and Beta-III Tubulin (coupled with Alexa Fluor 488), one of the major components of microtubules and a neuron-specific marker were used.
We can see in Figure 11 that we had contaminations on many of our microfluidic chips because we could not use antibiotic selection otherwise our bacteria would have suffered from it, and that most of our experiments could not be analyzed. However, no contaminations were apparent for eight of them. Two of these successful ones are displayed in Figure 12.

Absorbance analysis
Calculation of growth rate of the population for varying blank levels
28 ºC
Growth rate variation is low for different blank values(0.004-0.005)
See figure 5 for an example.
The growth rate of the culture seems to be constant at the values mentioned (0.004 to 0.005 /min) but the positive control seems to be  higher. We believe that this variation is due to noise.
42 ºC
The linear trend in variation of the blank can be explained due to evaporation effects. In this case, the variation was accounted for directly, so it was unnecessary to evaluate the growth rate for different blank values.
The y-intercept in the plot is not reliable but the trend is apparent.
We can observe exponential growth for the first 100 minutes (figure 6) at a rate of roughly 0.012 /min.
28 degrees Celsius
Figure 1: Absorbance at 28 degrees Celsius
42 degrees Celsius
Figure 2: Absorbance at 42 degrees Celsius
Plotting raw absorbance data on its own does not provide sufficient information about the effects of temperature on our system. Therefore, further analysis is required. This includes recording the variation in absorbance of the blank well (containing only the M9 medium) and normalizing absorbance data against the latter to spot ay possible trends in growth rate variations at different temperatures.

Characterization using IPTG Induction
LacI repression
With T7 and T7-lac promoter variants in hand, we want to characterize their relative strengths. To obtain the right set-up, we transform the promoter variant plasmids into a different strain of E. coli called BL21. These cells have a mutation in the promoter for the lacI gene. As a result of this mutation, LacI protein is overproduced and is found abundantly in these cells.
In this same strain, the gene for the T7 RNA polymerase is preceded by a lac operator. Since LacI is a repressor and is strongly present in BL21 cells, the production of T7 RNA polymerases is severely repressed.
With very few T7 RNA polymerases available, there is very little recognition and binding of T7 promoters and consequently very little expression of the gene driven by the T7 promoter. Moreover, the expression of a gene driven by a T7-lac promoter would be even less, since the presence of LacI would block any action of the T7 RNA polymerase.
IPTG induction
With such a system in place, the transformation of our T7 and T7-lac promoter variant plasmids into BL21 cells would produce little to no reporter expression. Now to induce promoter activity, we rely on the fact that the chemical IPTG blocks the repressor action of LacI.
Without LacI inhibition, the cell can resume production of T7 RNA polymerases. These in turn can bind to the T7 and T7-lac promoters to express the reporter gene without interruption. So the adding of IPTG to a BL21 cell culture containing these T7 and T7-lac promoter variant plasmids ought to produce high levels of RFP or Lysis expression. Since lysis is a rather binary process (either the cell is lysed or it is not), we use RFP fluorescence as a gauge"

We took the violacein pigment bacteria (right plate in photo) out of the fridge to find that the purple colour had started to develop. They were therefore left at room temperature overnight. The colour appears to be within the bacteria, with little or no bleeding into the media. The control plate (left plate) is the untransformed TOP10 E. coli.
Left: control plate - untransformed TOP10 E. coli, Right: Top10 transformed with pPSX-Vio+.
Pigment production efficienty
The Vio operon is currently on a very low copy number plasmid; moving it onto a higher copy number plasmid may accelerate pigment production.
Characterisation of colour output
We characterised the violacein pigment by carrying out the acetone extraction protocol used for carotene. The results were normalised for OD and then plotted as a graph of absorption units against wavelength:

Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ofundme page, the event posed a way for our team to gain funds for our project. Promoting the synthetic biology community and the involvement of high school students in scientific learning was a worthwhile experience.
Parent-Teacher Night
One of the components to our public engagement aspect for our human practices was a parent and teacher night. This night was certainly a success. During the event, we had our parents and teachers come to the University of Lethbridge for a presentation, and a few labs. The event gave our team the perfect opportunity to showcase our lab space, as well as introduce our project to the community. We used the presentation to briefly provide an explanation of iGEM, as well as our project. Following the presentations, the participants had the chance to perform a few experiments that require similar protocol and science to our own experiments. For example, they got to extract the DNA from strawberries, as well as run an agarose gel. This allowed the teachers and parents to gain an insight into the experiments completed by our team throughout the season, such as our minipreps. After the event, we collected some brief feedback from the participants. There was an overall positive response to the presentation and experiments; they were found educational and engaging. However, it was suggested that the delivery of the presentation should be refined and that our project, SynthetINK, be explained further in depth. By the end of the evening, a strong interest was shown regarding synthetic biology and a willingness to promote iGEM to extended family, friends and students. Many participants seemed eager to participate in similar events in the future. The teachers and parents expressed great enthusiasm seeing their students or children participating in the program and applying science outside of school. Overall, this event helped us to engage with the public, while also allowing the opportunity to spread more awareness for synthetic biology. It enabled us to show the teachers at our schools and our parents a glimpse into what happens during a season of iGEM, as well as the number of benefits gained by students from the program and the competition.
Curriculum Proposal and Research
Team members were fortunate to have interviewed Sheanne Cox, a middle school teacher at G.S Lakie. During our interview, we discussed the possible integration of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) into the Alberta middle school curriculum, Sheanne stressed to us the importance of early integration into the education system in order to help students develop a strong interest in STEAM initiatives. Sheanne also explained to us that focusing on middle school integration gives teachers the freedom to create an option class designed to support the current curriculum."

It has been shown that singlet oxygen is also produced by KillerRed, which was originally hypothesized to be the primary ROS produced1. More recent data suggests that superoxide is the primary ROS produced by KillerRed2,7. It is possible that triplet oxygen can enter the water channel and react in a similar manner to produce singlet oxygen via electron excitation by the chromophore2.

Education
We are fully engaged in various educational events and workshops using different communication channels with different groups of people. First, we published two articles sharing our iGEM project and learning experiences in most-circulated science magazines in Taiwan. This allowed us to reach out to those we cannot educate face-to-face. Second, we attended several international and national science workshops. We exchanged ideas about synthetic biology and our bio detecting kit. Third, we conducted media analysis to learn how mass media addressed this issue, and what campaigns we may further initiate to educate the public.
Science Magazine
Science Study Monthly
When first issued in 1962, the aim of this monthly was to help science education to take root, but it has now become an exchange platform for primary and high school teachers, and acts as educational resources for primary and high science curricula. The contents are easy to understand and rich in pictures and words, covering 7 major areas, including physics, chemistry and earth science etc. and providing diverse scientific knowledge to satisfy the public.
Our article “ Born of the “E”vengers will be released in December, 2016.
Our story:
Owing to the food scandal 2014 that happened in Taiwan, 50 students in HSNU decided to invent a bio-sensor that can detect the poison in edible oil.  We chose to use synthesis biology to make our biosensor cheaper. Because we used “E.coli” to be the “avenger” of our food safety, we made ourselves the “Evengers”!
Inventing biosensor
Although E.coli is really cheap on the market, it is difficult for senior high school student to get experiment plasmids and the synthetic equipment. Thanks to IGEM, a synthesis biology contest that is held by MIT, we were able to get the sample DNA to complete our dream of detecting toxin in edible oil.

Plasmid purification by Midiprep
Harvest the cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 12000 rpm in the mini-spin. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pelleted cells in 2 mL of Resuspension Solution auditioned with RNase solution. The bacterial pellet should be resuspended by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps remain.
Add 2 mL of Lysis Solution and mix gently by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Incubate for 3 min at room temperature.
Add 0.5 mL of the Endotoxin Binding Reagent. Mix immediately by inverting the tube 5-8 times.
Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Note. After the addition of the Neutralization Solution and Endotoxin Binding Reagent it is important to mix gently, but thoroughly, to avoid localized precipitation of bacterial cell debris. The neutralized bacterial lysate should appear cloudy and contain white precipitate.
Add 3 mL of 96% ethanol. Mix immediately by inverting the tube 5-6 times.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 4,000-5,000 rpm to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA.

Potsdam_Bioware,2011,Team:Potsdam Bioware#Safety Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," itself, but for all students with different fields of study. Through advertisement in different departments a audience with different background was the result. Starting with a general overview in the history of philosophy regarding the metaphysics of morals and the example of Immanuel Kant, Prof. Dr. Stoecker tried to explain the difficulty of ethics in modern times.
Kant started to think about general ideas concerning actions of humans a priori [4]. Philosopher often try to adapt these moral principles to certain specific cases. Nowadays they are confronted with the problem of a fast development in science and new applications. It is not any more possible to think first about a general principle and then adapt these to the new results. Today the society often needs an answer to a moral problem in short time, because the applications are needed or will be commercialize anyway. One can then try, to extract from the concrete problem e.g. synthetic biology in medicine general principles. This way is part of the applied philosophy.
To represent this current problem in finding a ethic view on synthetic biology, Prof. Dr. Stoecker suggested a field of forces, where different positive and negative effects pull at the decision to use synthetic biology in research for new applications. In conclusion, the ethic or moral decision for a new case in not determined by higher general principles. It is a combination and weighing of different positive and negative aspects.
Figure 1: Force-field map on synthetic biology
We tried to find relative clear examples for advantages and disadvantages of synthetic biology. One should always remind himself, that the different aspects have different weight for each individual. While the iGEM competition is a good example for advantages of synthetic biology e.g. new applications and teaching of new knowledge, Miller and Selgelid [5] show in their paper, that new applications in biology also can used for military use . The „lone operator” scenario by Tucker and Zilinkas [6] is also a good example for possible biosafety problems. In this unlikely scenario one professional researcher follows his own terrorist goal. Still these examples show disadvantages which one has to consider, when trying to make his decision.

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," Dutch economy. The pumping system of the blue energy setup conflicts with the trade in mussel growing. In the west part of the Waddenzee are located several installations used for capturing mussel seed. As vast amounts of zooplankton, fish and mussel larvae are filtered out of the water by the blue energy setup to prevent clogging, and the mussel business suffers greatly from this.[4]
Politics + Globalization and governance
Governments try to reduce the amount of fossil fuels used, and strive to reach a fully bio-based economy that is both sustainable and green. This is why political parties include the potential of blue bio energy in their programmes and emphasise the importance of research. Worldwide this shift in focus leads to a decrease in power of oil-producing countries. As the Netherlands was the first to make an exception for the use of genetically modified bacteria, other countries are interested in the specifics of Dutch regulations. Countries bordering the sea are looking for opportunities to applying blue energy and generate a larger percentage of their national energy demand, thereby making them independent of other countries when it comes to the supply of electricity. The implementation of blue energy gives an advantage to countries with more rivers flowing into the sea or with boundaries like dikes by which fresh and salt water are separated. Next to that, in countries with a shortage of fresh water and a lot of sun, solar energy is a much better option. By 2050, a patchwork of all kinds of renewable energy is in place, with each type of energy fitting the environment in which it is used. The possibility of using synthetic biology in addition to existing technologies provides one of many ways to replace fossil fuels and make the shift towards a sustainable economy.
Scenario 3 – GMOs
Science and technology + Sustainable development
Research in synthetic biology and specifically genetic modification of bacteria has taken place for over 30 years, but always safely within the boundaries of the lab. As GMOs are now used outside the lab, the connection between synthetic biology and industry becomes stronger. Even though application of blue energy setups using genetically modified biofilms causes some resistance and discussion, the benefits of it are readily acknowledged and so companies begin to see synthetic biology as an interesting option for solving problems that were not yet solvable before. It is seen that interest in applied research increases, especially because people expect that a trend is set that will be continued in the years to come. From 2030 on, more funds become available for research as the direct implication of the discovery of the blue energy principle serves as an illustration that research is the key to innovation and sustainable development. Research in synthetic biology has a"

UC_Davis,2011,Team:UC Davis#Notebook wip_-_-_TEXT.html," they have the correct antibiotic this time!  We also got a new strain, JS006, which we requested from another lab.  We'll make glycerol stocks and competent cells of these.
--Saturday-- Took plates out and all had growth=carb plates good! It's amazing what plating on the right antibiotic will do.  All of our plates which had failed just a few days ago had colonies with a few of them being red.
Week 4
--Monday 7/04/11--
Happy 4th of July for all the Americans!   Today we started making more competent cells for the new strain BW22826.  Tomorrow we will complete the protocol.
--Tuesday 7/05/11--
BW22826 Cells had very fast growth overnight, and were too overgrown to use for competent cells in the morning. The procedure was restarted late at night (around 9:30) and lesser amounts of starter culture were used (1, 2, and 2 mL) to ensure the cells don't overgrow. One culture was placed on a shaker at room temperature, the other two were placed on a bench at room temperature.
We inspected our LacI mutants. Most of the plates were covered in white colonies, though a few had some slightly pink colonies, indicating mutations were successful. The cells were plated on IPTG+ plates, so we expect induction; it is possible that the mutation rate was high and the promoter function was destroyed in a majority of colonies. Ten pink and ten white colonies were replated on IPTG+ plates, to rule out poor induction on our initial plates.
E0240 variants with B0034 and with no RBS in pSB1K3 were cultured.
--Wednesday 7/06/11--
The making of our competent cells was successful! We were able to produce two full boxes today, with good amounts of cells in each of the tubes. Hopefully we won't have to make more for a while.
We also miniprepped the E0240 variants from yesterday so that we could proceed with construction. We digested these minipreps along with our three main promoters (R0040, R0051, R0010) so that we could ligate them together.
--Thursday 7/07/11--
Today started slow but ended in a flurry!  We ligated three promoters (R0010, R0040, R0051) to E0240 (GFP) and transformed them.  We also retransformed our mutant LacI ligations to try and get even more. "

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#HBK_-_-_TEXT.html," the effect of the gene doping EPO on the production of red blood cells, the purpose of the model is to determine the dynamics of the detectable cfDNA concentration in the blood. Cell free doping DNA is released from dying infected cells and circulates in the blood where it is assumed to degrade at the same rate as natural cfDNA.
$$\frac{d[Doping\,DNA]}{dt} =k_{cell\,death}[plasmid\,nucleus]-kel_{cfDNA}[Doping\,DNA] \tag{17}$$
Equation 17 provides us with a detection window for which we assume that we can detect both, DNA left in the tissue and bloodstream after injection, and DNA released after cell death (kcelldeath). Any other degradation terms or transient expression we incorporated in the constants used. Based on the above model we obtained the concentration developments of cfDNA in time for both intramuscular and intravenous injections and the estimated detection windows where we assumed an estimated detection limit of 100 copies DNA. The concentrations of DNA over time were used in the laboratory for our sample preparation to mimic real life detection potential. The cell death rate constant is directly linked to the average lifetime of renal interstitial fibroblasts, which we estimated to be around 57 days based upon measurements in chicks by Weissmanshomer et al. 1975 .
According to Haller et al. 2018 , the expected concentration of doping cell free DNA may be higher for athletes in endurance and intermittent sports. Haller et al. found a 22.7 fold increase in venous cfDNA concentrations in footballers after a professional football match. Given the high amount of training top level athletes endure, this finding leads us to believe that the detection window might be even longer than our model predicts.
The Protein Effect
Lastly, the uptaken DNA can be translated into proteins according to equation 18, after which it can be exported to the extracellular environment according to equation 19.
$$\frac{d[protein]}{dt} =k_{protein}[plasmid\,nucleus]-k_{deg\,protein}[protein]-k_{export}[protein] \tag{18}$$
$$\frac{d[protein\,extracellular]}{dt} =k_{export}[protein]-k_{deg\,protein\,extracellular}[protein\,extracellular]\tag{19}$$

-Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill: Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
-Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
All three teams brainstormed collaboration ideas such as the “Building with Bio Revamp”.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night."

Tokyo-NoKoGen,2010,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#Project#lysis_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_K112808 activity. The experiment was performed from single colonies in a streaked LB agar plate. At first, we cultured the single colony having the above device in 100 mL LB for 12 hors at 37℃ with agitation. Then, the culture was dispensed into 3 mL scale and IPTG (f.c. 0.3 mM) was added to each dispensed culture to induce the expression of Lysis genes. The obtained culture was incubated for 20 hours at room temperature without agitation. After that, the OD660 of each culture (N=3) was measured. The result was shown (Fig.6).
The result showed that the OD660 were different in presence of IPTG (orange bar) or not (gray bar).  OD660 of samples with the IPTG were half less than no additive samples. That indicates IPTG induced the expression of lysis genes and the E. coli in the culture were lysed.
Conclusion and perspective
We could make a novel lysis system for disruption of E. coli, which system may be a proper control of lysis gene expression in EcoTanker.
And more, for the characterization and application of BBa_K112808, we built up a new measurement system (IPTG induction) to characterize an interesting lysis device (BBa_K112808). IPTG induction is a general method to produce a target recombinant protein, so with this system, anyone can make E. coli lysis easily and use this system for a lot of applications.
Therefore, with the investigation of the condition of this functional device, for example, whether this device can work after aggregation of E. coli or not, EcoTanker as a novel tool of resource recovery can be put into practice.

Keeping that in mind we have explored literature 1,4 and found five different RNA thermoswitches that we decided to test and build into our system in order to delay the translation of fusion construct bearing beta-barrel membrane protein. Furthermore, understanding the importance of expanding the library of well characterized and widely-applicable biobricks, we have de novo designed ( ) six completely unique heat-inducible RNA thermometers.
Results
With custom IDT primers with overhangs bearing thermoswitch sequences we performed a PCR  from a GFP gene containing plasmid and inserted RNA thermometers GJx (link: BBa_K2622010 , BBa_K2622011 , BBa_K2622012 , BBa_K2622013 , BBa_K2622014 ) upstream the GFP gene. Another set of primers was used to produce RNA thermometers Swx (link: BBa_K2622016 , BBa_K2622017 , BBa_K2622018 , BBa_K2622019 , BBa_K2622020 , BBa_K2622021 ). PCR was successful and all products were the same size as expected for Swx constructs ~76 bp (Fig. 2). DNA gel electrophoresis was not performed for GJx constructs, because whole plasmid was multiplied and only 40-60 bp were inserted.

pRSET plasmid and Swx PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes and ligated, while GJx PCR products were phosphorylated and ligated to produce plasmids from linear products. DH5α competent cells were transformed and plated on lysogeny broth (LB) media with ampicillin (Amp) and grown for 16 hours. Positive colonies were selected by colony PCR or restriction analysis (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) and grown in 5 mL LB media. Plasmids were purified and BL21 competent cells were transformed. Three tubes of every construct plus plasmid with GFP without RNA thermometer were grown till OD600 reached 0.4.

Measurement
Precise and accurate quantitative measurements of biological systems are crucial to improving understanding of biology. Such measurements often help to elucidate how biological systems work and provide the basis for model construction and validation. Differences between predicted and measured system behavior can identify gaps in understanding and explain why synthetic systems don't always behave as intended. Technologies which allow many parallel and time-dependent measurements will be especially useful in synthetic biology.

The male sex hormone, testosterone (which is produced largely in the testicles), is partially converted into a more potent derivative: dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The DHT is synthesized from the testosterone in several areas in the body: on the hair follicles, testes and adrenal glands 2 . The DHT is not only synthesized on the scalp, but is also transported to the scalp through the bloodstream.  It causes the deterioration of the hair follicle through a hormonal cascade 3 .
Available solutions
The hair loss product market is a multi-billion dollar market: in the United States alone, this market’s annual revenue is $7 billion, with a 3.5% annual growth rate from 2007 to 2012 4 .In China, the world’s second largest economy, sales of minoxidil (one of the two major products on the market), jumped 90% to $16.4 million from 2007 to 2012 5 .
Two major non-surgical treatments are available today:
Finasteride- Finasteride is one of the leading drugs treating male pattern baldness orally.  It holds 27.5 % of the market in the United States. The pills are taken orally on a daily basis.  The drug blocks the production of DHT, hence reducing its activity on the scalp 1 , 6 .  According to a study, after five years of treatment with  Finasteride, 48% of men had increased hair growth, while 75% of men who did not take the drug experienced hair loss 7 .The main drawback of  Finasteride is it’s potential side effects (partially because the treatment is not a topical one), such as impotence & cancer 8 .
Minoxidil- holds 28.2 % combined market share in the United States. This is an over-the-counter medication approved for male pattern baldness 1 . It is rubbed into the scalp twice a day. The mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood. It is most effective for people under 40 years of age whose hair loss is recent. Minoxidil has no effect on receding hairlines. Its use is advised for central (vertex) hair loss only. Hair regrowth can take eight to twelve months. However, only 30–40% of patients experience hair growth 9 .

UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay
To verify the functionality of the NodC enzyme, the UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay was performed. This assay shows a luminescence, which indicates the conversion of free UDP to ATP. The UDP is set free by the reaction of the NodC enzyme.
The UDP standard curve shows increasing luminescence with increasing UDP concentration. With this curve the conversion to free UDP can be calculated.
The evaluation of the assay with sample 17 (see Figure 9) and 18 (data not shown) shows that the NodC enzyme converts the UDP-GlcNAc to free UPD and a growing oligo-GlcNAc-chain. So the assay shows that the NodC enzyme can create chitin oligomers.
Figure 10.UDP standard curve. The standard curve shows the linearity and sensitivity of the UDP-Glo™ Lycosyltransferase Assay. The curve was prepared over the indicated range of UDP concentration in 25 µl buffer. The luminescence was measured after 1 hour of incubation with a Tecan200 Infinite Pro plate reader. Values represent the mean of four replicates (N =4) and the standard deviation is shown. For better visibility the values for the small concentrations are shown in the additional graph. The following assays (Figure 11 and 12) are based on this standard curve. RLU = relative light units.

The NodC (40 ng) was titrated in 1X glycosyltransferase reaction buffer the presence of 100 μM of UDP-N-acetylglcosamine and 10 mM N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as an acceptor substrate. The reaction was performed as described before and the luminescence was measured after 1 hour of incubation with a Tecan200 Infinite Pro plate reader. Each point is an average of two experiments (N = 2), and the error bars represent the standard deviations. RLU = relative light units.

Our team is made up of biochemists, engineers, a chemist, medic and biologist and the diversity in subjects offers different areas of specialism to contribute to the project.
We also had the opportunity to give a short introduction to the work we have been doing this summer and listen to presentations from other teams. This allowed us to identify common elements between our project and those of other teams, which, in turn, led to the opportunity for collaboration. We also saw the vast number of ways in which synthetic biology can be used to solve real world problems, for example, using RNAi to target crop pest such as aphids, a detection system for Listeria or the development of synthetic spiders’ silk in bacteria. This event was a good opportunity to meet with other UK based iGEM teams as well as chance to form important collaborations that we were able to work on over the rest of the summer.

Reaching out to the public domain via social media platforms was an essential part to our project. Our regular posting included details of our project and our progress in the lab, as well as promoting both our online and lesson-style outreach work.The social media accounts were successful at engaging the public to complete surveys, as well as serving as a vital tool for communication and collaboration between different iGEM teams. We concentrated on promoting our team as being approachable and open to collaboration with the public and other research groups."

In choosing the best combination, we use FoldX option via YASARA molecules viewer to calculate the ∆G of each molecule, searching for the smallest free energy    (regarding its stability in vivo). All those sequences are also submitted to I-Tasser server for projecting their 3D models qualitatively. The following    results would conclude that our cytoplasmic signalling combinations are    CheY-eYFP and LuxB-CheA.

Human Practice
Synthetic biology is a newly emerged interdiscipline in need of novel concepts and creations, which calls for the participation of young people. In 2011, iGEM brought High School Division into being. We believe that the high school participants will bring a new perspective to this new field.
Tsinghua-A team 2012 communicated with high school students on such issues as the concepts of synthetic biology ,the applications and the prospects ,with the help of ITCCC(International Teenager Competition and Communication Center), a Chinese organization devoted to the promotion of science and technology competitions for young people, on August 17,2012 . They high school students showed great interest and enthusiasm for iGEM and synthetic biology. Meanwhile Mao Yong, the vice director of ITCCC, who is preparing to organize iGEM HS, communicated with us on issues about out laboratory, the advantage and major of our team members , their scientific research experience, etc.. Also, we exchanged opinions on the responsibilities and obligations when undergraduate iGEM participants served as a director for high school students.
Besides, we collaborated with our sister teams, Tsinghua team and Tsinghua-D team, the other two iGEM 2012 teams in Tsinghua University. These three teams are composed of members from different colleges in Tsinghua. Our team members come from School of Information Science and Technology and the School of Science, while the other two teams are comprised of students from School of Life Sciences. On September 21,2012 we held a joint lecture on synthetic biology for students from different domains, organized by the Association of Science and Technology of School of Life Sciences. In the lecture, we reviewed our experience on the iGEM project and how we combined the research of synthetic biology with our respective majors. The audience were quite impressed and attracted by this project and synthetic biology.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," et al., 2008), which is added in the form of magnesium glutamate and potassium glutamate. Glutamate is a metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which generates NADH. In whole cells, NADH is used in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation relies on membrane bound proteins and proton gradients across a membrane. It has been shown previously that extracts prepared using French Press or sonication contain membrane vesicles which have ATPase activity (Futai, 1974), and that oxidative phosphorylation can be activated in CFPS systems (Jewett, et al., 2008). Sodium oxalate, another component of the supplement solution, is also used to help increase energy generation by the system. PEP synthetase, an enzyme present in E. coli, converts pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) in a reaction which consumes ATP, thereby wasting ATP and directing it away from protein synthesis. Oxalate inhibits PEP synthetase by acting as a pyruvate mimic, and hence limit the energy wasted by this reaction. The ribonucleotides ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP are also components of the supplement solution. They are used in the synthesis of mRNA for transcription of desired genes encoding on exogenous DNA added to the system, and ATP can also be used directly as energy for translation. The polyamines spermidine and putrescine are two other supplements which are added to aid with transcription. It is thought that they can bind proteins and DNA to help recruit polymerase for transcription. Polyamines may also increase translation fidelity, aid ribosome assembly, and activate tRNAs (Jelenc & Kurland, 1979; Jewett & Swartz, 2004b; Algranati & Goldemberg, 1977). To enable translation to occur, amino acids (added separately from the supplement solution) and an E. coli tRNA mixture are added to the CFPS system. Folinic acid is also added as it can be used as a source of folinate for the synthesis of f-Met; the amino acid required for initiation of translation in E. coli. Magnesium and potassium ions are also added as supplements. Both ions are ubiquitous in cells with many functions in protein synthesis, namely aiding translation by associating with ribosome subunits and stabilising RNA (Nierhaus, 2014; Pyle, 2002). While magnesium ions are essential for protein synthesis, at"

Neste Verão,  todas as equipas  trabalham nos seus projectos originais que serão apresentados no “Jamboree” em Boston no início de Novembro. Diversos prémios em diferentes categorias serão atribuídos.
A equipa de Heidelberg consiste em 15 alunos da Universidade de Heidelberg e um aluno da TU Darmstadt, todos provenientes de cursos diferentes, como Biotecnologia Molecular, Biologia ou Matemática. Os estudantes contam com o apoio e supervisão  de membros do grupo de investigação de Victor Sourjik (ZMBH- Centro de Biologia Molecular da Universidade de Heidelberg) e do departamento de Roland Eils (DKFZ- Centro de Investigação do Cancro; Universidade de Heidelberg).  O projecto em si, é desenvolvido nos laboratórios do Bioquant,  edifício recentemente inaugurado que funciona como um centro de analises qualitativas de sistemas biológicos a nível molecular e celular.
A equipa de Heidelberg está a trabalhar no desenvolvimento de um maquinaria que permita detectar e especificamente destruir elementos patogénicos ou até mesmo células cancerígenas. No estudo inicial para confirmar o principio em causa, a equipa reconstruiu geneticamente duas linhas celulares de E. coli tornando uma a predadora (killer) e a outra o alvo (prey).
O sistema consiste em dois módulos: um modulo onde as células predadoras reconhecem as células alvo-patogénicas e um outro modulo onde as células predadoras se movimentam em direcção às suas células alvo. A equipa explora as capacidades de detecção e movimento intrínsecas às bactérias E. Coli, necessárias à obtenção de nutrientes no meio, reconstruindo os receptores das células predadoras de modo a que estas detectem um cocktail molecular secretado pelas bactérias alvo-patogénicas.

After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Hi everyone!
I am Junhan Liao. I do some wet lab work in the team and I'm also the team's wiki designer, the illustrator and in charge of part of the Human Practice job. I hope to contribute to the team by using my knowledge and passion in biology thus i joined the team. I hope to learn more about synthetic biology and also other parts of biology in order to create magnificent projects with my teammates in the future.
I am Xingyue Huang and I am the wiki programmer. To be honest I have no idea what the team is doing when I came to this team. Though I am not a Biology guy I find this project quite intriguing, so I am willing to help the team by doing some programming work. I hope I can practice my web-constructing skill(which I did become an 'expert' in doing that) and learn something about synthetic biology (although I might not understand any word)
Hey everyone. My name is Yongpeng Fu. I’m in charge of the game and part of the wiki for this IGEM project. From designing the structure to writing the code, I tried my best to make this game as interesting as possible. It’s quite hard for me because I’ve never written any code in HTML, JS or CSS. So I guess this is my first shot trying to complete it. Hope you enjoy the game when you are visiting our website! Shan Jiang █████ me! I [Data Pluged]!
I am Hongyi Yu who mainly working on Interlab as well as doing research for the experiment plans. As a freshman, I have a lot to learn, not only the knowledge but also the standard protocols in the lab. Thanks to my team members, I’ve improved a lot during the last few months. I will try my best to help with our project on water bears. It’s great to get involved in the iGEM, but the most important thing is the unique experience!
I am Ian, a new member of SIAT-SCIE to take part in the iGEM this year. To satisfy the dream of childhood, creating my own organism, I took part in the iGEM lab works. However, I am not very familiar with the basic knowledge in synthetic biology, I need to learn a lot from textbooks, and papers. I know that I will also learn a lot of new, valuable knowledge from the lab and my teammates. To achieve a prize in the competition is the common goal"

Finally, we interviewed various experts in bioethics and scientific fields related to our project to help further inform ourselves and give essential background to those unfamiliar with the global issue of mercury contamination.
Intellectual Property: We sought to create an integrative and marketable project by developing a business plan along with marketing analysis for our device. We also educated ourselves about the patenting process via on campus seminars. Finally, we applied for a patent to protect the intellectual property of our team in order to help protect us during any future implementation of the developed business plan.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#PromoterCharacterization_-_-_TEXT.html," sites of MerR bingding site, a dyad sequence between -10 and -35 region of promoter PmerT was constructed by degenerate primers. The resulting PCR fragments, each potentially contained one or more random mutation sites at a restricted location.
The merTPCAD (PmerT) variants library was screened and primarily characterized in 96-well plates and the performance of each individual construct was compared with that of the merT wild-type promoter.
Fig. 7 Result of secondary screen. Characterization of semiconserved region variants was performed in 96-well plates after induction with a mercury concentration gradient of 10^-7M, 10^-6M, 10^-5M for 2 hours. Wild typr PmerT promoter is marked by dotted red box and an arrow. Obviously, some mutants indeed have different response behavior compared with the wild type, for example, higher threshold.
Then secondary characterization of the best performing candidates in primary characterization was then performed in 96-well plates by induction of mercury concentration gradient of 10^-5M, 10^-6M and 10^-7M for 2 hours, followed by recording GFP intensity of each well by Microplate Reader. The result of secondary characterization showed Fig. 7.
Fig. 8 Dose response curves of each final mutants. The fitting result was shown by a solid line. Promoter sequences were shown in Table 1. Corresponding graph data were presented in Table 2.
Table 1 Sequences of wild type promoter and its mutants. The MerR binding sequence is lined. The mutational sites are in red.
Table 2 The parameters of  Hill function* fitting.
Among all these candidates, mutant1, 3, 25, 44, 85, 88 (also shown in Fig 3) were selected for the final careful characterization (Fig 8) during which a higher concentration resolution was exploited. Then the dose-response curves were fitted by Hill function (Table 2.)
It can be observed that mutations at the semiconserved region of PmerT promoter significantly influenced the response behavior of MerR/PmerT pair. It is probably because that the mutations alter the binding affinity between MerR and PmerT promoter, which can also be deduced from Table 1. As a result of this, different sensitivity (higher or lower than the wild-type) PmerT promoters were gained by us (Table 1 and Table 2).
In summary, After initially characterizing the dose-time response manner of MerR based reporter system, we constructed a saturated mutagen"

Safety training received
Prior to the researches of the project, our team members received all basic trainings on biosafety and laboratory safety in turn ,lectured by professors in the laboratory.The safety training included  many aspects, such as the proper usage of all the equipments, how to deal with the experimental rubbish correctly, and wear rubber gloves, lab coats when making operations. Before using the super-clean bench,we must sterilize,etc.
Environment safety issue and biosafety group
Hela cells are commonly studied in labs, and they are not generally considered to be dangerous. Minor risks are contained in our research since the organism and plasmids, which causes no severe infection to human and animals, will be handled properly by well-trained personnel after every and each experiment, and the chemicals in frequent use are proved to be friendly, except EB ,which is separated along with related devices in a special section, the contact with which requires such protections as a pair of rubber gloves. Thus no major safety problem will possibly be encountered, which will be under control if they would emerge. We are supported and financed by Department of Automation, instructed and supervised by its professors and engineers studying life sciences. And laboratory assistants give us quite a lot of instructive suggestions including problems on biosafety. safety form 2(part1) safety form 2(part2)

Geneprobe is mainly divided into the following three aspects: public synthetic science,  synthetic biology discovery learning and synthetic biology project practice.
  1) public synthetic science: At the initial stage, we are aimed at  the elementary and junior high school students, high school students who have not much understood synthetic biology and life science temporarily. We cultivate their interest in life science as the main content, through fun and interesting life science experiments. And we teach them botany and animals in the garden and the zoo and raise flowers and small animals personally. Our aim is to guide lead students’ deep interest in life science.
  2) synthetic biology discovery learning: At the intermediate stage, we are aimed at students in the junior middle school and high school, who has had a certain understanding and interest in synthetic biology and life sciences. For their interest and questions in synthetic biology, we have designed a set of theoretical knowledge study, and hands-on experiments to obtain the required system of experimental training.
  3)synthetic biology project practice: At this advanced stage, we design a synthetic biology project for the students who has a deep understanding of synthetic biology and life science, letting them to work in group. And provide them with guidance and support, and recommend excellent team to participate in the iGEM competition.
Business mode
In view of our product, Geneprobe, GDSYZX-United has come up with a business mode that can earn enough cash flow
First ，direct at public synthetic science ，We will be designed a fun and meaningful day of  public synthetic science for elementary, middle and high school students to participate，Or the public synthetic science for 2 days，and try to live with WeChat way, let the parents of the children can see activities throughout the day.
Through high quality content , as well as reputation and brand building, to attract the students to take part in our activity , charge a fee for each activity , get enough income , to maintain the project.
Second，as the students of take part in public synthetic science , select students who has a strong interest in biology of junior middle school students and senior high school students, and design 7-10 days in summer or winter vacation of summer/winter camp for their, synthetic biology can help them experience the real synthetic biology science research. Every summer/winter camp charge a fee , can get enough income, help the development of the project.

Newsletter
We also participate in the newsletter project organized by Amoy_China. We were always keeping in touch with them and our contributions were published on three issues. The topic of each issue is different from each other, so they would make an arrangement in advance with us for our contribution to publish in the next issue. Through the newsletters, we shared the thoughts of how to build an iGEM team and introduced the team members, and most importantly, the detailed illustration of our project. Besides, the both teams shared thoughts about top events at that time and we gave some advices about topic selection. With our cooperation, the bond between both teams becomes stronger; we sincerely wish that the newsletter would be even better in the future! 
SKLBC Meet Up
Our team members participated in the iGEM meet up held by SKLBC-China on 19th,July. Students and teachers from SKLBC-GDSYZX, SYSU-software, SCUT, and SCUT-China also participated in this meet up. First was the ice breaking part, in which all the participants introduced themselves, bringing everybody much closer together. The second part was the presentations from each team. Those who listened were asked to write down their advice and questions and show it to the presented team. During this part we made a brief introduction of our track. Many showed great interest and appreciation to our project, many other appreciated our PPT, and some gave helpful advice. We also discussed many problems of the projects of SCUT with their team members, and talked about some mistakes from the biobricks. The third part was called the world cafe, in which all participants were divided into groups and were asked to discuss over iGEM issues( biosafety, the relationship of software and experiments, etc.). The meet up lasted for 3 hours, and the online discussion is still proceeding. The meet up was very successful, as by sharing and discussing, not only had we gain better understanding of other teams' projects, but also deeper recognition of our own project.
Team Selection
This year, we received an offer to attend SCUT's team selection competition. Prof. Huang had attended the selection competition at 8th July. Professors form SCAU had also presented. Finally, one team got the permission to attend 2015 iGEM competition held in Boston.

Collaboration with Nanjing_China
This year, our iGEM team has developed cooperative relationship with the Nanjing-China team. We have reached an agreement of helping each other examine the effectiveness of biobricks.
Firstly, we excised the EGFP cDNA form pEGFPN2 vector using restriction enzymes KpnI and NotI. Secondly, we inserted this cDNA into a vector pHisx6 that is commonly used for prokaryotic expression vector.
The bands appeared at 720bp, equal to the predicted length of EGFP coding sequence. This gel graphic indicates that we had successfully excited EGFP cDNA. Then, we transformed the recombinant vector into E. coli. We observed green fluorescence from the transformed E. coli under a fluorescence microscope.See more details (Nanjing_China)
Collaboration with NKU_China
This year, our iGEM team has developed cooperative relationship with the NKU-China team. We have reached an agreement of helping each other complete the construction of the carrier.
Firstly, we excised the pelB-CALB cDNA from pEGFPN2 vector with NdeI and BamHI. Secondly, we inserted the sequence into the pHisx6  vector. The bands located at 1,000bp, equal to the length pelB-CALB coding sequence. This gel image indicates that we had successfully cloned pelB-CALB. Then, we transformed the recombinant vector into E. coli.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice"
UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Modules#In vivo_-_-_TEXT.html," that was sent to synthesize to Mr. Gene Company, consists of the following basic parts:
Prefix+ medium strength RSB + LovTAP Coding sequence + Transcriptional Double Terminator + Suffix
E.coli Strain Mutant
As the transcriptional response regulated by LovTAP might also be generated by the trpR repressor in E.coli in tryptophan rich conditions, I looked for an Escherichia coli strain mutant in trpR to avoid the cross-talk of the endogenous function of this gene with LovTAP system.  Dr. Charles Yanofsky had the mutant (Identification number: CY15001) and kindly sent it.
According to the sequencing results, the trpR gene from the mutant strain didn’t have a frame shift as is reported at the literature, instead of that it had a non synonymous mutation (Alanine to Proline) corresponding to the aminoacid 80. The hypothesis is that this change might causes a dramatic structural change to the protein thus being non functional.
LovTAP expression Levels
Dr. Devin Strickland the designer of LovTAP, shared some issues to take into account to work with LovTAP. Analyzing some experimental results reported in his dissertation and in his published paper it is observed that at high expression levels of LovTAP, the behavior in the dark versus the light state is the same. So that, the regulation by light becomes not functional, thus I planned to test LovTAP under three different weak constitutive promoters (J23117, J23114 and J23105) to analyze its behavior and under the strong promoter (J23102), expecting to obtain the behavior reported by Dr. Devin.
LovTAP Reporter systems
The output module of LovTAP is the DNA binding domain of the bacterial transcription factor trp repressor (TrpR), with this domain LovTAP activated can bind as homodimer to the DNA operator called trpL, repressing the transcription.
The functional elements of the trpL promoter (-35 and -10 boxes, trpR binding sites and transcription start site) were synthesized in an oligonucleotide to introduce it by PCR into a selected plasmid. At the ends the primer includes the prefix and the NheI site that will be used for ligations of the promoter with the reporter systems described later. The primer designed is the following:

Calculation
Obtain the spacing of 5CB molecules
The forces between two molecules are covalent bonds, ionic bonds, metal bonds, hydrogen bonds and                         Van der Waals force. Because no other forces are present, the main force is Van der Waals force.                         The point at which the force becomes repulsive rather than attractive as two molecules near one                         another is called the van der Waals contact distance. Van der Waals force includes electrostatic                         force, dispersion force and induction force.
Fig.7 van der Waals potential energy
We can use a simplified formula: the Lennard-Jones potential[1].
$$E=\frac{A}{r^{12}}-\frac{B}{r^6}$$
where \(A=4\epsilon\sigma^{12}\), \(B=4\epsilon\sigma^6\).
However, there is no sigma Lennard-Jones parameters (Angstrom) epsilon Lennard-Jones parameters                         (kcal/mol) about 5CB, so we calculate the van der Waals contact distance(\(r_0\)) by statistical                         mechanics[2].
In statistical mechanics, the radial distribution function \(g(r)\) in a system of particles                         (atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.), describes how density varies as a function of distance from                         a reference particle.
Fig.8 The sketch map of radial distribution function
The radial distribution function:
$$\rho g(r)4\pi r^2=dN$$
where \(\rho\) is the density of 5CB, \(N\) is the total number of 5CB molecules. Integrate the                         above formula:
$$\int_0^\infty \rho g(r)4\pi r^2 \mathrm{d}r=\int_0^N\mathrm{d}N=N$$
$$g(r)=\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\rho 4\pi r^2}$$
Molecular dynamics calculation:
$$g(r)=\frac{1}{\rho 4\pi r^2}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^N \Delta N(r\to r+\delta r)}{N\times                         T}$$
Where \(N\) is the number of molecules and \(T\) is the calculated time (steps), \(\Delta N\) is                         the number of molecules between \(r\) and \(r+\delta r\).

Regulations
Legislation in Belgium & Europe
Research concerning genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is subjected to strict safety legislation in Belgium. These laws are in place to protect the general public and the environment from the potential risks of GMOs. The European legislation forms the foundation of the more extensive Belgian laws. Firstly, the use of GMOs in Europe requires an environmental licence. In Belgium, an approval for the research activity is required on top of that. This way, the Belgian government controls all use of GMO’s and can assess risk analysis accurately. This is all recorded in the Decrees of the Flemish Government: Vlarem I and II section 51. The Belgian government describes four risk levels to which different restrictions are coupled. These restrictions are a combination of physical actions and safety regulations. For this purpose, the Belgian government appeals to the expertise of the Advisory Board of Biosafety (ABB) (section Biosafety and Biotechnology of the Scientific Institute of Public Health) which acts as the scientific secretary of the board. They evaluate the risk analysis in the licence request. At the University of Leuven, all the laboratories, including the iGEM lab, have an environmental licence and an approval for their activities.

KU Leuven ""rules""
The KU Leuven has its own biosafety rules in addition to the national biosafety regulations, where Marianne Schoukens acts as the central contact point for Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) issues. All members of our team have received training in Safe Microbiological Techniques as well as general and specific lab safety required by the KU Leuven. The safety training consisted of a summary of the important biosafety issues and the composition of the lab. At the beginning of our project, all members of the iGEM team have received an update from the KU Leuven's HSE department. Via liaison Iris Govaerts, we followed a small seminar and filled in an orientation checklist concerning health and safety training prior to the start of project laboratory work.
The project we ultimately chose was the result of a whole series of brainstorm sessions. In these brainstorm sessions we discussed the feasibility of our ideas with our instructor (Dr. Ir. Ingmar Claes) and our coordinators (Prof. Dr. Johan Robben and Dr. Veerle De Wever). We also invited different PhD students, professors,"

It is reasonable to assume that POP levels are present in constant amounts, hence allowing for degradation of PE which varies with the translation rates and enzyme activity.
Impact on experimental work
We initially believed that it was the amount of POPs present in the environment, rather than the specific activity of the enzyme used and the laccase translation rates, which would have the greatest effect on the amount of polyethylene degraded.  Thus, although we had initially identified Rhodococcus ruber C208 laccase strain13 to use in the degradation of polyethylene, we now decided to use a laccase which was easier to obtain (E. coli).
Following the results of the sensitivity analysis, we realised that using a laccase with greater specific activity on PE would have a measurable impact on the amount of plastic our system can degrade. Hence, future modifications to our system will use R. ruber C208 laccase.

ZJU-China,2011,Team:ZJU-China#X-Sugarfilm.html_-_-_TEXT.html," cellubiose from the first layer would diffuse to the middle layer of Sugarfilm due to concentration gradient. Beta-glucosidase BglX (from Cytophaga hutchinsonii, BBa_K118028 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) expressed in the middle layer would now work to degrade the disaccharide into glucoses. As the simplest saccharide and the starter substrate of many synthesizing pathways, glucose can diffuse to the upper layer of Sugarfilm and set off the last step of the reaction system.
The upper layer of Sugarfilm is capable of being designed to host any synthesizing pathway starting from glucose. Except for the versatility, such design can protect cells from being harmed by synthesized products detrimental to the cell. Since the procedure happens in the top layer of Sugarfilm, the undesired by-products in the system could be got rid of quickly, which would lead to death of only a small amount of cells in the biofilm, ensuring the integrity and functionality of other regions of the system.
As an example, we designed a down-stream system to transform biomass into bio-fuel, producing iso-butanol with glucose. The non-fermentative metabolic pathway to do the job has been studied and optimized before, so we designed a very simple device to try it within our biofilm. Three enzyme coding sequences each with a RBS line down-stream the PtetR promoter, thus these bacteria can further transform the products of sugarfilm into biofuel.
Excitingly, we found this design opens a bright future for biofilm-reactors. In natural situations, biofilms can be formed by multi-species with cooperation, thus heavy burden can be resolved by adding ‘cooperators’. For example, type-A degrades cellulose into glucose while type-B make them into fuels.
Generally, with proper medium flow outside the biofilm, final products and wastes would leave the system immediately, and the continuous nutrient input provides good conditions for upper layer renewal. In ideal conditions, Sugarfilm could stick tightly to the substrate sheet surface until the whole sheet was degraded thoroughly.

Summary
VEGF（vascular endothelial growth factor）is a kind of ligand commonly used in research. It has various functions like increasing vascular permeability and promoting extracellular matrix degeneration. Using BBa_K2886007 , you can express and purify VEGF-165 which is most commonly used subtype of VEGF easily and construct receptors ( BBa_K2886002 or BBa_K2886003 ) that could recognize VEGF-165 efficiently. BBa_K2886001 is TEV protease functioning as inner-membrane domain that can recognize specific peptide sequence and cut it and then release transcription factors as a result for instance. BBa_K2886000 is transmembrane linker combining the outer-membrane domain and inner-membrane domain together to become a whole.
With this part collection and appropriate transcription factor, you could construct your own STEP system to recognize almost anything soluble you want（like VEGF as we do）and start the downstream reactions.

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Meetups_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM Copenhagen team introduced us to the use of ‘Medium’ as a social platform and we entered a very fruitful discussion about the variety of social platforms we can use and the advantages and shortcomings of each of them. The workshop “Windows: The Neglected Child in Bioinformatics” was particularly useful for us as well, given that an important part of our project was bioinformatics-based. We were able to learn and discuss the guidelines of implementing bioinformatic software that helped us verify what we were doing, we elaborate on this in our Integrated Human Practices page.
The poster sessions had an intrinsic importance for us. The input we received about the poster was insightful for us to rethinking our design. It was a great chance to practice presenting our poster to other teams, professors and we had the privilege of presenting it to Will Right (iGEM) as well, in the process we learnt a lot about the flow of the poster and thought of ways we could improve the storytelling of our project through the poster.
It was a great experience overall, we learned a lot from the professors speaking who inspired us with their work, had fruitful discussions with other iGEM teams about each others projects and poster, learnt a lot about how we could improve our project and meet some very interesting people. A big thank you to iGEM LMU & TU Munich for organising the event! (The pretzels were amazing with the yogourt sauce!)
Eurasian Meetup
The iGEM Eurasian Meetup in Shenzhen, China organized by TU Delft and BGI college was a fantastic opportunity to meet other iGEM teams from all over the world in a friendly atmosphere. We were impressed both by the variety of different projects and the enthusiasm that the different members brought with them, and learned about overcoming cultural barriers and sharing the spirit of science.
There were multiple presentations from renowned scientists, as well as fun workshops and games to build team spirit and meet new people. One of the most important parts of the meetup for us was the poster session, where we were able to get important feedback on the first draft of our poster made available to public. Thanks to this we were able to change some aspects of the overall flow of the project story on the poster we are trying to convey and use a central element better suited to our project.

All fluorescence levels were measured relative to the negative control WT E. coli MG1655, and the weak and strong constitutive promoters are included as references. Standard error of mean is shown, but are in several cases indistinguishable from the graph.
Fluorescence levels in the two different media display similar behavior, as seen in Figure 18. The main difference observed, was that the decrease in fluorescence over time was faster in LB medium than in M9 minimal medium, in concordance with the observations made in previous experiments. On a general level, the data revealed, that MG1655 cloned with the POmpR-RFP reporter system on the high copy vector exhibited a fluorescence level, equivalent to that mediated by the strong constitutive promoter. On the low copy vector, the POmpR-RFP reporter system yielded a fluorescence level comparable to the gene expression mediated by the weak constitutive promoter. On the other hand, expression levels in the MG1655 ΔOmpR strain were markedly reduced compared to MG1655, indicating that pathways including the transcription factor OmpR interfere with RFP expression under these conditions. Again, the fluorescence levels observed for the POmpR-RFP reporter system on the low copy vector were distinctly lower than for the high copy vector.
All things considered, the OmpR-regulated promoter was found to exhibit leaky expression comparable to the expression levels mediated by the constitutive promoters. When cloned into a low copy vector, the leaky expression was reduced prominently. Thus, to obtain proper regulation of RelE expression by the OmpR-dependent promoter, a low copy vector is required.
Transposon Hotspot Formation in LacI-Regulated lambda pL Hybrid Promoter Reporter System
During cloning, formation of a transposon hotspot between the LacI-regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter and a reporter system was observed, making this promoter inapt for the dormancy system
To control the gene expression of RelB, the LacI-regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa_R0011 , was chosen. Due to a putative formation of a transposon hotspot between the promoter sequence and the GFP reporter, which is described further here, another inducible promoter was chosen to regulate the expression of RelB.
Induction and Subsequent Inhibition of the pBAD Promoter
Expression by the pBAD promoter can be regulated tightly by induction and subsequent inhibition.
The pBAD promoter holds great potential to regulate the expression of the relB gene in our system, as it is capable of both an induction"

Summary
For antibiotic detection, most research is currently focused on real time PCR with specific probes that anneal to the antibiotic resistance genes. This method is comparable to our method, as specific primers are required per resistance. We decided to try out the Milk DNA Isolation Kit to be able to compare our boiling method with a commercially available isolation method.

Summary
Dik and Fimme do research on the development of diagnostic tools for pathogen resistance detection in the bioveterinary field. In S. aureus, blaZ is relevant when looking into the β-lactamases. Other β-lactamases are not relevant enough. BlaZ produces small-spectrum penicillinases. This means that benzylpenicillin, ampicillin and amoxicillin antibiotics, common first and second choice antibiotics that are empirically used by the farmer to treat mastitis, can not be used is blaZ is detected. Rapid detection of this gene could prevent the misuse of penicillins by the farmer and gives reason to directly prescribe other treatments. From the policy perspective, the presence of blaZ has a lot of impact.
The mecA gene is also relevant to detect as this gene makes the pathogen resistant against all β-lactam antibiotics, leading to the well-known disease MRSA. The experts revealed insights for the key of success. Furthermore, they told us that farmers are able to work with tubes and pipettes. Farmers are willing to invest and follow a more challenging protocol if time for a good results.

It should be noted that when a ligation has been done, it does not mean that it was successful. We will not know until we see growth on the plates and a cPCR of the colonies has been done. Even then, it would be useful to have it sequenced.
-Jacob
Worked with Jacob on steps 3 and 4 listed above. I made the gel, practised loading samples into wells (with Ruichen), and learned that the machine used to see the results is finnicky. Unfortunately, the 1 kb reference ladder did not work (unexpectedly and for unknown reasons).
(Step 3) Transformation and plating of the biobrick PCR products were the last things we did today. Of the 5, only TrpB sparked during electroporation. 1 uL of PCR product was used to transform cells.
(Step 4) Of the successful amino acid/antibiotic cassettes, Jacob and I transformed genes ""4"", ""7"", ""12"" (Tet resistant) and ""M3"" (Amp resistant)- names of the genes to follow - into EPI300, DH5a, and BL21 all with the recombineering plasmid pIJ790. The ones that sparked during electroporation are: 4 (EPI300), 4 (DH5a), 7 (BL21), and M3 (BL21). Quite a mix, but the addition of DMSO and MgCl2 to boost PCR efficiency increased the salt concentration of the solution and may have caused sparking. Gene 4 had both compounds added and 7 had DMSO (unsure about M3 - that was Mehul). Only 1 uL of PCR product was used to transform cells to reduce chances of sparking, which may have helped.

Some users may initiate self-treatment based on results they found on the Internet, which may be misleading and harmful for their health.
Wrong interpretation of results by badly informed users may cause treatment interruption or changes in the dosage of prescribed medications.
Facing positive results for severe conditions
A positive result for a severe disease may have an effect on the emotional and psychological condition of the user. Before making self-tests for many diseases available to the general public, this effect must be studied more thoroughly.
Overall effect on public health
Not many studies have been conducted in this regard since there are few self-test devices for specific conditions available on the market. Thus, the effect of the ability to test yourself for everything is not known. Before the introduction of self-tests for HIV, a mathematical model in one study predicted an increase in HIV among men having sex with men in Seattle, even if home-use tests would increase overall testing 6 .
Another concern is not reaching the target group. Before the first HIV self-test was permitted in the U.S., some experts expected that this test would be mostly used by wealthy HIV-uninfected people, so that it would not fulfill its goal to help infected people to discover their condition 2 . Their study suggested that the test may have a perverse effect of false-positive and false-negative results. On the other hand, it was shown in another study that self-test usage in the Netherlands was higher among high-risk individuals 7 .
Probably not all the users who were tested positive for severe conditions would ask for professional medical counseling, even if it was available. Some diseases currently must be reported to epidemiology and infectious disease control centers to enable disease monitoring and epidemic prevention. If positive self-test results are not reported, epidemic may be overseen. However, this may be solved by an Internet of Things module 8 , but this might also limit the device's usage because of an increased price.
Coercion
Another concern regarding self-tests might be coercion 11 , since test usage could be enforced on risk groups. This may especially be the case for socially stigmatized conditions like HIV.
Counterfeit
Counterfeited self-tests, which are providing false results to users, may have a huge effect on individual and public health. Strict regulation of test market and informing potential users about trusted sources of tests are therefore crucial.
More details about regulations, law and safety aspects of our work can be found in our Safety Form .

Research & Analysis
Indole Acetic Acid
In the initial design phase of our project, the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis pathway was selected as model for showing how our scaffold could increase product titre. IAA is a plant growth hormone and has been used by previous iGEM teams that have worked on enzyme scaffolding projects, such as ZJU-China 2012 and NUDT-China 2015. This is due to the fact that the pathway is made up of a simple, two-step reaction leading to the easily quantifiable product, IAA. To expand on this previous work, we decided to do our own research on the use of IAA in practice.
We contacted Amanda Rollason, a researcher at the Australian Botanic Gardens PlantBank facillity, who uses tissue culture methods for rainforest species conservation. Rollason informed us that their facility exclusively uses indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), another auxin, as they had found in previous experiments that IAA showed little to no benefit and that IBA was easier to work with, being more stable. Amanda coordinated our visit to the PlankBank facilities to learn more about their tissue culturing methods with Lotte von Richter , a science facilities coordinator.
Lotte von Richter
Science Facilities Co-ordinator – PlantBank
During the tour of PlantBank, Lotte showed us all the equipment and explained the methods that they employ to do tissue culture. We also received some advice as to how we should conduct our own plant experiments .
Figure 1: Pictured (Left to Right): Lotte von Richter, Emily Watson and Bec Schacht (UNSW iGEM members) in PlantBank’s tissue culture room.
After our visit to PlantBank, we decided that IAA synthesis was not a pathway which would be worth commercialising. However, we still wished to validate our scaffold design by demonstrating IAA biosynthesis with our Assemblase system and showing its effects effects on plant growth and development . Validation using IAA was also still valuable because the large size of the enzymes would allow us to make a preliminary inference that smaller enzymes would work well also. Applying Lotte’s advice on tissue culturing with aseptic techniques, we were able to more effectively conduct our future plant trials, but we also turned our attention to more commercially viable pathways as alternatives to IAA, which we could run in parallel (although this did"
