BOKU-Vienna,2017,Team:BOKU-Vienna#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," acts synergistically with ugi. emrR is a gene repressor for a number of different multidrug resistance pumps. The exact mechanism is unknown, but overexpression of emrR leads to a repression of those efflux pumps and therefore may lead to an increase of mutagenic pathway intermediates in the cell, increasing mutagenesis.
#1, #2 and #3 raise mutagenesis rates high enough, for E. coli to spontaneously evolve antibiotic resistances. If plated on several different antibiotics, under induction of the plasmids with arabinose, a portion of the cell population is supposed to survive with new resistances. This is what Heidelberg wants us to verify. Click here to read the protocol.

As a potential application, our project could help clean up microplastics from the environment.  Releasing GMOs and confronting the public with this topic bears several risks.  We found out that the Baltimore BioCrew is working on a similar topic, sharing the same difficulties and questions. A delegation of our team flew to Baltimore and setup a meeting with the BBC. After a constructive talk and some European strudel we decided to help the Baltimore team and set up a survey to gain an insight on the thoughts of the population.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#ProteinGAN_-_-_TEXT.html," different areas of importance across the entire sequence. There are 64 such filters in ProteinGAN and ReactionGAN implementations.
Figure 9: Source: (Zhang et al., 2018)
Spectrum normalization
One of the biggest issue then implementing GAN is the stability of the training. In practise a lot of GAN implementations suffer from diminishing (very small) or exploding (enormously big) gradients. In both cases GANs are not capable to learn patterns in data successfully. To mitigate this issue,  spectrum normalization technique  (Miyato et al., 2018) was used. It is regularization method to constrain the Lipschitz constant of the weights. It has been shown that it works successfully even for a large and complex datasets such as ImageNet (Brock, Donahue and Simonyan, 2018).
Mode collapse
Given original GAN formulation, there is nothing to prevent generator from generating a single, very realistic example to fool the discriminator. Such scenario is known as mode collapse. It happens when generator learns to ignore the input (random numbers). Logically, it is an efficient way for generator to start generating examples that could fool discriminator. However, it is not desirable behaviour and it eventually cripples the training as discriminator can easily remember generated examples. While working with proteins, we observed that this issue is even more severe in comparison to images. In scientific community, a lot of different approaches were proposed to address the mode collapse issue: Unrolled GAN (Metz et al., 2017), Dual Discriminator (Nguyen et al., 2017), Mini batch Discriminator (Salimans et al., 2016) to name a few. We preferred Mini Batch Discriminator approach due to its simplicity and minimal overhead. Mini Batch Discriminator works an extra layer in the network that computes the standard deviation across the batch of examples (batch contains only real, or only fake sequences). If the batch contains a small variety of examples standard deviation will be low and discriminator will be able to use this information to lower the final score for each example in the batch. ProteinGAN follows the approach proposed by authors of Progressively growing GAN (Karras et al., 2018).

Genes of the Color Pathway
The enzymes necessary to produce colored Escherichia coli colonies will be isolated from E. coli genomic DNA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cDNA. A total of eight enzymes are needed to produce FPP, after that we will make use of BioBrick I742152 and I742161 to make sure colonies will turn red. Other colors (orange and yellow also see the Edinburgh 2007 wiki ) can be produced by adding other enzymes. Of the eight enzymes we will isolate three are E. coli enzymes (atoB, idi and ispA), while the other five are S. cerevisiae enzymes (ERG8, ERG12, ERG13, MVD1 and HMG2).
The first gradient PCR have been performed on the genes, the E. coli genes all worked correctly (see lab notebook entry of August 19th ), while still some work has to be done on the S. cerevisiae primers ( August 20th ). The next step will be to PCR the E. coli genes again, with the ideal annealing temperature, using Pfx polymerase instead of Taq. The Pfx enzyme has proofreading and so is less likely to make a mistake within the genes. The gradient PCR on S. cerevisiae cDNA will be repeated and optimized.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html,": Table of reactions performed according to the DoE salt supplement surface response design. CFPS reactions contained concentrations of magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate, according to the table above. The pattern column shows how much of each supplement was present in a reaction; very low concentration (a), low concentration (â), usual concentration (0), high concentration (+), and very high concentration (A).
Experimental Procedure 2
Cell extracts were prepared and CFPS reactions performed as before, except the magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate concentrations were according to the surface response experimental design. Ammonium acetate was kept at the default amount. CFPS activity was measured as fluorescence at each time point minus fluorescence at 15 mins (Figure 7). Endpoint data was then used, along with the JMP software, to build a model predicting optimal concentrations for the three salts analysed (predictions visualised in figure 8). These predictions were then tested by preparing a supplement solution premix with amounts of magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate at concentrations of 6 mM, 195 mM, and 2 mM respectively. This supplement solution premix was used to supplement two batches of cell extract which were prepared identically. The first batch was the same extract used to collect data on which the predictions were made, whereas the second batch was newly prepared. It was found that for the first extract, CFPS activity was enhanced when the premix containing âoptimisedâ concentrations of salts was used compared to the un-altered supplement solution premix (Figure 9a). Additionally, CFPS activity was observed as being within the confidence intervals predicted by the DoE model. When CFPS reactions were performed using the second extract and the new premix, CFPS activity was lower compared to reactions using the second extract and the original premix (Figure 9b). This supports the view that each extract requires separate optimisation of the supplement solution premix to reach optimal CFPS activity, and that a DoE approach is suitable for achieving this.
Figure 7: CFPS activity of CFPS reactions with salt concentrations according to the surface response design (Table 3) was determined as fluorescence intensity at each time point minus fluorescence intensity at the 15 minute time point. Reactions 12 through 16 failed due to an error in set-up. These reactions were replicates of reactions 8-11 and their removal had little negative effect on the SRD according to the design diagnostics tool in JMP.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

DESCRIPTION
.
As seen in Figure 3 our construct produced a strong GFP signal, which ultimately proves that our expression system works as intended.
Insulin
Our experiments told us that our plasmid was a powerful tool, allowing us to conveniently assembling constructs in E. coli, which would be expressed in Y. lipolytica. Now we wanted to use it to take on the ultimate challange: Could we use this tool to produce proinsulin, and potentially increase the sustainability of insulin production?
Theory
Insulin is a peptrode hormone synthesised in the pacreas, and plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis and prevents harmful levels of sugar in the blood. Beta-cells in the islets of the pancreas release insulin to the blood stream, which stimulates muscle fat and liver cells to absorb and store glucose from the bloodstream by interacting with insulin-specific receptors 2 . Diabetes is caused by either immune-mediated destruction of pacreatic islet cells (type 1 diabetes), or pancreatic exhaustion causing insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes). Both types of diabetes is cured by artificially controlling the insulin concentration in the patient by injection 3 . The treatment of diabetes with insulin was discovered in 1921, and its ability to restore health is so dramatic, that it was initially described in terms such as ""the rising of the dead"". Considering this it perhaps does not come as a surprise that insulin is often described as one of the most important biomedical events of the last century 4 , and as the number of adults with diabetes is expected to rise from 415 million today to 642 million in 2040, the relevance of diabetes is higher than ever 6 . To read more about the insulin market, see our descriptions page .
Insulin biosynthesis
At the first stage insulin is synthesized as a chain of 101 amino acids, called preproinsulin with a molecular weight of 12 Kilo daltons (kDa), which comprises of signal peptide (pre-peptide) and three short chains: A, B and C. The pre-peptide, responsible for directing a nascent polypeptide, is removed from preproinsulin giving the proinsulin consisting of 86 amino acids with a molecular weight of 9.4kDa. Subsequently, the proinsulin is folded and two disulphide bonds are created between chain A and B and one links"

Integrated Human Practices
DR SZYMANSKI AND DR SCHYFTER
After coming up with a project idea and designing a way to test out our method, we decided it was time to start a discussion about whether or not our project had practical applications. Our first meeting was with Dr Erika Szymanski and Dr Pablo Schyfter of the University of Edinburghâs Science, Technology and Innovation Studies Department.
Their input really put our project into focus and laid down a track for the rest of our human practices. They told us that we were trying to target too many people with our DNA storage system and that we needed to be practical about who would actually use our product. As reading and writing data in DNA is slower than storing and retrieving something from a USB drive or even downloading a file from the internet, we needed to focus more on long-term, low access data storage. After this meeting we got in contact with local librarians and data experts.
Another takeaway point from the meeting was that up until this point we had not thought about the physical storage of our DNA. Were we planning on storing the DNA in some sort of time capsule that was only to be opened at certain times? Or were we going to focus on more practical and accessible storage of DNA in vials? We addressed this when we tested the viability of DNA in different storage conditions .
DR ANDY TURNER AND DR ADAM CARTER FROM ARCHER/EPCC
Following our meeting with Drs Szymanski and Schyfter, we set up a time to talk to Dr Turner and Dr Carter from ARCHER and EPCC. ARCHER is a supercomputer at the University that runs simulations and calculations that are too resource intensive to be performed on a regular computer. EPCC hosts ARCHER along with other computing and data facilities. Drs Turner and Carter have extensive experience with generating and storing large amounts of data.
Though very positive of our idea, they confessed that DNA data storage would not work best for them. The simulations and research"

Mainly focusing on the investigation of the properties and the future usages of the Tristable Switch, we did not have to release the bacterial chassis to the field. In the meantime, prioritizing safety of our project, we strictly followed all the instructions from the iGEM Headquarter and our school to avoid causing any potential risks.

Lethbridge,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html," Three finalists were chosen from 24 entrants that submitted business plans for the challenge. The winning plan came from the University of Lethbridge student researcher/entrepreneurs who form the Synbiologica Ltd. team.
This is the second win for the Synbiologca team, comprised of CEO Isaac Ward (3rd year, Neuroscience), first-year Biochemistry student Erin Kelly and Chemistry and Biochemistry masters students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon. They developed a new method of detecting hormones, which they expect will bring next-generation hormone detection to the research agriculture and medical market. They are in the process of patenting the the a biomedical device technology -- called âBiologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time"".
Not only did the group win $10,000 in the South Venture Business Plan Competition in March, they also took first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge. With that, came another $10,000, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect Centre for New Commerce (a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge), as well as a variety of other assistance, including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and thousands of dollars in media services.
Because the biomedical technology is in a patent phase, not many details can be released. However, it is designed to improve the way in which hormones are detected and provide more accurate information in a reduced time frame. The new technology also has the potential for a wide array of applications.
Quoting a U-of-L release, Ward stated the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
âThe internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,â Ward said. U of L teams have claimed several top international honours at past competitions, and three of the Synbiologica entrepreneurs are off to Boston Massachusetts, toward the end of June as advisors to the U of L's high school iGEM team. The university-level competition takes place in October, 2013 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, MA.
The Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge is an annual business planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region. The competition evaluates and awards business plans submitted by entrepreneurs who have taken advantage of the free business training provided by Community Futures across Southern Alberta.
On Wednesday, in Lethbridge, the Community Futures Lethbridge Region acknowledged the Synbiologica group for their win, and announced the additional winners of the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge. Outside"

-aminoacids.rtp
-ffnonbonded.itp
We add new information of lipid and dppc .
-dppc.itp
-lipid.itp
The new parameter cannot fit the set of Gromacs and its forcefield,and may lead to a non-integer charge.we generated a dummy-ion(ionptest) to balance the charge.
The dummy-ion has the mass of 1, and the charge as we set.

A 96-well plate was prepared with a column of 4 wells containing 100 Âµl 100% LUDOX and 4 wells containing 100 Âµl H2O. The absorbance 600 nm of all samples in all standard measurement modes of our plate reader was measured, and our Reference OD600 data was divided by our Abs600 data to get our correction factor. Data was converted to OD600 measurements through multiplication by our correction factor.
We created 200 Âµl of 2.5 ÂµM fluorescein stock solution and serially diluted it 1:2 with 1x PBS across plate columns 1-11. We then mixed 100 Âµl of fluorescein 5x stock solution with 100 Âµl of PBS in each well. Column 12 contained only 100 Âµl PBS buffer. This calibration plate was then measured in our plate reader under standard GFP settings and no path length correction to give us a standard measurement curve.
Cell Measurement Protocol
Inoculate 2 colonies per DNA sample on 5-10 ml LB + Chloramphenicol. Grow 16-18 hours at 37ËC and 220 rpm
Measure OD600 of overnight cultures
Dilute cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 in 10 ml 0.5x LB medium + Chloramphenicol and incubate at 37ËC and 220 rpm
Take 1% of total volume (100 Âµl) samples at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours of incubation
Place samples on ice and measure OD and Fl at the end of sampling point

USP-EEL-Brazil,2018,Team:USP-EEL-Brazil#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," in plastic packaging, a report was organized by the United Nations (UN) in 2010:
âIn light of uncertainties about the possibility of adverse human health effects at low doses of BPA, especially on reproduction, the nervous system and behavioural development, and considering the relatively higher exposure of very young children compared with adults, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) jointly organized an Expert Meeting to assess the safety of BPA.â (FAO; WHO, 2010, p. 7)
Even with inconclusive results, following this report and other studies from government organizations, several countries have now banned the manufacture of plastics containing Bisphenol-A. As well, a global demand for BPA-free products and packaging has started. In Brazil, the National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA) has banned, since 2012, the importation and manufacture of baby bottles containing Bisphenol A.
Existent Water Treatments
There is no legislation in force in Brazil regarding limit concentrations for endocrine disrupters in water, but it is still possible to see how alarming the concentrations found in water bodies are. Compared with the European Union proposed limit, which is 0.035 ng / L, most of the data found is well above this value and it is known that this contamination has a great possibility of worsening.
The major problem is that there is still no suitable method at Sewage and Water Treatment Stations that is fully effective in removing harmful amounts of estrogenic substances. In order to remove them, some processes are used:
â¢ Physical processes: membrane adsorption or filtration and ultra violet.
â¢ Chemical processes: advanced oxidative processes (ozone or peroxides), absorption by coal.
â¢ Biological processes: activated sludge and membrane bioreactors.
Although advanced oxidation techniques are very efficient, they cause environmental problems that have already been reported and, because of their toxicity content, are harmful to human health. A more effective solution, which has been well studied, is the application of processes involving the use of enzymes capable of degrading EDCs substances. One of the most viable alternatives to obtain and apply such enzymes is by biotechnological means.
Our Sollution
Why Laccase?
Laccase is a polyphenol oxidase enzyme found in many organisms, from plants and insects to fungi and microorganisms. Known as a green catalyst, helps in the cleavage of aromatic compounds and, due to its low degree of substrate specificity, this protein is effective in the oxidation of various compounds.

Furthermore, the apiary is subject to health constraints until the recovery plan has been ascertained. All the beekeeperâs instruments must be disinfected and sterilized.
For EFB:
Must be compulsorily notifiable to the Health Authority. It involves serious restrictive measures in accordance with the Veterinarian Police Regulation (DPR 8/2/1954, n.320). Differently, from the American foulbrood (AFB) regulation, the European foulbrood (EFB), has a less restricted regulation. In fact, the infected colonies must be distinguished in two different clusters related to their clinical picture:
Severely compromised colonies: In this case, the approach is the same as the one for AFB and it lies in destroying both the colony and the hive and in disinfecting and sterilizing the beekeeperâs instruments.
Not compromised colonies but with clinical signs: In this case, the âswarming techniqueâ is carried out to overcome the disease. It consists of:
Removing the infected combs from the hive.
Replacing the queen bee.
Adding adult bees from external healthy colonies.
Feeding bees with an appropriate nutrition.
Further practices suggested by the veterinarian in charge.
The apiary will be seized for at least 9 days and until the positive outcome of the treatment, in order to assess the efficacy of the âswarming techniqueâ. Anyway, also, in this case, the beekeeper can ask the destruction of all the affected colonies to the veterinarian authority.
In both the cases AFB and EFB, the use of antibiotics is not allowed in Italy because of its ineffectiveness and to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.
FAI emphasized a very important point that seems not only to apply in Italy but throughout the whole world: there are no different solutions to AFB and EFB diseases these days and the legislative tools are often perceived as repressive, so many beekeepers donât notify the infection in their apiary, destroying the infected colonies and concealing the fact. This is one of the most relevant problems for the health and statistical assessment studies.
After Mr. Della Morte learned about our project and the scopes of synthetic biology regarding beekeeping, he considered our proposal as a possibility of prevention method against the diseases. Our product would help beekeepers do not have to lose all their beehives and save money.
After the video call, Mr. Raffaele Cirone and his staff reflected on our project information and kindly sent us their final insights:

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," invited our coach, Prof. Zhu Xudong, to give us a keynote speech on the general idea of synthetic biology and iGEM. Later on, our core member presented some detailed information on the exciting iGEM experience and the composition of an iGEM team.
At recruitment campus event
After signing-up closed, we began our training session, which is carried out in a mentor-student system. Specifically, each core member of BNU-China 2017 is assigned 3-4 students matched according to the mentors' specialty and the students' interests. Students learn the required materials and supplementary ones listed on the syllabus. Mentors monitor the study pace of each student, answer their questions in the weekly meeting. Up to now, those, who had received trainings both by lectures and by our new mentor system, commented that they had gotten much more and much faster in this interactive system. In January and February, we plan on inviting several learned researchers and professors to give new iGEMers inspiring keynote speeches. Meanwhile, the training of lab techniques will start as well.
Destop Pet System
This year our theme is based on a Chines literature classic story named Pilgrimage to the West, in which the Monkey King is one of the main characters. To offer a more interactive experience, we created a desktop assistant system with the cute animated figure of the Monkey King. This system can react to simple instructions in natural languages and send back with related information on synthetic biology, iGEM, and our team. Besides, the animated Monkey King will send out warm greetings and farewells to the users upon opening and closing.
Sample dialogs with the desktop assistant system
Website and Posters
This is the fourth year since our university has joined in the iGEM community, whereas majority of our fellow students know little about this fantastic opportunity for fast personal growth. For the purpose of elevating the influence level of iGEM, we set up a website to exhibit the achievements of our past projects, to propagate the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM, and more importantly, to create a platform to document and share protocols, training videos and first-hand experiences for future reference.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," system in our yeast. We hope that we can have the chance to put our yeast into treating sewage one day, so the second thing we need to do is to put a detector in our yeast.
To solve this problem, we should come up with a method that allows people test   the content of heavy metal and when the concentrations are higher than the standard,   the settling process can be started. So we put promoter induced by copper into our   gene route, so that when the concentrations of copper are higher than the standard, the   gene route can start.This method is called RFP detection.
Things did not let us down, we went back to the sewage plant after we constructed our detector, the general manager met with us and listened to our feedback, and they were very glad that we had very interesting ideas. At the end of the day, they offered to have a long-term relationship with us, if we had any problems or need to put it on trial, they would be glad that we turn to them in the first minute. We were so amazed by the outcome that we decided to do more to perfect our project.
Tolerance issues: steel companies
Next, with our own ideas, we communicated with technical staffs from the   pollution department of Hebei Iron and Steel Group Wugang company, Henan Province.   (China's first base of thick steel plate production and scientific research. The   main bearing frame of The Nest, Chongqing Chaotianmen Bridge and The Shanghai   Central Building's are produced in this company). They led us to visit their cycle   industrial waste water treatment equipments and they told us that generally the   industrial wastewater was discharged to a sewage pool at first, then they would carry   out the treatment of heavy metal ions. General strain could not tolerant such heavy   metal concentration in industrial sewage, and the treatment using microbial required   oxygen and nutritional conditions. Therefore, we planned to improve the tolerance of   yeast and they agreed that if our strains could meet the requirements, they were   willing to make their sewage pool be our first batch of test.
However, the tolerance of natural yeast to copper ions and cadmium ions   conditions cannot be able to put into production. Improving the tolerance and   competitiveness of yeast to heavy metals is a necessary condition for our   project.
Improving the growth of yeast in high concentrations of heavy metal ions is the   a key part of the application in production. We choose the cre-loxp system to rapidly   evolve Saccharomyces cerevisiae to improve its resistance to copper and cadmium   ions. The cre-loxp system utilizes the"

â¡The safety of synthetic biology
International Risk Governance Council claims  that the risks caused by synthetic biology include:
(1) environmental risks,  such as bio-security;
(2) social risks;
(3) economic risks, such as  intellectual property rights;
(4) the theoretical risks, such as natural or  unnatural products. Although synthetic biology allows we human beings to  respond to many aspects of challenges such as the global energy and  environment, its development and application process involves different levels  of security risk, which brings considerable social concern and worries.
Our survey results
To investigate the condition of synthetic  biology, we made a survey on the internet. The results show that faced with  safety issues of synthetic biology, 40.37% people indicate that they would follow scientific principles to  support the development of synthetic biology. 55.28% people support  precautionary principle, emphasizing the necessity to improve the supervision  mechanism. 4.35% showed an attitude that they do not care the safety problem,  they will use as long as they can be applied to life. As for whether should  people take part in the supervision and management of biological technology,  78.88% people answered âYesâ, 21.12% people disagree, they hold the opinion  that people are so lack of relevant biological knowledge that they cannot have  a comprehensive understanding of science.
So we can see, a large number of people have the  desire to monitor the safety of synthetic biology. But itâs obvious that in the  management of synthetic biology, ordinaryÂ people make up too small parts  now. How to solve this contradiction? Our IGEM team had a heated discussion on  this issue. First of all, our government  and educational institution should promote the education and publicity of synthetic biology, to make more  people know what is synthetic biology and what does it do. Second, when a  synthetic biology product accesses to theÂ market, the producer must show basic principles and security of the"

CURLIÂ 
OVERVIEWÂ 
This year, we are developing a project which utilizes three orthogonal connection systems to detect enzyme-catalyzed reaction products qualitatively and quantitatively. To make the enzyme complex and our detection device (which is an interdigital electrode) connected, we choose the curli system of E. coli to create a functional nanofiber network to serve as a mediator.
Introduction
It has been proved that enzymes can be used in purified form. And the biocatalysis is a high efficient and environmental friendly manner which has great potential in industry. However, its production efficiency is limited by low mass transport stemming from hindered diffusion of the substrate or product across the cell membrane. Thus we do need an approach that optimally combines the criteria of high surface area, enhanced enzyme stability, rapid mass transport, and modularity. It had been elusive until the researchers from Harvard University developed a protein immobilization platform that modifies curli nanofibers, the amyloid fiber component of E. coli biofilms, with a peptide domain that can covalently capture proteins. [1]
According to the article published in 2015, [1] the process of the biofilm functionalization with enzymes through the covalent modification of curli fibers is showed in Picture 1. First, E. coli expresses CsgA fused to the 13 amino acid SpyTag (CsgA-ST), which self-assembles into curli fibers on the surface of the bacterium (A). Then it was covalently modified with an enzyme fused to SpyCatcher (B). Finally, substrate to product catalysis occurs on the high surface-area catalytic fibers (C).

Sexual differentiation is the most common and natural phenomenon in multicellutar organism, Usually, two gendersâ combination through fertilization is essential for their proliferation. However, in the most primitive organisms, no sexual differentiation existed. With the evolution from protist to metazoan such as animals, definite sexual differentiation came into being. So, there is a question that when and how sexual differentiation happened. The special F factor in E. coli enables its gene communication and determination of the sex what we defined as âfemaleâ and âmaleâ. Though this kind of gene communication is not genuinely sexual differentiation, we could make a hypothesis that the F factor is the transitory stage to true sexual differentiation. So we want to imitate sexual differentiation in unicellular organism to help us understand the process of sexual differentiation. We believe that this imitation would be very"

Customer Discovery - Has the team interviewed a representative number of potential customers for the technology and clearly communicated what they learned?
The Synsketch is aimed to help university students who participate in IGEM competition or those who have the basic knowledge about synthetic biology and hope to design a genetic circuit within minutes. In order to understand the needs and problems of the target customers, SKLBC-GDSYZX team held a science festival in Guangdong Experimental High School and had a meet-up session with the other four teams from Sunyatsen University and South China University of Technology. During meet-up session, our team introduces the project and listens to other teamsâ projects and their problems during the experiment process. Most importantly, our team interviewed a student from South China University of Technology and discussed the difficulties they had during preparation for iGEM competition. It was obvious that experiment teams and software teams should establish a close relationship and that our project will help experiment teams solve some current problems and satisfy their needs.
Based on their interviews, does the team have a clear hypothesis describing their customersâ needs?
According to the interviewees, there are three learning periods: basic teaching which requires a time-saving tool that is easy to learn and to use, learning engine that needs a good interaction between users"

Abstract
Among natural materials, silk fibers boast unparalleled strength and elasticity. This has made silk ideal for use in apparel, medical sutures, and other high-performance materials. The unique profile of silk arises from the composition of its repetitive protein domains, which varies between species. We aimed to program the physical properties of synthetic silk in two ways: by modularizing spider silk genes and tuning their properties through directed assembly, and by fusing accessory proteins to silkworm and honey bee silks to expand their functionality. To overcome the challenge of creating large, repetitive, GC-rich genes, we adapted Iterative Capped Assembly to ligate spider silk genes in specific ratios, orders, and lengths. The recombinant silks were expressed in E. coli then spun via standard wet spinning. This provides a platform for standardizing the customization of synthetic silk fibers, and exploring their potential as multipurpose biomaterials.
Projects
Customizing Silk
Modifying the genetic structure of silk can create a diverse new range of biomaterials.
We have adapted a novel cloning technique called iterative capped assembly (ICA) to rapidly and controllably assemble spider silk genes.  Our new process will dramatically shorten the time and expense needed to assemble these repetitive parts.  Click here to learn more.
Functionalizing Fibers
By attaching various proteins, we can create silk with specific applications.
Glowing silk is an idea that appeals both to the scientific and artistic worlds. It is a proof of concept for the scientists, demonstrating how we are able to functionalize silk fibers with novel peptides, and an interesting new material to work with for the artists. This method can be applied to different kinds of proteins with different functions as well, but every idea has to start small. To see how we attached GFP to our silk constructs, click this"

Texas Meetup
UT Austin
Franconia
Synthetic biology, being multidisciplinary and collaborative by nature, necessitates continual exchange of ideas and knowledge. Given our standing as a relatively new iGEM team, interaction and discussion with fellow researchers is of utmost importance to the development of our projects. Knowing this, we attended the annual Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium (FURS) held by the University of Texas at Austin this past September. iGEM teams from both UT Austin and Rice University were also in attendance. In addition to the symposium, the Texas iGEM teams had a meetup to begin collaboration, sharing of ideas, and improvement of presentation skills. Each of the teams gave mock presentations in preparation for the Jamboree and received feedback. Additionally, we discussed our projects, judging criteria, and current and future collaboration opportunities. It was a great honor to meet fellow iGEM teams and we are hoping to build upon the connections made at this event in the years to come.
The 2017 UT Austin iGEM team tested out a number of electroporation protocols, some of which they had some difficulty getting to work. Their team asked the Texas Tech 2017 iGEM team to test one of the protocols, Speer 2012, to see if the issue might fall in the protocol itself or their execution. The following is the Speer 2012 protocol and how it was followed. Materials Â· MRS media Â· Glycine Â· Millipore water Â· 50mM EDTA solution Â· Plasmids: pMSP3535 and pBTK519 Day One 1. Inoculate 5ml MRS medium with L. plantarum freezer stock 2. Grow overnight at 30Â°C without shaking Day Two 3. Add 1.25g glycine to two flasks of 50ml MRS medium 4. Shake to dissolve 5. Add 1ml overnight culture to each flask (1:50 dilution) 6. Culture for ~3 hours at 37"
EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"NA interaction, we can justify this hypothesis by thinking of an average nucleotide composition, as our synthetic sequences are randomly generated
dCas9 degradation is a fundamental process in our system.  Since high levels of dCas9 are toxic for the cell [3], a constantly varying dCas9 population is required for a signal to propagate from one gate to another (remember, the output of a gate is a gRNA which will bind to a free dCas9 in order to propagate the signal to the next gate). We can imagine two different types of degradation for the dCas9-gRNA complex : degradation of the whole complex and degradation of the gRNA's targeting sequence (resulting in a non-functional but occupied dCas9). We will neglect the last possibility since information about such mechanism are laking and because RNA bound to dCas9 is quite stable. In addition, we assumed that this degradation rate of the whole complex is the same of gRNA-free dCas9.
dCas9 and GFP degradation are slow. For these proteins we will take into account only the dilution, i.e. the concentration diminution caused by cell division.
In our project, the dCas9-gRNA complex is used as a transcription factor. It may alternatively  activate or inhibit a targeted promoter. Activation and inhibition processes are modeled using fist-order Hill functions: the Hill function is interpreted as the probability of our dCas9-gRNA complex being bound to the promoter [1]. In order to use this approach, we assume implicitly that the number of dCas9-gRNA binding sites is much smaller than the number of dCas9-gRNA present in our system. In addition, since the binding dynamics of two dCas9 to adjacent binding sites on the same promoter is not know, we developed a generalized version of Hill's model in order to include dCas9/dCas9 interaction; we will consider only the two extrema of this model which are zero or infinite interaction strength.
Summary
Concentrations depend only on time due to instantaneous diffusion
dCas9 binding/unbinding is not dependent on the gRNA's sequence
For dCas9 and GFP, \(\gamma_\text{degradation}\ll\gamma_\text{dilution}\)
The intracellular number of promoters is constant over time
Promotor strength is modeled by an Hill's function, with an Hill's coefficient close to one
dCas9-gRNA unbinding is very slow, such that \(D_\text{dCas9}\ll 1\)
dCas9/dCas9 interaction strength is either zero or infinite

January
After the team had been assembled, several informal meetings were held. During these, introductions were made between team members, allowing everyone to get to know each other. Additionally, talks with previous iGEM team members allowed the team to gain important information and guidance on how to approach the project.
Each member of the team gave a brief presentation on an iGEM 2012 project. The projects strengths, weaknesses and approach to each section were discussed. Medical themed projects were favoured among the majority of the team.
February
Initial thoughts regarding project ideas were put forward. A speed discussion of ideas took place for brainstorming and basic development of ideas. The following ideas were favoured and put forward as possible project candidates:
â¢ Weight control yoghurt
â¢ Anti-cancer yoghurt
â¢ Zebrafish water cleaning system for Third World
â¢ Athletic Drug testing
â¢ Clean Urban Air
â¢ Neural network with glowing bacteria and fibre optics
DIY SynBio group at The Arts Catalyst were visited for feedback on the project ideas. Posters which the team had created for the group were set up within the space in order to generate feedback from members of the public during SynBio workshops. Overall the anti-cancer yoghurt idea was favoured by the majority of public and previous iGEM candidates. In general the public found the medical projects more appealing, partly because they tried to solve tangible problems that could not be mitigated soley by 'electrical' or 'mechnaical' technologies. The 'neural networks' idea gathers interest with scientists at Cancer Reserach UK and members of the public alike because applying synethtic biology to study neuroscience seems both innovative and relatively original. The zebrafish idea gathered interest due to the novel chassis. The remaining ideas did not generate as much interest as they tend to be common themes amongst iGEM team projects.
March
Final meetings before exams, both internally and at the Arts Catalyst. In the meantime we had taken on board our feedback, and took the best ideas from each of the most popular project to come up with a new idea that combined tackling a medical condition, with neuroscience, with using a novel chassis in an Alzheimer's disease project. The idea pool has now been narrowed down to:
â¢ Anti-cancer yoghurt
â¢ Zebrafish
â¢ Alzheimer's disease"

a) W1: aptamer;
b) W2: 24nt complementary chain with a 9nt complementary part;
c) W3: 24nt complementary chain with a 10nt complementary part;
d) W4: Aptamer + 24nt complementary chain with a 9nt complementary part;
e) W5: Aptamer + 24nt complementary chain with a 10nt complementary part.
We could find that there were three distinct bands between the aptamer + complementary strands with a 10nt complementary part (W5), while 9nt did not. The lane 1 and 2 acted as markers, so we could clearly identify the positions of the aptamers and complementary strands in the three bands. The last band, obviously, was the result of an increase in molecular weight, which meant that the aptamer and the complementary strand combined together successfully.
Therefore, we have proved that the aptamer could combine with its complementary strand successfully.
The competition (Fluorescence Spectrometer)
We used the competition method to transfer molecular signal, because we considered that the competition method was best operated automatically later, so that users did not need to have a deep understanding toward technical basis. Therefore, it's quite important for us to verify that EpCAM could compete successfully, from a theoretical prospective to support our hardware and the activation of Cas12a as well.
Below are the exact procedures of our experimental group. First, we successfully hatched the streptavidin beads, biotin-modified aptamers and fluorescent complementary strands to form the complexes, then fixed the beads with magnets and discarded the supernatant, which would still contain fluorescent complementary strands that did not form complexes. After that, we incubated the complexes with EpCAM to achieve the process of competition.
Additionally, considering the non-specific adsorption, we set up several control groups, and the variables amongst them were replaced by buffer. After competition, we fixed the magnetic beads with magnet, then extracted the supernatant and added 3 mL incubation buffer in tandem. Below is the plot about the fluorescence intensity detected in different groups. Get more information of our experiment, click here.

Throughout the last couple of months, we realized that iGEM is much more than a                         competition. During the iGEM season, we had the opportunity to meet people from all around the                         world and work together to overcome the obstacles that surged during the development of our                         projects. But we did not want our relationship with the other teams to be based only on serious                         technicalities, which is why we organized and participated in several activities to share all                         the iGEM love!
Latin American MeetUp
While working on a project it is essential to receive feedback from experts and teams working in                         the same area to improve your work. Thus, we reached out to all Latin American teams for them                         to assist our Meetup, held on July 13th of the present year. We got the participation of 8                         teams, these being teams from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Tec-Chihuahua, Tec Monterrey and                         TecMonterrey_GDL. Throughout the event, the members and representatives of each team had the                         opportunity to present their project. These presentations were divided, some of them were                         online and the other ones were face to face. The experts asked a series of questions making the                         students aware of possible mistakes.
After the presentations, we had the opportunity to meet the other teams and interact with them.                         With this activity, we had the chance to participate and encourage collaborations between the                         teams.
Thanks to this event, we were able to analyze the obstacles of our project and found other                         alternatives and implement them. Thereâs no doubt that the feedback provided by the                         specialists was crucial for the proper development of the projects, and beyond the                         scientific issues, we were able to"

If the sensor responds in the presence of other metal ions, it will bring deviation to the experimental results. So it is necessary to repeat the specificity experiment of sensors to verify the correctness of the data from papers.â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our questionnaire also included part of the public acceptance of engineering bacteria.
The Public Acceptance of Engineering Bacteria
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Laying stress on the drinking water safety, 94% of respondents said they were willing to use convenient testing tools to detect heavy metals concentration in nearby water source.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In âhow do you think of genetically modified bacteria (non pathogenicity) used to detect contaminantsâ, 92% of respondents accepted and supported these applications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â But there were still a few respondents who were not able to accept biological methods, mainly because of the existence of biological safety problems. Therefor we invited Professor Zhaozheng Guo from BGI to come to school and set up a lecture on biological safety ethics, hoping to improve public acceptance of bioassay.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The problems above showed that cheap, fast and portable biological methods for detecting heavy metals in water or soil were of great interest to the public and small and medium-sized factories.

Mytilus edulis has the ability to bind to a very broad range of materials, ranging from glass, plastics, metals, wood and Teflon to biological materials, such as biological tissues, organisms, and other chemical compounds or molecules. As  a result, the adhesive abilities of mussels have been an inspiration for the production of the synthetic version of this biological glue.
The mussel attached by its byssus threads (Powel, 2009)
How do mussels attach?
Mussels use a rather flexible method to attach to a surface; they spin a set of threads from an internal muscle to the surface, also known as stem. (Waite, 1983) (Waite,1992) The treads are 2 to 4 cm in length and attach to the surface by the use of plaques (diameter 2-3 mm).  Thus, this plaque connects the substrate and the byssal thread. The specific adhesion is determined by the number of threads, which can go up to 30 to 50 threads per mussel. This will lead to a total attachment strength up to 400N.  The plaque is divided into three sections. The first part is a pre-coating adhesive layer, which can attach to the surface. On top of this, the byssal threads are anchored in an open, cellular structure. (Benedict & Waite, 1986) The overall protection layer is formed by a âvarnishâ, which protects against enzymatic and chemical degradation. (Rzepecki & Waite, 1995)
The foot of the mussel (Haemers, 2003 )
Formation of the plaque and bysall threads
As well as the plaque as the threads are built of proteins, which are produced in the musselâs foot. In the musselâs foot there is a very complex organ with different types of glands of muscles. In a special part (the ventral groove), the thread and plaque are formed. (Pujol, 1967) This ventral groove runs over the whole foot and can be sealed off from the environment if required. (Waite, 1992) The foot can be bend in such a direction, that the ventral groove contacts the substrate.
In the sixties it was shown that as well as the thread as the plaque is formed by the interaction of secretions from three different kind of cells located in the foot. (Pujol, 1967) There are three specific regions in the foot where the different cell types are"

They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5Î± for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

- Transformations of DH5a and BL21 resulted in 3 lawns and no growth. A replate was necessary, and they were streaked out.
- Performed additional transformation of all the following into DH5a: pBAD+control eYFP, pBAD+PUF eYFP, ptet+control eYFP, ptet+PUF eYFP.

- Both the TB cultures were successful. However, one of the normal K12 innoculations did not grow.
- Therefore, made two more TB cultures using just the K12 innoculation which worked.
- In addition, prepared CM and Amp plates for future use.
- Replates of pBAD with control/PUF eYFP in both DH5a and BL21 all had growth. However, BL21 cells looked translucent and flat. Inoculated all of the plates. No growth on transformations of the DH5a pBAD/ptet YFP constructs, so replated all of them. Checked resistance of ptet, and it's Cm, not Amp.
- Started biobricking PUF WT.
- Ran two PCR reactions with hotstart mix at 61 and 63 degrees C.
- Ran gel of PUF PCR samples done in May, bands looked to be the correct size. Gel extracted all five samples.
- Inoculated PSB1C3 overnight culture.
6/28/2012
- Made the M9 Media.
- The TB cultures from the K12 innoculations were successful.
- Currently, all cultures that we plan to use are in the 4 degree room. We will not take further action on the production protocol until we have received the C15 alkanes and Dr. Jin is back.
- We have all the materials to start the production media culture, but we will need Dr. Jin's guidance on the extraction method as well as GCSM analysis as the last steps of the protocol happen rather immediately. We will wait until next week to finish it up.
- Digestions of BBa_K157005 and pETDuet-1 seemed to have worked. However, the gel showed the split-gfp band at 300bp even though it was expected to be ~250bp.

Question 4
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Teams should strictly abide by regulations of the laboratory. Characters and functions of parts ,devices and systems should be documented in detail online so that they could be referred to if in need. Thus it could be safer.

FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," familiarize ourselves with all iGEM standards. Team Marburg hosted the German meetup, so we decided to attend to get new ideas and perhaps some help. After the meetup, many teams offered us advice but we worked especially closely with team Marburg. Team Marburg and us designed a âgame of cellsâ and chose to stay in contact.
Planning this yearâs project, we thought about acquiring a high-quality biofilm and remembered a key detail from Marburgâs last yearâs project: Curlis. So we asked our friends if they could send us the E. coli strain W3110 and their BioBrick pPickUp encoding CsgA, a part of Curlis. As this wouldnât be enough, CsgA was tagged with a SpyTag â part of our own last iGEM project. Perfect teamwork!
Thanks to team Marburg for sending us the constructs and the E. coli strain W3110!

Supposing, again, the complex formation CII in balance:
Although,
Therefore,
This way the speed of Hg2+ uptake to the cell interior, supposing only merT function, is given by:
Finally, the absolute Hg2+ uptake from bacteria on intervals 0 until a general time T is given by the integration of the equation above:
Similarly, it is for exclusive function of merC or merF:
Now considering the reduction process of Hg2+ into Hg0, we have the general equation:
Supposing the balance for complex CV formation:
Finally, the mercury ion reduction speed is given by the expression:
The quantity of reduced mercury on time 0 until a general time T is given by:
BIOSENSORING
On our project, experiments related to biosensoring are based on the idea of allowing bacteria growth of our construction (RTP + GFP) in medium containing different mercury concentrations and, by this, analyze fluorescence levels derived from GFP protein expression.
In order to simplify, weâre considering that Hg2+ uptake is mediated only by merT transporter, by the following equation:
Considering that Hg2+ is a GFP transcription factor, we assume that the transcriptional mRNA activation speed is given by:
mRNA transcription rate is given by:
And finally, GFP synthesis rate in function of mRNA ratees:
Beside the model values to quantify GFP cell production, itâs necessary to study models to quantify photonsâ emission by GFP. Photons emissionâs rate equation is given by the function of the constants, that are quantum yield (Î±), medium volume (V), Avogrado number (A) and GFP synthesis rate.
Photons emission rate is given by the equation:
Although,  it is already known, GFP formation rate in function of mercury uptake rates and mRNA transcription rate from Hg2+ transcription factor, so, we have:
Photons production rate is directly proportional to light intensity measured by the spectrofluorometer, which measures the experiment data.
To know how many photons are released in a given time T, it is just necessary to do:
For better comprehension and organization of the mathematics modeling, each experimental situation of our will be analyzed separately: Biosensoring , Bioaccumulation e Bioremediation .

We use the GFP data for the factors concentration and time. Data was provided for specific experiments and we plotted the graphs for time vs concentration.
From this plot we infer that the equation that fitted our model would be and exponential equation. We transferred the data to the"

On this page, we offer our unique protocols to the public.
Because Bacillus subtilis is our choice organism, we have focused on protocols specifically for Bacillus.
However below , you will also find other standard protocols we use.
Protocols for the work with B. subtilis
1. Growth, storage, media and components for Bacillus subtilis
This protocol gives the basic growth- and storage conditions, and the recipes for various media and the antibiotic concentrations used for B. subtilis.
2. Transformation of Bacillus subtilis
Protocol for the transformation of B. subtilis.
3. Isolation of chromosomal DNA from Bacillus subtilis for transformation
A quick protocol for how to isolate genomic DNA from B. subtilis to transform it to a different strain. By this means, you can very easily combine different B. subtilis genotypes. Transformation of genomic DNA is much more efficient than plasmids. Isolated DNA with this protocol is not clean!
4. Bacillus subtilis vectors
How to work with integrative B. subtilis vectors and how to verify the integration.
5. Isolation of chromosomal DNA from Bacillus subtilis (for PCR....)
Isolation of pure genomic DNA from B. subtilis.
6. Long Flanking Homology PCR
PCR protocol for long flanking homology PCR. You might need those PCR products for interrupting genes with resistance cassettes.

Mass action kinetics
Mass action kinetics is the assumption that the rate of reaction is proportional to concentration of the reactants. We chose to create a mass action kinetics model as we could use relatively few parameters. Reducing the number of parameters, whilst keeping the model representative of the system, made it easier to understand the effect of varying each parameter. We built the model in MATLAB first, and later ported it to JavaScript to make it a better design tool for the biologists and better communicate how the model works.
Graph interactivity
We spent a long time reviewing previous teams models. A problem we found was that most models werenât communicated in a way that was engaging and easy to understand. Weâve tried to explain our model in a way that someone with no experience in modeling could understand.
Weâve used interactive graphs on this page - when you get to them you can drag the sliders to change parameters and see how they affect the system.
We initially ported our model to a webpage so the design team could try out new stuff when they were designing our toehold switches. This turned out to be very useful for both of us. We decided to make it look a lot nicer and improve its compatibility with different browsers so we could put it on the wiki.

The Advisors
Marc âMC.AMMERâ Ammerlaan has been an iGEM advisor for 4 years. When Marc isnât watching Van Persieâs 2014 World Cup header over and over again he teaches Introduction to Biology Lab, Introduction to Microbiology Lab and Genetics at the University of Michigan. Marc has been essential in boosting the team's confidence when our project and experiment hit a brick wall. He is also known to comfort our team members with pizza  when we are spending late nights working on the wiki. Spirit Animal: Lion
Anuj Kumar is a team advisor and faculty member in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology here at Michigan where he has become a yeast guru. Known across campus for his Genetics course, Anuj is a die hard Detroit Tigers Fan and uses his old tickets as wallpaper for his office. After years of working on cellular processes in yeast, our team members can attest he is quite the FUN-GUY.
Our teamâs medaled veteran, Mike Ferguson is a walking encyclopedia of iGEM knowledge and wisdom. When searching for the protocol for a double digest, one has to look no further than Mike for the correct procedure. One look in his eyes, and you know the correct amounts of enzyme, DNA, buffer, and water. When all hope is lost, he will venture to the deepest and darkest places of the Undergraduate Science Building to help you find gels, dyes, enzymes, platesâ¦ and courage. His interests lay in the magical realm of regenerative medicine, aspiring to develop organs and therapies to extend human life, but he always finds time to help those in need of basic molecular biology techniques. Mike, we salute you. Spirit animal: Tardigrade

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," statistical inference to estimate the parameters from the experimental data. In short that means calculating P(Î¸|Ä); the probability of the model parameters, given the experimental data. We estimated this distribution from the experimental data and the mean and variance of each parameter could be calculated as:
(2)
The posterior probability P(Î¸|Ä) was calculated using Bayes theorem:
(3)
where the probability of the data P(Ä) is a normalization constant, the prior P(Î¸) describes your expectations of the model parameters before observing any data and the likelihood P(Ä|Î¸) is the probability of the data given the parameters.
The likelihood is a function of the product concentration  C(KM,Vmax,S0,t) calculated from the Michaelis-Menten model. We modelled the deviation between the experimentally measured concentrations  and model product concentration C as independent and identically normally distributed at every time-point. This gave us the likelihood
(4)
where Ï is the standard deviation of the normal distribution describing the deviation between the data and the model. With a flat prior (a uniform prior where all model parameters are equally likely before observing any data) the posterior P(Î¸|Ä) can simply be written as
(5)
(6)
where Z is a normalization constant.
To estimate the mean and variance of our four model parameters we calculated the integrals in equation 2 and 3, i.e., numerically integrating the likelihood L(Î¸) over the four dimensions of the parameters. It is a problem that is very numerically complex if L(Î¸) is to be evaluated for all values of Î¸. Therefore, we implemented a version of importance sampling, where we only evaluate L(Î¸) were it is large enough to contribute to the integral. We start at the maximum likelihood set of parameter Î¸max (found by SSD fitting) where L(Î¸) is maximized and take discrete steps in Î¸ until L(Î¸) is essentially 0. Therefore we do not have to compute L(Î¸)  for all values of Î¸, but only at the values that actually contribute to the integral. A visual of this is displayed in figure 6. We saved the values of L(Î¸) of all these points in four dimensional parameter space and the marginalized distribution for the individual parameters could then be calculated. For example for KM.
(7)
The mean and error estimate of KM and the other parameters  was then obtained by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the marginalized distribution. A plot of the marginalized distribution for each parameter can be seen in"

Results
We did both agar assay and capillary assay to detect the response of E.coli to different attractants and different concentrations of each attractant. Because the agar assay (Fig.3) is difficult to replicate and collect the data from, we just show the results of capillary assay (Fig.4) . We made a negative control using washing buffer and five concentration gradients (100mM/10mM/1mM/0.01mM/0.0001mM) of attractants. These E.colis were divided into three groups based on the plasmid they have been transformed into. The plasmids are biobricks, BBa_K608003 and BBa_K515102 (they are from 5A and 8F wells in plate1), and the McfR plasmid was designed by us. BBa_K608003 (5A) only has a strong promoter and medium RBS, so it doesnât have specific chemotaxis towards TCA intermediates. BBa_K515102 (8F) is a biobrick from 2011_Imperial_College_London, which responds to L(-)malic acid (HO2CCH2CH(OH)CO2H).
Fig.3 Agar assay: The three plates shows the chemotaxis results of 8F towards three kinds of attractants, malate, citrate and succinate from left to right. The filter paper of attractants is put on the left, the PBS is put on the right, bacteria is in the middle. Here, 8F swims fastest to malate.
Fig.4 E. coliâs ability of chemotaxis towards different concentrations of succinate or malate.
The cells were diluted 20000 times. 5A is a control which doesnât have chemotaxis towards malate or succinate.
Malate: McfR showed the strongest respond. The tendency of curve of 8F was biphasic with maximums at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and 10-5 M, while the tendency of curve of McfR was biphasic with maximums at attractant concentration of about10-2 M and 10 -7 M. Both of them reached minimum at attractant concentration of about 10 -1 M, the number of cells decreased slowly with attractant concentration decreasing for 8F and McfR. There was a significant difference among test and control (p < 0.05),"

The toxicity issues that arise when trying to express this fungal enzyme in E. coli can explain why no previous attempt to characterise the part recorded in the registry have been successful. Further characterisation of this toxicity, as well as attempting to troubleshoot it, could involve the subcloning of the part into a low-expression vector.
The inability to characterise the decolourising abilities of Lignin Peroxidase made us look towards a bacterial alternative; Bacillus subtilis dye-decolorising peroxidase. This enzyme, described in literature as the bacterial equivalent of lignin peroxidase due to the similarity of their mechanisms was cloned successfully, and the data regarding its toxicity and ability to decolorise azo-dyes is developed below.
Characterisation of BsDyP
After having confirmed that Reactive Black 5 and Acid Orange 7 are not toxic and have no effect of E. coli DH5Î± in a wide range of concentrations, it was determined whether the dye-decolorizing BioBrick BsDyP BBa_K1336003 affected E. coli growth performance, both in standard LB medium and in media contaminated with RB5 and AO7 sulphonated azo-dyes.
This was carried out by measuring bacterial OD at 680nm at regular intervals of 1 hour, in the different media. The choice of wavelength aims to reduce to a minimum the interference caused by the strong absorption of the dyes, while still measuring bacterial density. Although high-concentration RB5 still shows an absorption much higher than the other samples, the curve is preserved and so it allows to analyse how the presence of dyes might interfere with bacterial growth. The full protocol for this assay can be found here
Figure 2 - BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module preserves growth performance of E.coli DH5Î± in LB media. Graph showing that E.coli transformed with the BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module shows comparable growth the plasmid-free control in LB media. OD measured at 680nm and Time is shown in hours after incubation. Error bars indicate SEM, n=2.

2. Collaboration
Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way.
Â Â Â Â Â We worked in collaboration with NTHU_Formosa. We confirm the parts of NTHU_Formosa team. We did DNA electrophoresis to confirm the size of inserted vectors which are essential in the process of emitting the light. Also, we share the basic concept of designing websites and make them more familiar with web languages. For NTHU_Formosa team, they ran an SDS-PAGE of our bacteriocins to help us check if our constructs were correctly expressed.
(Collaboration)
3. Human Practices
Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world.
Â Â Â Â Â To make our project more complete, we asked for many suggestions of professors and government agricultural improvement institute to learn more about the dosage of fertilizer farmer used. Also, we explore the possibilities of our solutions and the problems we may face.

4. Characterization / Contribution
Successfully complete the InterLab Measurement Study. This means you have met all requirements of the InterLab Measurement Study, including acceptance of data.
Â Â Â Â Â The purpose of InterLab experiment is to standardize measurement techniques to make the data from synthetic biology laboratories around the world easier to compare with. This year, we focus on converting the fluorescence readings to absolute cell counts instead of relying on O.D. measurements since O.D. measurements usually vary from lab to lab. We calibrate and measure the value to complete the experiment.

[ Yes / No ]
[ This is the common Method article of participating universities of âiGEM Japan Human Practiceâ( KIT-Kyoto , Kyoto , Osaka , Tokyo_Metropolitan , and UT-Tokyo ).iGEM Kyoto has the responsibility for the wording. ]
Results
We drove this survey from July to September 26th.
All data: HumanPractice.xls
Our result is too much to write all on this page. So we write only graphs on this page and upload all result data. We analyzed mainly following points.
compare between arts and science(*) in college student
compare between ""genetic engineering"" and ""biotechnology""
compare between people with different jobs
compare between college student and the others
(*)In Japan, classification of arts and science is important. Most Japanese students study different subjects since high school due to the classification, because it is a big factor to decide the subjects required in the entrance examination for universities or colleges. This is the reason we predicted that there might be some differences between arts and science.

After the last Gibson reaction we have get red colonies that should correspond to bacteria transformed with pSB1C3-RFP (which should be impossible after the gel migration and purification). So we analyzed the content of the gel extraction and we saw that the tube only had linearized backbone. About pDawn III PCR 2, the migration of 5 Âµl from the gel extraction of PCR products have shown that there is not a high quantity of DNA material, not enough for a Gibson assemblyâ¦

Â Â Â Â However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
Â Â Â Â  Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
Â Â Â Â Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
Â Â Â Â  In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
Â Â Â Â The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
Â Â Â Â  In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2Â·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
Â Â Â Â  There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock"

Oscillation
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To describe the single-period oscillation system in a better and more precise way, we measured pluxR promoterâs response states towards AHL of different concentration. By using PCR and one step cloning, we removed luxl gene (fig1a, fig1b), and thus the plasmid, pTD103luxI-sfGFP, was mutant. In this way, we excluded its interference to our experiment.
figure 1a
figure 1b
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â After removing luxl gene, we combined the plasmid with its specific binding inducer and conducted PCR. The results verified that we had successfully removed luxl gene in structure. After comparing the results being induced by no AHL and AHL of  10^-6M, we verified we had successfully removed luxl gene in function. Also, it had the corresponding AHL and the ability to express sfGFP. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We did inducement experiment after constructing pluxR-sfGFP circuit. We designed a gradient from 10^-6 to 10^-11M. After a night of inducement, we harvested the cell and resuspended in PBS (pH=7.2). Also, we did two parallel experiments for each gradient, and measured the fluorescence intensity. Following is the relational graph of fluorescence intensity and the concentration of AHL (fig2).
Figure 2
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We used hyperbolic curve to analyze the result. We found that pluxR began to be activated when the concentration of AHL was about 10^-9M, and began to saturate when AHL was about 10^-6M. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We have figured out the relationship between pluxR and AHL, and our next step was inserting single-period oscillation system into MG1655, verifying the oscillation system. After being cultivated for a whole night, the co-transformation bacteria was transferred into the 100 ml LB medium with the proportion of 1:1000. When reaching OD0.1, we took out 1ml sample every 10 minutes, diluting to the same OD value and measuring the fluorescence intensify. Following is the result (fig3).

GeorgiaTech,2010,Team:GeorgiaTech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," and AOX2. The AOX1 gene family is stress induced and found in both monocotyledons and eudicotyledons while the AOX2 gene family is prominent only in eudicotyledons and expression depends on the tissue and developmental stage [3]. It has been demonstrated that over-expressing AOX1 leads to large increases in AOX protein and alternative pathway capacity in tobacco cells [4]. The presence of thermogenic monocots (such as Arum maculatum) also indicates that in simple prokaryotic systems, AOX1 expression would be sufficient for thermogenesis.
Objectives and Techniques
Cloning AOX genes into E.coli
Kumar and Soll have demonstrated that the gene for alternative oxidase from Arabidopsis thaliana can be cloned into E. Coli [5]. We chose, however, to use AOX from a thermogenic plant, the Voodoo lily, which can produce temperatures 20c above ambient. Two forms of Aox will be synthesized for bacterial expression by the company Mr. Gene. The forms are overexpressed in certain tissues during the thermogenesis event in Voodoo Lily.
Strains and Growth Conditions
The E. coli strains used will be Novablue and the expression strain BL21. The strains will be grown on LB media. Ampicillin(100 ug/ml) will be added to the growth medium when indicated.
Overexpressing AOX
The expression level of AOX corresponds to the amount of heat produced. AOX protein content in the thermogenic stages of flowering was at least 10-fold higher than that of pre and post-flowering stages, when heat is not produced [6]. To produce high levels of a protein, it is often useful to clone the gene downstream of a well characterized promoter. Inducing transcription from the regulated promoter thus results in elevated expression of the downstream gene product. By choosing a temperature-sensitive promoter, AOX production can be regulated and stopped once a cell has reached an optimal temperature. E.coliâs major cold shock protein CS7.4, is cold shock-induced via the temperature sensitive cspA promoter [7]. Other promoters that are more active around 15-20Â°C than at 37Â°C with a 100-fold or greater increase in gene expression have been identified. They include nusA, infA, and infB of the nus-inf operon, pnp of the S15 operon, recA, and aceE,F, and hypbB [8]. Qoronfleh et. al. have demonstrated that naturally occurring cold-ind"

We have a Comsol simulation for diffusion experiments that explains why at 1mM AHL concentration in sender wells, all 4 wells glow at the same time irrespectively of channel length. On the other hand if we use Î¼ , the wells should start glowing at different times. The channels are 1 to 4mm long. We used a Hill function to model activation of GFP in the receiver wells.

Our first diffusion try with highlighter inkÂ !
Camera picture of our punched agar chip glowing highlighter ink
The design of punched agar doesn't seem to be the best but at least we can see something. Diffusion experiments with different designs are running now.
We have been fitting quorum sensing experiments at steady state to a Hill function and found some quorum sensing parameters.
Fitting quorum sensing Hill function parameters thanks to steady-state data from experiments. Check the corresponding article for more details.
We wrote a survey in English , in French and in German on complexity for our human practice project. We expect 500 responses.

The plasmids for quorum sensing experiments concerning the Lux system are made and operational to be used for experiments. We have three different plasmids:
Lux promoter folowed by GFP gene
Lux promoter followed by cisRNA and then by GFP
Lux promoter controlling the expression of taRNA and cisRNA. The cisRNA coding gene is followed by GFP.
The third plasmid corresponds to a riboregulating system. The second plasmid allowed us to validate the crucial role of taRNA in this riboregulating system.
On the modeling point of view, we only tried to fit the data coming from experiments done with plasmid one (with no riboregulating system) and plasmid three (with an effective riboregulating system). They were the only one to show an answer to a change of input that was not on the noise level.
The experimental setting was to inject different concentration of the signaling molecule AHL at the same time point into different bacterial colonies. The factor that we want to observe is the strength of the activation of the Lux promoter. The"

iGEM Lund
We participated in Lunds universityâs 350 year jubilee by engaging with the public through a series of popular science talks. The topics included the history of synthetic biology and genetics, what synthetic biology is, what it could be used for in the future, ethics as well as our own project. Advancing and promoting the responsible research of synthetic biology lies within the core values of our group.

iGEM Bilkent-UNAMBG
In July, we received a request for help from team iGEM Bilkent-UNAMBG. They wanted to model their biosensor for detecting VOCs. However, they did not have any experience with either using MATLAB or modeling using ODEs. Therefore, we provided them with support through skype-meetings, MATLAB code and resources for how to find parameters for their biosensor.
Together with iGEM Bilkent-UNAMBG, we conducted a survey covering the public opinion about a mass screening program in both Turkey and Sweden. The results from each country could then be compared to analyze differences in the public opinion about mass screening strategies and how this should be financed. The results of the survey can be found under Human practices, integrated human practices .
