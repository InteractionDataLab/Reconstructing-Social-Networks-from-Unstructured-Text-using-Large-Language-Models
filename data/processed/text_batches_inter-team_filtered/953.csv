Yale,2015,Team:Yale#practices_-_-_TEXT.html," its dialogue on marginalized identities, including race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status.
In a recent New York Times article titled “Why Is Science So Straight?” Manil Suri points to some cultural standards which lead people in STEM to avoid or ignore issues concerning LGBTQ and other identities.
He writes: “L.G.B.T. workers in STEM-related fields report significantly lower job satisfaction, both when compared to other STEM workers and to L.G.B.T. workers in other fields. Such discontent — and invisibility — can contribute to a field’s reputation for being unwelcoming. As a result, young lesbians and gays might sell themselves short, aiming for occupations with little use for their talents, but in which they see more people like themselves.”
The results of the survey support his statement. From the graph, more than 50% of respondents feel their sexual orientation is an important part of their identity, and likewise more than half of respondents also want iGEM to improve its discussion on how identity impacts one’s scientific career.
When asked what would foster a more accepting community, one respondent answered, “General community support is one of the best things to foster inclusion (but maybe is the hardest to achieve)…For iGEM specifically, I think talking about these issues and bringing it out in the open will help make a supportive environment overall and at the Jamboree.”

Background
Tardigrades are able to tolerate almost complete dehydration by reversibly switching to an ametabolic state. This ability is called anhydrobiosis.[1]Tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation olerance.[2]2012, Takekazu Kunieda and his team identified five abundant heat-soluble proteins in the tardigrades, which can prevent protein-aggregation in dehydrated"

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," up our petty cash.
Gabi and Isabel are designing a poster for the waffle sale.
For our human practices we wanted to find a sociology student, willing to think about bioethics, but did not succeed yet.
Our video is nearly done, it is cut and only needs be underlain with music.
Monday May 7th
Team Student Academy:
First transformation of BBa_J04450 and BBa_I13522 and plating on selective agar. Result: We got little colonies. There weren’t any green colonies and only some pale red fluorescent colonies.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
More PCRs of laccase genes xccl from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100 and ecol from E. coli BL21(DE3) with the isolated genomic DNA as template and Xcc_LAC_FW_T7 / Xcc_LAC_RV_HIS and E.coli_LAC_FW_T7 / E.coli_LAC_RV_HIS primer pairs.
Since we wanted to screen and characterize laccases from different bacteria we had to order the bacterial strains which weren't available at Bielefeld University from DSMZ . Below is a list of the ordered strains and the laccases we want to isolate from these strains.
Laccase from Thermus thermophilus HB27 (look here for a publication to this laccase)
BH2082 from Bacillus halodurans C-125 (look here for a publication to this laccase)
We ordered S. lavendulae sp. lavendulae ATCC 14158 . Originally we wanted the strain Streptomyces lavendulae REN-7 but this strain isn't available at DSMZ. So we now hope that the laccase  gene STSL from Streptomyces lavendulae REN-7 is similar to that from S. lavendulae sp. lavendulae ATCC 14158 because there's no DNA sequence for the laccase from this strain available. publication
We wanted the laccase EpoA from Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350 (for the publication look here . This strain was not available so we ordered Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10137 . Unfortunately for this strain are no blast results after blasting the laccase from Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350 against database. So we decided to make primers for the laccase sequence from Streptomyces griseus IFO 133"

German Wide Meetup
Ten Teams. Three Days. One City.
In other words: The German Wide Meetup. This year's German-Wide Meetup took place in Dresden from June 30th to July 2nd. Nine teams followed the invitation by the iGEM Team Dresden.
The weekend started with some get-to-know games in the “Großer Garten”. During this time, first exchanges about projects and experiences happened between the teams.
On Saturday, the meetup continued with student talks, in which every team gave a short presentation about their projects. On top of that, even Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher and Marcel Thiel from Promega, gave  little input talks. The day finished of with a sightseeing tour through Dresden and a tortilla party afterwards.
A last get-together occurred on Sunday morning. Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun gave a talk about BIOMOD, a biomolecular design competition. Further down the line two workshops took place: “iGEM goes green” and collaboration speed dates. After a last group photo, the teams departed.
The event was a great opportunity to get to know the other German teams, to exchange ideas, experiences and to talk about collaborations. Thanks to the iGEM Team Dresden for organising and hosting this amazing event.

“Why is Golden Rice undoubtedly an excellent source of the vitamin A ?”
In addition to other factors the vitamin A status is the most important which influences the absorption and utilization of provitamin A carotenoids. The carotenoid content isn’t alone sufficient to list how much takes up by the body because of the affect of the other factors to the bioavailability of carotenoids, carotenoid species, concentration, the food matrix, dietary fat, and also the health status of the person. So to facilitate provitamin A absorption dietary fat is necessary. In contrast to that eating of Golden Rice leads to maintain appropriate vitamin A blood levels and absorbtion of sufficient provitamin A from the diets without needed oil. So the intestinal β-carotene uptake gets facilitated by the simple starchy food matrix of the endosperm and the fat content of the rice grain.
Vitamine A deficiency
Malnutrition is a vehement problem which demands the death of 12 million children worldwide. The damage of micronutrient deficiencies in the world is caused by the low dietary intake of iron, iodine, zinc and vitamin A. Concerning to the WHO (2012) 2.7 children can save from death via providing those with vitamin A. Directly preschool children and pregnant woman of the poor population are affected by the VAD in Southeast Asia.  Sadly rice is a poor source of many essential micronutrients (see table 3). So micronutrient malnutrition causes by a rice based diet in Africa and SE Asia.

“Why is Golden Rice a blessing to combat the VAD?”
Next to traditional interventions like distribution of retinol pills, accumulation of food with micro nutritive substances, diet diversification, disease control and disaster relief is this biofortification with genetic engineering another strategy to improve the malnutrition situation and combat the VAD. Naturally the plant rice can convert provitamin A (β-carotene) into vitamin A (retinol derivates) just in the leaves"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

K2020006
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (Y77X) This part is a variation of the BioBrick K2020005 . In opposition to the exchange of tyrosine77 against tryptophan, the named tyrosine was exchanged against an amber codon, the least used stop codon in Escherichia coli. The codon TAT of tyrosine77 was substituted with TAG, which codes for ONB-tyrosine, if the corresponding tRNA/synthetase pair is added. So tyrosine will be exchanged against ONBY in the pro-peptide cleavage site of the enzyme in the presence of the needed ONBY tRNA/synthetase pair. By irradiation with light, this non-canonical amino acid can be converted to natural tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site of the enzyme and the cleaved off photo-labile group. Thereby, the protease will reach its activity just by shining light on it. Caused by the mutation in the pro-peptide and not in the direct subtilisin E gene, the actual position of the modified tyrosine was counted from the beginning of the pro-peptide compared to common annotations counted from the N-terminus of the actual enzyme. Unfortunately, we were not able to execute all of the experiments that we planned due to a lack of time. But as our proof of principle of exchanging tyrosine against a larger amino acid namely tryptophan showed no difference in the activity compared to our working subtilisin E expression system , tyrosine77 in general not influences the proteolytic activity of the enzyme. And the replacement of tyrosine against ONBY will not cause an inactivation of the protease. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

In the experiment, our CsgA-producing strain of E.coli is induced at a high (0.5% w/v), low (0.2% w/v) and no (0% w/v) concentration of L-rhamnose. Furthermore, csgA deficient bacteria transformed with an empty plasmid (pSB1C3) are also tested and used as a control (Table 2.). All the experiments were carried out in triplicates.
Table 2. Strains of Escherichia coli used for assess the biofilm formation using crystal violet
The cultures of both strains were grown and induced in a 96-well plate. 40 hours after the induction, the samples were washed with water (in order to disregard non-attached, planktonic cells) and dyed with crystal violet (figure 9.).
Figure 9. 96-well plate used for test the biofilm-making capability of our designed constructs. The first two rows (A-B) contained cultures with 0% w/v of rhamnose. The columns D-E and G-H were inducted with l-rhamnose to a final concentration of 0.2%w/v and 0.5%w/v respectively. The green boxes show the strains carrying BBa_K1583000, and the red ones the control strain with pSB1C3.
Results and discussion
In the end, the wells were diluted with ethanol so all the content can dissolve in the liquid phase. We measured the absorbance at 590 nm of wavelength for all the samples, obtaining the following results (figure 10.):

Victor Sourjik has studied Molecular Biology and Physics at University of Regensburg. He has done his PhD at the Institute of Physics and Technology in Moskow and in the lab of Professor R. Schmitt at University of Regensberg. He then went as post-doctoral scientist for five years to Professor H. Berg at Harvard University in Cambridge, USA, and became group leader in 2003 at the Center for Molecular Biology in Heidelberg. Victor investigates bacterial chemotaxis as example for the molecular perception of environmental signals and their transduction within cells. He combines quantitative data with computational modeling to obtain a detailed understanding of the signaling mechanisms in complex systems. In his Nature publication in 2005 he could use criteria for systems robustness in order to predict a correct topology for the Che signal transduction network. This approach has become a paradigm for the utilization of systems biology to pursue biological research. For his successful research on prokaryotic signal transduction Victor has won the Chica and Heinz Schaller award in 2007. We are sure that his broad experience in the field of bacterial chemotaxis will be a key asset to the strength of our team. back

CBPa : To assess the ability of our protein to bind to cellulose, we mixed different forms of cellulose powder with our protein, in presence of a non-specific competitor protein : bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 1h, the mix is centrifuged. The supernatant and pellet are harvested and examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6).
Figure 6. Cellulose-binding test of the fusion protein.
3) Antibody layer
In order to test whether we can detect mosquito-borne pathogens by immunodetection, we tested antibody-antigen recognition onto PVDF commercial membranes by using E2 envelope protein of Chikungunya virus (E2/CHIKV) and monoclonal E2-specific antibody 3E4.  Single E2/CHIKV was conjugated with horseradish peroxydase (HRP) and efficiency of the detection method was tested (Fig. 7A). Then, specificity test was assessed by performing detection of conjugated E2/CHIKV among an excess of conjugated BSA (Fig. 7B). After that, since mosquito proteins can interfere with the E2/CHIKV recognition, we substituted BSA with conjugated mosquito lysate proteins (Fig. 7C). Finally, ""real-world"" test was performed by detecting 17D vaccine strain of Yellow Fever virus (YFV) into infected mosquitoes (Fig. 7D) by a coach with the required safety access to an Institut Pasteur BHS facility.
Figure 7. Immunologic assay test of the fusion protein.
4) Combined
We made the composite protein-cellulose-based patch by mixing cellulose powder and the pre-silicated fusion protein, and compressing it on a Darragon SE 10 (200 bars, 100 kN, 10T). To check the rigidity gain of the silicated patch, we can characterize the rigidity in traction and compression by measuring the Young’s modulus and the rigidity in shearing by measuring the shear modulus. Then, we coated specific antibodies to CHIKV onto the composite patch, allowing us the detection of purified CHIKV envelope protein.

Biomaterial Overview
Our project aims to improve the yeast surface display system by assemble biopolymers on the yeast cell wall. Here are two types of biopolymers synthesized our chasis organisms, the engineered S. cerevisiae str. EBY100 and INVSc1. One is tubulin protein, whose sequences originate in Mus musculus (house mouse). The other one is flagellin protein coded by codon optimized sequences of E.coli str. K-12. In addition, there are some enzymes fused with the subunits of the biopolymers, including PETase, Xynase, BG, EG, CBH. All of the organisms involved, both the chasis organisms and those we acquire original coding sequences from, are belonged to the risk group one, which do not cause disease in healthy adult humans.
Measures
Even though the organisms of our choice are relatively safe ones, we still took necessary measures to guarantee the safety of our project.
First of all, we strictly limited the engineered strain within the lab by destroying their ability to survive under environment lack of certain substances. The engineered EBY100 cells cannot sustain deficiency in leucine, and the engineered INVSc1 cannot survive without histidine, tryptophan, and leucine.
Secondly, before starting our lab work, we thoroughly examined the safety protection facilities, including wall-mounted eye-wash and emergency shower, first aid kits, fire extinguishers, etc. The broken, dysfunctional, overdue ones were immediately fixed or replaced.
Thirdly, to keep the risk of accidents and leakages to the lowest level, we strictly followed the rules and codes of safe operation listed below:
No slippers and pants would be permitted in lab. Close-toed shoes are worn at all times in the lab.
Gloves and medical mask is ordered when working in the labs, especially with some aerosolizing agents, such as SDS.
Hands must be washed before leaving the lab area. And lab coats are mandatory precaution.
No food or drink are allowed in the lab.
All bench space is wiped with 75% EtOH before and after use, and the biosafety cabinets are exposed to UV for twenty minutes before and after use.
All unnecessary equipment is unplugged and removed from bench after use.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ine dimer (white color) should be produced in those with functional import.
Plasmid preparation of those with white color and subsequent sequencing leads to the identification of functional PTS1 variants. Afterwards, we repeat the cloning steps described before to obtain a mTurquoise−PTS1* construct and co-transform it with the corresponding Pex5 variant. Eventually, the correct localization of mTurquoise tagged with these PTS1 variants provides proof for its function.
Mutagenesis of PTS2
Imagine you need different protein concentrations in your artificial compartment. What to do? Take our modified PTS2 sequences with varying import efficiencies.
To characterize the import efficiency for the site-directed PTS2 firefly luciferase was used. Luciferase is a luminescent protein which can be split in a C- and a N-terminal part. Only when combined, luminescence can be detected. To measure the import efficiency the two parts will be expressed and imported into the peroxisome in a separated way. The smaller part (Split2) of the split luciferase will be brought into the peroxisome first via the PTS1 dependent pathway. The other part is imported via the respective modified PTS2 sequence. The better this sequence is recognized by Pex7, the stronger the luminescence of the assembled luciferase can be detected in the peroxisome. There is a chance of split parts of the luciferase assembling in the cytosol if the import is too slow. To avoid wrong conclusions of the luciferase localisation, we designed a negative control experiment. It includes a split luciferase similar to the one used in the initial experiment, but without the peroxisomal targeting sequence. Consequently there will be no import into the peroxisome. If we subtract the luminescence of the negative control experiment from the luminescence of the main experiment we can define the degree of import.
In addition to a directed approach according to Kunze and colleagues we also want to perform a random  mutagenesis experiment to alter the five variable amino acids of the core region of the PTS2 sequence in an unbiased manner. The aim is to generate a library of different peroxisomal PTS2. The 15 nucleotides are assembled by chance. In the DNA synthesis this sequence will either be described as [NNN]5 or [DNK]5. N stands for all four nucleotides mixed, K for either G or T and D for A,G or T. The “DNK” composition prohibits two out of three termination codons. Additionally with this library the amino acid"

Restriction Digest Protocol
In the Insert Tube...
600 ng of DNA (To figure out the volume, the calculation is 600 / concentration of plasmid.  This gives you volume in μL).
Water, so that the volume of both DNA and water in the tube is 35 μL total
4 μL of React 1 Buffer
0.5 μL of EcoR1
0.5 μL of Spe1
In the vector Tube...
250ng of DNA (To figure out the volume, the calculation is 250 / concentration of plasmid.  This gives you volume in μL).
Water, so that the volume of both DNA and water in the tube is 35 μL total
4 μL of React 2 Buffer
0.5 μL of EcoR1
0.5 μL of Xba1
Put both tubes into the 37°C water bath for one hour.  After, place them into the 65°C heating block for 10 minutes.  This deactivates any enzymes in the tube (which is ok, because by now they’ve done all they need to).     Take the insert out, and put it in a -20°C freezer.
Antarctic Phosphatase Protocol
To the vector tube, add 5 μL of 10x Antarctic Phosphatase Buffer, 4 μL of water, and 1 μL of Antarctic Phosphatase.  We do this to prevent the vector from closing up again without any insert.     Put the tube into the 37°C water bath for 30 mins.  After, place it in the 65°C heating block for 10 minutes.
Ligation Protocol
Take the insert out of the freezer, and add 5 μL of insert and 5 μL of vector to a new tube.  Label the rest of each tube as Unligated, put the date on the tube, and stick it in the -20°C freezer incase your ligation/transformation doesn’t work.  To the single tube of 10 μL mix, add 10 μL of 2x Quick Ligase Buffer, and 1 μL of Quick Ligase.  Let this sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.

We transformed the pDR111 plasmid containing the 3α-HSD gBlock into B.subtilis PY79 and performed a colony PCR.
We repeated the PCR for the signal peptide (SP) and 3α-HSD gBlock with less primer (1µl each). This time the PCR worked so we cleaned it and cut it with SalI and NheI restriction enzymes.      We then performed an overnight ligation of the cut SP and 3α-HSD gBlock with pre-cut pDR111 plasmid.  We transformed the product into E. coli TOP10 and performed a colony PCR.      Starters for positive colonies (4 and 9) were made, from which we prepared glycerol-stock and performed a miniprep.
Active team members this week: Ruth, Liron and Tal
Expression
We performed a restriction reaction of the 3α-HSD gBlock with the original sequence (RFC10 compatible)using SpeI and XbaI enzymes.        We then ligated the cut 3α-HSD with pSB1C3 and transformed the ligation product into E. coli Top10. Colonies grew in the control (ligation of pSB1C3 without 3α-HSD).      Therefore, we performed a colony PCR with 8 colonies, but received no positive colonies.  We repeated the colony PCR, this time with 20 colonies, but received no positive colonies.
We planned the expression plasmid with the part BBa_K1321338 , which contains pT7 and an RBS (iGEM14_Imperial), and reporter plasmids with the parts BBa_J06702 , containing an RBS, the mCherry-coding gene, and a terminator (iGEM2005), and BBa_K1357008 , containing an RBS and tsPurple and a terminator (iGEM14_Virginia).  We then extracted the BioBricks from the 2015 DNA Distribution Kit and transformed them into E. coli Top10.      We made starters from the transformed strains and performed a miniprep.
We performed a restriction reaction of BBa_K1321338 with PstI and SpeI enzymes and of BBa_J06702 , BBa_K1357008 with PstI and XbaI enzymes.
We performed PCR again to the 3α-HSD"

Future Work
The most obvious improvement for future work on a self destructive plasmid would be to replace the LVA-tagged I-SceI homing endonuclease in  by a wildtype sequence. I-SceI protein with the wildtype sequence is commercially available and has been shown to work. The restriction site and reporter gene have been shown to work, so these would not require immediate attention. Possibly the restriction site could be integrated into the reporter gene sequence, so that cleavage would immediately block transcription of the reporter gene.

Clotho
- Eliminate bugs: Try to prevent error messages from appearing when certain buttons are pressed. The bugs should be handled with Bugzilla as soon as possible to improve the overall usability of Clotho.
- Fab Dash: Prepare it for the deployment into the wet lab environment. A new interface is being developed, in which the left side is going to be more tab-like, and opening ""file, new, ..."" will allow a more direct way to create new parts.
- Plug-in manager
- Batterboard integration: Some works are still needed on its bugs.
- Sequence view integration and improvement: This app will allow the import of Genbank file and the uptake of its features, which are written in the header, into the database.
- Drag & drop to Clothocore and Optimus Primer: This upgrade will allow part to be dragged and dropped to some applications.
- Guide to Clotho Apps
- New projects will probably be used for next year's iGEM
Trumpet
- Craig has developed this application with good usability and interface
- A paper will be written based on Trumpet's documentation
Puppeteer
- Resource manager: This program aims to increase the efficiency of resource allocations. While the main goal is to make it function well, its parallelism problem (i.e. how to optimally use pipet in general cases/protocols) must be solved because it needs to be ready for demonstration. The flexibility of this program also needs some improvement by removing all hard-coded information so that it can be used in other robot.
- Puppeteer: Work on allowing restriction digest and ligation. Complete Gateway Gibson assembly method for MIT cross compatibility.

Bacillus subtilis
B. subtilis is one of the best-studied gram-positive microorganism, and a model bacterium for studying bacterial differentiation (e.g. endospore formation) and phenotypic heterogeneity. [1] [2] Its ability to become naturally competent makes B. subtilis an organism which is easily accessible for genetic manipulation. [3] The GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status and the secretory capacity made B. subtilis a preferred host of choice for big scale production of secreted proteins, such as lipases, proteases and amylases, highlighting the industrial relevance of this bacterium. [4] [5]
In addition, the iGEM Team LMU-Munich 2012 has constructed the Bacillus BioBrickBox, which contains several well evaluated integrative vectors and other parts for the use in B. subtilis, thus providing a powerful toolbox to engineer B. subtilis. [6]

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Arabidopsis thaliana the Na+/H+ antiporter AtNHX1 mediates the import of not only Na+, but also K+ into the vacuole. The transporter probably contributes to the accumulation of      cations significantly [12,13]. AtNHXS1 is a through DNA- shuffling improved version with an increased Na+/H+ Vmax [14]. We introduce the AtNHXS1- gene into our strain genome, so it      increases the sequestration of ions into the vacuole.
Fig.7: yeast cell with ENA1 and NHA1 knocked out and VNX1 und NHX1     overexpressed.AVP1 is integrated into the vacuolar membrane and increases the proton gradient over the membrane. AtNHX1 is integrated into the vacuolar membrane vaciliating the seqeustration of     sodium using the protongradient that is increased by AVP1.
In Arabidopsis thaliana AtCLCc, a Cl-/H+ antiporter, localized in the vacuolar membrane, is responsible for the transport of Cl- across the vacoular membrane and therefore important regarding      salt tolerance [14,15]. We integrate the AtClCc gene in the yeast genome to increase accumulation of chloride in the vacuolar lumen, using the proton gradient generated by AVP1.
Fig.8: yeast cell with ENA1 and NHA1 knocked out and VNX1 und NHX1     overexpressed.AVP1 is integrated into the vacuolar membrane and increases the proton gradient over the membrane. AtNHX1 is integrated into the vacuolar membrane vaciliating the seqeustration of     sodium using the protongradient that is increased by AVP1.AtCLCc was integrated to further increase the accumulation of NaCl into the vacuole.
As we decided, in result of our Human Practices work, to show the adaptability of the concept to other ions, we designed more cells which should be capable of sequestrating potassium.
The AtAKT1 gene from Arabiddopsis thaliana mediates potassium uptake over a wide range of potassium concentration in the extracellular room [24–27]. AtAKT1 specifically is a high affinity      transporter in the plasma membrane [28–30]. Since sodium has a negative effect on the efficiency of AtAKT1 [31], we did not combine a sodium accumulating mutant with this channel but rather      designed a separate mutant called NAKT. Therefore, we integrated the channel in the plasma membrane of a mutant with ENA"

York,2017,Team:York#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," 3D printing, for reasons outlined here . He also helped us adapt our design so that the degree of magnification could be changed more easily - an important factor for anyone that might use the hardware in a post-iGEM context.
As we approached the end of the project, Dr. Laurence Wilson (Department of Physics) expressed his interest in the possibility of using a Raspberry Pi based, automated DIHM system in remote and/or inaccessible locations, such as the salt mines near Whitby, UK, which are not safe enough for people to perform experiments. Hopefully, this is a sign that we have designed our microscope in a manner that is suited to use in research!
The International Community
We have also tried to extend our human practices beyond the borders of the UK during the project. Our most notable advance overseas was with the iGEM 2017 team from Aachen. While we were testing our DIHM, the Aachen team sent us some samples of Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742 - which we were able to examine. A hologram we created from images of their organisms is presented below.
Figure 1: Hologram created from an image of iGEM 2017 Aachen's S. cerevisiae sample.
There was an issue with our lens alignment, but, using this hologram, we were able to see that S. cerevisiae is around 18 pixels when in focus. This corresponds to 4 µm, which is what we expected from the literature, providing further evidence that our analysis methods are suitable for quantifying the sizes of organisms [1].

Unfortunately they did not work as expected. In a short period of time we found many positive clones, but further analysis indicated that the VirA receptor was changed to constitutive activity. Thereby, due to the short time available, we did not manage to construct a receptor that was specific for other phenolic substance, e.g. capsaicin.
We tried to create a light signal that is visible to the human eye as another part of our project. So genetic amplifiers ( Cambridge, iGEM 2007, amplifier project ) were added to our luciferase BioBrick. This amplified luciferase readout was coupled with the VirA/G signaling system in order to visualize the induction behaviour. The amplifiers worked so far and gave a visible luciferase readout but the basal expression of the vir promoter was also amplified so the induced status of the VirA/G system was not discriminable properly from the uninduced status.

Check other molecular mechanisms or see the characterisation of this construction .
UV-INDUCED PROMOTER
This construction is made up of two parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter
The repressor-binding site inside the promoter and
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (green) protein. The promoter was taken from the RecA one. Proteins that participate in the orchestrated bacterial SOS-response [1] that involves more than forty independent SOS genes, most of which encode protein sengaged in protection, repairing and replication regulate our construction.
When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain the green fluorescent protein one condition should be met. Since there is a repressor, lexA, that blocks any possible transcription, it is needed to UV-irradiate the cells to break down lexA and habilitate transcription.
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: when a bacterium undergoes severe damage it uses this repair system for maintaining a functional (double stranded) DNA able to duplicate. The damage can be so harmful that it can generate ruptures, dimers, bases modification, etc., therefore the bacteria releases RecA resulting in polymerized and filamentous structures which bind to and stabilize DNA [2"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Project#Entrepeneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," to successfully enter the IVD market are the integration of our unique technique within other techniques, and its capability for rapid and versatile diagnosis at the molecular level, especially for detection of infection diseases. These technological advantages contribute to a strong position within the identified markets.
SWOT analysis
For the commercialisation of CINDY Seq, the strengths and weaknesses of our product were considered. We did this via a so-called SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for ""Strengths Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats"", and is frequently used by companies to determine how its objectives can be accomplished, and what obstacles must be overcome or minimized to achieve desired results. It allows to see where our technology CINDY Seq is today, and where it may be positioned in the future.   The SWOT analysis is further divided in an internal and an external analysis. The internal analysis is done to identify the values and the weaknesses that should be covered to achieve a stronger market position. The external analysis is done to clarify the opportunities we have to grasp and to acknowledge the threats against which we have to protect CINDY Seq.
Internal analysis
Strengths
:
We already have a proof of concept and a strong IP position.
CINDY Seq is a versatile tool to obtain both simplex and multiplex results.
CINDY Seq is rapid, cheap and meets all safety requirements posed by the iGEM competition.
Weaknesses
:
CINDY Seq relies on other techniques, for example in our applied design Cas13a is required for detection
Because CINDY Seq relies on other techniques, the values rapidity, low-cost and on-site are highly dependent on other steps in the detection method. For example, in our applied design the detection of genes takes a few hours due to the steps during sample preparation. In addition, lab equipment and expertise till a certain extend is required
External analysis
Opportunities
:
There is a high demand for frontline diagnostics.
The market is predicted to grow (see market analysis).
Cas13a is currently discovered and has a great potential to be a key player in rapid genetic material detection. Cas13a requires a techique to optimise the visible output
Threats
:
CINDY Seq is versatile and can be applied broadly. However, the versatility of the tool can be a bottleneck for finding a niche and outcompete more specific and specialized frontline diagnostic tools.
Lack of optimized techniques on which CINDY Seq relies will stop the development of the CINDY Seq.
Cas13a is patent-pending and therefore the owners of the Cas13a patent have time to develop their own"
Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," codons having the slowest insertion time, were designed and constructed. The TIR of each variant GFP was then varied by attaching ribosome binding sites (RBS) of varying strength to the synthetic genes. The genes were then expressed in E. coli cells.
Shows the similarity between GFPs. Genes with opposite criteria, such as slow/fast and common/rare, show very little similarity.
To design the genes a custom program was created which replaces all degenerate codons in a gene with the desired codons, for example, replacing all rare codons with common degenerate codons or all slow codons with fast degenerate codons. The variants were sent for construction at a commercial laboratory (Integrated DNA Technologies), and then inserted into viral DNA vectors which were incorporated into the cells’ plasmids through existing replication machinery. This was accomplished through basic cloning, and the expression of the fluorescent protein was then characterized using flow cytometry, a quantitative method of measuring fluorescence. Using this data, the maximum translation rate capacity of each variant GFP was determined and that data was used to distinguish between rare, slow, frequent, and fast codons.
3) Introduce the Synthetic Genes Optimized Using Our Criteria into E. coli
Our general plan for expressing our variant GFPs in living cells was to ligate the genes into a vector, transform the cells with the vector, then sequence to confirm the presence of our variant genes. After this we ligated in a dRBS, measured the florescence of the cells, and then sequenced again to determine which colonies were using which RBS.
The figures below show the construction process that we used to insert an RBS library and variant GFP into plasmid pFTV.
Inverse PCR
Through inverse PCR, we cut away the existing superfolder GFP while amplifying the rest of the plasmid. By adding ""tails"" to our primers outside the annealing sites we were able to introduce new restriction sites into the plasmid.
Inverse PCR Products
Inverse PCR cuts out the pre-existing coding sequencing while simultaneously amplifying the plasmid backbone with the new restriction sites.
Inserting GFP
Each GFP variant is inserted separately
A decision was reached to use a leader sequence to homogenize the first 60 base pairs of each GFP.
Why use a leader Sequence?
Leader Sequence is heavily optimized to ensure it does not become the rate limiting step in translation. It ensures an even range of translation initiation is sampled across all variants by homogenizing the first 60 base pairs, which can impact TIR.
Our construct before insertion of the dRBS"

Lethbridge,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#busi overview_-_-_TEXT.html," is also a more efficient means of individual testing. If a test on an individual must be performed and a sample from the subject cannot be stored due to the risk of hormone degradation, Researchers would currently have to use an entire monoclonal antibody kit to test it. These kits are designed to perform tests for many subjects at once and it would be wasteful to use a kit for only a few tests.
When BEAR reaches the diagnostician market, it can be assumed that each hospital that buys the device will need more than one to keep up with the demand for tests in multiple departments.
Synbiologica Ltd wishes to provide researchers with a new, faster, accurate method of hormone detection that will ultimately speed up the process and lower the costs of research. This will lead to new discoveries in many research labs, including the labs with which Synbiologica Ltd is associated. Money made by the company will be put towards further research and allow Synbiologica Ltd to continue development of biotechnological devices and technologies. Research done by Synbiologica Ltd and the labs with whom the company works will be the means of attracting the target market of hormone researchers.
Currently, the team members of Synbiologica Ltd work out of research laborator space provided by the University of Lethbridge as well as incubator space provided by Tecconnect.

The parameters from the fitting of the simulated noisy data returns similar parameter values as the parameters returned when fitting the experimental data.
The KM estimated for CsADH2946 is low, which indicates a high affinity towards the substrate crocin dialdehyde. This is also agrees with the pulling simulation , where the enzyme showed specificity towards this substrate. We compared the results with the binding of acetaldehyde and validated that CsADH2946 has specificity against crocetin dialdehyde since a higher force was required to pull this substrate from the active site. These results greatly support our choice in selecting CsADH2946 as an enzyme candidate in our zeaxanthin-crocin pathway.

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," of the atoms of the system, that is how the atoms move over time, can then be simulated by numerically intergrating Newton's equations of motion.
The MD simulations were performed based on previously defined protocols, which were nicely summarized by Justin Lemkul in a tutorial (6). All the steps until the production MD can be done on practically any system while the production MD will require a supercomputer to reduce time. Next follows a short description of the main steps in the protocols as well as some tips and general comments.
Define Box and Solvate
The protein has to be put in a box containing solvent where the simulation will take place. We chose a cubic box with at least 1 nm between the protein and the box. The simulation is run with periodic boundary conditions, meaning that if the molecule touches the boundary it will appear on the other side of the box.
Add Ions
We neutralized our enzymes and added ions to a concentration of 0.15 M to get closer to physiological conditions (7).
Energy Minimization
In this step the energy of the system is minimized using a steepest descent algorithm. This is done to remove any conformations that are unfavourable in terms of energy. The potential energy of our system was calculated using the CHARMM27 force-field in this and all later steps of our simulations.
Equilibration
Equilibration is done to relax the system into an equilibrated state. It starts of by doing a simulation with constant volume, temperature (310 K) and number of particles. Once the first one is finnished, another simulation with constant temperature (310 K), pressure (1 bar) and a constant amount of particles is run. The system is also equilibrated in the beginning of the production simulation, but by performing a more refined equilibration protocol in advance, simulation time is saved.
Production Molecular Dynamics
Once the system was equilibrated production MD was carried out with constant pressure (1 bar), temperature (310 K) and number of particles. The systems were simulated  for 100 ns on a supercomputer with 24 processors running in parallel. The time it takes for the simulation to complete is dependant on the amount of particles present. Because CsADH2946 is a tetramer with the highest amount of atoms in the simulated system, it took the longest time to finnish (approximately one month).
The Resulting Stable Enzyme Models
The result we got from the 100 ns stability simulations in GROMACS show a trajectory of each enzyme wiggling around trying to equilibrate into a low energy state. We"

Lambert_GA,2015,Team:Lambert GA#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," as effective results. Here are some we have used over the years, and we hope they help you as well!
Water Bath
Rubber Bands, the Best
From the side
Problem:Our team does not have brackets for our shaking water bath. This is a problem because it did not all us to secure it well enough to be able to incubate overnight.
Solution: We noticed the holes at the bottom of the shaking water bath's tray that are meant for the wingnuts to be secured. Instead of purchasing the expensive brackets (that don't fit correctly, since we have one small set)- we found that a configuration of rubber bands works much better and is much more secure. All you need to do is secure them to the bottom using two holes and pulling each end of a single rubber band through two close holes. You then pull one end through the loop of the other to secure. Continue doing this until you have four points of contact to the base and can then work on securing the glassware to the base using more rubber bands.
Blue Ice
Visualizing the Tubes
Problem: When using clear microcentrifuge tubes or PCR tubes, the transparent plastic can get lost amongst the white ice/Styrofoam.
Solution: It is a simple solution to this frustrating problem- color the ice. One drop of blue food dye per 1L of water creates vibrant blue ice that can be easily differentiated from the tubes during wet lab work. It is also very helpful to have ice with a hole/dip in the middle to place tubes as opposed to strictly shaved ice (which runs the risk of diluting your solutions).
Keeping PCR Tubes Cold
Using an Ice shaver
PCR tube in shaved ice
Problem:As a high school lab, we don't have an ice block for our PCR tubes. This poses a problem because regular shaved ice could easily destroy the precise experiments by dripping melted chips into an open tube.
Solution: We fixed this by taking shaved ice, and packing it into a tray made for microcentrifuge tubes. We then used a single PCR tube to make indentations in the ice to use as a mold. This mold is then frozen for use in the next heat-sensitive lab. (Note: It is recommended that you use the centermost slots during your wet lab to avoid your ice channels from melting too quickly.)

SCU_China,2017,Team:SCU China#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," a whole new view on melatonin. They also                                         emphasized what to focus during the research, such as the safety issues emerged                                         when we tried to produce E.coli strains secreting melatonin in human body, the                                         dedicate relationship between the circadian rhythm of melatonin production and                                         sleep related neural circuits and possible test on mouse in vivo. At the same                                         time, to our delight the professors highly appreciated the practicality and                                         novelty of our project. During the interview with the experts of CFDA, we got                                         known of the national standards on melatonin in Mainland China, which drove us                                         to focus more on legal issues and safety considerations.
      We had video chat with Team Purdue to                                         introduce our respective projects. In this                                         video chat, their real condition simulation experiments inspired us to do some                                         experiments to simulate growth conditions in the environment of gut. In                                         addition, we were inspired by team “SCU-WestChina”’s modeling of constitutive                                         promoter family to make our modeling of enzyme kinetics by ourselves, in order                                         to achieve more efficient production of melatonin with reasonable formula of                                         enzymes.
      With the help of the Sleep Medical Center,                                         CFDA and other iGEM teams, we finally                                         arrived at the complete project design and improvement.
03.  Experiments
      During the following experiments, we                                         encountered many problems as well; luckily,                                         most of them were solved with our toil and others’ assistance.
      SCAU-China provided LUDOX in the measurement                                         kit, which turned out to be crucial                                         in our InterLab experiments.
      Limited to the rules of using plate reader                                         in our public lab, we cannot use the                                         plate reader in our public lab for continuous kinetic measurement of repressilator over 8h. Thankfully, Team “SCU-WestChina” provided us plate reader                                         “Biotek Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader” in their lab to finish such                                         experiments.
      During CCiC, we learned that the project of                                         the iGEM team of Peking University                                         was closely related to repressilator as well, so we exchanged our experience on                                         repressilator and maintained constant communication since. After the conference,                                         we found in our experiment that the plasmid pLPT107 cannot be transformed into                                         the ΔclpXPMC4100 stain that was knocked out by ourselves; thus, we turned to                                         team ""Peking"" immediately. Gratefully, they sent their Δclp"

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#safety#safety in the lab_-_-_TEXT.html,". Associating DNA parts together will always pose safety risks in case of accidental release of DNA or bacteria occur. European safety rules are pretty strict and are tailored to avoid accidental contamination of the environment or the humans manipulating these microorganisms. We think that the fact that Safety Issues are mandatory for iGEM projects is a very good way to force students (and their advisors!) to take some time evaluating (or getting help to evaluate) their specific safety (biosafety) issues.
When we discussed biosafety issues of our project, we analyzed the 2012 Paris-Bettencourt iGEM project named "" Bware "", which proposes several measures to ensure that new synthetic constructions do not consitute health or environmental issues if the strain was released on the wild. Such a system would be ideal to destroy any genetic material that could be released during or after the use of E. calculus.

6/20/08
Need to make media/plates today.
When thinking about making simple tests of all of the full parts that we received, one should consider which dropouts are necessary for construction.  Note that all activators are on pRS305, which is a LEU2 shuttle vector.  All repressors are on pRS304*, which is a TRP1 shuttle vector.  Finally, all reporters are found on the pRS306 plasmid, which is a URA3 shuttle vector, with the exception of the LexA activable reporter and the Zif268-HIV repressor reporter, both of which are on the V0002 vector for some reason.  This means that to make simple tests of our parts, we'll have to primarily make plates and media with the following pairs of dropouts: LEU and URA, TRP and URA.  This also means that it should be relatively simple to construct Test#2 by using three different"

In vitro assay
This experiment was made to test if the loxP and the lox66 were working properly, it also allowed us to measure the Cre concentration needed for an in vitro recombination reaction. The particularity of lox66 is that it has an altered sequence at the end of it's left arm when compared to loxP (natural recombination site from P1 Bacteriophage). This sequence variation reduces affinity of the Cre recombinase for the arm.
Based on the report made by the igem2010 UT-Tokyo team and some papers [1] , the lox66 (BBa_I718016) from the registry was wrong, it had a gg instead a cg in its left arm. This part was corrected by the  iGEM11_Tokyo_Tech team (BBa_K649206) and by the iGEM11_WITS_CSIR_SA team (BBa_K537019), but no DNA was available in the registry. Anyway, we needed to synthesized it and test it as part of our PCR-primers, we used the proper sequence described by [2] .
We designed two primers, one containing the lox66 and one containing the loxP sequences, these primers amplified the ORF from the kanamycin resistance gene, flanked upstream by the loxP and downstream by the lox66, using PCR."

In the case of COD, the second position from the non-reducing end is deacetylated  [2]   [4]   [9] . If both enzymes – COD and NodB – are active at once we are able to create a deacetylation pattern involving the first two units.
In contrast to NodB, COD does not deacetylate chitosan twice, after long incubation periods  [2] .
CODs catalytic part is its N-terminal domain, while the other two domains make up carbohydrate-binding molecules. The catalytic domain correlates to a carbohydrate esterase domain (CDA)  [4] .
Figure 10. Structure of COD. Structural data from RCSB PDB. A 3D simulation of the enzymes molecular structure.  [11]
Mechanism
COD deacetylates the second N-acetyl-D-glucosamine unit (GlcNAc) of the non-reducing end  [2] , thus generating acetic acid and D-glucosamine (GlcN).
Figure 11. Mechanism of COD. The enzyme deacetylates at the second position of the non-reducing end.
Methods
We ordered the cod gene via IDT sequencing and inserted this gene into the pSB1C3 vector through a BioBrick system and verified this via sequencing.  The cod was fused to a T7-promoter  (BBa_I719005) . The vector includes the RBS  BBa_K2380024 .

In my daily life, I am interested in computer science. But unfortunately, I am just at the beginning.
When I have free time, I would like to play piano. The music can always refresh myself. Also, I enjoy playing video game. Recently, I am playing Steep. I guess you will consider me as a snowboarding amateur, and that is true.
In fact, I had already heard about iGEM before our teacher began to organize this team. I think this could be a good chance for me to have a nice experience in biology. Just as my expected, I have learned lots of genetic relative knowledge. Besides this, the most important thing is that now I was led to the world of biology and I am able to access to more knowledge. Least but not last, iGEM provides me a chance to take an experience in teamwork. Maybe we cannot always get together to do the experiment and other work, but there is a degree of unity among us.

Teacher
As the guidance teacher of team SHSBNU_China, I am a Biology teacher in 2nd HS attached to Beijing Normal University, international division. After my Graduation from Beijing Normal University, College of Life Science, as a PhD in Ecology, I have 6 years’ experiences of Biology teaching in my school, dedicating myself in creating different levels of Biology courses to fulfill demands of different students.
I started building our courses form the Standard Level Biology (SLB), then Moodle version (online) of SLB, and forwarded to Accelerated Biology Course (ABC) for enthusiastic students, as well as Honored Biology Course and Genetic Engineering Experiments for students who’s willing to study further and deeper in Biology. These different levels of Biology Courses have prepared the students for international Biology contests like iGEM. I’m so proud that my student could enjoy this challenging competition.

Mittel für Flug und Unterkünfte in Cambridge wollen eingeworben werden. Drittmittel für Studienanfänger gibt es nicht. Doch einige in der Privatwirtschaft, sagt Eils, seien Feuer und Flamme für die Elitestudenten. Sponsoren können rechnen. Und Eils, von Hause aus Mathematiker mit Hang zur Computerlinguistik, rechnet ihnen geschliffen vor, wem die Tausender zugutekommen: ""den Besten der Besten"".
Für die vierzig Studienplätze, die die Universität Heidelberg jedes Jahr im ""Elitestudiengang"" Molekulare Biotechnologie zu besetzen hat, laufen Jahr für Jahr mehr als tausend Bewerbungen ein. Und die besten zehn Prozent dieser inzwischen 120 Biotechnologie-Studenten nehmen am iGEM-Wettbewerb teil. Dazu vier ausgesuchte Studenten der Mathematik und Biologie. Für diese gilt, was für alle Biotechnolgie-Teilnehmer gilt: Eine Eins im Abitur reicht nicht. Wer sich mit dem Harvard-Nachwuchs messen will, muss schon früh durch seine erfolgreiche Teilnahme an ""Jugend forscht"", an Chemie-Olympiaden oder an entsprechenden Schülerprojekten einiges an naturwissenschaftlicher Reife an den Tag gelegt haben.
In Heidelberg jedenfalls, das lässt Eils selbstbewusst durchblicken, macht man in dieser Hinsicht keine Kompromisse. Der erweiterte Spielraum der Institutsleitungen bei der Auswahl des Nachwuchses wird komplett ausgeschöpft. Welche Aufgaben dann solcherart vorgeschulte und offenbar auch in den Semesterferien spielend leicht zu motivierende Studienanfänger schon anzupacken bereit sind, zeigt das iGEM-Projekt aufs allerschönste.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html,"BD-enzyme fusion protein. We needed to understand if the joining together of the two parts would have a negative effect on the binding capacity or in the enzyme itself.
An easy way of testing the feasibility of these constructs is to test the FBDs with GFP first. We constructed fusion proteins with the several FBD on the N'-terminal, since it was the terminal the binding domains were recommended to be placed at.
Figure 5 Analysis of FBD-GFP fusion proteins. With this image we show that the GFP activity was not affected by the fusion between the FBDs and the GFP. CBD stands for the +control, Cellulose Binding Domain from the Biobrick registry BBa_K1321357.
Cell extract from strains expressing our fusion proteins was incubated overnight with the fabrics. Afterwards two washes of the fabrics were performed. Water, PBS, BSA 5%, Ethanol 70% and Catechol 30mM correspond to the washing solutions we used to remove the non-bound GFP, as well as to test the binding strength of the different peptides. The data displayed corresponds to the values after the final wash, normalised using the values from the first wash.
The intensity of the colour corresponds to the GFP signal measured at that point.
In figure 5 we can see that some FBDs show high affinity to certain fabrics, and some are even specific. In the case of FBD2, it shows high affinity and specificity for both cotton and linen. This FBD binds poorly to silk and wool, which is interesting given that both cotton and linen are plant-fiber-based, and silk and wool come from animal sources.
FBD5 shows affinity to all four fabrics, and has no specificity for any of them.
Interestingly, most FBDs have affinity for silk, which is very useful in the development of our product given that through our human practises we were able to get to know that silk is one of the most demanding fabrics when it comes to stain removal.
Different washing solutions also influenced differently the several FBDs. For example, FB10 performs very well when washed with water in silk and wool, but performs very badly when washed with the same solution in cotton and linen.

iGEM Japan Kansai Forum was held by Team Kyoto in Kyoto Uiniversity. Some Japanese iGEM team gathered it and We made some presentations for our projects, manegement our team.After the presentations, we had some questions and answers periods. We could understand more deeply because we could  discuss our project with  participants. Seniors who rely on the participants participated a lot, and a sharp point, adequate advice fluttered. We also were pointed out questions, advice and shortcomings. With these questions we could review the project and made it better. Also, I heard stories about the administration of other universities, and they also thought about doing cloud funding. At the end of the forum, all the participants wrote feedback on the questionnaire and pointed out the specific improvement points of each other's team.This effort helped one after the forum.

Gifu
Meeting with team Gifu that their project is fermented food was held by team Nagahama. As each theme is Japanese traditional food theme, we brought mutual research theme of Funazushi and sake and talked about regulation of genetically modified food in Japan. We discussed how our projects can actually work.We thought of it. And since each organism used is S. cerevisiae, we advised on experiments using S. cerevisiae. We talked about the characteristics of the promoters we used and we discussed what is best.
Gifu taught me that the expression level of S. cerevisiae mRNA can be regulated not only by promoter but also by terminator. All devices used our project have CYC1 terminetor.We decided to use CYC1 terminator with no reasons. If we wanted to express more mRNA, we found that it would be better to turn into high activity of terminator. This was useful information for our project. We advised"
Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Architecture_-_-_TEXT.html," if the design has been properly realized. If the result is not what it should be, the design cycle is applied again (specifications, design, modelling, implementation, testing and validation) until the desired result is accomplished.
Another similarity between the two fields is structure, both buildings and cells rely on the structure to support and protection against the outside world. Structure is essential. Without the right structure a building might collapse and like our Bare Cillus project shows, once we remove the cell wall to create l-forms the bacteria becomes very fragile and will burst if not in an osmotically stable solution.
Applications
“Vitruvius suggested in his texts On Architecture that architecture is an imitation of nature, but what happens when architecture becomes nature and we begin, through the design of biological systems, to become architects of nature?” (Dade-Robertson M et al. 2013)
At the moment there is a big division between the built and natural environment due to lack of technological bridge as the current architectural practices are based on Victorian technologies. We believe this problem can be solved using synthetic biology, especially if we implement synthetic biology as a material practice, with the cell being the factory where the enzymes represent the machine that process and assemble the raw materials into a usable product.
However, to what extent can synthetic biology be applied to architecture? Could we program a single cell to grow a building?
At the moment, one of the major problems that is stopping us from producing materials using biotechnology is due to the yield rate of a cell not being efficient enough to be price competitive. However, as our project shows, a higher yield rate can now be achieved using l-forms, which at the very least is a sign that things are quickly improving and that this may become a reality in the very near future.
We could use cells to create a specific material in a lab which could then be manufacture in a conventional factory to a new, better product to use in architecture; for example, stronger, environmentally friendly concrete.
It could even be possible to engineer cells to grow and self-assemble in to, for example, a brick. We could then use the ready-made part directly from the lab, and may even wish to keep the cells integrated with the product so that it becomes living, with the ability to respond to the environment and heal itself.
Is this really possible? It is important to remember that a single cell creates all of us, therefore, in time it may even be possible to grow a whole building out of a one cell.
However, the application area must have certain characteristics in order for it to justify the use of"

Binding K
The phase space related to various parameters plays an important role for scientists in the bio-engineering field. The appropriate simulation of the genetic circuits by software will be helpful for design of genetic switch. Based on the synthetic genetic circuits with non-coding small RNA, we study the phase space of binding constant K (Kb) for engineering in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The various types of sRNA mediated circuits are well described by relevant Kb, mapping the near simultaneously regulations to decrease (or increase) the target mRNA. The popular genetic switch, Plac with LacI (weak binding) and Ptet and TetR (strong binding), are used here to mimic the simplest synthetic circuits in E. coli. We develop the software tool, Binding K, to illustrate how the genetic regulation varies with Kb. In addition, the mean field theory and the 4th Runge-Kutta method are integrated in this software tool.
The introduction of Binding K
The calculation of binding constant K for genetic circuits based on the non-coding RNA (sRNA) plays an important role for various types of bio-function. Even for E. coli, there are more than fifty types of sRNA mediated bio-function. To tackle the problem of the binding constant K for sRNA duplex in E. coli, we use some methods for the calculations. Our team member Eddie Wang, cooperating with Mr. Cheng-Ping Jheng, professor Cheng-I Lee (Department of Life Science, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan) and instructor P. H. Lee have published one MD method to measure the binding constant K [1]. Firstly, we set up the build-up of sRNA structure in E. coli. Secondly, the  molecular dynamic (MD) and Amber molecular dynamic package calculating the A-form RNA duplex in implicit solvent model are used here. With the explicit solvent model, we take the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) as the basic modeling to calculate the change of Gibbs"

“It is possible, yes”
“And this thesis, that we both agree on, is of course regarding all actions, right?”
“Right”
“The only consequence we can affirm, as being the direct result of an action are the one with an apparently immediate beginning and end, both spatial and temporal. And this leads back to my argument that if we were to do only the things of which we know the consequences, it will leave us paralyzed. Agree?”
“Yes”
“And does it also mean that not knowing the consequences doesn’t mean that a certain action should not be carried out?”
“That makes sense”
“Therefore, my friend, it is only human not to know all the consequences of ones actions, but it is not an argument against GMO.”
This dialog shows that the most common arguments against GMOs can be refuted.  In ethics, believe it or not, what is right and what is wrong always comes down to the art   of rhetoric.  Beside the overall GMO discussion there is also the discussion concerning animal use in   synthetic biology (see Animal Ethics ).
We did some fieldwork and visited a department at Odense University Hospital where   antibodies are made.   And what makes the ethical discussion even harder is that the conditions under which   laboratory animals are kept are much better than the conditions that animals for   consumption have.  When thinking of laboratory animals and animal consumption one cannot help but to think that   we see these living creatures as tools. Fortunately, this view is changing. And hopefully one day we will treat these beings with the respect they deserve.

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"ase placement pancake algorithm is O(n^2).  My next goal is to create a key generator which takes in a permutation of parts, and based on the pancake algorithm, tells the user the ""key"" that allows them to create that permutation.  This key will be the series of invertases that must be added.
7/3/11
- Over the weekend, I found that our current pancake implementation might need another layer of complexity, making it O(n^3).  I am continuing to play with this algorithm to determine whether this is true or not.  I also have begun testing out what I call a Link Sort Algorithm.  If this algorithm works, and I choose to implement it, then I will update my notebook to explain how it works.
7/8/11
- This week I shifted my time from working on the pancake algorithm, to developing my own algorithm, which I call Link Sort.  Today, I finally got both the designer and key generator for this algorithm up and running.  First I will explain a little bit about how the link sorter algorithm works, and then explain how this is implemented using invertases.
Link Sort
Link sort is a sorting algorithm which takes in a permutation of n parts and sorts that permutation within n-1 steps.  The following explains how this algorithm works:
For i = 1 to n-1
1.  Find the index, j, of the largest value within the subset of elements from index 1 to n-i+1.
2.  If this element is not already at index n-i+1, then reverse the elements between index j and n-i+1.
The following is an example of the link sort algorithm acting upon the permutation 4,2,1,3.
Starting Configuration: 4,2,1,3
3,1,2,4
2,1,3,4
1,2,3,4
In order to implement this sorting algorithm using invertases, I have placed n-1 shells around each invertase.  Within each shell, each part has n-1 invertases which link that part to the other n-1 parts.  Every time an inversion is made, the outermost shell is used to make the inversion.  By using the outer shells first, inversions completely preserve the inner shells for future inversions.  This weekend, I will be writing up more documentation regarding this algorithm.  Now that we have this algorithm, and can generate correct invertase keys for each permutation of n parts, the next step is to visualize the"
METU_Turkey,2014,Team:METU Turkey project_-_-_TEXT.html," this design, controlled biodegradation is very important because we can not precise all the risks. So, we made our organism addicted, briefly it works with a kill-switch mechanism with the presence of arabinose.
Why did we choose this project?
The biodegradation of plastic bottles took thousands of years, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air. Our project aims to clean enviroment with the degredation of PET to pyruvate by E.coli. With this project,while  the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E.coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new source.
Can our bacteria degrade PET in huge amounts?
For nowadays, yes. Also we can do this biodegradation process with different organisms like algeas in water. For soil, situation is more complicated but actually, we try to obtain this biodegradation genes from a soil organism Pseudomonas putita. E.coli can be worked as easy as P. putida and has a good adaptiton. If we talk about a biodegradation on a collected plastic, our project would work properly.
Why did we associated some of our parts with Pseudomonas putida F1 strain?
P. putida is used for related experiments and it has lots of metabolic similarities with E.coli
Which teams worked on the previous parts of our project?
With the experiments of Darmstadt, London Imperial college and UC_Davis Teams and other iGEM parts, we can obtain catechol from PET. For going further, we ligated  K316003 part with a constitutive promoter. So, we reduced huge amounts of catechol into 2-hydroxymuconate Semialdehyde and obtained green colour as we expected. Then, we designed a new part From https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Parts BBa_K808000,BBa_K808010,BBa_K808011,BBa_K808012,BBa_K808013,BBa_K808014  From http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K316003 and  Bba_K316003 http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K936020 and Bba_K936020 With these parts, we can obtain catechol from PET.

We were very happy to be invited to participate in this forum. Thanks for organizers. We learnt a lot from the forum.
Thursday 30/7
With the help of our senior fellow-student brothers and sisters, we studied the methods of Elisa and RNA extraction. We learned a lot in the course of experiments. But we still need to do the experiments by ourselves so that we can grasp the methods thoroughly.
Friday 31/7
Today we went to the laboratory. We succeeded in reverse transcription of RNA and kept the cDNA in refrigerator. And our cell’s growth situation was favorable.
Sunday 2/8
Today we reported our progress to our tutor in the meeting. After the meeting, we entered the cells room to continue our experiment. Cells were successfully subcultured by us.
Monday 3/8
Today, in preparation, we prepared the solution before the experiment. We used cells which were available. First of all, we extracted the RNA from cells. After running the gel electrophoresis, we detected RNA’s concentration by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. And then, we synthesized cDNA by reverse transcription. Afterwards, we detected cDNA’s concentration, and we processed the data. And then we calculated the consumption of the reagents such as water, primers and PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix. We expanded the cDNA with PCR. We used the cDNA which had been expanded to run the gel electrophoresis. After all the work had been done, we cleaned up the laboratory furniture.
On the other side, the work of culturing cells was well. There were more and more cells in our cells room.
Tuesday 4/8
The result of experiment we had done yesterday was less than satisfactory. So we analyzed the reason why we failed. First of all, we found the mistake maybe caused from gene expression. Review of the literature revealed that PDE5A, GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3 were expressed in kidney. The cells we used in experiment were HEK293. But we don’t know whether the genes we needed would express in HEK293 or not. So we had to consult with our tutor.

Introduction of Sup35
Sup35 is one kind of yeast prions which is found in [PSI+] Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [PSI+] is the prion phenotype which causes nonsense suppression of all three types of stop codons.
As we know, Prion-forming ability is not conserved, revealing that it is a disease. Prion domains have non-prion functions, explaining some conservation of sequence. Yeast prions [PSI] and [URE3] induce a cellular stress response (Hsp104 and Hsp70 induction), suggesting the cells are not happy about being infected[1]. Under three quarters of growth conditions tested that a difference between the two states of protein [PSI+] and [psi-] existed, if the protein are in the state [psi-], the cells are healthier[2]. The yeast prion are much milder than animal prion and the huge difference in the genome sequences between human beings and yeast creates barriers to the infection from yeast to human beings.
The [PSI+] has a strong ability to propagate by inducing the newly produced Sup35 to switch to the same state as [PSI+], resulting in the aggregation[3]. Therefore the chance of reading through the stop coden or the nonsense mutation enhanced, forming a new phenotype[4]. The acatastatic read-through change the physicochemical properties of the mRNA and protein, and then the stability of the mRNA and the function of the protein are changed[5]. Because of the sequence diversity downstream the stop coden, the uncertanity of phenotypes is remarkable in the hosts. These phenotypes are heritable when the prion comes into progeny from cytoplasm[6],[7],[8].

In this section, we present the main results of the BeeT-project. The BeeT-system is subdivided in three parts: specificity, regulation, and biocontainment. These parts are based on the main demands BeeT had to meet. To ensure BeeT's specificity, we engineered an existing toxin and identified a potential mite pathogen. Furthermore, we developed a toxicity-assay to facilitate future research on Varroa destructor-specific toxins. Also, software was made to aid in the discovery of Varroa destructor-specific toxins. For the regulation of toxin production, we developed two riboswitches that can detect mites, designed a genetic circuit which regulates the formation of BeeT subpopulations, and included a toggle switch which ensures BeeT is only functional in the beehive. BeeT's biocontainment was ensured through the introduction of an optogenetic kill switch and a Cas9 kill switch. We"

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Project Description
Plastic is a ubiquitous material in modern consumer goods. One of the most common plastics used today is polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Chemically, it is a polymer consisting of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid subunits. With the increasingly short life cycles of consumer products, PET waste is accumulating around the globe at an uncontrollable rate. Moreover, PET is a plastic that does not biodegrade well, and degradation often has to use industrial processes. Given the rapid accumulation of PET and the difficulties associated with biodegradation by ecosystems, it is paramount to find a more efficient method to degrade PET.
Upon conducting our research on plastic degradation, shortly after deciding to focus on this topic, our team came across a joint collaboration research project from Keio University and the Kyoto Institute of Technology, two prestigious universities in Japan. Their paper explained their recent research on PET degradation into Terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol using a new bacterium originating from Japan called Ideonella Saikainesis. We were inspired by Ideonella Saikainesis because it was an effective PET degrader (containing PETase) from Osaka, Japan, our current location. Considering this, we realized that the production of PETase was based on unique Japanese research, so it was only apt to center our project around this as it showcases a special (and scientifically recent) aspect of the Japanese environment. Consequently, our aim and experimental idea were born: to optimize the use of PETase and hopefully add a new Biobrick to the iGEM catalog. Subsequently, when looking at past iGEM projects of Turkey 2014, University of Washington 2012 and Darmstadt 2012, all centered on plastic degradation, provided us with inspiration on the potential applications for our project in addition to lab protocol ideas.
We chose to optimize PETase as our goal, aiming to make a new type of biobrick available to future iGEM teams. We hoped that this will make experiments in the following years easier to conduct. However, in order to even get to that stage, we recognized that we needed a well thought out procedure. Our team is currently working on this step. Thus far we have determined that we will be using a western blot test to help us deal with the signal peptides. We also have three promoters (one"

Rutgers,2011,Team:Rutgers#EAS1_-_-_TEXT.html," tryptophan, the trpR protein will repress transcription of the E. coli trp operon by binding the operator region in the trp promoter and, thus, blocking RNA polymerase.

LovTAP
Overview
The two seemingly unrelated parts described above share one crucial feature: an alpha helix. LOV2 binds and unbinds an alpha-helix in response to light, and one domain in the functional trpR structure is “bound” to an alpha-helix. Strickland et al.’s idea was to force them to “fight over” a single alpha helix. Thus, since LOV2 has a higher affinity for the helix in the dark than trpR, there is no trpR activity in the dark. However, when exposed to light, LOV2 releases the alpha helix, allowing trpR to bind it and, thus, result in trpR activity (which of course is repression of the trp promoter).
 
Figure 3
 
Details
Thirteen successive amino terminal truncations of trpR were ligated, in frame, downstream of the region coding for the Ja-helix in AsLOV2. One construct, referred to as LovTAP (the LOV- and tryptophan-activated protein), showed increased binding affinity to trp operator DNA when illuminated. Further tests showed that, upon light exposure, LovTAP binds DNA in a manner that is characteristic of the trpR domain. Additionally, mutation of the conserved cysteine of the LOV2 domain, which should prevent the conformational change that releases the Ja-helix, was shown to abolish binding to DNA in the presence of light. As this cysteine is crucial in the function of LOV2, this result suggests that the observed light sensitivity of the DNA-binding activity is due to LOV2.

A. Dark state-DNA dissociated: The shared helix contacts the LOV domain and trpR is in an inactive conformation.
B.                  Photoexcitation occurs at 470nm (represented by the FMN chromophore going from yellow to white) causing the contact between the LOV domain and the shared helix to be disrupted. trpR now binds the helix and assumes its active conformation (represented by the helix going from blue to red).

In the afternoon, 3 post-doctoral scholars from CSMedLab delivered a very informative speech about transgenic plants and after that, answered our questions patiently.We have gained a lot of knowledge as well as some social skills in this activity.

Questionnarie about HCV Dectection
    We released an online questionnaire on September 1st   and received 1023 valid answers by the time we closed the website on September 22ed. Our sample of this survey came from all over the country as shown below. It’s worth mentioning that we also received 24 answers coming abroad, which encouraged our teammembers a lot.
                                                                  
    We selected some of the questions and will explain how the feedback helped us refine our project.
    The results of question2 and question4 indicate that the public only have a vague idea about Hepatitis C. Quite a high percentage of people don’t know what it is, and lots of people thought that HCV can transmit through saliva. The fact of this urged us to pay more efforts to popularize information concerning Hepatitis C to the public. We have learned that antiviral medicines can cure approximately 90% of persons with hepatitis C, but access to diagnosis and treatment is low. This firms our belief that HCV detection should be added into the annual physical examination, and question8 and 9 shows that the public are with us.
    According to the result of question5 and 6, though the interviewees are not so familiar with the term “Hepatitis C”, they actually did quite well answering questions about the incubation period and symptoms of Hepatitis C, which is a real comfort to us.
    We made significant changes after collecting the data. Question 12, specifically, inspired us to reconsider the places where we can apply our test paper. We refined our product positioning and decided to promote it mainly to the hospital instead of aiming at the household market.
    The results of question10 and 11 are particularly instructive. These two questions contraposed the problems we might encounter with while promoting our paper. Those advices people given are of great practical value, and will definitely help making our theory into actual product.
    After collecting the data, we did lots of public activities to popularize the idea of Hepatitis C, which will be mentioned later. Based on the result, we improved our project in various aspects"
Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story_-_-_TEXT.html," the luminescence when added. Finally, the only recourse was to try various chemicals available in the stockroom of the Lab, with the hope that one would reversibly inhibit the luminescence. This was clearly an approach that relied entirely on good luck, and I was not surprised when all of my efforts failed. I was conceptually exhausted, and could not come up with one further idea.
I spent the next several days soul-searching, trying to imagine the reaction that occurs in luminescing jellyfish and searching for a way to extract the luminescent principle. I often meditated on a drifting rowboat under the clear summer sky. Friday Harbor in summer, at that time, was quiet and peaceful, differing from the present-day scene that is almost saturated with busy pleasure boats and noisy seaplanes. A rowboat always has the right of way over one with a motor, so nobody disturbed my drifting vessel; even large ferries saved me a wide berth. Thus, meditation afloat was safe, but if I fell asleep and the boat was carried away by the tidal current, then I had to row for a long time to get back to the Lab.
One afternoon on the boat, a thought suddenly struck me-a thought so simple that I should have had it much sooner: “Even if a luciferin-luciferase system is not involved in the jellyfish luminescence, another enzyme or protein is very probably involved directly in the light-emitting reaction. If so, the activity of this enzyme or protein can probably be altered by a pH change, at least to some extent. Indeed, there might be a certain level of acidity at which an enzyme or protein could be reversibly inactivated.”
I immediately went back to the lab and made a squeezate. Then, I mixed a small portion of the squeezate with acidified water containing various amounts of acetic acid. The resultant mixtures at pH 6.0 and pH 5.0 were clearly luminous, but at pH 4.0, I saw no luminescence. I filtered off the liquid from the rest of squeezate and mixed the solid part, containing the granules of light organs, with water of pH 4.0. After the mixture was filtered, the filtrate, now free of cells and debris, was nearly dark, but it regained its luminescence upon neutralization with a small amount of sodium bicarbonate. Indeed, the experiment showed that the luminescent substance of the jellyfish can be extracted.
But my real surprise came in the next moment, when I added a small amount"
