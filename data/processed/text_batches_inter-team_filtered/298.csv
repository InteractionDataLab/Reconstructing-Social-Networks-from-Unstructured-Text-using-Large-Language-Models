Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," the accessibility of synthetic biology, allowing scientists to have portable tools to aid them in synthetic biology wherever they are.
An Unengaged Public
A Panel Discussion at the 2011 World School Debating Chapionships
To try to engage members of the public, we collaborated with St Andrews iGEM to organise a debate/discussion to coincide with the World School Debating Dhampionships (WSDC). The WSDC is an annual global event with High School students from different cultures and backgrounds, competing and debating on current issues. The WSDC has been an annual competition since 1988 and has been hosted in exotic locations around the world such as Sydney, Lima and Singapore. This year it was held in Dundee, Scotland. In the past, the Championships have had Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair participating as patrons.
We felt that the aims and objectives of the WSDC which focus on international understanding would be a good incentive for us to introduce and encourage interest in the relatively controversial field of synthetic biology. Many of the participating WSDC students are potential leaders. The knowledge of Synthetic Biology would be advantageous to future global decisions. By being able to link politics and Synthetic Biology, political promotion of the subject can greatly be enhanced and Synthetic Biology can have a larger beneficial role.
After having decided to collaborate with the iGEM team of St Andrews, we set up a meeting where both teams and Jon Urch, of Revealing Research Dundee, brainstormed ideas for the event.  Our first plan was a panel debate, where we would first give a short introduction on synthetic biology (giving a description of synthetic biology and discussing its benefits and limitations) and then allow the students to perform a debate. After lots of discussion we chose to give a longer presentation and then have an open discussion where both the St Andrews and Dundee team form a panel where the audience could direct questions and/or discuss among themselves.  In the meetings prior to the discussion, we chose to divide the presentation into two parts: the positive and the negative aspects of Synthetic Biology. The responsibility of the negative aspects was held by the St Andrews team while we prepared for the introduction and discussing the benefits of Synthetic Biology.
On the 21st of August 2011 we held the discussion on Synthetic Biology at The Union in The University of Dundee. At the beginning of our presentation, the audience was asked if they knew anything about synthetic biology and what their opinion regarding it was. Only one person in the audience said that they were opposed to Synthetic Biology.
The Arguments
Synthetic Biology is hard to define, even scientist struggle with the definition."
Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," range, including early childhood education?"" With this effort came additional questions, including ""How can we make biology more accessible to young children?"" and (for high school aged students) ""How can we improve access to science education for disadvantaged youth in Australia?"" We consulted with a variety of stakeholders within the science education community in order to answer these questions, as described in our Human Practices page.
Our project concept could potentially have commercial value and therefore we had to address intellectual property issues. We consulted with a number of experts and stakeholders in the intellectual property space, as described in our Human Practices page.

Should remove at around 9:00 am tomorrow
Started a lyophilization: 2:30 pm
should remove on Wednesday at 2:30 pm
I tried to see how much volume could fit into one of the 3.5kDa cassettes
tried forcing 20mL into the cassette
It fits, but definitely leaks
When I extracted the liquid from the cassette, it was evident that some PEG had gotten in there

Fig.3 Stalk elongation may function to elevate single cells away from surfaces.(Communicative & Integrative Biology, 2013 6:4)
In the whole life cycle of C.crescentus, we mostly focus on the process of degradation of flagellum and biosynthesis of holdfast. Thus, we will discuss the pathway of the two parts dividedly and design a reasonable circuit containing protein involved the pathway controlled by light signals.
DgrA/DgrB
The concentration of c-di-GMP is varying, and for our experiment we will promote its expression to inhibit rotation of flagella. It will bind to DgrA and DgrB. The resulting complex will have two routes to go: one is the [c-di-GMP&amp;DgrA] complex which will inhibit FliL, a protein bounds to the membrane playing a key role in rotation of flagella. The other route is that the DgrB will directly affect the rotation of the flagella.
HfiA/HfsJ
Ref: A Cell Cycle and Nutritional Checkpoint Controlling Bacterial Surface Adhesion
In this paper, author describes a novel regulatory mechanism by which the C.c. bacterium integrates cell cycle and nutritional signals to control development of an adhesive envelop structure known as holdfast.
They discovered a novel inhibitor of holdfast development. HfiA, that is regulated downstream of lovK-lovR. They also discovered a bio-synthesis related gene named HfsJ. The suppressing mutations in HfsJ attenuate the HfsJ-HfiA interaction.
Fig.4 Biosynthesis pathway of holdfast.
These results support a model in which HfiA inhibits holdfast development via direct interaction with an enzyme required for holdfast bio-synthesis.
In conclusion, the author claimed that they demonstrated that the predicted glycosyltransferase, HfsJ, is a required component of the holdfast development machinery and that residues at the C-terminus of HsfJ mediate a direct interaction with HfiA, leading to a post-translational inhibition of HfsJ.

In the morning we reserved the bacilli of leuB and contracted its plasmid. The next PCR and gel-electrophoresis showed nothing wrong.
In the afternoon we conducted double-enzyme digestion for 5 μl system of leuB and nothing was wrong. Then we added leuB into c-resistive LB liquid medium and took it back to Yushan campus.
Because of the failure on Pea Rhizobium yesterday, we continued on its activation today. We made new solution of T antibiotics concerning about its solubility in 50℃ hot water and folded it with foil. Then we added 54263 (loop I) to AT-resisting LB liquid medium
In the afternoon we made new leuB-deficient liquid medium (in gradient concentration of VB1) and added HB101 and BL121 into it.

We reserved colonies of 54263 coated yesterday, contracted the plasmid and conducted PCR and double-enzyme digestion. The resulted showed no problem on the part. But we doubted there were double plasmids.
We found the length of plasmid that contracted from K381001 was abnormal. It might be a mistake of the package received from MIT.
Yesterday we failed in the loop II experiment for it didn’t yield fluorescent protein testing bacteria. In the afternoon we incubated 18-3&11-16 in LB (AT+) medium without AHL.
There were colonies cultured from BL21 coated yesterday, while none was in HB101. So we kept incubating.
9-7
There was no colony cultured from 18-3&11-16 that were ligated yesterday. We found the reason was the wrong antibiotic (it should be K (- -)). So we changed the medium and re-cultured it with an addition of AHL.
We took the single colony of HB101 in deficient-type medium and determine its OD value. Then we selected the most concentrated as No. VB1② (compared to VB1). Then we coated the kidney bean and Alfalfa and incubated them in TY medium"

The smell of E. coli as we know it from working in the lab using LB media, is not delicious. The first thought  that comes to mind is not how much you would like to taste it - so we wanted to make E. coli taste and  smell delicious. In order for us to do so, we wanted to make a limonene construct synthesizing limonene  controlled by pTet. In iGEM parts registry, two parts encoding the limonene synthase 1 exist. We decided  to use both parts and thus make two constructs in order to test which one is the most useful and has a  more enhanced production of limonene. The parts are to be found as Bba_K118024 and Bba_I742110 . Bba_K118024 encodes appY and dxs – Bba_I742110 does not. appY and dxs  increases the production of limonene, so we expect Bba_K118024 to show a more enhanced production of  limonene than Bba_I742110.

Background and Rationale
Alberta’s bitumen oil deposits represent one of the largest oil reservoirs in the world. Bitumen-bearing carbonate rock, or carbonate rich oil shale, represents 26% percent of Alberta’s total bitumen resources, or approximately 447 billion barrels of unprocessed heavy oil1,2. The majority of this carbonate-based oil shale is found within what is called the Carbonate Triangle where the oil is trapped within carbonate rock and therefore poses additional difficulties for extraction when compared to conventional oil reserves. Although carbonate oil reservoirs have been successfully exploited in countries such as Venezuela and Mexico3, unstable oil prices in Western Canada have prevented large-scale industrial exploitation of Alberta’s Carbonate Triangle oil reservoirs. Since the utilization of unconventional oil can emit 5-15% more CO2 than the production of conventional oil4 it is necessary to develop alternative technologies to facilitate extraction of unconventional heavy oil and mitigate the subsequent negative environmental impact. Our goal is to use a synthetic biology-based approach to develop a proof-of-principle method for extracting carbonate oil and to evaluate the associated economic and environmental issues.
Many carbonate oil deposits around the globe are being extracted through the use of in situ application of heat and steam1. While steam-based methods have been successful in places such as Egypt, Oman, and Italy1, these methods are taxing on the environment both through the use of large quantities of water and the energy needed to generate the steam. Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) uses natural bacterial products to enhance oil recovery in tertiary extraction processes and has been successfully tested in Germany and Russia to enhance the productivity of carbonate oil deposits5. Typically, microbes are directly injected into the well site where they proliferate and disperse into the matrix to deliver acids, biosurfactants, or other useful products6. A major problem associated with current MEOR technologies is the difficulty in isolating or engineering bacteria that can survive in the extreme environments of oil reservoirs6. The project outlined here will circumvent this issue by having MEOR products secreted from bacterial cells for collection thereby removing the need for direct application of bacteria to the carbonate deposits.

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," fairies? In addition, their lovely power to make flowers bloom would be profitable for us in many ways, such as application to agriculture. This is why we have set our project for realizing Flower Fairy E.coli with synthetic biology!! In order to realize our dream, we focused on FT protein, known as Florigen.This protein is a kind of plant hormones. First of all, FT protein is produced in leaves, and then move to the shoot apex and bloom flowers. Therefore, FT protein is the key to our project.
Our Goal is to induce flower formation just by putting Flower Fairy E.coli on leaves!
When you want to use our Flower Fairy E.coli, all you have to do is just put them on plant leaves! When you spread Flower Fairy E.coli, FT protein is secreted and penetrate the cell membrane of a plant, and the plant starts blooming.
We had to go through four steps in order to achieve our goal――Flower Fairy E.coli.
These four steps are “EXPRESSION” , ”SECRETION” , ”PENETRATION” , and ”ACTIVATION”
In each step, we have some problems to be attacked.
“EXPRESSION” ; It is unclear whether E.coli can express FT protein, because FT protein is derived from plant cells .
”SECRETION” ; After produced, ''E.coli'' have to secrete FT protein outside of themselves.
”PENETRATION” ; FT protein has to penetrate into plant cells.
”ACTIVATION” ; Even if FT protein could get into the cells, it is unclear whether FT protein produced by E.coli can activate genes in shoot apex cells and induce flower formation.
1.EXPRESSION
The first step is EXPRESSION.
We had to make E.coli produce FT protein.
However, in the natural environment, wildE.coli don't have FT gene. Therefore we tried to make a new BioBrick part including FT gene and introduce it into E.coli.
Modifying FT gene for Biobrick
FT gene is derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant. Professor Araki in Kyoto University kindly gave us FT cDNA in TOPO blunt end 2(Invitrogen). FT cDNA has two cleavage sites of iGEM restriction enzymes, EcoR1 and Pst1 (Fig.1-1 A), therefore we modified FT gene sequence by Inverse PCR with primers containing two base mismatches between primer and cDNA(Fig.1-1 B). As a result, we could get mutated FT cDNA, which are"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 3_-_-_TEXT.html," managed to find an endogenous fluoride riboswitch that had been reported in bacillus subtilis. As a novel biobrick, this would have obvious applications in the analysis of water purity. Such a device could also be pitched at persons a la General Ripper, concerned about fluride contaminating their ""precious bodily fluids"", though such a marketing strategy could produce somewhat sporadic orders.
Some of us also started using the faintly egomaniacal geneious program for the analysis of DNA.
All in all, a fairly productive first day!
Tuesday
Oli and Tom continued with the rather elongated protocol for creating competent bacillus.
Jolyon contacted the team in Yale who had discovered the bacillus based riboswitch for the detection of fluoride. Hopefullly we should be able to integrate it into some sort of reasonably fast acting novel bacterial biosensor which we can then hook up to our standardized bioluminescence. In order to bring about this standardization, Andreas introduced the biologists to some of the principles of control theory, so we had some of the conceptual tools to change the shapes of the input/output curves. One important possibility is using these control theory principles to reduce the noise of the response.
Andreas and Paul also started on the software for our device today. Our current plan is to use an Arduino board to detect our inputs, communicate this information to a python script and then present this on a user interface. Very snazzy.
In addition to this, Emmy got the completed home page online! Considerable! A graphic designer as well as a biologist in our midst...
Wednesday
The first results of our light sensor made by Andreas and the user interface made by Paul came out today. See the lab book for the results.
We also built up a schedule for when each of our individual modules should be finished by. Our final schedule can be seen on the calendar. Hopefully we shouldn't look too unprepared when UEA visit tomorrow. By the way, UEA are visiting tomorrow.
Continued wrangling for the already constructed plasmids also took place, with Tom trying to get his hands on an optimized lux operon for use in bacillus. Whether or not it is actually codon optimized is, at this time, unknown. If the worst comes to the worst however, we can just get DNA 2.0 to synthesize the whole thing and optimize it for bacillus. We may have finally found a use for our synthesis budget.
Lastly, we finally manage to make up and freeze our stocks of bacillus. At eight fifteen, Tom and Oli finally exited"

We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents. A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20]. Assuming this is the recommended budget for other laboratory courses, students would be unable to run our assay more than once in a given week. We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay:
and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.  In addition to being expensive, Coenzyme A (CoA) is not very stable in solution. Sigma has reported that solutions stored at -20C are only stable for 2 weeks! [21]
In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run. This would allow a student to run our assay ~ 10 times. We couldn’t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA. Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use. We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond. Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen. A proton transfer from tyrosine then leads to a keto-enol tautomerization [25][26]. In vivo, crotonyl is covalently bonded to acyl carrier protein, but coenzyme A is used as an analog. The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].
We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA’s role as an acyl carrier. We wanted to explore a large chemical space to increase our chances of finding"

In our design, the function of the chamber is to hold our magnetic beads (fixed with magnets) with the aptamer and provide a place for the sample to bind to the aptamer so that the the complementary strands with lysine can get detached . Our intention to design the chamber as an oval is that the elongated structure can reduce the bubble generated by the difference in flow rate between the cavity wall and the middle stream.
Chamber 2 is round( diameter:12mm) Within this chamber ,there are gel pillars(diameter: 0.5mm). The contents of the chamber are engineering bacteria frozen into dry powdery and trypsin. After the reaction in the chamber is carried out for a certain period of time, the mixed reaction of the culture medium and the reaction liquid flows from the upstream into the chamber under the negative pressure generated by the peristaltic pump
First of all, we select aptamers AP273, which has best affinity for AFP. We modified a biotin at the end of its 5’ end, which has affinity for streptavidin. Because of the presence of streptavidin-modified beads, aptamer has been locked firmly on beads. At the same time, a complementary chain was synthesized at its protein binding site. We modified an amino group at the 3’ end of the complementary chain which can be combined with lysine protected by BOC anhydride to link lysine to the complementary chain. Because Van der Waals forces between AFP and aptamers is stronger than hydrogen bond, due to the action of magnet lying at the bottom of the reaction system, aptamers are separated from complementary chain, one at the bottom, the other in the supernatant. At this point, with the action of trypsin, lysine can be separated from the complementary chain, and start his adventure.

EXPERIMENTS:
STEP 1: Create guideRNA Plasmid
Why
In our experiment, the production of differentially identifiable expression patterns is paramount. A library of promoters with robust expression patterns was required to achieve this. To further modulate the expression patterns, a promoter targeted short guide RNA (sgRNA)-Cas9 repression system was devised. These sgRNAs have a 20bp SEED region homologous to the promoter between the -10 and -35 box, a deactivated Cas9 associates with the sgRNA and is directed to the promoter through it’s homology, this will inhibit the RNA polymerase as it’s very large and bind with a high affinity. The strength of inhibition is proportional to the binding afinity of the SEED region.
A two vector based system was decided upon to express this system. One low copy vector will express the catalytically inactive Cas9 protein, promoters and a downstream reporter; the other will contain the sgRNAs and a high copy origin of replication (ori). Confining the sgRNAs to a separate vector is advantageous in that it can be easily substituted out for another vector, potentially detailing sgRNAs with a differing affinity to the promoter. This interchangeability can facilitate a ‘plug and play’ system to produce a multitude of expression levels with ease.
How
Refer to step 2 for plasmid construction.To select for a dual transformation, each vector backbone requires separate antibiotic resistances. Consequently, the high copy vector (containing sgRNAs) was given an erythromycin resistant cassette, the low copy backbone was given a Chloramphenicol resistance cassette. Each vector also required a gram-negative compatible ori. High copy ColE1 was present on the sgRNA vector to drive high expression and promoter inhibition. A low copy pSC101 ori was initially given to the other, as dCas9 is toxic in high concentrations. Another set of sgRNAs were designed to have no inhibitory activity, termed  sgRNA0s. The ‘seeds’ were not homologous to any of the promoter, whereas the other set were 100% homologous. This will act as a control, to signify how the expression will differ when inhibition is occurring."

Figure above: Engineered strains of E. coli being flushed with argon gas to create anaerobic conditions
Through our experiments, we concluded that:
•    Of the five E. coli strains tested, JM109 and WM1788 showed strongest nitrogenase activity.
•    The linear relationship between nitrogen fixation activity and time matches that seen in nature.
•    Optimal conditions: glucose as carbon-source, glutamate as nitrogen-source, LB as inoculating media, minimal M9 as testing media for GC assay, anaerobic environment at   30 °C for overnight preparation before acetylene reduction assay.
•    Troubleshoot a faulty reporter mechanism
•    Created a hybrid promoter
•    Ran light experiments that showed discernable fold change in on and off states with appropriate amounts of aTc.
In future, we intend to:
•    Alter conditions to increase activity in JM109 and WM1788
•    Determine a minimal nif cluster
•    Directly check and optimize light sensitive promoters
•    Adjust the leakiness of the light sensor system to not need aTc
•    Swap out the reporter protein with the nif cluster to get both systems working in conjunction.
•    Transition into cyanobacteria by transferring the genes with the nif cluster back into Synechocystis S. 6803.

The University of Wisconsin - Madison has long been a leader in research, innovation, and education.  With that reputation in mind, we have assembled a diverse team that will take part in the iGEM competition at MIT this fall.  The team is comprised of undergraduate biochemists, geneticists, microbiologists and engineers alike.  Our aim is to gain insight and knowledge in the field of genetic engineering.  We also hope that in the process we will do something no one else has done before.  This year, the Wisconsin iGEM team has selected ambitious projects based on the broad topic of biofuels.  More information on these projects can be found on this site.

After PCR was finished, the resulting products were mixed with 10 uL of 6x Loading Dye and split into two 30 uL products. Each sample was loaded into a 1% wt/vol agarose gel, along with 10 uL of 1 kbp GeneRuler DNA ladder, and ran for 20 minutes at 100V in 1x TAE buffer. (Note: only 6 lanes were on the gel, so the second 30uL product of the Device 3 PCR reaction was stored at -20, to be ran on a separate gel on Monday).
Gel was removed and imaged on an Invitrogen gel box. Pictures will be uploaded in results using cell phone camera.
Results
PCR shows high amplification of a 1kb band of each device, consistent with amplification of an expected 970 bp product in all devices using the same primer. Bands were cut and placed in eppendorf tubes.  Device 1 band had a weight of 188 mg, Device 2 had a weight of 199mg, and Device 3 had a weight of 103 mg. Device 3 has a second product that has not been run on a gel yet, resulting in lower weight amounts (and possibly lower yields).
The resulting PCR shows show proper amplification.  Bands were cut out and extracted using the Zymo Gel Recovery Kit , with the following protocol:

What is the problem?
Macrophage-mediated Inflammatory Disorders
Mediators of inflammation induced by macrophages are critical for a variety of human inflammatory disorders (Jou et al., 2013), such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Gout. Once activated macrophages actively secrete and cause an imbalance of cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of inflammation (Jou et al., 2013).
Gout
Gout is a painful and potentially disabling form of arthritis. The first symptoms are usually intense episodes of painful swelling in single joints, most often in the feet, especially the big toe, which turns red and warm. 50% of first episodes occur in the big toe, but any joint can be involved. The diagnosis of gout can be difficult, and often treatment plans must be adapted to each person, including nutritional education and use of drugs (Schumacher, 2015).
Gout affects the quality of life due to intermittent attacks and the potential of becoming chronic (Schumacher, 2015). This disease occurs in about 4% of American adults (about 6 million men and 2 million women; Arthritis Foundation, 2015).
This disease occurs when excess uric acid (a normal waste product) collects in the body, and urate crystals deposit in the joints. Certain foods (such as shellfish and red meats, alcohol in excess, sugary drinks and foods that are high in fructose) and drugs (such as low-dose aspirin, certain diuretics, and immunosuppressants used in organ transplants) may raise uric acid levels and lead to gout attacks (Schumacher, 2015).
Over time, increased uric acid levels in the blood may lead to deposits of urate crystals in and around the joints. These crystals can attract white blood cells, leading to severe, painful gout attacks and chronic arthritis. Uric acid also can deposit in the urinary tract, causing kidney stones (Schumacher, 2015).

These laws cover the protection of patients which was then introduced in the Civil code, organizational rules in medical sectors and guidelines to be put in place to protect people involved in medical research programs. In march 2002, patient rights are put in place and certain end of life guidelines are discussed. Futile medical care is banned. Ethic committees set up by the European Union also exist to complement these laws for example, the European Commission, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, the Inter-service Group on Ethics and EU policies, and the Executive Management for Research and Innovation
Specifically concerning synthetic biology, a European project called SYNBIOSAFE approved by the European Commission has focused on ethics and safety of synthetic biology. In 2012, it published an article concerning the bioethical and biosafety attentions in iGEM competitions. These two types of frameworks help the researcher to answer to many ethical questions in the clearest way possible. Therefore, not only law may limit synthetic biology. Aspects concerning Politics, Economy, and Philosophy could influence the bioethics questions.
Why do we need Ethics commitees? Interview with Mr FAUCHER
On the 29th of July, Savandara and Charlotte had the possibility to meet with Mr Jacques Faucher, doctor, priest and founder of the regional Ethics commitee ""l'Espace Bioéthique Aquitain"". Mr FAUCHER generously accepted to come to our lab at the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology (IECB) in order to talk to us about the importance of bioethics in the field of synthetic Biology.
When Mr Potter, American oncologist and surgeon, invents the word ethics in the 1970's and writes his book Bioethics: a bridge to the future he pioneers the questions to come asking himsef questions which go beyond medecine such as: does life have a future on this planet? Questions which have lead to the conclusion that not everything that can be done should be done. Since the modification of a plant's genome or of a unicellular organism's genome is tolerated, what about the human genome? In other words, are there barriers to put on living organisms? Should we have the right to experiment on humans in order to widen our knowledge on the human body? In the case of human clinical trials, ethical aspects are judged on the quality of the scientific protocol. It would not be ethical to use humans as tests if researchers are"

iGEM weekly meeting 4/8/12 Announcements: Isiah, Lab Manager – The next 2 weeks is about organizing the lab. We need to divvy up the remaining work. Expect Isiah’s email about the inventory in a few days. Isiah will just finish cleaning a few more things up and then the lab will be ready to go. 2 books will be created, one for the glycerol stock and another for primers/buffers/ etc. There will be a physical copy in lab and one digital one. Cara, Social, & Anthony, Treasurer – Thursday at 4 PM is the deadline for applying for SORF. WashU has not responded to Cara, so we will try to use Uros’ biobrick contact. We will not be able to take more than 2 trips, and 1 trip would be awesome and enough work. This trip would be great for human practices and collaboration. Cara will contact Northwestern. U Mich will ultimately collaborate with us, so that’s our option. We will apply for the money anyways, because even if we don’t use it the money will just get reallocated back to the SORF fund. The application will be about how the trip helps our human practices collaboration. Cara & Asha – contact Courtney O ‘Connor about funding deadlines. EC funding works similarly to SORF, but we need to check deadlines about that. Asha will be emailing Courtney (outgoing) and Troy (incoming).

The transformation control plate.
No colonies were expected to grow on this plate as no DNA was added to the cells for transformation
The transformation control (water) plate.
Instead of adding DNA, water was added instead. Therefore, no colonies should be growing on this plate either.
Looking at the two pictures above, it shows the transformation has been a success as colonies were growing on the plates where DNA was added. The plate where 200ul of the transformed bacteria were added, had more colonies growing as expected.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," But these natural occurring porines are only permeable for molecules like sugars smaller than 600 Da. And more importantly, implement of micF, an antisense ncRNA may inhibit the material diffusion through OmpF. Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
OprF represents one of the largest pore sizes on bacterial outer membranes, allowing diffusion of polysaccharides in a range of 2000 to 3000 Da. The overexpression of OprF in E. coli will drastically improve the antibiotic absorption capability, like antibiotic condensation occured in E. coli.
Viroporin: SCVE from SARS Virus Viroporins are similar to porins in that they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occurs between hydrophobic, transmembrane and alpha-helical domains of the proteins.
SCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria. SCVE is permeable for many small molecules, which is originately designed for apoptosis of cells triggered by virus. Implementation of SCVE in ROSE may potentially improve the permatilibty of small molecules including antibiotics.
Inhibition of Efflux System using CRIPSR Efflux system is a kind of mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic substances, microbiotics.
According to previous research, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic resistance, or multidrug resistance(MDR). For example, in E. coli, AcrAB efflux system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty. It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance, that is to inhibit the function of efflux system. In order to completely inhibit the major efflux system of E. coli in genetic level, CRIPSR would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.
Clutersted reularly interspacaed short palindromic repeats, abbreviated as CRIPSR, are some fragements in prokayotic DNA with short repeats. Natually, CRISPR/Cas system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRIPSR spacers"

We successfully improved an RFC10 compatible BioBrick linked to our project, characterised it experimentally and sent it off for judging. The BioBrick we were improving was BBa_K89001 , which was a BioBrick expressing the enzyme IaaH, involved in indole acetic acid synthesis. We improved the part by adding a HisTag and a SpyTag. The improved BioBrick number is BBa_K2710005 and more information about how we experimentally validated the improvement can be found on our improve page ."

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," on the farm are utter infection and claw disorders. The farmers treat udder infection (mastitis) themselves. For this they have antibiotics that they are allowed to inject in the cows. Most of the times this works, but sometimes it does not, then they have to call the veterinarian. They try to do most things by themselves to prevent high bills from the vet. With mastitis they then have to hand in milk for an antibiotic resistance test, this test takes 2-3 days until results come in on which antibiotics to use. Tjerkje wants a faster method and if she can do the test herself she would like to to save costs of the veterinarian.

Insights
The most common pathogens in livestock are E. Coli, Salmonella, Streptococcus aureus, Staphylococcus agalactiae
Trade-off between reducing antibiotic resistance or animal health. Farmers are trying to reduce misuse of antibiotics, but if they wait to long with treatment the illness could become worse, resulting in reduced animal health.
Changes
Look into Salmonella
Summary
Gerbrich studies animal sciences. She told us that E. Coli, Salmonella, Streptococcus aureus and Staphylococcus agalactiae are the most common pathogens in livestock farming. Giving preventive antibiotics is not allowed anymore, the rules to prescribe antibiotics are quite strict in the Netherlands for the dairy sector. Every year the veterinarian composes a plan together with the farmer, for which antibiotics are allowed to use for which illnesses. When a farmer wants to deviate from this plan the veterinarian needs to have a written declaration. Every antibiotics used needs to be registered. A farmer can thus inject the antibiotics himself, the challenge is that while farmers are trying to reduce antibiotic usage, on the other hand, if they wait to long with treatment the illness could become worse, resulting in reduced animal health.
We asked Gerbrich if there are possibilities to fight multi-resistant bacteria like the salmonella bacterium with antibiotics. She told us that there are still some antibiotics which are used only human. If the veterinarian decides it is necessary to use these, there can be an exception. It is however under strict supervision and noted down which veterinarian prescribes these antibiotics. If antibiotics can no longer be used because of stricter regulations, breeders should focus on health and robustness of the cow. Lower production of milk could also result in a healthier cow because the cow can put more energy in its own immune system. In order to bring the"

The measurement results are shown below.
1.5 mMGlutamate / 600 nm OD / 3h 100 mM IPTG
When the given data checked, it is obvious that the produced GadE is functional and makes E. coli survive in the acidic microenvironment in comparison to negative control results. Based on the data given, the E. coli with overexpressed GadE can survive in pH 2 gastric juice for 5-9 hours.
Acid Repellency
The main objective of this part of our project is to direct resistant E. Coli into the internal mucus layer where Helicobacter Pylori are abundant for a length of time. We will direct our E. Coli using the hydrogen ion difference between the stomach fluid and mucus layer. The PH of gastric juice is 2.0 whereas the pH of gastric mucus layer is 7.0. The chemoreceptor tlpb naturally found in the inner membrane of helicobacter pylori enable these bacteria to move away from acidic condition to a more neutral and basic environment. Therefore, we decided to use the TIpB protein and designed a biobrick for our E. Coli in order to ensure that our Bacteria reach the region where the helicobacter pylori are.
Background
Chemotaxis, movement toward or away from chemicals, is a universal attribute of motile cells and organisms.  E. coli cells swim toward amino acids (serine and aspartic acid), sugars (maltose, ribose, galactose, glucose), dipeptides, pyrimidines and electron acceptors (oxygen, nitrate, fumarate).
E. coli's optimal foraging strategy
In isotropic chemical environments, E. coli swims in a random walk pattern produced by alternating episodes of counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation (Fig. 3, left panel).  In an attractant or repellent gradient, the cells monitor chemoeffector concentration changes as they move about and use that information to modulate the probability of the next tumbling event (Fig. 3, right panel.  These locomotor responses extend runs that take the cells in favorable directions (toward attractants and away from repellents), resulting in net movement toward preferred environments.  Brownian motion and spontaneous tumbling episodes frequently knock the cells off course, so they must constantly assess their direction of travel with respect to the chemical gradient.

Carnegie_Mellon,2014,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," safe by policy controlling what water is safe for us to drink, US government and state policies do not currently require any testing or provide any safety limits for drugs such as estrogen in water. Although water providers believe the levels of these compounds to be safe, extensive research on the effects of decades of exposure has not yet been conducted.
There is increasing evidence that endocrine disruptors in the environment may be interfering with our bodies’ hormonal messenger system. The hormonal messenger system is incredibly complex and carefully regulated. There are a number of ways in which chemicals such as estrogens can disrupt the endocrine system. They can mimic or block the chemicals that are naturally found in the body, alter hormonal levels, and therefore affect the functions that these hormones control. The less direct interferences these compounds have include altering the body’s ability to produce hormones, interfering with the ways the hormones travel through the body, and changing the numbers of receptors.

Impact on the Economy
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted a joint study which calls for more research to fully understand the relationship between endocrine disrupting chemicals and specific disorders and diseases. The study’s report has indicated that with the assistance of better testing methods, potential disease risks could be reduced, thus significantly improving public health.
“Chemical products are increasingly part of modern life and support many national economies, but the unsound management of chemicals challenges the achievement of key development goals, and sustainable development for all,” said UN Under Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. Steiner explained how investing in new testing methods could be a great benefit to the current understanding of the costs of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals. It would also assist in maximizing benefits, reducing risks, and providing more intelligent options which would aid in a transition to a green economy.
Sustainably managing water resources requires financial resources, technical competence, and governance. It has been said that Switzerland “stands at the forefront of water protection worldwide”. They have made plans for river restoration and control of micropollutant discharge from wastewater treatment plans, and this is something that the U.S. would need to follow in order to move toward a green economy and reduce endocrine disrupting chemicals in drinking water.

Safety Problem
Implemented solution
Sterilization of the PCB
How do we clean the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) without damaging metalic and plastic components?
Well, we decided to copy what flow cabins do. Based on this, we decided to use UV led lights to achieve this objective. This idea was given by Mojica as a part of our intergrated human . Furthermore we have programmed an especial reaction that use little droplets with HCl and ethanol to clean and ensure we have perfectly sterilized the PCB which is protected by a plastic film as well and this feature prevents acid from attacking it.
Sterilization of the microfluidic tubes
The reaction fluid is going to pass through microfluidic tubes and it will contaminate them. To reverse this situation we will use the same special program wich usses droplets with ethanol and HCl.
Protection of the user
We want users to see what is happening inside Printeria but also we want them to be protected if something wrong happens inside. That is why we thought that a metacrilate box that covered the machine would be a nice option. Besides, it is useful to pin up the elements which will be part of Printeria.
Overheating of the PCB
As the PCB has a cold and a hot zone, it is necessary to evacuate the heat generated. The hot zone can achieve more than 80º degrees and can be a potencial danger. A resistance is responsible of heating, and a peltier plate is responsible of chilling. Peltier effect is based in a semiconductor metal where you apply a potential difference. Then, you create a hot part and a cold one in that semiconductor. We use the cold part to extract the energy and stabilize the temperature via conduction of the PCB's hot zone.
Ventilation
The peltier plate is responsible of chilling the PCB but how do we evacuate all the energy generated? Well, the answer is simple, Printeria just needed ventilation holes and watercooling to do it. Watercooling is based in the higher termic capacity of fluids (water in this case) to absorb energy. Water is pumped through microfluidic tubes to reach the peltier and chill it.
Electroporator
This device is capable to reach high voltages, so if you require one of these in your design first of all, ensure no one can harm himself/herself. This is the reason why we designed our own electroporator in a dedicated and compacted printed circuit to isolate it from any exposure. It can reach until 1600V,"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Coacervation_-_-_TEXT.html," $N$, and that we did not conveniently choose $N=400$ and $N=100$ to meet our statement. We saw in Figure 2 that the coacervate region in the $\sigma(\phi)$ plot “moved upwards” as we chopped up the polymers. First we rephrase the statement that $\sigma(\phi)$ “moved upwards” with decreasing $N$ as: for a fixed $\phi$, the point $\sigma(\phi)$ will be higher if $N$ is lower. This is equivalent to saying that for arbitrary $N>0$, $$\left(\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial N}\right)_\phi <0 $$ The subscript ""$\phi$"" means that $\phi$ is held constant. This reduces our proof to the exercise of proving that the derivative of $\sigma$ with respect to $N$ is always negative. After some basic calculus, we find $$\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial N}=- \frac{2}{3}\cdot \left(\frac{4\sqrt{\phi}}{3\alpha\phi}\right)^{2/3}\cdot N^{-2}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{N}+\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\right)^{-1/3}<0$$ Although the expression in the middle of the above inequality looks complicated, the important result is that it is the product of positive terms with a minus sign in front, and thus we conclude that any point on the curve $\sigma(\phi)$ “moves up” (that is, in the positive $\sigma$-direction) with decreasing $N$ as it did in Figure 2.
The theory presented so far has another important implication. Opposite to what you might expect, coacervates form only within a range of polymer concentrations. More polymers does, after some point, decrease the amount of coacervates. This may sound very counterintuitive, but as you can see for example in Figure 3, taking the system to be at point P and increasing the volume fraction of polymers $\phi$ will have the system move out of the coacervate region.
Figure 3: Increasing the polymer volume fraction moves the system out of the coacervate region. Imagine the system to be at point P in parameter space, and now increase the polymer volume fraction by adding polymers of the same charge density. This brings the system to point Q, which lies out of the coacervate region, meaning that the system will no longer form coacervates.

Project ideas – team members assigned to look into this projects
The team had gone through the top five projects in order to shortlist them. Progress with further research had been discussed.
[1] Computing DNA - Rachel, Zoltan, Steven
Zoltan had found a few relevant papers and told that even though there are plenty of papers available in the field, realising the final idea and solution will be difficult. Richard also suggested that it would be a difficult project.
[2] Microcracks in Concrete - Harsh, Da, Alan
Rachel told that Brussels made a glue before, however it was not used for concrete repair.
[3] BactoNatto, Teeth, Coating spores/BS - Rachel, Younus, Jannetta
Jannetta found some extra papers on tooth decay. MIT had a project where they used lactobacillus. More research is needed. Rachel had found the chemical flavouring of chocolate. It has been suggested that the projects mentioned in the title could be merged with the diabetes issue (therefore creating natto that solves many problems). This would allow us to have a selection of sub-projects with more chance of success.

Submission
Using the DNA carrier provided by iGEM, and the DNA to submit, digest and ligate them. But we failed. After analyzing, the reasons we suspect are as followed:
1.The concentration of the DNA is too low to make it,
2.The carrier provided by iGEM is useless because the linear carrier has low working efficiency.
As a result, we are going to have some meetings to solve it.
3.Using the part distribution to get the carrier annular carrier by Enzyme digestion, and put the first group of gene into the carrier by ligament.

6.Bioamplifier
A bioamplifier could help us to amplify the intensity of some signals that detected. According to the 2007 iGEM team from Cambridge v , a, so called, PoPS amplifier was built to increase the strength of the signalling system. However, we think we could improve the amplifier to be more sensitive and more specific and introduce the various colours indicating gradients of signal intensity. The project could be quite practical and work as a tool for future iGEM teams. A further improvement could be adding a control of the amount of colour intensity increased corresponding to the signal it received. A simple example could be the volume control knob on the stereo.
7.Display device
This project also involves quorum sensing system and the colour proteins mentioned by last year’s iGEM team from Cambridge iv . We will generate several different kinds of E.coli type and cultivate them in array in certain order. So when a specific chemical diffused into each culture, some culture might have no response at all but others might express a coloured protein accordingly.  The coloured colonies as a whole will display a given character, such as alphabets or numbers. But if another chemical is involved, it might cause a different expression of proteins in some other colonies, and then a different character will be shown.
8.Bio Timer
Could your timer in the kitchen be a biological based device? This project aims to design a Bio timer using quorum sensing and band detection based on a research group in Princeton University vi . A general idea is to cultivate 12 colonies on a plate, and the timer will be initiated by adding some AHL. After one hour, the first colony will show colour and produce more AHL sending to the next colony. The band detection technique prevents the backward of signal detection. So, the bio timer could show hour by hour difference for half day. It could be improved if time measurement is based on oscillation instead of diffusion of signalling substances vii .

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," 11: Meeting with Dr. John Aikens (Former CEO, Proterro)
Dr. John Aikens, former CEO of Proterro, talked about how one of the main paradigms of Proterro’s experimental design was the separation of growth and stationary phases, where cyanobacteria would start secreting product upon reaching stationary phase. This was due to rerouting the carbon flux early on, endangering the cyanobacteria themselves. We used this model as an inspiration for our experimental design in Part III, where sucrose production can be easily induced at stationary phase in response to certain environmental stimuli. However, at the same time, he stressed how cyanobacteria are extremely under-studied and that most promoters need further characterization. As a result, we wanted to characterize many promoters to help further the cyanobacterial synthetic biology community, and made that a main goal of our project. He informed us that it was desirable to have high CO2 input to reduce total amount of cyanobacteria and water needed, although this was not necessary. He also suggested using carbon dioxide controlled conditions, which prompted us to secure a cell culture incubator. Moreover, he informed us that contamination is almost guaranteed once cyanobacteria start making sucrose, mostly by skin-related germs. This comment encouraged us to use cell culture level precaution and techniques. Lastly, Dr. Aikens addressed some potential issues of working with cyanobacteria, one of which was polyploidy. One method he recommended was E. coli  conjugation, but explained that despite its effectiveness, that it was a time consuming process. To counteract this issue, our team suggested using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which he was very enthusiastic about. He also emphasized the importance of experimenting with a fast-growing strain, which we sought out. 
May 13: Correspondence with Hung Li (Martin) (Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University)
Based on the knowledge and advice of people we met with up until this point, we have some concerns regarding the length of time cyanobacterial transformation takes. Thus, we considered using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to insert our genes and promoters of interest into cyanobacteria. We reached out to Hung Li who is a part of the Department of Chemical Engineering of National Tsing Hua University and is a PhD student of Professor Hu, the first to research on CRISPR-Cas9 with PCC 7942 in 2016.

Brasil-SP,2014,Team:Brasil-SP#Project#Device_-_-_TEXT.html," biochemical or inorganic detection reactions commonly used on microfluidic chips, our microchip design is centered on the problem regarding the GMO that will do the biodetection reaction and produce the output signal. We defined the following set of specifications that our device must have:
it must be a trustful biosafe containment structure;
the liquids involved on the biodetection methodology must be transported and mixed without the use of pumps, they are:
the bacillus spores;
the nutrient solution for spores germination;
the protease solution;
a disinfectant solution;
it must be an easy-to-use device;
the blood must be easily filtered to separe the serum fom the cells.
Considering the existence of accessible solutions on blood fractionation without the need of a centrifuge[4][5], and also because the process could be easily done with accessible resources (like a egg beater, see reference [6]), we didn't considered the serum separation a major limitant on the diodetection process. So we choosed to focus the design on the other cited specifications. As a disinfectant solution an ideal option should be Virkon, a solution commonly used on hospitals for cleaning harzadous spills. It effectiveness against bacterial spores is well documented on literature, specially on Bacillus genus [11].
Prototype Design
The core of the proposed microchip design is the manual operation. The popularization of eletronic devices like cellphones or even cheap little radios fostered the everyday natural notion of devices operation by pushing buttons. This concept is used as a main insight for our biodetection device focusing on the ease of operation. After brainstromming thinking on a user-centered approach, it was sketched a novel concept of microfluidic chip for disease biodetection based on fluid transportation by pressure variation on membranes pushed using human fingers force.

Fabrication Options
We evaluated three main options of material for manufacturing a prototype device: glass, low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC, or ""green ceramics"") and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). We selected the PDMS material because its elastic properties, convenient for membrane constrution [7], despite reports on literature of LTCC devices with ceramic diaphragms [8], that certainly are not suitable for the task; other disadvantage of LTCC is the material opaque characteristic. It was also considered the ease on prototyping and precision on the channels construction, and this is why glass wasn't treated as the more appropriate option [9], at least for microchannels construction .

Our Journey
 
''If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go  together.''
- African proverb -
  The beginning of our journey
 
When we first saw that The National Institute of Chemistry was looking for team members  to present the colours of Slovenia iGEM HS Division, we thought it would be a great  opportunity to do what something we were interested in and learn something new. We  applied to the call for applications and hoped for the best. Parts of the application  procedure were writing a motivational letter, attending an interview, taking part in a  personality test and, the toughest of them all, solve a scientific problem.
 14 months ago, we knew nothing about synthetic biology because we only learned the  basics in our biology and chemistry classes. We had no clue how demanding the project is  going to be at the time.
Building a knowledge basis
 
When we started with our team meetings in September and October 2014,  we first had to  learn the basics of biochemistry and biotechnology.  Through autumn and winter we have  had having lessons two afternoons per week after school. We learned about cloning,  plasmids, PCR and biobricks. Moreover, we learned how to edit wiki pages, use  bioinformatics programs and data bases. At the same time we were also studying the  additional literature and developing our ideas. We learned about E. coli, conditions for its  optimal growth and bioreactors. Finally, we got to enter the labs where we practiced basic  lab techniques and protocols, such as pipetting with micropipettes. We also cut the vectors  with restriction enzymes for the first time and tested our samples using agarose gel  electrophoresis.  It needless to say how fascinated we were when we were actually able to  see several pieces of DNA of different lengths.  It was a great experience because we were tutored by university professors and scientists  who were really able to explain to us everything thoroughly.
So Let’s get to work!
 
Afterwards we decided to divide in two working groups: biotechnologists and synthetic  biologists"
Duesseldorf,2016,Team:Duesseldorf#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," about such topics? Those were questions we wondered about, so we decided to create and conduct a survey to answer those questions. The survey was conducted online and face to face in Düsseldorf’s downtown.

They were seeking ideas that were original and realisable, and we were selected as one of six presenters from numerous applications. In just 30 seconds, one of our team members communicated the benefits of using synthetic biology as a tool to create a renewable alternative for production of hydrogen fuel to a global audience.
The reach of our pitch at this event was huge. With hundreds of attendees in the live audience, thousands more watching at satellite events around the country and it was also broadcasted globally on a live simulcast stream. Additionally, the event was uploaded onto YouTube and has so far reached 1,317 views.
Conferences
Synthetic Biology Australasia Conference (SBA)
The Synthetic Biology Australasia (SBA) Conference 2017 was attended by the team, and our iGEM project was showcased in a presentation. Not only did we gain the opportunity to share our work with experts in synthetic biology, but we were able to watch inspiring presentations on exciting new research in the field and received great advice regarding the ethics involved with our project.  We were very fortunate to meet Dr John Glass from the Craig Venter Institute, who gave us much appreciated advice on presenting our work.
Additionally, the conference gave us the opportunity to meet iGEM teams from Usyd, Melbourne, and Auckland at a social event organised by iGEM HQ Representative Abigail Sison.
Australasian Conference of Undergraduate Research (ACUR)
Team members were accepted to present our research in a 10 minute presentation at the Australasian Conference of Undergraduate Research (ACUR) 2017. We were able to communicate our research findings to many people, with the conference having a high attendance with approximately 100 speakers alongside judges and guests. At the conclusion of our presentation we were asked many questions from the audience, which allowed us to understand the concerns people have and address these in our final design.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA was analyzed using DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. L and HR correspond to GeneRuler 1kb and High Range DNA Ladders.
The next step was to identify if reference nucleotides - in this case 5-methylcytidine triphosphates (5mC) are accessible to phi29 polymerase and do not inhibit the reaction. Once again 50 pL droplets were formed containing MDA reaction reagents as previously, only this time it contained 300 uM concentration of methylated instead of simple dCTP molecules. The generated emulsion is incubated off chip at 30oC for 6 hours. As seen from the amplified DNA analysis on agarose gel (Fig. 12), the methylated nucleotides pose no problem for the reaction to occur and produce a heavier (expected because of additional -CH3 group) DNA fragments. These results conclude that 5-methylcytidines can be used as reference nucleotides, which can be differentiated from other forms of cytidine nucleotides during nanopore sequencing.
Figure 13. Analysis of activity amplification reaction product.The concept of catalytically converted nucleotide incorporation (activity recording) was tested by performing in bulk (20 µL) or droplet (50 pL) MDA reactions. Both of the reaction were incubated 30oC for 6 hours. 1. No primer contro; 2. MDA reaction with standard cytidine nucleotides; 3. MDA reaction with substrate nucleotides as the only source of cytidines; 4. MDA reaction with substrate nucleotides as the only source of cytidines with added CAT-Seq esterase enzyme. L and HR correspond to GeneRuler 1kb and High Range DNA Ladders.
When the working concentration of the MDA reaction have been established in droplets, we ought to test the simplified approach of our system. For this, our catalytic biomolecule of interest, which catalyzes the hydrolysation of substrate bound nucleotides was purified using 6x histidine tag. MDA reactions containing substrate nucleotides as the only source of cytidine triphosphate (no reference nucleotides) were performed in bulk and 50 pL droplets with or without the addition of extracted enzyme. The amplified DNA product agarose gel analysis results prove, that the presence of added enzyme enable the MDA reaction to take place. The substrate bound nucleotides are inaccessible to phi29 polymerase meaning that the reaction mix is missing 1"

In order to find a solution, one must first have a problem. Some of the problems we tackled included genetically engineered machine awareness, arsenic contamination, and safety.
We are aware that the community is not familiar with the science behind iGEM. Once our device is completed, we plan to take the knowledge learned in the lab to the area's high schools. Already more awareness has spread, but there will be more awareness when our team members spread the word about iGEM.
Our team focused on creating a device that can benefit societies that have had arsenic contamination. Our device is made to be used in the real world.
From the beginning of the project up to the very end, all team members took precautions in order to protect human safety. Our project does not not raise issues on safety.

RecA Project Sensor Project Reporter Project
Abstract
     Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor or the Chernobyl reactor. Penn State’s team project will focus on using a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to develop a robust and reliable biosensor which utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch coupled with a fast-acting reporter capable of producing an easily visible effect. We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.
     Our hope is that the basis of our biological dosimeter system will prove to be an effective genetic system capable of detecting harmful levels of radiation and relaying it to those working in the field or affected area. We envision our system not only being useful in such applications, but also being capable of further expansion and evolution through the expanding field of synthetic biology.
Overall project: Bacterial Dosimeter
Radiation of one form or another is a constant presence throughout our every day lives. Radiation, or the transmission and absorption of energy over a given distance, has proven an invaluable technology useful in applications for everything from heating our food to diagnosing and treating diseases. Some forms of radiation, however, can be detrimental to the human body, as they are a common cause of such diseases as radiation poisoning and cancer.
All types of radiation can be divided into two categories: non-ionizing and ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation (consisting of radio, micro, infrared, and visible electromagnetic waves) contains less energy and has a relatively small effect on living organisms that has only recently been studied. Ionizing radiation, however, contains a much greater amount of energy capable of ionizing atoms which can lead to harmful effects on living tissue. This category of radiation encompasses alpha and beta decay as well as neutron, X-ray, and gamma radiation.
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team.

Ethical question
Last week we discussed a more theoretical philosophical model on our attitudes towards nature. In this week’s session our opinions also play a central role. It appears that all of us have very different attitudes towards the goals of the project, the values that play a role and the responsibilities we have, while at first, in the very first value sensitive design session, we appear to have quite similar ideas. Time to reflect upon the Value Sensitive Design within iGEM. The question of this week:
Was value sensitive design useful and can it, should it, and if yes, how should it return in future project of the TU Delft or any other iGEM team’s project?
It appears that at first, the team was somewhat sceptical about the incorporation of ethical issues in very early stages of design, especially when no real project has been selected. Then, after the project was determined, no ethical review was carried out this year. For a complete ethical analysis of the iGEM project, including ethics at this decision making step is also necessary.
For future projects, introducing ethics may be interesting, also since the benefits are recognized by the students and supervisors. An ethical ""review form"" was suggested as a suitable format to ensure moral issues are considered in all stages of design. To incorporate it in the whole competition, is probably still a bridge too far, at least at this moment.

Abstract
Microfluidic devices were designed and fabricated to characterize the signal transmission in the developed IOD band system. The signal transmission was characterized using spatially separated cell cultures inside a single microfluidic channel in conjunction with live fluorescence microscopy. Plasmids coding for a synthetic reporter protein were transformed into signal-receiving cells to show activation of its yeast pheromone pathway. The on-chip characterization was used to evaluate the signal transmission range and its evolution in time. In addition, special microfluidic topologies were designed and fabricated to test yeast-induced agglutination on-chip to lower the time and sample volume requirements. Agglutination tests were performed with synthetic yeast strains inducing blood agglutination by displaying the human antigen A antibody (anti-HuA) on its surface. The yeast strains were designed and synthesised by Module 3 . The amount of blood required for the experiment was approximately 5 μl. The overall experiment duration did not exceed 60 seconds.
Key Achievements
Set of microfluidic devices fabricated by PDMS soft-lithography.
Characterization of signal transmission range between wildtype MATa and MATx Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.
Dynamic characterisation of signal transmission between synthetic MATa and MATx Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.
Demonstrated yeast induced blood agglutination on-chip by human antigen A antibody (anti-HuA) displayed on cell surface by Yeast Surface Display.
Introduction
The diffusion processes are slow, and the inertial effects are negligible on micro-scale with low Reynolds number [Angelescu2011] . Hence microfluidics enables complex control of the intercellular microenvironment. Microfluidic experiments in conjunction with live fluorescence microscopy were designed and performed to verify and characterize the signal transmission mechanism in the developed IOD band system, and to verify the developed yeast-induced blood agglutination mechanism.
Soft-lithography
Fabricated microfluidic devices (three PDMS molds bonded to single glass slide)

Mentoring from KUAS
We had a team meet-up with the collegiate team KUAS_Korea at Korea University for mentorship and exchanging ideas. Firstly, each team briefly presented their project to the other team. KUAS_Korea’s project was about demonstrating the game theory in a biological context, using two different synthetically modified bacterial strains. After the presentation, members from each team provided advice, critiques, and recommendations for the other team so that both teams could improve their projects. Although the content was from different tracks, we were able to get practical feedback on our presentation. Some of the advice included that our project need not focus on the commercialization of our product, which is a heart failure immunosensor, as we are a high school team. It was suggested that manifesting our passion and efforts toward achieving our experimental procedure are sufficient enough. After participating in iGEM for more than ten years, KUAS_KOREA gave our team practical advice on Giant Jamboree requirements and informed us on many previous mistakes they have witnessed over years of Giant Jamboree participation. In addition, KUAS_Korea generously gave advice on wiki development, project presentation, human practices, judging criteria, and many other aspects. Finally, we were given the opportunity to visit the lab at Korea University. Thanks to this meaningful discussion and collaboration which helped our team not only to improve upon specific aspects of our project but also taught us how to perform better for the Giant Jamboree.
Proof-Reading Help
We would like to thank Nottingham iGEM for their invaluable collaboration on our project. Nottingham iGEM very kindly offered their grammar checking services, as native English speakers for our wiki. We collaborated intensely over the summer months, sending their team drafts and redrafts of our wiki submissions. Their team generously supported us, editing our drafts over and over until the grammar was perfect! We could not be more grateful for Nottingham iGEM's invaluable collaboration on this project. It has been a pleasure collaborating with them and their help with our iGEM project was vital to our team's success.

Designing an RBS library with the constraints that were present in our constructs was very difficult and Iman helped us to understand and solve this problem.  Iman taught the Biodetoxification group the protocol for Gibson CBA and homologous recombination. Dr. Salis provided modifications to the protocol using the Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid.
Wiki Support
Chiam Yu was helpful with advice. Ashlee spent a lot of time surfing the internet and found tutorials and resources for html and CSS. None of us have experience with creating a website prior to iGEM so it was quite a daunting task.
Presentation Coaching
Dr. Howard Salis and Dr. Tom Richard both improved our presentation skills.
Kay Dimarco (staff) helped us to find activity kits from the previous iGEM team, which we ended up reinventing but were a source of inspiration for our presentation to the science teachers and the ScienceU students. Matt Johnson (staff) and Leah Bug (staff) gave us advice on our NewBio Teachers presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools.
Policy and Practices Support
Dr. Tom Richard helped us to refine and implement our ideas for human practices topics.

Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
No. None of our software projects raise research, public, or environmental safety issues.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
No. We do not plan to develop new parts in our projects.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at our institution?
We do not plan to conduct any wet experiments that involve DNA manipulation. Our instructors and advisors think our projects do not raise any safety problems.
4. Do you have any other ideas to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
It might be helpful if there are more comprehensive learning materials that promote awareness of biosafety issues. It would be more desirable if the materials are interactive, as users can actively learn with fun.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#coli_-_-_TEXT.html," necessary for optimal laccase activity.
ECOL CuCl2 concentration
Another test of ECOL was done to survey the best CuCl2 concentration for the activity of the purified ECOL laccase. 0.03  mg mL-1 protein were incubated with different CuCl2 concentration ranging from 0 to 0.7 mM CuCl2. Activity tests were performed with the incubated samples, in 100 mM sodium actetate buffer (pH 5), 0.1 mM ABTS, to a final volume of 200 µL. The activity was measured at 420 nm, 25°C and over a time period of 10 hours. As expected the saturation takes place after 5 hours (see Figure 16). The differences in the activity of ECOL laccase incubated in different CuCl2 differ minimal. The highest activity of ECOL laccase is observed after incubation with 0.4 mM CuCl2 (42% of added ABTS). With a higher concentration of 0.7 mM CuCl2 the activity seems to be reduced (only 41% ABTS got oxidized). This leads to the assumption that CuCl2 supports the ECOL laccase activity but concentrations exceeding this value of CuCl2 may have a negative impact on the ability of oxidizing ABTS. Without any CuCl2 application ECOL laccase show less activity in oxidizing ABTS (see Figure 16). This fits the expectations as laccases are copper reliant enzymes and gain their activity through the incorporation of copper. Additionally negative controls were done using the tested concentrations of CuCl2 but no laccase was added to detect the oxidization of ABTS through copper (see Figure 17). The more CuCl2 was present, the more ABTS was oxidized after 5 hours. Still the maximal change accounts only for ~6% oxidized ABTS after 5 hours.
Figure 16: Activity measurement using 0.1 mM ABTS of ECOL incubated in different CuCl2 concentrations. Incubation with 0.1 mM CuCl2 or higher concentrations leads to an increase in ABTSox.
Figure 17: Negative control for CuCl2 activity Tests using different concentrations of CuCl2 H2O instead of laccase to determine the potential of ABTS getting oxidized through CuCl2.
In relation to apply the laccase in waste water treatment plants it is beneficial knowing, that small amounts of CuCl2 are enough to activate the enzymes. This reduces the cost factor"

Collaborations
This year, we collaborated with 3 iGEM teams of 2018, be showing as follows, and we participated in China 5th CCiC held in Shanghai. We helped each other and shared some good ideas concerning our projects, and we got some fantastic inspirations.
1.Collaboration with OUC-China
According to our appointment with OUC-China, We printed and propagandized the E.coli cartoon designed by OUC-China to the new students on the club recruitment day at our school. Many students are attracted by this cartoon book. It introduces complex Synthetic Biology with vivid pictures and words, which enable more students to learn about Biology and fall in love with it. We imparted some biological knowledge in the E.coli cartoon in detail for those new biological fan.
2.Collaboration with SKLMT-China
With the invitation of SKLMT-China, we made a contribution to the construction of Pseudomonas fluorescence promoter pool. With the help of report gene firefly luciferase, we managed to test the intensity of different promoters. This helped SKLMT-China team to build up promoter pool, which aimed to collect intensity data of promoter under different lab conditions. The process of cooperation enables us to learn from one another and achieve satisfying results.
Using the BERTHOLD Mithras LB 940 instrusment,  showed in the left, we sbtained some valuable results.  These results are showing as follows.

3.Collaboration with NEU-China-A
This year, NEU China A aims to design a biological system against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and potential colorectal cancer(CRC) by using engineered probiotics. To put out the fire in the gut, E.coli Nissle 1917 is selected as their firemen. They empower it with an anti-inflammatory device in their project. And we donated the E.coli Nissle 1917 to them.

Berlin_diagnostX,2017,Team:Berlin diagnostX#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," our idea and their thoughts on T. solium. Many physicians, in particular Dr. Dilip Mishra (picture), were very interested in a rapid diagnostic test and we agreed to a joint research project. While we were still on site, we visited the research facilities and planned how to isolate RNA from T. solium in this environment. Our plan was to disrupt the eggs using the highly corrosive detergent “QIAzol” and a homogenizer.
Subsequently, we planned to ship the lysate containing the worm’s RNA in QIAzol to Germany for further purification and analysis. However, we realized the difficulties to export a shipment containing biological compounds and a phenolic agent. For this reason, we traveled to Delhi to meet iGEM IIT Delhi. Together with the Delhi-Team, we established an RNA isolation pipeline. This posed to be a real challenge, because regular RNA isolation kits are not developed for temperatures above 40°C. After successful isolation, the RNA is dissolved in water and for this reason easy to ship.
After our return to Germany, Dr. Mishra obtained intact eggs from Taenia Solium. With the equipment and technical advice, he created RNA-Lysates from these eggs for the first time. Unfortunately, the export of the lysates stabilized with QIAzol took three months due to difficulties to acquire the needed certificates. Thanks to the help of iGEM IIT Delhi, we were ultimately able to ship the samples to Germany, to extract the RNA from the Lysates. Finally, the sequencing core facility of the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin,  generated two libraries from the RNA and to sequenced it using Next-Generetion-Sequencing on a HiSeq5000. Sequencing yielded 96 million reads that characterize  a unique sample of T. solium eggs. To our knowledge, we are the first to report a method direct RNA isolation from T. solium eggs without a manipulative hatching procedure and to perform transcriptome analysis thereof. This information is crucial for the development of diagnostic tests.
Simultaneously, we wrote an application to the institutional review boards to gain ethical consent for a clinical study. We received ethical consent from both boards. To our knowledge, we are the first iGEM team to write an application and received the ethical approval for a clinical study. Throughout this study, we will accompany social workers, that provide tapeworm-chemoprophylaxis to villages and recruit volunteers for a stool sample prior to receiving chemoprophylactic treatment.

Ariel Ragetli
Major and Year:
Major in Biochemistry (3rd Year)
Why iGEM:
I heard about iGEM from my second year Biochemistry teaching assistant who told me about past project ideas and the basic design of the program. I was intrigued by the idea of creating machines, little bacteria, that could solve complex problems.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to refine my laboratory technique and get the opportunity to work with people vastly more knowledgeable in the world of research and synthetic biology to expand my own knowledge base as well as get the chance to help create something tangible that could potentially have some impact on the world around us.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted to solve a complex problem, in the context of human diseases, and to physically see the impact of that solution on the people affected.
Hobbies:
Learning Japanese, I have been to Japan twice in my life and am intrigued by the culture and the language. I plan on spending an extended period of time in Japan at one point in my life, and I am continuously practicing and improving my conversational to that end .

Daniel Korvin
Major And Year:
Microbiology and Immunology with a Minor in Biochemistry Graduated May 2014
Why iGEM:
I first heard of iGEM through a friend back in 2009. At the the time, I thought he was crazy. 'E. Coli cultures lighting up like traffic lights!?'. Two years later, in 2011, I stumbled across the openwetware wiki while doing research for a project, and this led me to the iGEM page. After seeing the kinds of incredible projects that had been attempted over the years, I was hooked, and knew that I had to join the UBC team at the next available opportunity.
Hope to gain from iGEM:
I hope to improve my understanding of engineering principals in biology and build on my modelling knowledge base, these tools will help me work towards a masters degree in chemical and biological engineering.
What Inspires you:
Everything to do with microbes, especially the application of metabolic engineering to microbes, ask my team mates about chicken sexing or electrobacter and they will tell you!
Hobbies:
My interests include growing and showing off stylish goatees"

Digest protein A and IgG protease on gel
I ran previously digested protein A and IgG protease in an agarose gel 1 % (110 V) in order to do a gel clean up. This was because I did not obtain good results from colony PCR of previously ligated protein A with IgG protease (fusionprotein). Therefore, I redo the ligation and transformation into e.coli, however I this time include a gel clean up of the digested samples in order to exclude interfering material in the tube when ligating.
In addition I found out from the sequencing that the protein A I have in the bank vector does not consist of two Z domains (ZZ domain), instead I only have one of the domains (Z domain, 180 nt).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive"

Having been through a happy period in Hong Kong, we get our certification to MIT. Every team worked so hard, and everybody are all so friendly. Of course it is important that we get a gold medal and the certification to go to American, but what really matters is what we saw, who we met, and what we had been through. The whole competition had become a great celebration for every member of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Before our team was founded, we heard that a great deal of energy and money has been consumed in fermentation to cool down the fermenter. There are almost 100,000,000 Yuan wasted every year all around China. So, we planned to design a chassis host which can work in higher temperature with the production of heat controlled.
We have extracted new heat shock proteins (HSPs) from thermophilic bacteria. Then we combine it with an RNA thermometer, letting the HSPs be translated at a suitable temperature to release the burden of the cell in its logarithmic phase.
BIT-China is founded in 28th Feb and our slogan is ‘for one green earth’. To settle the problem of energy consumption of cooling system in fermentation, we set up two artificial systems with the method of synthetic biology.

Human Practice collaboration
We have worked together with the University of Exeter and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) since the early development of our Mars-oriented human practice and have been able to influence and troubleshoot with each other. With the first skype call taking place on 23 of June between Copenhagen and Exeter and DTU joining in not much later, we've been able to work together over a longer period and use each others connections and knowledge.
Together we have made a report trying to answer some of the biggest questions concerning space travel and colonization of Mars. Together with DTU we hosted an event during the danish public cultural and educational event ""Kulturnatten"" in collaboration with the Planetarium. The event was planned and executed as a joint venture between our two teams and was based on research done for our collaborative report and materials made by both teams. We have also participated in a lot of iGEM events where we have gotten to meet a lot of fellow iGEM'ers! At the European Meetup we also hosted a workshop.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," of synthetic biology for energy supply, starting from future society-scenario’s created the day before. The nice thing about this approach was that we learned about the perspectives of people with different backgrounds, ranging from scientists to business people. It felt like we all started on the same page. The ideas that were most appealing were later worked out in different groups. Lisa and I worked on a scenario, “the green human”, where humans would evolve together with plants to be able to rely on photosynthesis for energy. Of course this scenario is very futuristic, but in our opinion it exposes a very important aspect of both energy transition and synthetic biology: that the public should be involved, to be more conscious about energy use and more engaged with technological advances in the field of synthetic biology.
April – Meetings with DAE students
As mentioned in the collaboration section, we designed our project with the help of students from the Design Academy Eindhoven. Apart from collaborating with them on designing the future end product BeeT, they helped us think about our project and its connection with society. We met with them twice: The first time, we visited them and took part in a design workshop. We talked about our ideas for our iGEM projects - at that time there were still a lot of ideas on the table. The students helped us realize what other “non-science” people think about synthetic biology. The second meeting was a lab day for them to see what our everyday life in the lab looks like. It was fun sharing our knowledge with them. On this day, we especially realized what kind of prejudices a lot of people have towards GMOs. At the end of the day, we learned what aspects we should pay special attention to when presenting our project to the broad public. Moreover, we were able to convince the students that synthetic biology is in fact something good rather than something threatening.
One of the students gave us the opportunity to have a “real life bee experience”. The aim of this project was to study group dynamics, stress, and teamwork. The task was to prepare a dish (Baklavah) like bees would do it.

Plasmid verification:
L, pR1, pR2, pC1 and pC2 are the DNA-fragments from ladder solution, the two samples of pgRNA and pdCas9, respectively. From Figure 1 the two fragments with 1.5 kb and 1.0 kb were found from the fragments of pgRNA after digestion by BspHI. The fragment with 100 bp from the digested pgRNA is not visible on the gel, probably due to masking of the dye colour at the bottom of the gel. Two bands from the digested pdCas9 with 2.7 kb and 4 kb were also detected. By comparing the results og gel elecrophoresis obtained from today's experiment with the results from day 3 (22. June. 2018), one can clearly see that the bands with the expected length from successful transformed competent cells, are much clearer. Hence, this also indicate the samples from the successful transformed DH5α cells are purer, which is also true by comparing the results from Nanodrop (see day 6 - 27. June. 2018, and day 3 - 22. June. 2018).

DNP Biosensor
Scroll down to read more
2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) is commonly used as a dye, wood preservative and pesticide 1. One of the effects on humans after oral exposure of DNP is weight loss and it has therefore been used in diet pills2, however, it has multiple negative effects, such as nausea, vomiting, sweating and dizziness, leading to death3. A Global Health Warning has been issued after several deaths have occurred in the UK caused by DNP overdose3.
Our biosensor for DNP relies on the actions of laccase, an enzyme that can degrade DNP. The low redox potential of laccase, along with the use of a mediator, can expand the range of substrates oxidised by the enzyme4. In our biosensor, ABTS is used as a mediator, which is also a substrate for laccase5. When laccase is paired with ABTS, laccase activity causes the production of ABTS radicals which have a blue colour which in turn indicates laccase activity. When there is another substrate present that can compete with ABTS for binding laccase, fewer ABTS radicals are produced. Therefore, the blue colour produced is less intense in the presence of DNP due to competitive inhibition of the two substrates.
This detection method requires two biosensors, one control biosensor to which only water will be applied and another for the actual sample. Our DNP biosensor uses crude cell lysate from cells expressing the sequence confirmed laccase CBD fusions which is then washed with PBS to purify the enzyme. A solution containing 0.2mM ABTS and 100mM sodium acetate buffer at pH5 is then added to the biosensor and is freeze-dried onto paper. A dark blue colour in the control will appear as soon as the biosensor is rehydrated. A"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," the wildtype but kept constant between the three distinctive designs. These regions were discovered to be the most frequent occurring -35 and -10 regions in native E. coli promoters by Harley and Roberts in 1987. The sequences between such converged regions were kept constant as per the wildtype for designs 2 (P2) and 3 (P3). For design 1 (P1) however, they were randomized in order to test its effect. The decision to reduce the number of base pairs from 18, found in PLac, to 17 was made due to the results of the study by Harley and Roberts in 1987, listing this number to be the most frequent occurring number of base pairs gap found in regions in native E. coli promoters.
Design 1 (P1) was made by randomizing all elements of the promoter while only keeping the -35 and -10 regions constant. The upstream element (US element) of P2 were randomized while keeping the downstream element (DS element) conserved as per wildtype. The DS element of P3 however, was randomized while keeping the upstream element conserved. This systematic approach of randomization was chosen as it allows for the most variation between promote designs allowing for a rich synthetic promoter library.
Figure 3: Image Detailing Promoter Designs.
In order to implement these synthetic promoter detector variants into the Sensynova platform, designs were made by replacing the IPTG detection module of our framework with the promoter library.
Figure 4: SBOL Visual Detailing Detector Promoter Variants
Implementation
The promoter designs were sent off for synthesis by IDT as single stranded oligos.
Using Q5 PCR , the three designs P1, P2, and P3 were converted into double stranded DNA. Once PCR purified, samples were restrict digested using EcoRI and SpeI. Digests were subject to gel electrophoresis .
The plasmid backbone, BBa_J61002, was digested using EcoRI and XbaI and purified following gel electrophoresis .
Promoter designs were assembled into BBa_J61002 using BioBrick cloning. Ligations were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells and grown overnight .
Colony PCR was performed to check ligations. Colonies picked for this protocol were streaked onto a LB-agar plate.
Colonies were picked from streaked plates and cultures were prepared for miniprepping . DNA samples were then sent off for sequencing to ensure that the constructs were correct. Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .

Gold criteria
Cyano and Co-culture expert Daniel Ducat
In the beginning of our work with the three “Trinity” organisms we stumbled across several questions:  How should the growth media be composed?
How can we effectively use our cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus as a sugar producer?
How can we prevent the other organisms from overgrowing S. elongatus?
The synthesis of sugars in S. elongatus, especially aiming at a co-culture with heterotrophic organisms, has previously been shown by Dr. Daniel C. Ducat from Michigan State University. His Synechococcus cscB strain produces and exports sucrose in salt stress media. During our brainstorming sessions at the beginning of our iGEM journey, this strain was often named as a main example for the use of cyanobacteria in a co-culture. Finally, we decided to contact Dr. Ducat and asked him for advice and good ideas regarding co-cultures with cyanobacteria.
Luckily, he was on a symposium visit in Germany in May 2018 and offered to visit us and provide us with the cscB strain. In a private meeting, he suggested to use a sps (sucrose phosphate synthase) overexpressing Synecchococcus strain. Thus, we would be able to have sucrose production and export, without having to induce high salt stress in the culture media with NaCl. Although sucrose production would be less effective we could prevent the negative effects of salt stress regarding our heterotrophic bacteria and fungi.
In one of Dr. Ducat’s publications (A synthetic, light-driven consortium of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria enables stable polyhydroxybutyrate production, 2017) , he used barium alginate beads to encapsulate cyanobacteria to enhance sucrose export. We were interested in using these beads as another option for co-culturing methods besides solid and liquid culture. Dr. Ducat provided us with a protocol for creating these beads and suggested to encapsulate all of our “trinity” organisms.  Most importantly, he suggested M2 as a co-culture medium to us, which is derived from the cyanobacterium medium BG11. He also provided us with the protocols which were"
