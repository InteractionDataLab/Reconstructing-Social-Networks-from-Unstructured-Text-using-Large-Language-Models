Introduction to LSA
What's Sensitivity Analysis? The sensitivity of a system to its parameters may be determined using either global or local methods. We implement both of them into our code. Specifically, the global sensitivity analysis employed Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation(RS-HDMR) algorithm to estimate the sensitivities of the circuit properties with respect to the circuit model parameters, such as rate constants, without knowing the precise parameter values.
Why Sensitivity Analysis? The models we use to describe a gene network are systems of ordinary differential equations. In the case of ODE models, robustness is generally studied in the context of parametric uncertainty via properties such as robust stability and response to perturbation. Although there is no standard quantitative measure of robustness a common thread in the literature relates robustness to parametric sensitivity. Parameters whose perturbation causes undesirable changes (either qualitative or quantitative) in some output identify processes with fragility The sensitivity information can then guide the selection of the optimal mutation targets and thereby reduce the laboratory effort.

SOCIAL WORK / KERJA SOSIAL (KERSOS)
Our team understands that the future implementation of Finding Diphthy project will need a real foundation from any society levels. Through KERSOS, we are aiming to reach the grass-root level. Not only focusing on educating the people about diphtheria outbreak and our project, moreover we want to know about their health needs. From the insights, we understand how our project would affect the society’s life.
Giving Explanation and Instruction to the Volunteers
Volunteers Explaining to Villagers
KERSOS was held in collaboration with the Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia. It was held in 4-8 June 2018 and took place at Cikidang Village, Sukabumi,West Java. In here, our team took part in training the volunteers of KERSOS to give a talk to the villagers about health issue related to diphtheria and also about Finding Diphthy project in brief. The volunteers then came door to door toward the houses to explain all the issues and approach the villagers. This method was purposely applied so that our team can engage more people (the volunteers and also the villagers) in our project.
Follow Up from UI iGEM Team to the Villager
In the end of the socialization, our team did some follow ups to the villagers directly to make sure they got the right information and to measure how far their understanding about the issues. In the follow up, we got the insights from their testimonies about how important our project and how it would beneficially affected their health. Moreover, they consider it as a “friendly-user” diagnostic tool since it can be used by everyone without really depending to the health officer. They also consider it as a relevant solution, for it would be accessible for them who are still hard to reach nearest PUSKESMAS (health center) or hospital.
Building Lavatories
Besides the socialization, in collaboration with KERSOS FTUI Committee, we build some lavatories and any sanitary facilitation for the villagers. We also patched stickers of the right steps to wash hands in every house to remind the villagers in keeping their hands free from bad-bacteria. Those was aimed to prevent and minimize the risk of diphtheria outbreak to happen in that location since diphtheria can caused by the bad quality of sanitation and health habits.

Overview
In modern fermentation process, cooling system, aiming at keeping the cells in a good condition, plays an important role. However, that results in a great consumption of energy. According to a research carried by COFCO, the leader of bio-industry in China, once the fermentation temperature limit can be risen by 1 centidegree, 100 million degrees of electricity can be saved all around China. Moreover, thermal electric generation accounts for a large proportion in China. Let’s do a calculation about the effectiveness (Figure 1). The result is striking and the emission brought an enormous impact on environment such as acid rain, global warming and so on.
Figure 1: if the temperature of fermentation raise 1℃，all fermentation industry in China can save nearly 1 billion yuan per year. According to the electric price of industry，1 billion equal to 173310225(kW•h) power. In China, 78% electric energy was produced with coal in 2012. That means we can save 135181975(kW•h) power which made by coal every year. To generate those electricity need consume 50017 tuns of coal! That is a big number! So we can shrift those coal and we can reduce 134776 tuns of carbon dioxide emissions per year.

Complete Project Information- Beyond the Summary
Abstract
Codons are groups of three nucleotides that specify a single amino acid, which is then added to a growing polypeptide chain during translation. Even though each codon spefifies only one amino acid, some amino acids are coded by multiple codons. It has been demonstrated that the genome of E.coli shows statistical preference for some of these degenerate codons over others, and it is hypothesized that these codons translate more efficiently than non preferred degenerate codons. We constructed synthetic reporter genes entirely from codons hypothesized to be fast or slow,and characterized them in E.coli. As of right now, we have characterized the level of GFP expression in G3, the fast coding sequence for superfolder GFP. GFP 2, the common coding sequence has been successfully transformed in the plasmid and data is expected to be analyzed for that variant by the giant jamboree. There are still issues with getting a dRBS in the G1, rare, and G5, the calculated slow insertion time. G4, the slow codons, has not been successfully introduced to the backbone, so it has been decided to forego this variant due to time constraints.
Illustrates the principle of codon redundancy. The number in each degenerate codon refers to the criterion that would lead to it being chosen.
Why is this important?
Examples of bioproducts vital to our lives are medicines, fuels, and even industrial chemicals. Codon optimization is important because it gives engineers an additional point of control over protein synthesis.
Our codon optimization research is important for the additional reason that it will help future researchers to develop more comprehensive models of translation. A better understanding of translation is an example of a foundational advance in biology that will lead to faster, more efficient research in many areas of biology. If, for example, our research shows clearly that certain degenerate codons are preferred because they can be translated more efficiently this will allow scientists to search for a mechanism that predicts these effects, and will invite engineers to redesign genes to be translated more efficiently.
Metaphor Alert: Codon optimization can be thought of as an extra dial that can be tuned to rationally control output of genetic systems.
Background
Codon optimization refers to the idea that the"

Alpha Team – Ag43 Protein
Team Members: Ana Maria Cujba and Martyna Sroka carried out the following work;
Alpha team took an Ag43 part produced by the 2012 Hokkaido University iGEM team, the goal at first appeared simple – insert a FLAG-tag-multiple-cloning-site (FLAG+MCS) into Ag43.  However, two further problems had to be overcome first:  1. The part had six additional Pst1 sites (non-compliant with RFC-10) which did not appear in the registry sequence. These sites had to be removed.  2. Ag43 has beta hairpins, these are somewhat like Velcro and stick the cells together so that can form biofilms, for our assay these would lead to false-positives and two of them had to be removed. Only after solving those two problems, alpha team proceeded to insert FLAG+MCS; they also experimentally characterized all Ag43-related parts.
Omega Team – INP
Team Members: James Long and Joseph MacKinnon carried out the following work;
Omega team took an INP part produced by the 2011 Edinburgh University iGEM team, (this part is simply INP with engineered yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) attached to the C-terminus).  A FLAG(and HexaHis ""His"")-MCS had to be inserted onto the C-terminus of eYFP, although this is simple in theory it still took longer than expected, not only due to PCRs misbehaving, but more importantly the antibody test was negative and it was suspected that the eYFP (having its C and N termini on the same side) was shielding the FLAG/His tag.  Because of this, the eYFP had to be removed and the FLAG tag attached to the C-terminus of INP.

SCUT-China_A,2016,Team:SCUT-China A#Model#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," the 4S pathway has become a major obstacle to BDS. Studies have found that HBP and HBPS in 4S pathway have majot inhibition effect on Dsz enzymes. HBP strongly inhibits the activity of enzyme DszA DszB and DszC; HBPS has certain inhibition effect on enzyme DszC, but only in the early stages in the BDS. The reason is that, when the concentration of HBP increases, the inhibition of HBP will become the major one. And some researchers have found that enzyme DszC is inhibited by HBP and HBPS noncompetitively, and the substrate DBT also has certain inhibition effect on enzyme DszC. Due to the limited high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detector resolution, the mechanisms of how the effects are brought by HBP to DszA, DszB are still unable to be determined.
(1) The determination of kinetic parameters:
2.2 Determination of related parameters
1).The catalytic pathway of DszA，DszB，DszD can be described as enzymatic reaction based on traditional Michaelis kinetic theory. The kinetic data can be fitted by Michaelis equation:
In the equation, v is the catalytic rate of enzymes, kcat is conversion number, [E0] is the concentration of enzymes, [S] is the concentration of substrates, Km is Michaelis constant, and Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate of enzymes.
2)Because DszC is inhibited by substrate DBTs, the Michaellis equation is no longer fit. We could only use substrate inhibition equantion to fit the gained data:
In the equation, KSI is substrate inhibition constant.
Using the fitting statistics of MATLAB, we obtain many kinetic parameters of different Dsz-enzymes.

(2) The determination of related parameters in four major inhibition reactions:
1).The determination of IC50：
The degree of inhibition can be reflected by the dosage-reaction; the dosage-reaction describes the influence brought by concentration variations of inhibitor to the activity of enzymes:
In the expression, vi is the catalytic rate of enzyme when concentration of inhibitor is [I], and v0 is that without enzymes，IC50 is the inhibitor’s concentration which makes the enzyme’s activity reduce to 50%, comparing to the original one.

UGA-Georgia,2016,Team:UGA-Georgia#Interlab_-_-_TEXT.html,"Statistical Analysis
Looking at each team’s data inputs, we saw that the fluorescence of the L2C16 Methanococcus mutant stayed consistent among the teams. Therefore, we compared the fluorescence values of mutants L1C12 and L1C18 against the fluorescence value of L2C16 mutant. In doing so, we were able to calculate percentages for the fluorescence of L1C12 and L1C18 mutants and came up with a model displaying the variation among teams that used plate reader and variation among teams that used flow cytometry.

Figure 3. Summary of the percentages of the fluorescence of L1C12 and L1C18 mutants against the fluorescence of L2C16 mutant among teams using plate reader.
Conclusion
From the collaboration study, we’ve gained information about the reliability and reproducibility of our data. Our collaboration study not only validities our findings with the work we’ve done in the lab, but also gave participating teams awareness of the capabilities of Methanococcus marpaludis and knowledge of the methods of reading mCherry fluorescence. Additionally, the interaction with other teams allowed us to pass on the skills we have developed in lab and obtain feedback on our method of experiments. This season’s interlab allowed our team to implement a standardized protocol for fluorescence measurements for both flow cytometry and plate reader and to look at some of the standard deviation that it may have changed.
The Future
This year was the first time our interlab branched out to iGEM teams in China. Although, the data wasn’t sent back to us in time, it was valuable in creating a protocol for international shipping for our cell extracts. Since it was the first time we had potential teams participating from overseas, this season was a great experience in determining the protocol and process by which genetic materials could be shipped overseas with the additional requirements in customs. Next year, the team plans to extend our interlab to more teams overseas and bring in more participants in order to better measure the effect of our standardized protocol on standard deviation."
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," is easy to compare two Chain-Model structures with the help of chain sorting. We only need to compare unicode_c value of chains in the chain list and unicode_t value generated under that order. If two structures are equal, their chain list and tree structure must be equal since the chains order is unique in our chain sorting method. If two structures have same unicode_c value of each chain and unicode_t value, they must be same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the strings.
How to find species with specific structural pattern of a template one?
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched, there may be more than one region. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the minimal task is to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type"

Superoxide dismutase
“[...] are a class of enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. As such, they are an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. One of the exceedingly rare exceptions is Lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli, which use a different mechanism.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase

The feedback we got from some of the guys over there was to think about using metabolic wiring as a digilog signal as well as a digitial signal (so as to provide information on the metabolic load of the sender strain) and, again, to look at introducing elements of selection pressure to the IPD system. We decided to think about these suggestions but take them with a grain of salt from people who might be less familiar with iGEM than other advisers we have had.
Weekend 14th-15th
After a long sunny week where we were trapped inside for all of it, the weekend was mostly cloudy with occasional rain. Welcome to Scotland.
The team mostly relaxed over the weekend, but Philip and Yuma’s dedication recognises no weekend. Philip read some reviews on aromatics degradation, among other things, and Yuma looked some more into an idea brought up by advisors Chris French and Jon – sugar signalling. He and Philip decided it was promising but would require more research.
Week 4 (16th June – 22nd June)
Monday 16th
Today we got to do actual lab work for the first time. We might have done little more than plate out some bacterial cells to make them competent, but it felt very encouraging. We learned some of the practical stuff you never learn about in the course, like how to prepare agar plates, and who to ask for various pieces of equipment.
We met with Dr. Garry Blakely to discuss a mechanism for slowing growth in our proposed population control demonstration of metabolic wiring, and he suggested a ribosome bases approach, such as targeting rpsL. We also further discussed the sugar logic idea as a way of getting started, though it was agreed a better metabolic pathway should be sought out. The main problem we are having at the moment is that all goof pathways produce toxic chemicals that cause horrific nerve diseases or cancer – not ideal.
Presentation skills were also worked on – rather fun – and looked into multicellular IPD, and alternative aromatic pathways.
Tuesday 17th
In the lab we just plated the cells from yesterday onto LB media – apparently the streaking went well. Small victories are heroic victories this early on.
Today was pretty research-heavy, with more metabolic pathways being sought out with limited success. We have a database of possible molecules we can use but they’re all so toxic, presumably because they are membrane-diffusible which is what we need. The sugar logic system would provide an alternative but it is not without its own problems.

Overview
Human practices is a highlight of our project in this year’s iGEM. As a researcher, we need to focus primarily on scientific research and laboratory work. But we cannot decide the direction of our research by soaking up in experiment time.  We will always keep the code in mind: whether projects are safe ? will it benefit the folk？
We  put great  elbow grease  into connecting human  practice with laboratory work. We tried to make our human practice progress along with experiments. To achieve this goal, we first analyze the demands for our project. We went to the farm of our university and went to a farm in the city center to get rigorous information of morbidity and current remedy . Secondly, we would like to know the effectiveness and the safety of our project, thus we discussed the dangers of  FHB  with many experts and compared the different approaches to control FHB.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project#DataPage_-_-_TEXT.html," different BioBricks involved in the production of methyl salicylate. After finding out that the MIT 2006 brick ( BBa_J45700 ) only produced weak amounts of the wintergreen scent (MeS), we dove into the literature and discovered a possible lack of chorismate present in the bacteria. We tried to overcome this problem by overexpressing aroG in E. coli. In the literature, we found two mutations that could make DAHP synthase insensitive to allosteric inhibition. We succeeded in biobricking the normal aroG gene, which gives future teams the opportunity to introduce mutations themselves to overcome the chorismate problem. We characterised our bricks with a renewed smell test , GC and an SDS-PAGE analysis.
(E)-β-farnesene Experiments
After the whole summer's work, we finally made 5 BioBricks for this section. Our favourites are:
BBa_K1060002 contains an open reading frame that codes for (E)-β-farnesene synthase from Artemisia annua. The enzyme converts farnesyl diphosphate into E-β-farnesene. It was a milestone in our project work. We succeeded to remove an EcoRI site in the gene (AY835398.1). This gave us one of the basic parts we needed to create our system.
BBa_K1060009 is a construct that constitutively expresses β-farnesene synthase. This was the final device used for our Aphid experiments .
BBa_K1060011 is similar to BBa_K1060009 . However, in this biobrick we added a lac operator in front of the β-farnesene synthase. This makes it possible to switch of (E)-β-farnesene production by using biosensors expressing LacI.
Our pilot studies with these biobricks and the aphids are promising and we now backed it up with quantitative data. Apart from this in vivo characterisation, we also initiated an SDS-PAGE analysis. Taken together this indicates that the EBF synthase is produced.
Ecosystem Experiments
Two companies (Biobest and pcfruit) specialised in biological pest management, were very interested in our project and invited us to perform experiments at their facilities. These experiments demonstrated the effect of MeS in inducing plant defence mechanisms and that this has an effect on the aphid population.

Things to do before starting
Equilibrate samples to room temperature (15–25°C).
Heat a water bath or heating block to 56°C for use in step 4.
Equilibrate Buffer AE or distilled water to room temperature for elution in step 11.
Ensure that Buffer AW1, Buffer AW2, and QIAGEN Protease have been prepared according to the instructions on page 16.
If a precipitate has formed in Buffer AL, dissolve by incubating at 56°C.
Serum DNA Extraction Procedure
Pipet 10 μl QIAGEN Protease (or proteinase K) into the bottom of two 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.
Add 500 μl sample (plasma or serum) to the microcentrifuge tubes.
NOTE: It is possible to add QIAGEN Protease (or proteinase K) to samples that have already been dispensed into microcentrifuge tubes. In this case, it is important to ensure proper mixing after adding the enzyme.
Add 500 μl Buffer AL to the sample (the same amount as the sample). Mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. It is a quite syrupy consistency. To ensure efficient lysis, it is essential that the sample and Buffer AL are mixed thoroughly to yield a homogeneous solution.
NOTE: Do not add QIAGEN Protease or proteinase K directly to Buffer AL.
Incubate at 56°C for 10 min. DNA yield reaches a maximum after lysis for 10 min at 56°C. Longer incubation times have no effect on yield or quality of the purified DNA.
Briefly centrifuge the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube to remove drops from the inside of the lid.
Add 500 μl ethanol (96–100%) to the sample (the same amount as the sample). Pipet it into the tube via the side of tube. This will let the foam of the centrifugation go away. The ethanol will let the proteins precipitate. Mix again by pulse-vortexing.
Carefully apply 600 μl of the mixture from step 6 to the QIAamp Mini spin column (in a 2 ml collection tube) without wetting the rim (pipet via the side at the top of the tube). Close the cap, and centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. Discard the filtrate en place the QIAamp Mini spin column in the same 2"

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. To test the versatility of the prescreening, multiple variants of the ssDNAp were designed to target the EPO DNA. The ssDNAp 5 targets the EPO coding sequence. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp 5 was used in this experiment to target the EPO DNA. The ssDNAp 5, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA (1 µM), 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 5 (1 µM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. Again, the primer 051 was used as off-target ssDNAp. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.

1. Collaboration with SHSU_China
a) What they did for us
DNA Kit Plate. The SHSU_China team provided our team with their DNA Kit Plate 1 after we used up all the plasmid in well 4L (part BBa_K325909 which contains the pSB1C3-Lux plasmid) for transformation that unexpectedly ended up in failure.
Ligation. They helped us ligate 2×20μL of our part BBa_K2836001 (pSB1C3-LuxG) using a Quick Ligation system from New England BioLabs (with the Quick Ligation Enzyme, Stock No. M2200), as this system can complete the entire ligation process in 10-15 minutes.
Competent cell. They provided us with three tubes of E. coli DH5-α competent cell after our lab ran out when we needed to transform our BBa_K2836001.
Troubleshooting. When one of the forms in our first submission for the InterLab was rejected, SHSU_China and our team worked together to find any errors in our submission. Eventually, we found out that it was only a misinterpretation of the requirements (there was a section where we multiplied our Abs600 values with the conversion factor which was unnecessary). With their help, our second submission of the InterLab was successful.
b) What we did for them
Laboratory and equipment. Thanks to their help, we gladly shared our lab and equipment with the SHSU_China team in order for them to complete their InterLab study. Their laboratory lacked a suitable equipment to measure absorbance and fluorescence in a 96-well plate. We also utilized this chance to aid each other through the entire process of InterLab, helping out during experiments and eventually comparing our results.
Transformation. We helped SHSU_China transform and amplify part BBa_K1321200 from well 16E on DNA Kit Plate 5 which contains their desired VHb protein.

Consequently, a few interesting biobricks were selected.
2.1.2 Biobrick candidates & tests
A serie of biobricks with constitutive and inducible promoters was selected. Even though LacI induction appeared to be a better choice in regards to its well-documentation, biobricks were tested with either constitutive promoter or LacI inducible promoter.

For the constitutive promoters, biobricks designed by iGEM Freiburg 2011 were chosen. Based on their research, BBa_K608017 and BBa_K608014 seemed to be the most appropriate parts in our case because of their high level of fluorescence. Concerning the inducible ones, BBa_J04450 was selected for its consequent documentation and BBa_K801100 chosen randomly among the list of biobricks producing RFP.
Choice of the promoter
In this experiment, the four plasmids were transformed in parallel in competent DH5ɑ, which were then incubated overnight in a 5 mL pre-culture (LB+ chloramphenicol). Inducible promoters were incubated with 7 different IPTG concentrations overnight (1 CFU per condition). The day after, 10µL of overnight pre-culture were dropped on a microscope slide in order to observe fluorescence thanks to an epifluorescence microscope.  No fluorescence could be observed in the tubes with bacteria transformed with biobricks having constitutive promoters. There is a high probability that these plasmids need more time to emit observable red fluorescence.   In contrast, the two biobricks with inducible promoters showed fluorescence. After centrifugation, bacterial pellets were definitely fluorescent under natural and UV light (fig 6).
Figure 6: Bacterial Pellets of DH5ɑ transformed with BBa_K801100 and incubated with 7 different IPTG concentrations: 0, 0.13, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mM. Red fluorescence is observable as soon as there is some IPTG under natural light (top) and UV light (bottom)

Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of research safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
There are potential safety concerns with our project, but they do not exceed the normal caution exercised when working with antibiotic-resistant organisms. Although the team is working with a lab strain of E. coli that must be provided with the proper nutrients to survive, we are also working with a variety of antibiotic-resistant plasmids. While we follow proper sterile protocol in our work in the lab, there is still a chance that a wild pathogenic bacteria may enter reactions. In this event, a wild bacteria may have the chance to acquire an antibiotic resistant plasmid. If it were to be removed from the lab, this bacteria could exchange this resistance factor with other bacteria.
We do not work with virulent or potentially hazardous strains of bacteria in the lab, and thus would not risk infection or illness from these antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The only hazard is in allowing these antibiotic-resistant bacteria to transfer their plasmids to pathogenic bacteria outside the lab. Here there is the possibility of danger to the public or the environment depending on the strain of bacteria.
Since some of our project ideas require the use of specific antibiotics, their use and disposal must be taken into consideration. Some of these compounds are toxic or even carcinogenic to humans and must be handled appropriately. These compounds may also be toxic to the environment or public if they were to not be disposed of properly.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our BioBrick components raise any safety issues other than the antibiotic resistance they carry. Steps must be taken to ensure the antibiotic resistance is not accidentally imparted to a pathogen bacterial strain. Otherwise all of the BioBricks created by the team are for analytical purposes only and can only produce fluorescent proteins when correctly used.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If"

Dr. Wu walked us through the three stages of drug development: discovery & research, development, and manufacturing. Mrs. Michelle Bruce, our business and marketing teacher, then guided us through the final process of developing a marketing plan for our potential product. In our marketing plan, we formulated a description for our envisioned product, conducted a market analysis with the help of BioHealthWays CEO Brain Pan, and examined the regulations required for our product to be approved for sale.
To ensure our product is safe and marketed responsibly, we researched current food and drug regulations. For example, there are regulations in place for introducing new genetically engineered bacteria strains into the market. The approval process is laid out by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration’s Guideline for Food Safety Assessment of Genetically Modified Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Organisms, which requires characterization of the organism, of any genetic modifications, and most importantly, a safety assessment. We also decided to market our product as a health food, defined by Taiwan’s Health Food Control Act as a “food with health care effects,” but not a “medical treatment aimed at treating or remedying human diseases.” To receive a health food permit, a product must be shown to 1) be harmless, and 2) carry definite health effects. Before any product can be launched, extensive tests must be performed so we can be sure our product is safe and useful for reducing the accumulation of acetaldehyde.

In our school, all ninth grade students are required to take a health class which already discusses the negative effects of alcohol consumption.

Their system is aimed at characterizing biosensor-based screening systems and to generating variants in terms of reporter genes, promotors and sensitivity tuning. To test their platform, they needed to be provided a functional biosensor based screening system ( See their work on the iGEM Newcastle Wiki and the result here ).
We, the iGEM Evry Paris-Saclay team developed a biosensor-based screening system, so we got in touch with iGEM Newcastle and sent them our one of our biosensor, composed of PsiR transcription factor from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and a synthetic promoter we engineered, pPsiTac2 ( BBa_K2448050 ), derived from pTacI ( BBa_K864400 ). Sensynova has been able to generate variants with signal amplification properties, fine tuner modules as well as different colour outputs.
iGEM UPMC Paris (HP/HP)
We were contacted by the iGEM UPMC Paris team whose project was to provide developing countries with access to healthcare through their project called the BioMaker Factory. A software able to produce fragments of antibodies in Bacteria to develop therapies for multiple diseases. This time again, our lawyers were needed to dissect legal issues around the development and distribution of such a project. Diversity of our annual team helped to provide multiple service and develop every aspect of a project development from the design to its placing on the market and this was very enjoyed by other teams and in particular iGEM TU Delft that contacted our photographer to be provided pictures of the event ( See details on our Education & Public Engagement page ).
In return, we worked alongside iGEM UPMC Paris to the framing of practical work in a scientific course in Montrouge High School in Paris. Through our experience students could see what students in biology can actually do. We helped them to observe the relation between genotype and phenotype with Ade2- yeast strain that turns from red to white by UV exposure mutagenesis ( See details on our Education & Public Engagement page ). Setting the protocol and making it understandable for students was a great exercise. Scientists have to find simple ways to present complex ideas they find in their research to ease the understanding of complex phenomenon. This experience allowed us to practice simple and effective scientific mediation. Presenting iGEM was the conclusion of this meeting with students pushing them to explore and go beyond their abilities to grow and evolve. Students enthousiasm was the best reward we could expect. Even today, they ask us for questions around Biology to learn more about it.

Database - Integrating NDEx
NDEx is a breeding ground for network sharing, discussion, analysis and storage. By acting like the Facebook of networks, NDEx serves a medium for the discovery, sharing and discussion of networks. Networks are commonly used for their ability to capture the biology as a system of particular molecular interactions with interaction types varying between the type of networks built by scientist. The discussion of networks offered by NDEx provides a means for researchers to share their ideas behind network construction and analysis as well as sharing a copy of the network. NDEx also provides what is know as provenance history which means that history of the network construction is saved and the development of the network can be seen. As a means of further connection the biological network community NDEx offers an API and has plans for further integration with the network visualizer, Cytoscape (www.ndexbio.org).
SBiDer was developed with the intention to involve the biology community with the SBiDer Network. Discussion of genetic circuits is imperative for the proper use of a circuit as well as to give the proper context of the circuit. NDex would give a discussion board to the SBiDer network where biologist can discuss topics regarding optimal genetic circuits, the potential to experimentally create new circuits from"

Clearing
 
Footer
Adding a footer following the columns, yet still inside the .container, will cause this overflow:hidden clearing method to fail. You can place a .footer into a second .container outside the first one with no detrimental effects. The simplest choice may be to start with a layout containing headers and footers and remove the header to utilize the clearing methods in that layout type.
Backgrounds
By nature, the background color on any div will only show for the length of the content. This means if you're using a background color or border to create the look of a side column, it won't extend all the way to the footer but will stop when the content ends. If the .content div will always contain more content, you can place a border on the .content div to divide it from the column.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," £8300 at the current lowest threshold for lung cancer screening, and taking into account cancer recurrence. Treatments under £20,000 per quality year are deemed cost-effective by NICE, the UK public body that publishes healthcare guidance.
Cost analysis
Our test is much cheaper than existing solutions, especially when you consider the final product will be a multiplexing assay which will test for many diseases simultaneously.
Qiagen PAXgene blood RNA tube: 1 @ £752 / 100 kits [11]
£7.52
Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit: 1 @ £1115 / 250 kits [12]
£4.46
Taking a blood sample inc. labour [13]
£3.42
Medical lab technician’s time: 15 minutes @ £8.45 / hour [14]
£2.11
Paper-based toehold switch biosensor: 50 @ 1.7p / 1 μl switch [15]
£0.85
Other lab equipment e.g. sterilisation: tubes: gloves (approx) [13]
£0.30
Total
£18.66
We estimated 15 minutes of lab technician’s time based off the advice of Professor Lovat's research team and Dr Pregibon. The processing of miRNA takes approximately 2 hours for 8 samples. However, if this process was further automated, this cost could be significantly reduced.
The total figure is likely to be an overestimate, as the two major components, namely the PAXgene blood RNA tube and the miRNAeasy Mini Kit which make up over 70% of the total aren’t for clinical use. These products are targeted at researchers and small volume applications, and have many extra features to match - which would not be required for our sensor. Economies of scale and stripping the products down to their core functions could introduce further significant savings.
We believe our test would cost less than £15 ($20) once this is taken into account, making it extremely cost effective as it can test for several diseases simultaneously.
Large cost savings could come by testing saliva instead of blood. Looking into the financials:
Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit: 1 @ £1115 / 250 kits [12]

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," from chemical production and waste treatment and further enhancing its environmental sustainability.
Synthetic biology is an emerging market with many techniques and tools that have yet to mature[19]. Strong governmental support is required to aid in the development of this market, but current signs for its development are promising. Recent start ups such as Zymergen and Ginkgo Bioworks have experienced explosive growth and are making big waves in the synthetic biology industry. Synthetic biology itself has shown potential for high applicability in various different fields. Nonetheless, the development of new technologies, as always, requires acceptance and support from society.
Society’s perspective on synthetic biology (ULaval)
Genetic engineering impacts society in a wide variety of ways, ranging from pharmaceuticals to crops to. However, people are often unaware that their food or medicine has been produced by mean of synthetic biology. Perhaps, provided with this knowledge, they would reject such products because they might be afraid of what they do not understand. In this section, we attempt to explore and elucidate the following: Is the society knowledgeable enough about biological synthesis and genetic engineering? How can they be better informed? How accepting is the general public towards GMOs? Who are the opponents to this technology?
Fear is often closely linked to ignorance[20]. As of today, synthetic biology still remains an emerging field, but in the past has often be portrayed as a dangerous thing, especially in popular culture. One of the best known is Jurassic Park, in which scientists succeed in bringing dinosaurs back to life using genetic engineering. While people with a scientific background can generally identify the line between science and fiction, some science fiction writing can appear convincingly real to the uninitiated.
Because of this, synthetic biology has often frowned upon, even considered “dangerous” to health and the environment, despite approvals by regulators and scientists, and their benefits recognized to date, with examples like biofuels[21] and increased yields and agricultural growth[22]. To prevent misconceptions, the scientific community has to invest more time to popularize synthetic biology, and educate and inform the public to allow them to better understand how GMOs are designed and function.
Public scepticism towards new technology is not unfounded. Indeed, scandals in the recent history of the scientific community have put a damper on the credibility of some scientific studies[23]. Disasters in healthcare, like the prescription of tobacco as an anti-stress medicine[24] and the tragedy over the prescription of thalidomide to pregnant women[25], or other cases like the mad cow disease[26] are good examples. While healthy scepticism is important, it"

USING OUR PCS TO DO THE FUNNY STUFF!
Beautiful models!
Protein models
To obtain the three-dimensional structure ...
... of our conditional sensor designed to bind repetitive DNA sequences, we employed comparative modelling. We began searching for appropriate templates for the selected biobrick sequences of TALE (Bba_K747027, Bba_K747043, Bba_K747059, Bba_K747075 obtained from the registry, plus Bba_K1514002 and Bba_K1514003 we synthesized) + linker + hemiCherry1 (BBa_K1514000) or 2 (BBa_K1514001). These were submitted to a PSI-BLAST similarity search against the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Templates for each domain were selected based on the percentages of residue identity, e-values, alignment scores and sequence coverage.
To start modeling, the program Chimera 1.9 (Pettersen et al., 2004) was used for sequence aligment. The aligned sequences were generated with default values ​​and manual curation. To build the three-dimensional models of our chimera proteins, different templates were chosen for each protein region. Manual curation of the alignments obtained was performed using DNATagger (Scherer and Basso, 2008). Then, a set of at least 100 models was generated using Modeller 9.10 (Eswar et al., 2006). Structural characteristics of each protein part was analysed for the best models generated. Manual adjustment of torsional angles in the linker region were performed afterwards, using Swiss-PDB viewer (Johansson et al., 2012), and the quality of the final models was validated using the QMEAN Z-score calculation (Benkert et al., 2008).
After obtaining our final models we performed a structural alignment of both mCherry parts against the active mcherry structure (PDB 2H5Q). This alignment enabled us to estimate the final structure of our models bound to DNA and the distance between both TALE domains in the DNA, to perform our mathematical modeling.
Results
Two PDB proteins were selected as templates for model building. For the"
Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project#Chemotaxis#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," by the bacteria can be used to image the uptake of bacteria using confocal microscopy.
1. Testing for chemotaxis towards malate
Experiments involving chemotaxis can be split to two categories, qualitative and quantitative. In the qualitative experiments, we are able to show that bacteria, which we study do or do not move towards a source, however it does not inform us at all about the cell count.
5th of August - Agar plug in assay
The simplest method for studying chemotaxis is to use agar plug in assay, which is a simple experimental method to show bacterial movement towards a localised chemical source.
Experiment is performed as follows, bacteria are added into the plate on one side, and the attractant to the other. Result is then the shape of the formed colony which grows into distorted elipse shape within the agar if the attractant is present, however colony shape remains circular if no attractant was added.
In our experiment we have used 5-α Escherichia coli cells. Cells used as positive control were transformed with pSB1C3 plasmid backbone, which conferred chloramphenicol resistance. These cells have not been modified in any other way and were used to show 5-α E. coli are capable of chemotaxis, using serine as attractant, which acts as a ligand for Tsr, an endogenous chemoreceptor. 5-α Escherichia coli competent cells were also transformed with pRK415 a working plasmid with mcpS gene and tetracycline resistance. These cells express mcpS gene from P. putida KT2440, which is chemoreceptor with malate as its ligand, and therefore malate was used as attractant for these cells during agar plug in assay. As a negative control, no attractant was added into the plate.
Amount of attractant added contributes greatly towards the result, as too little attractant added will not stimulate bacteria to move towards source, however too much attractant will result in the saturation of the medium and the bacteria will not chemotax towards source. Values (concentration of attractant, distance between colony and attractant at start etc.), necessary to perform this experiment have been worked out using modelling.
These are the values of attractant concentration we have used, when 5µl sample was added into the plate:

Team Description
We work together, create together, have fun together, persue dream together! What we have is passoin and courage, what we pursue is challenge and creation. We are a family more than a team, we are brothers and sisters more than schoolmates!
We will keep every single laughter in mind as well as dismay and frustration. We miss those days when heated discussion took place to determine proceeding plans and those nights when we repeat experiments to figure out puzzles. What we finally get is much more than the project E.ADEM, but friendship, courage, strength and happiness.

-Performed PCR in order to tether PUF(WT)-cCFP with GC buffer and the PCR failed, presence of primer dimers. PCR of the amplification of cCFP and PUF for tethering seemed to have worked although there was low cCFP product. The order of PCR for tethering needs to be reversed and optimized tomorrow. Inoculated two tubes of pETDuet-1 for further cloning work.
-Desalted the ligations from yesterday and transformed them into DH5a. Plated the transformations. Started two new digestions of pBAD and a digestion of PUF PCR.
7/25/12
-Isiah made minipreps of both K12 and K12-Petrobrick innoculations. We prepared 2 tubes of K12 TB cultures to grow overnight.
-Did primer extension in order to tether PUF-cCFP with HF buffer and PCR didn't work, presence of primer dimers. Performed PCR of PUF-cCFP under a gradient of temperatures 50/55/60/66/70oC with an annealing time of 1 minute instead of 30 seconds. PCR was done with WT-PUF, cCFP, and primers PUF-cCFP tether 1F/1R.
-Found no colonies on the plates. Also ran a gel of an uncut miniprep of pBAD with one of the pBAD digestions from yesterday. No bands for either.
7/26/12
-11 reactions for wtPuf was made for PCR, 7 was ran today the rest will run tomorrow. Starting over on pSB1C3 tomorrow due to strange results. Divya accidentally put miniprep in TB cultures, so she redid TB culture prep (2 tubes K12; 2 tubes K12-Petrobrick) and set them to grow overnight
-Presence of primer dimers under all temperatures of the PCR done yesterday. Ran another PCR for PUF(+)-cCFP tethering with PUF(+) including primers PUF-cCFP tether 1R/PUF-cCFP 1F and cCFP with primers PUF-cCFP tether 1F/PUF-cCFP 1R in order to amplify the parts before tethering. Made 4 inoculations of pETDuet-1 with Bob.

Nanjing-China,2014,Team:Nanjing-China#modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," good as the binary system. The luxR+ system is only             a little better than the control.
As time goes on, the binary system and luxI+ system is still better than luxR+ system and control system,         and the differences between the binary system and luxI+ system is two little to be found.
Someone may ask why luxI+ system and binary system is better than luxR+ system, while it is clear         that they should be better than the control system. We assume that these E.coli. already remain in a stable         state called initial state after cultivating for a long time. In this state, the concentration of luxR is         almost stable because the work of the Pcons. As a result, the feedback by luxR is not as useful as that of         luxI, which increase more magically[ Results about this will be listed in the supplement.].         In the supplement, we also model about the stability of the system.
In a word, by using positive feedback system, we can produce more enzyme to do the degradation job,         and the system is little affected by the strength of Pcons[ For more, please refer to the supplement.].
The time sensor shows the time for reading the position of the red fluorescence in the detection system.             It is situated in the AHL producing cell in the detection system following the luxI.             This part was tested by using Plac and lacI.
With the help of MATLAB, we have gotten some results.
The diagram above shows that RFP increase as time goes on as our expects. However,             we would rather use a stable amount of RFP to make sure that we always read the results of             sensor at the same time. A stable concentration of RFP is also a reflect of the environment,             which may also affect the result of the sensor..
From this diagram, we can get that RFP reach its stable concentration at the time of 40000s,             which will be our time for reading the result of sensor system.
With the help of time senor system, we can always read the results of detector at proper time.
The suicide system is used to wipe off our bacteria to reduce the probability that these E.coli.             may escape to the environment, posing a potential threat to the health of human. To realize our aim,             we design a circuit that makes the cells dead where there are no lactose or the aimed toxins.             To make it simple, we just test whether the cells will die without lactose for this section.

Our project also required auxotrophic markers for selective screening of our transformants, so we looked for a ura3 and leu2 auxotroph. A paper by Verbeke et. al described the JMY2394 strain, which satisfied our parameters, but was unavailable to us. We searched for a similar strain and settled on FKP393 by recommendation of Erin Bredeweg of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. FKP393 is a NHEJ mutant derived by transformation of Po1g with the specifications matA; leu2-270; ura3; xpr2-332; axp-2; ku70::hph+.
This strain includes all of our specifications but lacks sufficient annotation. We were informed by Cory Schwartz of UC Riverside that this was not an issue, because the parent strain is the well-studied W29, which we can use for genome analysis. We received the FKP393 strain as a gift from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center at the Kansas State University.
PROGESTERONE METABOLIC PATHWAY
Due to our extensive research on world issues, we chose to create a contraceptive in yeast: progesterone. Progesterone is a hormone produced by all mammals (men and women) naturally, and aids in many functions regulating fertility, menstruation/ovulation, pregnancy, and normal body function. ""Progesterone prepares the endometrium for the potential of pregnancy after ovulation. It triggers the lining to thicken to accept a fertilized egg. It also prohibits the muscle contractions in the uterus that would cause the body to reject an egg. While the body is producing high levels of progesterone, the body will not ovulate"" (hormone.org). Progestins are routinely used in contraceptive pills, vaginal rings, and IUDs. Progestins are a chemically formulated version of progesterone (CITATION!!!), that acts on progesterone receptors to increase cervical mucus and suppress ovulation to prevent pregnancy. They are not naturally made by the human body, and therefore have many ill effect on the women who take them (CITATION!!!!!). Progesterone is the molecule naturally made by the body, which when taken in excess, can perform the same function as progestins: preventing pregnancy. Progesterone can do so without the harmful effects that progestins cause (CITATION!!!!).  In mammals, the progesterone biosynthesis pathway begins with cholesterol. Enzymes convert cholesterol to pregnenolone to progesterone"

Ribosense
The Magnesium Riboswitch we tested. The M-box on the left is the apamer, while the terminator on the right is the expression platform, active only when magnesium is bound. From Dann et al., Cell 2007.
As our project involved improving the way we make biosensors and apply them in the field, we aimed to develop several biosensors, employing different mechanisms, to prove the extended functionality of the final product. To date, most of the biosensors in the registry use an inducible promoter to control expression of their reporter protein. We aim to use some of these as a proof of the compatability of our kit with a theoretical customers' sensors. However, we also explored another mechanism of biosensing in the form of riboswitches. The rationale behind this decision is found on our Design process page, whilst the success of Ribosense can be found on our Results page.
Riboswitches have several advantages over traditional inducible promotors: firstly, they are usually modular in design, typically containing an aptamer (ligand binding) domain and an expression platform domain, which alters expression of downstream genes. Such a structure may allow for abstraction of discrete parts of each riboswitch, and construction of new regulatory elements with engineered properties that could be designed ""de novo"" using software tools (Although we may have to wait a little for such modelling capabilities to be realised). Secondly, if the expression platform acts by altering translational rate after transcription has finished, such devices may allow for faster respone times than those seen for current genetic devices, which can only alter transcriptional rates.
Our sensors

Other Biosensors
We also aimed to use other biosensing parts that were pertinent to the topic of groundwater contamination and which were already available in the registry. Early thoughts of mercury and arsenic testing proved to be unfeasible within the time constraints as our laboratory does not usually handle"

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
“Vitiligo is a skin disease that is caused by selective destruction of melanocytes and is characterized by white spots. Melanocytes and keratinocytes seem to exhibit a functional close relationship, mediated at least in part by keratinocyte-derived cytokines, which seem important for survival and activity of melanocytic cells” - New Insights into the Pathogenesis of Vitiligo: Imbalance of Epidermal Cytokines  at Sites of Lesions p. 87
Nina: These cytokines are important for us to study in order to check if we can introduce any into the skin.
""It has been hypothesized that melanocytes form a functional unit together with keratinocytes, the so-called epidermo-melanic unit (6). Close relationships important for melanocyte survival and differentiation likely exist between these two cell types, that are mainly because of keratinocyte-derived cytokines, acting on melanocytes via speci®c receptors (7, 8). Keratinocytes secrete GM-CSF, an intrinsic stimulant of melanocytes in UVA-induced melanosis (9), endothelins, which are intrinsic mitogens for melanocytes and stimulate UVB hyperpigmentation (10), and bFGF which is a natural mitogen for melano-cytes (11) and promotes melanin synthesis (12). SCF/c-KIT pathway mediated by keratinocytes plays a critical role in the control of normal human melanocyte home-ostasis, increasing the number, size, and dendricity of melanocytes (13). Furthermore, keratinocytes synthesize IL-1a, IL-6, TNF-a and TGF-b, which are paracrine inhibitors of human melanocyte proliferation and mela-nogenesis (14±18). Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that a functional change of cutaneous microenvironment ± i.e. an impairment in keratinocyte secretory activity ± may be involved in melanocyte disappearance in vitiligo."" - New Insights into the Pathogenesis of Vitiligo: Imbalance of Epidermal Cytokines at Sites of Lesions p. 88
Nina: The bFGF is interesting for us to continue studying. It does not need any glycolisation, which GM-CSF does. SCF stand for stem cell factor and might induce all types of cells to proliferate and get to active which might result in cancer development. However bFGF might also"

Among various desalination methods, Reverse Osmosis Method (RO Method) had a rather short yet rapid developing history. Now, it shares nearly half of the global desalinated water production capacity. As a new desalination tool, the project should be evaluated against traditional methods. In this page, you will see our partly comparison against RO method based on our results. Furthermore, how two methods might cooperate with each other to achieve an better effect.

Desalination method has been used for hundreds of years to produce fresh water, but large-scale municipal drinking water distillation plants began to operate during the 1950s (Gleick, 2006). Over years, this industry become more and more important due to the increasing water demand of human activities. Until 2013, global desalination water production capacity has increased to 85.9 million m^3/d. (Shumo, 2015)

iGEM Meeting
June 8, 2009
6:00 PM PST
6:19: We discovered we had video chat capabilities. It made the meeting AWESOME.
6:23: Possible 3rd kill switch: SulA stops FtsZ gene which is responsible for forming a contractile ring in binary fission
Another possibility: having a cell synthesize a colicin under certain conditions. Colicin is a toxin that kills bacteria. Check out this Pubmed article. ** http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17347522
6:28: Will discusses the EV131 failed clinical trials. The Histamine Binding Protein needs to not be in the bloodstream because it works outside of the bloodstream to cause vasodilation. and the IGE Antibody binding protein needs to be in the bloodstream to bind. This defeats our bifunctional protein idea.
Will’s new tactic: we could create a safe strain of S. aureus that secretes EV131 in the nose, and focus on establishing a secretion protocol. We can make biobricks for secretion. We can create new parts for the bacteria. Will is making a list of other things we can focus on. It’s on the google group.
Something like this:
Going from:
Cambridge's project to make a gram-positive chassis: https://2007.igem.org/Cambridge/Gram-positive_chassis_project
The Parts page about B. subtilis: http://partsregistry.org/Chassis/B.subtilis_Strains
Use Bacillus subtilis as our chassis.
Figure out how to turn off the genes that allow for mobility.
Add genes from S. aureus that allow B. subtilis to cling to mucus.
Add new parts for protein secretion in gram-positive bacteria (in addition to the one already there)
Come up with a new technical standard regarding gram-positive bacteria as a factory for proteins (this hasn't been done, I think)
Biobricks for uptake into blood

Since we want to see if the MBEC for S. aureus is reached, we determine the concentration of lysostaphin along the x,y-plane between gel and exudate, the exudate-plane. We also determine the concentration of nutrients on this plane to see what amounts of nutrients are flowing through the gel into the exudate with malignant bacteria.  Figure 6 shows the mentioned plane with an approximate average nutrient concentration of 7 * 10-5 mol/m3 across the plane. Figure 7 depicts the approximate average lysostaphin concentration across the same plane, showing a concentration of 10-15 * 10-13 mol/m-3.

Now that we have shown what results we obtain and how we obtain them with COMSOL, we will not show all the pictures for the other hydrogel composition and seeding density combination, however, we put the obtained values in Table 4.
Table 4: Results
Discussion
As we established the 3D in COMSOL, the complete hydrogel patch looked promising since there are nice gradients that can be seen for diffusion of particles. We kept encountering these gradients, but the surfaces we wanted to use to determine concentrations have varying values all over as can been seen in figure 6 and 7. The axes showing the values of the gradient always went from the maximum to zero, making the gradients' values not very accurate. We kept trying to make educated guesses for averages of the gradients, but sometimes the axis gave values making it almost impossible to get decent results. However, the trend of increasing lysostaphin concentration stays the same over increasing amounts of cells.
This also accounts for the concentration of nutrients. When the amount of cells increases, the concentration of nutrients reaching the exudate of the wound decreases. However, it is worth noting that reading errors are much more influential for nutrient concentrations because of the small differences for varying amounts of cells. In fact, we later realized that this parameter is not worth investigating."
Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," it is solid.
Add the appropriate amount of 6X purple loading dye (NEB) to the PCR or digestion reaction mix (8 µl for 50 µl PCR reaction).
Place the gel into the tank and add 1X TAE buffer so that the gel is fully covered.
Pipet the DNA into the pockets.
Run the gel at 120 V for 20 min.
Image the gel using ultraviolet light. If necessary, cut out bands.
Beta-Galactosidase Activity Assay
To determine the activities of the wildtype ß-galactosidase and the ß-glucuronidase mutants, an assay with p-nitrophenyl-galactopyranoside (PNPG) was setup. 1X assay buffer consisted of the following substances:
Chemical
Conentration [mM]
Disodium phosphate
100
Magnesium chloride
1
Beta-mercaptoethanol
Beta-Galactosidase assay on Agar-plates
ß-Galactosidase assay on plates To generate a visual output for ß-Galactosidase activity of the ß-glucuronidase (GUS) mutants, a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) assay was set up. Therefore, LB-agar plates with 100 µg/ml kanamycin, 4 mg/ml X-Gal and 0.5 mM IPTG were prepared. Cultures with the different GUS mutants and the wiltype enzyme were grown overnight to the stationary phase. The next day, 10 µl of each culture were plated in eighths on the same plates. When the blue color started to develop, the plates were imaged.
Blue Plaque Assay
1. Introduction
The Blue Plaque Assay is a method to determine M13 phage titer.
2. Material
LB/Amp-Agar Plates (1.5 % agar):
Plates with bottom agar (15 g/L agar in LB medium) supplemented with antibiotic are prepared at least 30 min before plaque assay. Top Agar (0.7 % agar):
Top agar containing 7 g/l agar is autoclaved and stored at ~56 °C in the heating cabinet. 3 ml top agar is sufficient for one agar plate. X-gal stock solution (40 mg/ml):
0.2 g X-gal is dissolved in 5 ml DMSO and stored at -20 °C"
Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html,"OX-S30 versus deionized H2O. Reading the LUDOX-S30 absorbance value from our spectrophotometer, we subtract the dH2O absorbance to get a corrected absorbance value. Then, the LUDOX-S30 OD600 from iGEM’s reference spectrophotometer is divided by our corrected absorbance value to give a standardized conversion factor.
Figure 1: Raw Absorbance Values and Correction Factor.  Calculated with iGEM Interlab Spreadsheet.
2. Particle Standard Curve
Our silica microspheres have similar size and optical characteristics as cells but can be mass produced and distributed globally so that all labs will have the same size and concentration of microspheres. Measuring the absorbance of these beads allowed our lab to construct a standard curve of particle concentration (seen below), “which can be used to convert Abs 600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.”
Figure 2: Microsphere Solution Serial Dilution Protocol
Per the protocol given by iGEM, we prepared out microsphere stock solution and serially diluted this solution over 11 wells each with a total of 100ul. Throughout this process we mixed by pipetvting up and down 3 times before each transfer of solution, as well as one final remixing before measurement by the plate reader.
3. Particle Standard Curve
In order to standardize our fluorescence data, we used iGEM-provided fluorescein (a small, inexpensive molecule with similar excitation properties to GFP), to “generate a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration.” We followed the iGEM protocol and prepared the fluorescein stock solution via serial dilution, similar to the procedure for creating the microsphere absorbance standard curve.
The resulting fluorescence curve could be used to back-calculate cell-concentration and GFP expression in an unknown plate or liquid culture.
Cell Measurement
Protocol: Cell measurement
Transform Escherichia coli DH5α with specified plasmids and grow overnight on plates.
Pick 2 colonies from each plate and grow these overnight in seperate liquid cultures.
Dilute cultures to an Abs600 value of 0.02 in a final volume of 12 ml of LB and our antibiotic, chloramphenicol.
Take 500ul of each sample into seperate eppendorf tubes and place on ice.
Incubate original 12ml solution for 6 hours more.
Take 500ul from from each of the individual incubated samples and pipette into individual eppendorf tubes.
Check the Abs600 and fluorescence of all eppendorfs,"

The biofilms will be dyed with crystalviolett and living B. subtilis cells as well as cell lysate will be transferred into the wells. If biofilm-destruction takes places, the crystalviolett will vanish by carefully washing the plates. Additionally, an expression control will be conducted via Western Blot.

Subtilin impact on Streptococcus pneumoniae
First of all, a growth curve for S. pneumoniae was recorded to learn about the growth behavior of this organism. It was measured in the plate reader in 100 µl THB broth at 37 °C without shaking and measurement was taken every 10 min. The mean value of 10 measurements were determined and plotted.
Fig. 1. Growth curve of S. pneumoniae measured in the plate reader in 100 µl THB broth.
Fig. 2. The spot-on-lawn assay shows a clear halo around the B. subtilis ATCC6633 spot. No clearing zone is visible around B. subtilis W168.
As expected, S. pneumoniae shows rapid growth during its exponential growth phase. It reaches its maximal OD600 just under 5 hours. In contrast to other bacteria, for S. pneumoniae, there is no plateau during stationary phase, as autolysis of the cells starts and the OD600 decreases again.
As S. pneumoniae is a target of the BaKillus killing strategies, a spot-on-lawn-assay should reveal the inhibitory impact of subtilin. Therefore, spots of the B. subtilis W168 wild type and the subtilin-producer B. subtilis ATCC6633, respectively, were spotted on a S. pneumoniae lawn. As depicted in figure 2 and 3, the subtilin producer significantly inhibits the growth of S. pneumoniae. In contrast, B. subtilis W168 wild type does not show inhibitory impact. The experiment was performed three times and the mean value and the standard deviation are illustrated in the graph below.
Fig. 3. Analysis of subtilin impact on S. pneumoniae.
Subtilin impact on Staphylococcus aureus
Moreover, the impact of subtilin on Staphylococcus aureus was tested in collaboration with iGEM Team Groningen, as they have access to S2 laboratories, in which S. aureus and even multidrug-resitant species are handled"

Arrival of gBlocks for all three devices
All three devices ordered as gBlocks arrived today! Refer to main lab notebook page for details regarding device specifications and FASTA sequence verification.
All three devices were briefly spun for 3-5 seconds at 3,000xg to ensure all DNA is at bottom of tube, resuspended in 100 uL of TE buffer, and briefly vortexed to mix. Tubes were then incubated at 50 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes to ensure elution of the total DNA, and briefly vortexed and centrifuged to homogenize and collect the samples.
gBlocks must be amplified before digestion to ligate into pSB1C3.  A set of primers were prepared and ordered via IDT to amplify all three devices based on the Prefix and Suffix sites.
Amplification Primers for all Interlab Devices
Primers created are as follows, with parameters of each primer individually and as a pair calculated via Benchling.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," before expression of the repressor protein, it was expected that Mg2+ would somehow demonstrate a dominant effect.
Normalized final fluorescence readings from our construct. Readings were adjusted against final OD620. The construct did not work as expected.
As can be seen, our initial assay did not give the expected results. At differing IPTG concentrations, the response to magnesium seems to have inverted.
Typical growth curves of our construct. Magnesium concentrations varied from 1 μM (most red) to 5mM (most green).
We repeated this experiment, using a different range of magnesium concentrations (1μM - 5mM) and doing duplicates in alternate rows. The cells grew well, although they did not appear to do so in an exponential fashion. It is believed that this may be a feature of the minimal medium in which we were performing the assay, as failed tests using a rich defined medium (which, unfortunately, autofluoresced at GFP wavelengths due to the aromatic amino acids it contained) showed normal exponential growth with the same construct and at identical magnesium concentrations.
Having collected OD620 data as well as fluorescence data, we hoped to generate graphs containing fluorescence readings normalized to cell density. We used the following formula to normalize our data:
Initial analysis produced fairly convincing data, as shown in the graphs below (top images). Certainly, the part appeared to produce a convincing response to magnesium between 1 μM and ~10μM, within the sensitivity range of the original paper. A more modest increase can be seen past this point. More careful analysis of the raw data indicated that this apparent trend may have been an artifact of the normalization formula, as no particularly convincing trend can be seen in the raw final fluorescence data (bottom images).
Surface plots of our plate reader assay data. Top images have been normalized to cell population, while bottom images have not. Images on the right leave out the outlier at 1μM.
Line graphs of our plate reader assay data. Top images have been normalized to cell population, while bottom images have not. Images on the right leave out the outlier at 1μM.
However, visual inspection under the fluorescence microscope demonstrated that the low magnesium cultures had very different fluorescent properties, both in quantity and quality of the light produced (higher magnesium cultures had a more yellow hue). We took this as a sign that our plate reader may not be producing reliable data, perhaps not surprising given that we were having to use non-optimal emission and excitation filters. Additionally, the final fluorescence was lower than the initial fluorescence despite the fact that visual inspection demonstrated that it increased considerably from start to finish."

5th June
Group discussion concerning the project idea to be carried forward - favouring the 'Anti cancer project'. Roles were then assigned to team members present for intial research roles for the week:
Cancer research roles:
1. Ruxi Comisel - Proteins upregulated in cancer of the intestines. Specifically in the outer epithelial cell (enterocytes) – in microvilli. Also, what actually is... gut cancer? A general overview would be useful…
2. Khaicheng Kiew - Our chassis (bearing in mind that we will also build it in E. coli as a backup). We need to think what would make a good chassis in our case (ie. naturally found in the gut in an obvious one), and how well does the chassis fit.
3. Alex Bates - What will the killing mechanism be? A broad overview of cancer treatments is required, specifically detailing how a bacterium can administer the treatment.
Considerations:
a. The bacteria may secrete a toxin etc – how will we ensure that it doesn’t simply diffuse through the gut?  b. If it is a toxin, what sort of biosynthetic pathway is required? c. Does the bacteria trigger apoptosis in the cancer cells (ie. an intracellular killing mechanism)? How can this be done from an extracellular bacterium? Perhaps beta-arrestin? d. Are there any treatments which we can take advantage of specifically because we are using bacteria?  e. For example, a protein which creates holes in the cancer cells? Does using a bacterium open up the possibility of using a different cure that currently isn’t in use because we cannot target it to cancer cells – could the use of bacteria allow this?
4. Weiling Yuan - Targeting – do we use antibodies? What previous projects have used bacteria expressing antibodies? Are there any other ways of doing this? Perhaps the latching and initiation mechanisms can be incorporated into one protein?
5. StJohn Townsend - Initiation – mechanoreceptor activated upon latching? What other ways are there of doing this?
6. Tom Johnson - Past iGEM projects which we could incorporate into our own: Cancer projects, Gut projects, Protein engineering, Antibodies expressed in bacteria etc.

The NEPTUNE Flow
Neptune abstracts a very intricate workflow to provide an intuitive experience for its user. Below is a detailed depiction of all of the components that are under Neptune's hood.
Each of BostonU Hardware Team's members played an integral part in the success of Neptune's development.
Liquid Flow Relations & User Constraints File | Shane McCormack
In order to increase accessibility of our tool (and microfluidics in general), a method for describing microfluidics in a few simple lines was formed! This standard consists of Liquid Flow Relations (or LFR), and the User Constraints File (or UCF). The LFR file is where the user describes the inputs, outputs, and tells of any operations which occur on those inputs and outputs. These operations are described as symbols on the LFR, but are informed by the UCF. The few lines of LFR are the only things needed to run a chip through Neptune; a sample UCF is provided with Neptune that can be fine-tuned, but will not need to be written in its entirety.
The UCF can be thought of as a library of microfluidic components where, once a component is defined, it will never have to be written again! In more detail, once a component is defined inside the UCF, all subsequent LFR files can utilize the symbol the component is linked to without redefining the details of the component. The UCF leverages the MINT standard of describing parametric microfluidics. This parametrization unlocks great potential in the rapid prototyping of designs, where one number can be changed in the UCF, and all subsequent designs will have the updated component! For example, if our fictional synthetic biologist Dr. Ali found that his mixer's bends were too short in length, with one number edit in the UCF he could fix every bend of every mixer in all of his designs thereafter! This is far more accessible than redrawing every bend by hand on AutoCAD"

This result, together with all promising facts about V. natriegens like the higher solubility of some proteins that are difficult to purify and the simple transferability of E. coli tools to this organism, have strengthen our vision that V. natriegens is the perfect chassis to accelerate scientific progress in synthetic biology.
VibriInteract
Protein interaction studies are known to be time-consuming. First, all the plasmids required need to be cloned and co-transformed into the interaction strain. Second, you have to cultivate those co-transformants and test them on inductive plates. Now imagine how much time you could save using a much faster growing organism, accelerating all steps required for protein interaction studies. And imagine this time, could be used in a meaningful way, to get new results and speed up scientific progress.
For the design of VibriInteract we had a look at the Genotype of the E. Coli strains used in Bacterial Two Hybrid Assays which are commercially available from Euromedex. It is also possible to use any other strain deficient of/from cya.
DHM1: F-, cya-854, recA1, endA1, gyrA96 (Nal r), thi1, hsdR17, spoT1, rfbD1, glnV44(AS).
BTH101: F-, cya-99, araD139, galE15, galK16, rpsL1 (Str r), hsdR2, mcrA1, mcrB1.
The genotypes of the  strains recommended and provided by Euromedex showed three common genetic modifications:
F-: Both strains do not contain the F-plasmid which encodes the mechanism for conjugation in E. Coli (Willetts & Skurray, 1980) . V. natriegens has not been described to possess such a plasmid needed for conjugation. For this reason, we did not consider this part for VibriInteract.

There are several large, well defined colonies on the full antibiotic plate. It appears that 2 days are required for sufficient growth at 30°.
I PCR purified a couple of other knockouts (ArgE Tet and TrpB Kan) and transformed them, reusing the electroshock cuvettes we borrowed from Rafael. A pack of 50 was ordered so we could do more than 4 transformations per day. They are currently growing in the 30°C room on the second floor.
We only had one chlor plate left, and 4 potential biobricks which were to be put on the chloramphenicol resistant pSB1C3 plasmid. Since there was only one plate (and one electroshock cuvette), only the MetA biobrick ligation product was transformed.
The pKD46 recombineering vector that we received from Dr. Ramey grew well overnight at 30°C, and was miniprepped, and then transformed into the Epi300 strain. The recovery period was done at 30°C as well. If the transformation is successful, Ting will make electrocompetent cells out of the Epi300+pKD46.

July 7
In the past couple of days, we have found candidate knockouts for all relevant genes but trpA, and attempted to confirm that they were all actual knockouts by PCR. Unfortunately, none of the PCR's worked. We suspect that it was because of a bad enzyme, so some of the reactions were repeated. Currently, the results are inconclusive as to whether or not the knockouts are actually knockouts. We also ordered the relevant knockouts from the Keio collection.
Colonies with potential biobricks of trpA, tyrA, argE, metA, and dszD were successfully grown. This time, chemically competent cells were used, and they were plated on 1/2 concentration chlor plates. We also transformed and grew out the previously characterized minC biobrick.
To physiologically characterize the knockouts, we made M9 plates, and plan to set up an amino acid gradient. Sadly, we ran out of M9 salts before we could make tet plates, so some knockouts can't be tested in this manner yet. We also made spec plates to grow some things from the registry, but a lawn grew on the negative control. Looking into the literature, it looks like the concentrated antibiotic we were using was not the correct strength.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#MAK_-_-_TEXT.html," model more accurate, especially for the lower miRNA concentrations we decreased kopen to 105, the lowest possible value in our range.
Another way to improve the lower miRNA concentrations was increasing the decay rate of just the miRNA. We had assumed it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in our system. Increasing just the miRNA decay rate had similar effect to decreasing kopen.
With our initial parameters our model was a poor representation of our system. Once we updated our parameters, it was able to represent our results relatively well.
Stochastic model
The Oxford iGEM team kindly ran stochastic simulations of system for us. They ran both intrinsic and extrinsic simulations and provided us with the final uncertainties.
Intrinsic Simulation
Intrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty caused by the changes in reaction rate due to the fact reactants collide randomly. This is more accurate than mass action kinetics for low reactant concentrations.
For our stochastic simulation, each time step a reaction rate was determined randomly using the Poisson distribution. As this is random, multiple stochastic simulations have to be run for a large enough sample size. A time step of 0.01 seconds was used.
The intrinsic simulations gave an uncertainty of only 0.0096%. This validated our use of mass action kinetics to model our system. As the intrinsic uncertainty is negligible we could assume rate of reaction was proportional to concentration of the reactants, i.e. the law of mass action.
While we later updated the parameters with our experimental data, the concentration of reactants did not decrease to invalidate this result.
Extrinsic Simulation
Extrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty cause by the uncertainty of our parameters. The extrinsic uncertainty is by far the more significant of the two uncertainties in our model.
The extrinsic simulation assumes our parameters were normally distributed and runs multiple simulations randomly choosing parameter values.
The specific conclusions of our extrinsic simulations, such as the test being complete in 37 minutes in 90% of cases, are unfortunately no longer useful after our experimental results showed some of our starting parameters were significantly off. However, the extrinsic simulation demonstrated that biggest weakness with our model was our parameter's uncertainties.
Cost model
There's two parts to our cost modeling; the cost analysis which works out the cost of the test, and the much more impressive screening cost-effectiveness model that works out the value of rolling out a screening programme.
Our screening programme's cost per quality year of life gained would be just be £8300 at the current lowest threshold for lung cancer screening, and taking into account cancer recurrence. Treatments under £20,000 per quality year"

We explored how our project impacts or is impacted by the social environment; for example, with fictional future scenarios that may result from the use of our system.
We did research about the current national and international legislations for the shipping of GMOs.
We got in contact with experts from National Institutions , we performed a global survey and we checked the requirements of a potential user.
We received students to do BioArt and experiments in our laboratory. .
We made society part of our exciting journey through the radio, newspapers, and social media.
Hereby you can find more details about our Future scenarios and Outreach projects. A complete discussion of the legal regulations, our contact with experts and society and the outreach activities can be found in the Gold page or in the links in the text.
Future scenarios
“Planning is bringing the future into the present so that    you can do something about it” - Alan Lakein
What would be the potential applications of CryptoGErM in the near    and far future?
In this part of Human Practices, we explore the future scenarios of    the introduction of the CryptoGErM system to the world.
With all these fictional scenarios we give a deep insight on the    repercussions, applications and consequences that CryptoGErM would have    if introduced as a daily life system.
The scenarios are presented as fictional digital news and articles    from a futuristic and unreal city called New    Groningen in The Netherlands in the near and far    future, where the CryptoGErM system has been introduced,    followed by an explanation of the current reasons behind its    conceptualization.
We present them as digital news in a mobile device, based on the    prediction that the UN Intellectual property agency’s chief made in an    interview to La Tribune de Geneve, stating that newspapers will be    replaced by digital versions by 2040.
""In a few years, there will no longer be printed    newspapers as we know it today” “It’s an evolution. There’s no good or    bad about it. There are studies showing that they will disappear by    2040” - Francis Curry
The last existing Public Library has disappeared!
First fictional scenario
What if in the far future we start to run out of space to    accommodate"

Human practice
Communication is an essential part of human interaction and civilization in general. Every scientist has the duty to teach, communicate with and support the public, in order to give everyone the chance to learn about new and old scientific breakthroughs. Without communication the world wouldn’t be the place it is today.
The invention of the internet has made it a lot easier to stay in contact with one another, but it is also a great source of misunderstandings and misleading or simply false information. This is why it is crucial to publish scientific work and make it accessible to the public in an understandable way.
But what can we, a small team of students, do? What is achievable? Who can we reach and how can we learn from the people around us?
Thinking of a way on how to reach as many people as possible, we came up with the idea to have an interview on our university’s radio station.
Here, we‘ve talked about iGEM, synthetic biology in general, our team and of course our project. Our goal was to educate fellow university students, who have never heard of iGEM or even synthetic biology, what this competition stands for and what we achieved during the course of the last months.
We believe that learning and communication has to be done by both sides. So how could we get in touch with people, who are not involved in our project and benefit from their feedback? What we came up with was a survey. This way we would be able to receive information from a broader audience.
We’ve started by evaluating the basic knowledge about synthetic biology in general, the people’s opinion on consumption of bacteria and bacterial spores. We launched a survey that reached out for people of all ages and different educational background.
Since the first survey was focusing on synthetic biology and our project in general, we also wanted to get in contact with people suffering from ulcerative colitis. Given that, those are the people that we affect with our approach. Their opinion was extremely important to us and we therefore decided to dedicate them an extra survey.
However, publishing surveys that may include sensitive medical and personal data"

Proteorhodopsin Culture pH Characterization
BBa_K1282002 transformed BL21 E. coli were grown by shaking overnight at 37C in 30 ml of LB+chloramphenicol. Cultures were divided into 6ml experimental groups, induced cultures were given 20uM beta-carotene, and light cultures were exposed to a 200W equivalent LED bulb. Cultures were allowed to grow at 37 degrees celsius for 29 hours. During the 29 hour period pH measurements were taken every six hours  and a final measurement at the 29th.
NOX Dissolved Oxygen Consumption
200ml of PBS solution was agitated on a magnetic stirring tray for 6 hours in order to aerate the solution.  BBa_K1282003 transformed BL21 E. coli were inoculated into 30ml of LB +chloramphenicol at the same time that untransformed BL21 E. coli were inoculated into 30ml of LB. These cultures were grown at 37 degrees celsius for four hours. 200ml of PBS solution was agitated on a magnetic stirring tray for 6 hours in order to aerate the solution.  Optical density of the cultures was measured and the cultures were normalized to an OD of .018.  20ml of each cell culture were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes to pellet the cells, the pellet was then resuspended in 5ml of airated PBS. The dissolved oxygen content of each solution was measured simultaneously by dissolved oxygen probes connected to an arduino for 29 minutes.
NOX His-Tag Isolation SDS-PAGE
An attempt was made to isolate the poly-histidine tagged NOX protein using His-Spin Trap columns and SDS-PAGE. This proved unsuccessful likely due to low concentration of the target protein as it was not under a high expression promoter.

FBA Model for Alkane and MFC
FBA
In the alkane degradation and MFC modules, we adopted Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) model to capture the relationship between different variables and characterize the theoretical maximum values of target outputs. The FBA model is widely used to simulate a genome-wide metabolic network, and the flux distribution between metabolites.  With this algorithm, it is possible to maximize an objective function  under a set of constraints provided by the user or the genome database, without specific enzyme kinetics inputs. By using FBA, we can analyse the alkane degradation pathway and electron generating reaction while taking into consideration of the complex metabolism network. This algorithm also helped us bypass the enzyme kinetics part, since little has been documented about the ASS enzyme complex in current literature. However, this method was limited to simulate equilibrium state only, and the theoretical limits are highly dependent on the database and constraints provided.[1] In our project, we used iSO783 as Shewanella Oneidensis MR-1 metabolic model, and made adjustment upon it.  iSO783 is a widely-used S. Oneidensis MR-1 model containing 774 reactions, and 783 genes. [2]
Hopefully, this mathematical modelling can provide an insight into the  interdependence of conditional factors and serve as a guide of our experimental design. 
 
Extracellular Electron Transport
In the MFC, S. oneidensis MR-1 has been reported to transport electrons to electrode in three ways, (1) direct electron transport (DET) mode based on the c-type cytochromes and conductive pili called nanowires, (2) self-secreted flavins to convey electrons and 3) the mediated electron transfer (MET) mode, which relies on exogenous mediators [1].  The DET route, which is a more dominant transport mode without the help of exogenous mediators, is modelled and studied. As reviewed in the MFC part of our wiki, the DET route depends on the c-type cytochrome (MtrC and"

The tour was a great learning experience and an exciting opportunity for iGEM Calgary team to work on future potential synthetic biology projects for iGEM. It was also an opportunity for our marketing team to form important partnerships with the Oil and Gas Development companies. We are still working on getting more sponsorship for our research project and I hope that we are successful in this endeavor. Within the next couple of weeks our marketing team will be working on our August newsletter and getting media coverage for our project, the All Alberta iGEM Jamboree (also called aGEM) and the iGEM competition itself at MIT.

P. M Back in da House!
Hey guys,
I’m Prima and I’m back on the show again!! This has been a very successful week for iGEM Calgary. I’d like to specially thank VWR and Corning Life Sciences for sponsoring our project. Both of these generous contributors have been recognized under the Bronze category of our sponsors.
The marketing team also finished, edited and began to distribute the July newsletter to all companies. This newsletter highlights the achievements and progress of iGEM Calgary for the month of July. Aside from that, Jamie, Fahd, Jeremy and I are slaving away with our hard core marketing responsibilities! We followed up with numerous companies who are considering our sponsorship package, set up meetings and thanked all other companies for considering our project.
We have an exciting week coming up as the team prepares for its next ultimate fundraising project: iGEM Bake sale trinity! This time we’ll come prepared with double the treats, triple the advertisements and of course 15 talented iGEMers to make Wednesday August 5th a once in a life time event!! Come devour the ambrosia!!! We have high expectations for next week and if all else goes well, iGEM Calgary will celebrate with a end of the year team get together. That’s about it! Peace out!

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#project#chitin deacetylase_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymes. If they could be individually induced, each combination of CDAs may be expressed and different chitosan oligomers could be constructed for various applications. To achieve an effective regulation, we have been searching for a suitable system. During this, we have stumbled upon a solution in a modern research issue – the T7-split-RNA-Polymerases.
The general concept is to split T7-RNAPs into a C-terminal and N-terminal domain. The biological activity of the split T7-RNAPs is restored when both fragments are in direct proximity to each other. The assembly of the split fragments can be made dependent on the dimerization of fusion proteins. Only when both domains are expressed the proteins can dimerize, reassembling the RNAP. If inducible dimerization systems are chosen as fusion proteins the dimerization must additionally be induced, for instance by small molecules or light.
Figure 15. The orthogonal expression of the two CDAs would result in the production of three different chitosans.
Mutants of the T7-RNAP carrying amino acid substitutions in the region that mainly determine the polymerase’s promoter specificity address altered T7 promoter (PT7) sequences. This would allow the expression of the genes of interest orthogonally, when placing several orthogonal variants of T7 promoter in front of the gene. These promoters can be placed upstream of the genes of the different CDAs. Via chemical or light induction the dimerizations of fused dimer systems mediate the reassembly of various split T7-RNAPs, that are orthogonally addressing variants of PT7. Thus, a orthogonal regulatory system is established.
We have not been able to introduce this system into our project and the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts yet, but we are planning to facilitate such a system in our next years project.
