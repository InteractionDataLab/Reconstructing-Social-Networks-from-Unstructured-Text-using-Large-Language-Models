SCUT-China_A,2017,Team:SCUT-China A#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," spends 2-3                     hours. And the measurement of fluorescent proteins requires spectrophotometers which is expensive and                     requires professional operations.
        Therefore, we set a goal to design a more efficient report module, and build up a series of heavy metal                     detecting module that can efficiently and highly selectively detect heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions.
Design of our project
        To sort this problem, our team tries to develop a novel method to detect heavy metal ions, which could measure                     the metal ions in the aqueous solution specificity and efficiently with low cost.
        By the release of neurotransmitter, we used the lysis gene SRRz ( BBa_K2360000 ) from the phage together                     with the endogenous enzyme β-galactosidase as a report module, which can efficiently respond to specific                     signal. The development of this module might sort out the problem—long respond time of traditional report                     module—GFP. What’s more, we chose the specific heavy metal ions operons to build up our detecting modules                     to achieve the specific detection of our method.
        The method we developed inherited the characteristics of previous biosensors: low cost and relatively                     convinient. Moreover, it enhances its response speed and simplifying the measurement method, providing a new mean for the public to detect heavy metal ions in the environment around them conveniently and                     efficiently.
Figure 1. gene circuit of the project
        According to the previous researches, we found that the depth of the color produced by the chromogenic                     reaction is positively correlated to the lysis rate of the cells, and the lysis rate of the cells is                     positively correlated to the intensity of the SRRz, which is induced by its operon, and finally determined                     by the intensity of the heavy metal ions. This result made it able to be used for not only qualitative                     detection but also quantitative measurement.
Results & Demonstration
Detect& Lysis
        We successfully developed three specific detecting devices and achieved our idea. By imitating the release                     of neurotransmitters, the effect of our report module is very significant. Our devices can detect heavy                     metal ions and make remarkable response in one hour. Figure 2 is one of our response effect.
APP
        Based on the principles mentioned above, we developed a smart phone app to optimize our method of quantitative                     measurement. People can use our devices to qualitatively detect whether there are heavy metal ions in                     the solution, and use their cell phone to scan the samples after the chromogenic reaction to quantitatively                     measure the concentration of"

“2-Pleasant” handbook
    From the feedback of questionnaires in the early period, we realized that 81% of people know less about harmful bacteria in daily life, which inspired the idea of making a handbook about prevention of harmful bacteria. The handbook covers basic knowledge of bacteria around us, tips for preventing bacteria and our innovate solution with synthetic biology. And we have distributed it around the world, hoping to reach the goal of getting people to pay more attention to harmful bacteria and know more about synthetic biology in a more interesting and attractive form. (More details on our Public Engagement & Education page)
    In addition, we held a summer camp with the subject of “approaching to synthetic biology”, aiming to hopefully pass on our motivation and shaping the next generation of scientists. And we took part in the first iGEM Eurasian meetup 2018 and the 5th CCiC, to have a collision of ideas with other teams and get lots of useful advice.     Please clik here to know more about our human practice.

Aix-Marseille
For our first collaboration we aided the iGEM Team from Aix-Marseille with their project on chewing-gum.
The aim of the project was to collect answers to a questionnaire from people on the street. The questions concerned the use of chewing gum, as well as the public understanding of synthetic biology and genetic manipulation.
We asked over 30 people to fill in this questionnaire, earning us a Gold Medal for the collaboration.
Aachen
At the meetup in Germany we met the team from Aachen, who are working on ""Upcycling methanol into a universal carbon source"". For this project they designed synthetic pathways involving multiple different enzymes.
As our project is based on the focusing of enzymatic reactions onto one scaffold, our flexosome, we had found our first application. The Aachen Team supplied us with their BioBricks for  Methanoldehydrogenase II from Bacillus methanolicus (BBa_K1585210, MDH), 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase from Methylococcus capsulatus (BBa_K1585211, HPS)and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase from Methylococcus flagellatus (Ba_K1585212, PHI). For further information refer to the Wiki from Aachen
We then modeled their enzymes into our system via Clone Manager and created the Primers that would allow us to insert them into our expression vector pBAD.  Following constructs were planned:
Vector: pBAD His A (Arabinose induced expression Vektor with an N-Terminal His-Tag)
Enzyme/Dockerin Fusions: MDH & CTHE, HPS & ACEL, PHI & BCEL
Dockerins from ACEL: , A. cellulolyticus , BCEL: Bacteroides cellulosolvens, CTHE: Clostridium Thermocellum
By the end of the competition, we were able to fuse HPS to the Dockerin ACEL and PHI to the Dockerin BCEL and prove their correct insertion by sequencing. The fusion of MDH to the Dockerin CTHE was thus far not successful."

Mini library ligation results
We checked our plates from our practice plate library assembly yesterday, and we got colonies!!  Strangely, our 450 ul plate didn't have a huge number more colonies than the 50 ul plate.  Dan suggested that this was because we plated all the cells in a 450 ul volume, which may have sloshed around and taken cells with it.  Next time we should pellet the cells and resuspend in 100 ul and plate that.  Based on our colony numbers with 50 ul, we should probably plate with 100 ul in the future.
Due to the proliferation of colonies, we picked 90 colonies with the assistance of Will.  These 90 colonies should hopefully represent all 18 oligos in equal amounts.  We did colony PCRs on all 90 with the junction PCR protocol, and sent them out for sequencing today.  We saved these 90 colonies by adding LB/spec to each of the wells after suspending them in the 10 ul of water for the colony PCR.  We will eventually harvest and gather all 18 assembled plasmids from this step.
Sequencing results for oligos 5 and 6
Sequencing indicated that most of our colonies worked, and that our F1s were inserted correctly!  This is a huge step forward, and gives us good hopes that our 90 colonies also have their F1s inserted.  Out of the 8 colonies each that we tested for oligo 5 and 6, only 5.8 (missing chunk on promoter), 5.3 (deletion on linker), and 6.8 (bad trace file) were bad.  However, all the rest were good!
We also now have an idea of our combined ligation/transformation efficiency.  NUMBERS HERE PLZ

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Bioinformatics_-_-_TEXT.html,"6.3. For the force field we chose AMBER99SB since it allows the modelling of proteins containing metals like zinc. Furthermore, the AMBER99SB force field has been well established for such kinds of tasks.
However, we were not able to stabilize the zinc ion in the active site of the protein with reasonable distances between the zinc ion and the coordinating amino acids. As shown in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2 the initial distances between the zinc ion and the nitrogen atom of the two histidine amino acids was around two Angstrom. During the time of the simulation the distance of the histidine increased, because the histidine amino acids did not stay in their initial position. However the distance between the negatively charged glutamate and the zinc stayed the same.
We assumed that the structure of our botulinum toxin obtained from the homology modelling could be in an energetically suboptimal state. That’s why we decided to create another homology modelling based on another botulinum neurotoxin. Since most neurotoxin share nearly every characteristic of their tertiary structure, we computed another homology model based on the botulinum neurotoxin E which has a slightly different fold.
However, the simulations using the homology model based on the class E neurotoxin were not able to fix the zinc ion relatively to the histidine residues.
Then we decided to simulate the experimentally obtained crystal structure 2PN0, which resembles the actual distances between the atoms and therefore should be in the energetically optimal state. But also in the simulation of the actual light chain structure, there was a conformational refolding in the active site of the protein. We finally also tried to introduce harmonic distance restraints, which improved the situation of the conformational change, but did not completely solve the issue of the modelling a stable active site of the metalloprotease.
Figure 4: This visualisation of the active center of the botolinium toxin is shown exemplary for all MD simulations performed by us. It can be observed that the histidines are no longer in close contact with the zinc ion.
Discussion
Due to tight constraints on computational resources and time we were not able to work on this problem even further. A step in this process could have been custom parametrization of a force field for the zinc ion. But even then, success would have not been guaranteed, since other possible factors cannot be ruled out. Moreover, MD simulations are only simulations and sometimes may not be able to perfectly represent nature. Even though the MD models are by now quite sophisticated, they cannot always easily"

To our knowledge, there is no other resource, in which visitors can see projects explained so simply, and where they can experience what the team members went through by reading their own accounts. Visitors are also free to interact through comments and can contact the teams presented directly. Finally, as igem.today also serves as a survey-hosting platform, visitors can fill out surveys, and respond to team’s questions, thereby giving their own input into the scientific process, and effectively establishing a communication.

SURVEY OF IGEM ALUMNI
We often hear former iGEMmers saying that this competition is something truly unbelievable and that it will helps students later in their lives and careers. In order to improve dialogue between iGEM’s past and future, we thought it important to quantify these experiences, and went about doing this by creating a survey, which we posted on igem.today.  Specifically, we set out to study in more detail in what way iGEM has helped alumni in their everyday life, in finding a job, or working in a laboratory. We received a reply from 38 people from 15 different universities answered our survey. Here we present a small summary of our most important/interesting findings:
The people interviewed predominantly work in the scientific community and/or are students (76.3 % and 71.1% respectively). 50% of this group works in a biologic field.
94.7 % of the people interviewed think that iGEM has helped them in their later career and 76.3% think that iGEM has helped them to find a job later in life.
In the end, the majority of the people interviewed wanted to become an assistant for their university iGEM team (63.2%) and would like to assist teams by supervising and helping find team funds.
By considering all this information, we can see the iGEM is not only a competition about synthetic biology but also about education, teamwork, and communication. For students this means that participating"

During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients. For example, the recurrence of the disease seriously affects people's health and lives and aggravates their economic conditions.
Intestinal microecology is the research hotspot in recent years. However many pathogenesy of intestinal diseases is still vague. I’m greatly interested in studying inflammatory bowel disease from the perspective of intestinal microecology.
Q: We really hope to learn more about the classification of intestinal lesions from the perspective of medicine.
A1: The first classification of lesions in digestive system is mainly based on dissection, including esophageal diseases, gastroduodenal diseases, small intestinal diseases, colon diseases, anorectal diseases, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases.
Actually, each disease from different splanchna can make a sub-classification, like congenital disease or genetic disease, inflammatory diseases, tumor diseases, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, etc. Also there are other symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement caused by some certain disease. For example, immune disease can cause the gastrointestinal involvement.
A2: There are four types of lesions in digestive system : esophageal and gastric diseases, intestinal disease, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases. Intestinal disease includes infectious intestinal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic bowel disease, autoimmune enteropathy, medical bowel disease and tumor enteropathy.
Q: As an outstanding doctor, you must have participated in many major discussions of operations on patients and intractable cases. We would appreciate it if you can offer us some details about some cases caused by inflammatory intestinal disease and patients’ following development.
A1: Inflammatory intestinal diseases is an important type of intestinal disease, which is one of the priorities of our work here at Department of Gastroenterology. There are mainly two types of inflammatory intestinal diseases: ulcerative colitis and  Crohn's disease.
The target organ of ulcerative colitis(UC) is colorectal mucosa mostly, which means that inflammation is limited in mucous layer. The main clinical symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhea and blood stool with mucus and pus. Most of cases are chronic and recurrent, and a little of them is fulminant. We treat mild-moderate patients with 5-aminosalicylic acid(5-ASA) preparation. If the patient is not sensitive to 5-ASA, we give them glucocorticoid. If the patient is also resistant to glucocorticoid, we add imuran(AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine(6"

Though we must admit due to lack of sufficient knowledge in computational tools, we were unable to explore further concerning the latter question. Afterwards, many participants demanded us to tell them more interesting iGEM projects, which we shared with delight. During this experience, we noticed how starting with innovative iGEM projects and the application of synbio can help engage audiences before we filled them with the engineering principle behind. However, it was necessary to discuss biosafety and bioethics, especially facing listeners who enjoy creation. More offered keen advice on the Kitty Wonderland prototype, such as how volunteers could supervise the shelter and how the shelter might be able to alert volunteers when several cats are present, so volunteers can come, feed or trap cats for neutering and vaccination.

Discussions with animal-welfare groups, neighborhood and local government on the applied design of our project
Our applied design, the cat shelter, aims to help volunteers who care about the welfare of feral cats. So aside from engaging with Fenghua Li’s volunteer group in the first place, we also participated in an event advocating civilized rules for pet keeping, in which we interviewed participants, who were considering adopting pets, about their opinions on a cat shelter using nepetalactone as attractant being placed in their neighborhood. They pointed out we could organize residents who fed feral cats occasionally to manage the shelter through connecting with neighborhood committees. Aside, some said their neighbors might not want feral cats gathering near their residents, so we needed to consider where the house should be placed cautiously.
Lucinda, Eden and Rocky: Ready for interview at the event advocating civilized rules for pet keeping.
Together with a talk on our design at an animal welfare event, we gained more insights into the problem of feral cats and how our design might be of use to the volunteers and feral cats through conversing with members from welfare groups including the director of

To use this part a suitable leader sequence has to be placed in front as the sequence of this BioBrick does not contain a start codon. Its sequence was originally obtained from a wild type Bacillus subtilis but was codon optimized for E. coli. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page and in the section of the related BioBrick K2020002 .
K2020001
– subtilisin E gene, optimized for E. coli codon usage, with leader sequence pelB This composite part consists of the leader sequence pelB ( BBa_J32015 ) and the subtilisin E gene ( K2020000 ) from our first BioBrick. It can be used to express subtilisin E in Escherichia coli and simultaneously secret the enzyme into the periplasm of the cell. Subtilisin E is an alkaline serine protease, which non-specifically digests proteins. To generate a functional coding sequence that can be expressed in E. coli the leader sequence pelB, which begins with a start codon, was placed in front of the subtilisin E gene. Caused to subtilisin E’s partly toxicity for E. coli, this BioBrick should be cloned into an expression system with an inducible promoter. This should hinder the organism in the expression of the protease during its growing period. With the iGEM promoter BBa_R0011 it was not possible to successfully express subtilisin E. Hence, we exchange the promoter against BBa_R0010 . All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page and in the section of the related BioBrick K2020002 .

Communication is so important in modern society and we did learn a lot by communicating with other iGEM teams.
Four teams’meeting
There was a meeting for SZU-China , SYSU-China , FAFU-CHINA and XMU-China in ShenZhen University in June. We got advice from the tutor of SZU-China who was familiar with iGEM competiton and had instructed SZU-China team for two years. He told us to design the circuit quickly and started the experiment as soon as possible. He also suggested that the improvement of an old part may be difficult, so we would better not take this as the main project. The student members of other three teams asked many questions about our project, which motivated us to consummate our project. We not only presented our project but discussed some issues about the judge criteria, human practice and experiments. We were illuminated a great deal from SZU-China’s methods of team management.
SUSTech-Shenzhen

Finally, the playground is to be developed especially for the young audience, which is a major consumer of power for phones. The playground must be a place where youngsters hang out after school, while maintaining its status as a green space.”
The making of the furniture as a prototype called for a revisit of our safety concerns. We now knew that children would be climbing and playing on the furniture, making it crucial that the material of the PowerLeaf will not break. This is a concern we discussed with Flemming Christiansen, which you can read all about next.
Finding the Proper Material
Criteria to the Prototype
The system itself will consist of two different compartments, an outer and an inner chamber. The first will be facing the sun, while the other will be facing the building or furniture. Since one culture of the bacteria depends on solar energy to produce its product, the outer compartment must allow for sunlight to pass. It should here be noted that the prototype is purely hypothetical, as the membrane, between the two compartments, should exclusively be permeable to cellulose. For that reason, we wanted to find a material, that fulfilled our established criteria, so that we could illustrate the technology.   The device itself will be made entirely from plastic, a material that is thought to be undesirable due to the difficulties in its disposal. This is due to plastic being of a xenobiotic nature, making it generally recalcitrant to microbial degradation Fewson CA. Biodegradation of xenobiotic and other persistent compounds: the causes of recalcitrance. Cell. 1988. . Following these concepts, we can identify the following set of criteria for the desired material:
Solar exposure. The material covering the solar cell, must allow sunlight to pass through to reach the bacteria.
UV resistance. As the material will be exposed to the sun, it must be resistant to the UV radiation.
Bacterial growth The material must neither be growth inhibitory, nor toxic to the bacteria.
Easy to mold. The outside of the device could be molded depending on the circumstances, as the device only relies on the bacterial technology.
Durability. The device will be located outside, meaning that the material must be able to withstand hard conditions and heavy weight.
Temperature. The material must allow for an appropriate constant temperature for the bacteria, despite the variations in sun exposure.
Longevity. We would like for the material to have as long a durability as possible, since replacing the device could prove cumbersome. We are aiming for at least twenty years of durability.
Price. We are looking for"

Patents are a unique topic in the case of biotechnology entrepreneurship as they can significantly enable or bar a startup from success. The variables represent the need/interest in legal advice, having an interest to patent and the ability to patent during iGEM project development. The need for legal advice and having a patent interest show a positive and significant relationship to founding a business (ß = 0.404 and p = 0.030, ß = 0.411 and p = 0.044, respectively). This signifies that 1) Founders are in need of legal advice because of their interest to found a business, 2) the product could require patenting to be viable and/or 3) understanding how to secure a proper patent is difficult.
On the other hand, patenting during the iGEM project development shows a negative relationship of -0.417 and p = 0.73, all variables being held constant. This negative relationship with founding implies a barrier to patent a product during iGEM. Such a barrier would explain why some teams have difficulty founding businesses during iGEM project development.
Many of the founding teams interviewed did receive legal advising from their accelerators or mentors. Only a few needed to patent, and some are still in the middle of filing for a patent. The qualitative results are mixed on needing patents to have a viable product; however, it is clear that there is a lack of legal understanding and a need to provide iGEM teams with better legal knowledge and training, if the need were to arise.

Collaborations
While it is of vital significance to carry out experiments in the lab, we also need to step out to seek for collaborations with other iGEM teams which will certainly give us a better understanding of our project and make it more far-reaching. This year, collaborations with teams and conferences came out and take a look at our collaborations now!
Instructor of SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
Both located in Shanghai and took part in the iGEM 2017 Championship, ECUST established contact with Shanghai Xiehe High School. Serving as the instructor, we held several discussions on experimental design and assisted them on the Interlab experiments. Working with other members and teams is a necessity in scientific field, and when it comes to iGEM, it is even more indispensable.

Collaborations with SJTU
Apart from Shanghai Xiehe High School, ECUST also had collaborations with Shanghai Jiaotong University. This summer, we invited the members from SJTU to take a Lab Visiting Day in our campus and exchange ideas on iGEM competition. On top of that, we two teams also carried out collaborations on experiments such as plasmid transformation and monoclonal screening. By communicating viewpoints, we gained many valuable suggestions which are useful to refine our project.

CCiC
This August, the 4th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was held in Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University and some of our members attended the conference. There were many professors and scholars delivering speeches on synthetic biology and China iGEM teams sharing their projects. By communicating with professors and other teams, we gained a much deeper understanding of the principle and mechanism of Synbio.
Besides lectures and workshops, there was also time for social activities to know about other teams.

Tongji-China
Late in August, Tongji University hosted a Community Open Night for iGEM teams in Shanghai, which was a workshop for us to communicate with each other. The night was a great success and gave the Shanghai teams a chance for collaboration and communication.

UNebraska-Lincoln survey
While surfing iGEM websites, we found there are various kinds of collaborations in Community Bulletin. The Lincoln survey from UNebraska caught our attention and we filled in it seriously, hoping to share our opinions and thoughts about greenhouse gas with UNebraska.

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"leshoot the issue. The result of this is that we suspect some contamination somewhere along the line, so we went back to construction. Unfortunately the primers selected were not able to sequence across the whole 3 bricks so we don't know what happened to these random ligations and thought it would be safest to backtrack.
We set up 5ml overnights of the new gRNA 3 & 5 vectors. We extracted the plasmid from these cultures and sent them off for sequencing using gRNAv_F_seq and ColE1_F1. We also set up 5ml of the kit plate CFP, RFP and sfGFP transformants for re-construction of the bricks. We extracted plasmid from these the next day too.
We set up overnights of pMTL83211 from the SBRC culture collection and purified this in the morning before digesting 4μg with NotI and XbaI. We also amplified Pfdx donated by the lab with Pfdx-NdeI-BsaI_R and XbaI-Pfdx_F. dCas9 was amplified from the vector gifted by Ed Bolt's lab using cas9-R-NotI_OH and BsaI-cas9_F using KOD. dCas9 (4.1kb) was run on a gel and purified from there, and Pfdx was PCR purified.
Pfdx was then digested with XbaI and BsaI, while dCas9 was digested with BsaI and NotI at 37oC for 2 hours. The components of this new dCas9 strategy vector were ligated in a 1:5:3 (vector:Pfdx:dCas9) ratio using 100ng of vector at 4oC overnight.
The new dCas9 strategy vector ligations were dialysed then transformed into TOP10 before recovery and plating on LB + Em plates and growth at 30oC for 2 days. This generated only 1 colony on the negative control plates each and around 100 on each of the test ligations.
WEEK 13
gRNA tests work
8 colonies were picked from the new dCas9 strategy vector transformation and screened using cas9_scr_R1 and pCB102_R1. If present, the plasmid would give a 1kb amplicon. PCR settings: 55oC annealing temperature and 1 minute extension time, 30 cycles.
All colonies gave a amplicon of 1kb, which shows that all 8 colonies were positive"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," modelling, Mass Action Equations were used. It is known that the laws of mass action state that the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of the activities or concentrations of the reactants. The mass action equations in Figure 1 can be used to represent basic protein expression:
Fig. 1 Mass Action Equations for Protein Expression
Each of these equations is used in triplicate to represent the expression of BamA, OmpA and lgA respectively and from these mass action equations a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations can be derived.
Ordinary Differential Equations
The model uses a set of differential equations:
Fig. 2 System of differential equations for BamA kinetics
Determination of the System Values
In order to solve this system it is ﬁrst necessary to derive values for all the parameters used:
1. copiesBamA, copiesOmpA, copiesIgA - Relative number of plasmid copies.
It is important to consider the eﬀect of diﬀerent starting masses of DNA of BamA, OmpA, and lgA, therefore to calculate the number of plasmids from which each protein can be expressed. Assuming that we add 25-1000 ng of DNA to our system  [1], a single base pair has mass of 650 Da, and the length of each plasmid is known, mass of each plasmid was calculated:
peT2Ab with BamA - 5089.5 kDa
pRSETb with OmpA - 2550.95 kDa
pRSETb with lgA - 2490.8 kDa
Knowledge that 1 ng equals to 6.022∗1017 kDa, allows to calculate the number of plasmids present for a particular number of ng of DNA added (Tab. 1).

After much back and forth, the 2013 Virginia iGEM team has chosen a project! We will be researching the formation of minicells via the expression of the FtsZ gene! The protocols have been researched and we have begun our experiments!

June
Our first protocol in lab was to extract the bacterial genome on June 17th. The next day we isolated FtsZ using a PCR reaction with primers designed by our team. This isolation was confirmed via gel electrophoresis; FtsZ is about 1200bp and the gel confirmed isolation and extraction! The team’s first attempt at ligating our isolated FtsZ onto the iGEM chloramphenicol backbone was on June 19th. Unfortunately, days later it was confirmed it did not work. After addressing issues with antibiotics and media, we finally achieve transformation and selection success! Colonies were selected and grown up in liquid LB + Chloramphenicol 25mg/L. These colonies were miniprepped on June 29th, and the plasmid was extracted. The DNA was digested to confirm the FtsZ ligated to the backbone. After confirmation of the ligation, the plasmid was sent to sequencing to confirm absolutely the FtsZ is intact.
July
The team drew out of compound Biobrick formation plan.
On July 9th, the team ligated FtsZ with the ribosome binding site of choice (BBa_B0034) as well as GFP (BBa_b0015) to the same ribosome binding site. We received and analyzed the data from sequencing. Although it appeared incorrect at first, we have officially isolated the FtsZ gene and it is present in our Biobrick! Unfortunately, on July 12th a gel confirmation indicated that the ligation failed. A strain of minicells from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston was received on July 18th.  This was a strain of"

Ethical considerations during scientific investigation
Our team had extra help from an embedded humanist, named Daan Schuurbiers, who followed the research as a midstream modulation project. Including Daan to the project, the team became also aware of the social sciences of the research. ‘’Midstream modulation asks how research is to be carried out, which is the main business of research, rather than whether a research project should be carried out, which is an upstream policy question. It is a means to evaluate and adjust research decisions in light of societal factors while the research process is taking place.’’ There are 3 different stages in the governance of science and technology, upstream, downstream and midstream modulation, see figure on the right. So by thinking about midstream modulation, this project is connected with the scientific research as well as to the social issues. In this documentary you will see how science will meet the human interest in many ways.

MINT | Radhakrishna Sanka
A microfluidic description language generated as an output of MuShroom mapper and used as an input to Fluigi. This language is used to describe the features of the specified microfluidic device in great detail including specification of feature shape, size and spacing.
Netsynth | Prashant Vaidyanathan
Netsynth is a software tool that was originally built by Prashant Vaidyanathan to translate Verilog logic descriptions into wire and gate lists. Netsynth has been modified for use in Neptune through a collaboration between Shane McCormack (BostonU_HW Team member) and Vaidyanathan to produce output formatted for interpretation in the context of microfluidic design. MuShroom mapper (a tool build by McCormack) uses this output alongside a variety of other inputs to produce a MINT file output in the Specify stage of Neptune.
3DuF | Joshua Lippai
A CAD-like drawing web application. 3DuF can be used to manually draw a microfluidic design if the user wishes to bypass high-level specifications. 3DuF will then output SVG files (for CNC milling layers of the microfluidic chip) and a JSON file for later visualization and editing purposes. When used in the context of Neptune, 3DuF is leveraged to visualize the JSON output of Fluigi so that the user may control his or her microfluidic device intuitively through the Neptune interface.
MakerFluidics | Ryan Silva
MakerFluidics is an accessible, inexpensive microfluidic fabrication technique used to manufacture microfluidic chips. A user will use an SVG file to mill out both the control and flow layers of a microfluidic chip. Then he or she will use these 2 layers to sandwich a piece of PDMS and vacuum the chip to create a seal. Through Neptune, the user is encouraged to use this fabrication infrastructure to make their chip so that they may rapidly prototype many chips inexpensively for any iterations of their experiment and easily control their microfluidic system through the Neptune interface.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ADPH have to be high enough to ensure, that nearly each Mcr molecule in the mixture is saturated and the reaction goes proportional to enzyme concentration.   By determining the slope of the linear decrease of absorbance it is possible to calculate the specific activity.   The specific activity is a value which characterizes the ability of enzymes, to convert a substrate into a product.   It is defined as the moles of product formed by an enzyme in a given amount of time under given conditions per milligram of total proteins, the unit is µmol min-1mg-1.   To calculate the specific activity, one needs the slope of the measured absorbance. This value defines the change of absorbance per time.   By using the Lambert-Beer law it is possible to calculate the amount of NADPH converted into NADP+ per time (Lambert and Anding, 1760) .
ε is 3400 M-1cm-1 and d is 1cm. By dividing with time and enzyme volume, we get the final formula to calculate the NADPH conversion per time.
Since one conversion of malonyl-CoA corresponds to two conversions of NADPH, we can calculate, how much malonyl-CoA is consumed per time. This value is defined as enzyme activity with the unit µmol/min and depends on the enzyme amount. By taking the protein amount into consideration, the specific activity can be calculated:
For
Acc
the enzyme assay must be redesigned because carboxylation of acetyl-CoA doesn’t consume NADPH or other photometrically measurable compounds.   Therefore, we decided to do a coupled enzyme assay, where we not only add Acc (or Acc containing cell extract) into the reaction mixture but also purified
Mcr
as indicator enzyme which metabolizes malonyl-CoA as product of Acc and thereby converts NADPH to NAD+.   It is crucial to add large amounts of Mcr into the mixture to ensure, that Acc is the rate-determining enzyme and not Mcr. For the Acc activity assay we planned to mix purified Acc or cell extract with ATP, MgCl2, NaHCO3, purified Mcr and NADPH. Our strategy was to start the reaction by adding Acetyl-CoA as precursor for all reaction steps and then measure absorbance loss just like in the Mcr assay.   The calculations for the specific activity are also the same.   Beside evaluating enzyme performances, we also wanted to specifically detect and quantify
3HPA
in our cells.   We planned to do that via H"

Blog #15 - Noneffective Antibiotics (Part I): Dangerous Battle against Killer Germs

SEM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Picture by Janice Haney Carr.
Are we soon going to be dying of pneumonia again? It is almost unimaginable, but the danger that our antibiotics will soon fail against plagues thought to be conquered a long time ago, is eminent. In fact, the situation has grown very acute. The all-purpose weapon antibiotic is on the verge of losing its vigor since many pathogens, such as the pneumonia causing bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa , have become resistant. Experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) have already raised a loud alarm: In their recently published first global resistance report , they are drawing a rather apocalyptic picture. If nothing is done, doctors soon might not be able to do anything but stand helplessly next to their patients while they are dying from nowadays easily curable diseases or even smallest wound infections.

Producing the most widely used and valuable components of palm oil in this way would render the widespread deforestation directly associated with the palm oil industry redundant, and so would halt this relentless destruction of the environment.
Why did we choose delta 9 desaturase, delta 12 desaturase, FabA?
Delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase
The reactions converting stearic acid to oleic acid and the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid are performed by delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase enzymes respectively. These enzymes are not native to E. coli, which meant our project would include the introduction of non-native genes in E. coli - presenting its own set of problems. We evaluated the various organisms that are native hosts to delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase enzymes in the hope of finding an organism as similar as possible to E. coli in order to minimise the risk of mis-folded products amongst other potential problems. We began looking into other prokaryotic microorganisms that would possibly contain the desaturases we were looking for. We first looked at the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis - that had the native delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase enzymes. However, the potential implications of using a pathogenic organism such as M. tuberculosis meant this wasn’t a viable option. In addition to this, we discovered that there may have been some protein folding issues when M. tuberculosis were introduced in to E.coli
Algae was the next organism we considered, which also has native delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase enzymes. From our initial evaluation of eukaryotic algae (which would almost certainly present mis-folded product) we were hopeful we could also find the same genes located within prokaryotic cyanobacteria. We eventually were able to find a suitable cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.

SPLASH! AT CORNELL
Splash! at Cornell is an educational program annually hosted at Cornell, where students and faculty can come to “teach anything, learn anything.” Cornell students teach short classes to visiting high school students on a topic of their choosing, from immunology to salsa dance. Naturally, it made sense for Cornell iGEM to teach what we are passionate about – synthetic biology! We developed a curriculum that highlighted interesting aspects of synthetic biology. We taught our students about research techniques and dove into an application by presenting our 2016 project, Legendairy. We concluded with a hands on activity - loading a gel, and a discussion of bioethical issues facing synbio using case studies. Looks like our class made a splash!
PARTNERING WITH THE NEXT GENERATION
We, at Cornell iGEM, know our responsibility to the Ithaca community and are more than happy to give back. As students with expansive knowledge in synthetic biology, we possess great potential to increase awareness and preparing students for this innovatively growing field. This year, we started a new mentorship program with Ithaca High School. We first launched the idea when the AP biology teacher at Ithaca High School reached out to us in June 2017. Having conducted several successful workshops with 4H extension and other organizations on campus, we pride ourselves in our unique approach  and informative introduction to synthetic biology.
The goal for the mentorship project is to help students who are interested in bio-engineering in IHS to build their very own synthetic biology project team.
During our first visit in October 2017, we shared our past project team experiences working in a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment; we described the experience of bringing a concept to life: from ideation to development to feedback stages. In addition, we shared our brainstorming process to help lead them in the right direction to develop sound synthetic biology project ideas themselves. In the coming months, we will continue to mentor them for their upcoming Bio-Builder competition , a smaller-scale program similar to iGEM, and conduct workshops on lab techniques, teamwork and leadership.

Fig.3-1-1 Effect of dose of Hez-PBAN on stimulation in vivo pheromonotropic activity in vitrugin females of H. zea (bars indicate SEM. n=8). This figure shows that PBAN can efficiently stimulate pheromone production in just a small amount (10 pmol).(Rellal.Abernathy et al, 1995)
A Problem of Degradation by Peptidase
The only problem for us to use PBAN is that PBAN would be degraded quickly in an insect’s body. In order to understand this problem, we searched some former papers and we found another paper from Peptides, “Enhanced oral availability/pheromonotropic activity of peptidase-resistant topical amphiphilic analogs of pyrokinin/PBAN insect neuropeptides(36) .” In this experiment, Heliothis virescens was the experimental insect and amphiphilic analogs of pyrokinin/PBAN were used instead of natural PBAN. This way, the analog can resist peptidase, as shown in the graph below. The amount of the natural PBAN decreases quickly while the analogs degrades slowly (Fig.3-2-1). However, we found the amphiphilic analogs of pyrokinin/PBAN peptide requires many special artificial modification, which means E.coli absolutely cannot produce this artificial PBAN that can easily resist peptidase. Thus, we need more brain storming to think of a way to use PBAN even if it may be degraded by peptidase.

We have to mention a special group that help us a lot. That is the whole family of iGEM-China. Chinese students are now making up a significant fraction in iGEM competition. However, due to time zone, and the language differences , we faced many challenges throughout the process. So we established a social media group to help each other. Each and every one of us benefited from this group. It is the greatest cooperation that can ever come to our doors.
We also want to thank the team from NCKU. They organized a wonderful conference to give the teams in the Asia-pacific area a chance to discuss their projects together. We received the warmest welcome from the hospitable team members of NCKU and had a great time during the conferences. It was a valuable opportunity to practice our presentation, and, most importantly, make new friends.

Differential Equations: The differential equation for the abundance of an mRNA species is determined by transcription and degradation rates of mRNA:
The differential equation for the abundance of a complex X of I, R, and S accounts for the following factors:
If X is a monomer of I or R, it can be produced through translation and we add the term,
If X is formed from association of any complexes A and B in a reaction,
then we add the terms,
for association and dissociation.
If X can associate with a complex Y to form a complex Z in a reaction,
then we add the terms,
for association and dissociation.
If X is a complex that allows flipping of the switch (ie X is SPBI4 or SRLI4R4) then we add the term,
for production of X through switch flipping
Protein degradation in complexes is assumed such that individual proteins degrade at the same rate as they would outside of a complex. Degradation rate ρ is assumed to be equal for all monomers, so we assume that a complex X with N subunits degrades at a rate proportional to 1/N, since all subunits degrade together in the complex. For degradation of complexes, we add the term,
DNA is assumed to be conserved, without production or degradation. To allow protein complexes to degrade without losing DNA, degradation of any complex involving DNA is assumed to apply only to the protein; the DNA is left behind. For free DNA involved in complexes Ci, we add the term,
where Ni is the number of proteins in complex Ci.
Thus the general differential equation for abundance of a protein complex X is:
where n different protein pairs Ai and Bi can complex to form X, and X can complex with m different other complexes Yj to form m complexes Zj, and there are N proteins in complex X.
If X is a monomer of I or R then we also add the translation term, if X can be consumed or formed through switch flipping we add the appropriate production or consumption terms, and if X is naked DNA then we add terms for its formation through degradation of complexes.
Note that the only reactions involving switch flipping are:
Example:
For abundance of integrase dimer, which for a PhiC31 style system takes part in the interactions,

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," design. Having more then 5 year experience in microfluidic technologies she quickly pointed out what may be the negative design aspects in our system:
First of all, if we encapsulate only a single template into each of the droplets, the template concentration would be too low for protein expression to occur inside the droplets. This was based on Greta’s own research – it was nearly impossible to express detectable amounts of green fluorescent protein in droplets when only single DNA templates were used.
For this reason we have recognized another thing that requires innovation – protein expression from single templates. To see how we solved this problem, please click here to go to Rolling Circle Transcription section in the design page.
Secondly, as our design incorporated phi29 elongation reaction to record the activity of information after protein expression Greta has noted that Phi29 mix might not be compatible with in vitro transcription-translation (IVTT) mix. Because of that we did early separate experiments to see how phi29 works with IVTT. You can see the results by clicking here . Phi29 amplification has only started working after IVTT mix was diluted at least 4 times. It was a life saving advice, because if we would not have caught this huge problem early on, we would not have enough time to solve it later on.
Close
Week 27
After some more research we had the idea to add phi29 reaction mix to each droplet after protein synthesis reaction is finished by merging substrate droplets with another population of phi29 droplets. This has both allowed for IVTT reaction to be efficient as possible and later when droplets were merged, diluted the IVTT mix enough for phi29 to be functional.
Linas Mažutis from the Sector of Microtechnologies (Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University) pointed out that our design might not be efficient at this point, as it incorporates difficult and inefficient DNA fragmentation and barcoding steps. In turn, He suggested we should find alternatives to this approach. The developed method should have as little steps as possible to avoid data loss, as our goal is not only high-throughput but also high-quality data.
Week 29
In order to avoid DNA fragmentation and barcoding we have thought of a solution that could solve this problem - Nanopore sequencing. It solves the problem by having the ability to sequence long strands of DNA and at the same time - detect modifications. That completely removes the need of fragmentation and barcoding, and in turn, eliminates at least 4 burdensome steps from the overall design.

In order to produce reliable experimental results, researchers must have a multitude of test subjects or animals to which BEAR will be applied. For example, for every animal used in a neurological behaviour test, one BEAR apparatus will be needed to monitor hormonal changes in each individual animal if they are to be tested at the same time. Situations arise where natural circumstances control when a test must be performed (for example, when a lab rat becomes pregnant) at a time different from other test subject. BEAR is a more efficient means of doing individual tests. The majority of a monoclonal antibody test kit would be wasted as these kits are designed to perform many tests at once. In special situations like these, scientists often cannot store a sample for later use to run more tests at once because the hormones are at risk of breaking down. A new hormone-detecting disposable unit will be needed for each test performed. Each researcher using animal test subjects will need multiple BEAR devices and will need to continue to purchase the disposable cartridges to continue their research, ensuring an ongoing market for Synbiologica.
The biotechnology market consists of the development, manufacturing and marketing of products based on advanced biotechnology research. This market is predicted to grow steadily over the next few years with a growth rate between 6-7%. In 2016, the Canadian biotechnology market is forecast to have a value of $4.6 billion, an increase of 39.4% since 2011 (Figure 2). 9 67.4% of the biotechnology market is dedicated to medical device and health care and 23.8% of the market focuses on food and agriculture.
Figure 1: Canada biotechnology market value forecast: $ billion, 2011-2016
In 2008, the Canadian biomedical device market had been valued at $6.4 billion annually. The performance of the market is forecast to accelerate, with an anticipated CAGR of 5.3% for the five-year period 2011 - 2016, which is expected to drive the market to a value of $13.2 billion by the end of 2016. 10
Though BEAR was initially designed to be a research and diagnostic tool, we see future application in the Livestock agriculture industry as a hormone and health monitoring system. In 2011, of the 12,457,000 head of cattle produced, 45% were exported to other countries. Alberta produces 39.3% of beef cattle in Canada. Beef Production contributed $25"

Finally, to check if it was also possible to see apoptotic cells labelled with Annexin V in the microscope, we did an experiment with four conditions. One sample had no TRAIL and no Annexin V; the other had no TRAIL and Annexin V; the next had TRAIL and no Annexin V; and the final had both TRAIL and Annexin V.

Lactate production
Experiment overview
A lot of cancer cells ungergo a metabolic transition, called Warburg effect, where they do the aerobic glycolysis to obtain ATP. A subproduct they generate in this kind of energy production id L-Lactate (Vander et al, 2009). Therefore, the excretion of Lactate by cancer and healthy cells is different enough to be used as an indicator of cancer.
First, we wanted to check the how the production rates of lactate would vary in healthy and cancer cells. To this end, we analysed the medium in which our cells of interest had been incubated for a defined time in a defined seeding density. For detection of lactate in a sample, we used a L-lactate kit (Megazyme) , in which two enzymatic reactions lead to a measurable concentration of NADH proportional to the Lactate content of the sample, which can then be measured as optical density at 340 nm (OD340). The kit was used applying the provided protocol.
Methods and Results
We used Jurkat cells as our cancer cells, 3T3 as our control for non-cancer cells and we also measured the concentration of lactate in bacteria. We expected the Jurkat cells to produce more lactate than the 3T3 and the bacteria to produce none.
The first problem we came across measuring the absorbance was the phenol red of the medium of the mammalian cells, which absorbs at the same wavelength as the lactate kit. Once the phenol red was removed, there was still another problem: a component of the medium seemed to react with our kit. After a bibliographic search, we decided that removing FBS from the medium was"

RFP biobrick fluorescens measurement (test)
Goal:
1. To get a descriptive curve for the rise in fluorescens (transformed DH5α)
2. Find out how often the measurements need to be done.
Procedure:
The second batch of plates from transformation and the negative control:
1. Colonypicking and exchange to liquid medium
Measurements of the first batch (Tecan):
1. Measured the OD of the blank (LB and CM), and measured the OD of the two cultures.
2. For the next measurements we diluted the cultures by 1:100 in separate tubes.
3. Incubation of the tubes
4. The first measurement was done in the Tecan, and repeated for every 30 minutes and then 1 hour (because of minor changes in values)
5. The measurements was set overnight as well using the following script: FluorescenceLong. The data was set to 588 nm absorbance, 584 nm excitation, 607 nm emission, 37°C, 40 gain, 150 kinetic cycles, 300s shaking (orbital 3 mm amplitude).
Results:
The second batch from transformation has turned red. From the measurements of the test batch we have an idea of the increase in fluorescence intensity and the change in absorbance over time. This can be used to determine the timing of the second batch with the negative control as well.

In order to avoid spread of genetic material, we built a plasmid which constitutively expressed Barnase (an RNAse from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) under the regulation of the tapetum specific promoter TA29. Barnase effect under the regulation of this promoter can’t be tested under the limitations of transient expression and time restrictions didn’t allow us to create the stable plant, but its function is well documented .
We worked together with NRP-UEA-Norwich team to introduce their chromoproteins (Yellow and Blue) in our system to be used as a strategy of identity preservation. We received their complete transcriptional units and tested them in plant. However, their activity was not strong enough to be detected by naked eye.
The complete biosafety module, containing chromoproteins as identity preservation agent, had already been constructed in biobricks format. Expression of Barnase specifically in tapetum cells and an identity preservation agent completes our biosafety module.
Since the provided chromoproteins did not show enough change in the plant’s colour to be detected by the naked eye, we tested an alternative strategy. We tested an anthocyanin production enhancing genetic construction in N.benthamiana. Anthocyanins are coloured compounds found in plants.
We obtained this construction from GoldenBraid 2.0 collection. This construction expresses two transcription factors (Ant1 and JAF13) and successfully enhanced the synthesis of anthocyanins. Therefore, we propose an identity preservation strategy based in anthocyanin accumulation as part of our biosafety module.

Voici le planning de répartition des électroporations:
Trois populations cellulaires ont donc été respectivement électroporées 12h, 24h et 36h avant le premier run de cytométrie (en rouge, à 9h, jour 3), quatre autres 6h, 18h, 30h et 48h avant le second run (en vert, à 16h, jour 3).
La première analyse cytométrique  nous a permis d’obtenir les données pour le suivi à +12h, +24h et +36h, tandis que la seconde, nous a permis d’obtenir les données pour le suivi à +6h, 18h, +30h et +48h.
En couplant toutes ces données, on obtient un suivi sur 48h de l’induction de l’apoptose après électroporation de p53wt.

Chaque population cellulaire, représentant les différentes tranches horaires du suivi, a subi un test à l’annexine V à l’instant escompté. Malheureusement, une mauvaise dilution du tampon de l’annexine a causé la mort de toutes les populations cellulaires lors du test. Bien que les résultats furent probants pour les suivis à +24h, +30h et +48h par simple comparaison des populations contrôles et tests au microscope (figure 1), nous n’avons pu le confirmer par l’analyse cytométrique.

N’ayant pu commencer la culture des DU-145 que début octobre, les deux semaines qui nous a fallu pour atteindre la confluence nécessaire à l’expérimentation n’ont pas laissé place à la pratique d’un second essai…
Cependant, de nombreuses études ont montré que le fait d’amener p53 wild type au sein de cellules tumorales p53 mutées déclenchait le processus d’apoptose. C’est le cas notamment"

EF-1alpha Promoter
Introduction
The constitutive human Elongation Factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) Promoter regulates gene expression in mammalian cells. It is known that the CMV promoter is commonly used for constitutive expression, and here we introduce EF-1alpha promoter as an alternative mammalian promoter, which works in a wide range of cell types. The origin of this part is from Homo sapiens chromosome 6 genomic contig, GRCh37. p13.
In our characterization, the sequence of EF-1alpha Promoter was assembled in front of a GFP reporter ( BBa_K648013 ) and hGH polyA terminator ( BBa_K404108 ) using Freiburg’s RFC25 format. The EF-1alpha promoter-GFP was then transfected into HEK293FT cells and in vivo green fluorescence signal was observed under fluorescence microscope. The positive control was iDUET101a plasmid ( Addgene Plasmid Number 17629 ) that contains EGFP reporter driven by an EF-1alpha promoter. A negative control was made by GFP generator that does not contain the EF-1alpha promoter. As a side by side comparison, a CMV promoter driven GFP reporter was also transfected, though a quantitative comparison between the two was not conducted in our characterization. Detailed protocols for our characterization work can be accessed via the link.
Characterization Procedure

Liquid is crossing over a close valve in this chip. The blue liquid has crossed over the valve above it, a valve that is
closed, and is contaminating the red liquid, as seen by the dark-purple liquid in the red metering section.
Mixer does not mix liquids sufficiently
This qualitative failure is characterized by the final output of a mixer not being sufficiently mixed. This failure can be dependent on the chip being tested, as certain procedures will have varying levels of tolerance regarding mixture homogeneity. In general, liquids exiting a mixer should be relatively homogeneous; a quantitative calculation of mixing can be performed to calculate how homogeneous the final mixture is.
Liquid is not fully mixing in the mixer. Ideally, the liquid would enter the mixer on the left, mix as it passes through the primitive, and exit as a homogeneous liquid on the right side of the  mixer. However, in this mixer the liquids exiting are not homogeneous, as seen by the distinct sections of color.
Metering dispenses inaccurate volume of liquid
This qualitative failure is characterized by an incorrect volume of liquid being dispensed by a metering primitive. This failure is almost always observed in conjunction with other failures such as leaks and liquid crossing over closed valves. Therefore, if any of the above failures occur prior to or during metering, it is extremely likely metering will dispense an incorrect volume of liquid(s). To calculate the volume of liquid being measured and/or dispensed from a metering primitive, please refer to the metering quantitative analysis portion of Fluid Functionality.
Liquid crossing over closed valves is causing a metering failure. The presence of oil in the output (horizontal) channels of a metering primitive suggests that valves have not properly caused, as liquid should not be displaced in output channels (horizontal) as their accompanying valves should be closed. This would cause inaccurate volumes of liquid to be dispensed by the metering primitive.
Quantitative Analysis & Evaluation
Maximum Pressure Calculation
When a chip's internal pressure exceeds the maximum pressure that the sealing can withstand many complications such as leaks will ensue. In order to evaluate whether the chip will be able to function without these issues a PSI calculation is needed to be performed. This quantitative test is utilized to measure the internal pressure of a specific primitive inside your microfluidic chip. The MARS chips have all been manufactured using Makerfluidics, and have been evaluated to withstand an internal pressure of up to 5 PSI[1].  To calculate the pressure in a given primitive the following three equations need to"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#PHB_-_-_TEXT.html," embodied energy which nowadays is required, as seen at table 1 above.The production of PHB is 4 times higher than PET and PVC, which is one of the main reasons why PHB is still under development (table 1). PHB’s tensile strength is not as well as other plastic types, but the elongation is higher than PLA’s (table 1).
The melting point of PHB is almost the same as PLA, which makes it compatible for 3D printing. PHB has the possibility to be used as a substitute for PET, PVC and PLA due to the melting temperatures similiarities. It is also indicated through maximum temperature, minimum temperature and how good it is as an electrical and thermal conductor or insulator (table 1). One of PHB’s best properties is that it is a bio-derived material.
Some of the plastics commonly found in bandages are poly-vinylchloride and poly-ethylene. PHB has properties similar to these plastics which makes it a competent replacement for the backside of the bandage, as shown above.  The fact that PHB is biocompatible makes the plastic suitable for partaking in covering a skin lesion and thereby protecting mechanically from further exposure to microorganisms (and microplastics).
A wound often heals better and more effectively when a traditional patch is applied, partly due to the fact it withholds moist GIL, E. S., PANILAITIS, B., BELLAS, E. & KAPLAN, D. L. 2013. Functionalized silk biomaterials for wound healing. Adv Healthc Mater, 2, 206-17. . PHB, as a framework for Bacto-Aid, could retain moisture. This could result in a synergistic effect, where the properties of spider silk combined with PHB  creates the perfect healing conditions. It is though, important to do further studies of the moist’s impact on the different sub-elements of Bacto-Aid."

We have tickets for London!
Wednesday 13th
The remake of Brian: The Movie began today – he’s never looked better. Meanwhile in the lab, data is (yes I know it should be ‘are’ – deal with it) starting to come in, but not fast enough.
Thursday 14th
We have tickets for Boston!
Friday 15th
The project description was finalised today. Infintiely more exciting was a visit from Eppendorf who gave us pens which look like pipettes. This changes everything.
A late night tonight though, as time points for a growth curve were needed until 9pm, and PCRs were still being done at 7pm.
Weekend 16th-17th
The pens aren’t that great actually – they ran out immediately.
Week 13 (18th August – 24th August)
Monday 18th
The start of the penultimate week now, and we might have a logo! The experiments continued apace, with the two week deadline being stolidly ignored by all.
Tuesday 19th
Another of our famed trips to the pub today, joined by one of our supervisors. This was the highlight of the day.
Wednesday 20th
We solved the mystery of the failed FullClips – our half clips were broken because the kinase is faulty because we… left the freezer open. Oh well!
Thursday 21st
More sequencing results today – they look… strange.
Friday 22nd
TAnother big meeting today with everyone – powerpoint slides and everything. Everyone recounted what stage they were up to and we started to look at exit strategies for getting thing to an acceptable end.
This was all fairly invigorating, and morale was generally restored after a hard week.
Weekend 23rd-24th
How can there be one week left??

High School Practical Course
On July 27, 28, and 30, we held a 3-day practical course for 20 students from a local high school. The students were 16-18 years old, and had prior knowledge of microbiological principles. For many (or all) students though, the practical course was their first time employing many new techniques.
The concept for the practical course was to teach students the principles of synthetic biology, how to work safely in the laboratory, and how to utilize cloning as a biological tool.
The daily plan was as follows:
Friday
Introduction to laboratory safety by Professor Thorsten Mascher
Basics of cloning explained by Simon
Dilution series competition
First steps of PCR
Saturday
Cutting insert with restriction enzymes
Gel electrophoresis of PCR product
Presentation
Construction of a new plasmid with RFP
Transformation of E. coli with new vectors and plating
Monday
Checking plates for red (RFP) E. coli colonies
Introduction to synthetic biology by Professor Thorsten Mascher
Paper & glue constructs
Explanation of the LMU-Munich iGEM 2012 project
Brainstorming and presentation of student SporoBead ideas
Certificates of participation
Have a look at the creative ideas the students had about what to do with our spores:
Our thoughts
The chance to solidify our own knowledge of cloning and synthetic biology in general by teaching it to others was fantastic! We also appreciated the enthusiasm of the students, as they volunteered to participate, and did so on their summer vacation."

Continuation of the Western Blot
Washed the membrane with 20 mL TBST for 10 min.
The primary antibody Sigma F3165 Monoclonal Anti-Flag M2 Antibody contained 5 µL AK (4 µg/µL) on 2 mL TBST, 1% milk powder (20 mg) for a AK-concentration of 10 µg/µL.
First the membrane was incubated in a 2 mL AK-solution for 30 min at room temperature. To make sure, that all antibodies got contact with the membrane, we welded the membrane with the AK-solution and incubated it for another 90 min at room temperature. After that the membrane washed with 20 mL TBST two times for 10 min at room temperature.
The secondary antibody solution contained 20 mL TBST 1% milk powder (200 mg) with 2 µL goat-anti-mouse. The antibody was incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
After that washed with 20 mL TBST two time for 10 min at room temperature.

Chris has managed to construct what we hope is a working red light sensor. It is being sent in for sequencing today.
Minor characterisation experiment:
-Red light sensor constructed with blue-white lacZ reporter
-If activated, the red light sensor transformants should produce blue colonies
-Red light sensor containing-colonies from transformant plate streaked onto two plates
-One plate left in the light, the other left in the dark
-If the one in the light grows blue and the one in the dark doesn't, it is a good indication that the construct is working

Summer Camp for High School Students
In summer 2016, high school students from different regions of China came to SUSTech Summer Camp. We devoted to prepare a lecture for them, introducing our project based on their knowledge learnt from the biology classes set by their own school. Primary PI, Dr. Wei Huang briefly introduced synthetic biology and iGEM.  We collected their questions and suggestions, which may give us new thoughts about our projects.
“Although I have no biology background, I can really understand what you were talking about. Your works are really amazing and I am deeply impressed.”high school students' principal said.
The lecture given by Dr. Wei Huang, Jiashun Xiao and Haiyan Wang, to high school students joining SUSTech Summer Camp.
Citizens and residents
In addition to student population, we thought our project must be known by a wider range of people. Besides, to make our “Sound Visualization” closer to life, we hope to make our effort turned into actual therapy idea or new way to modify genetic structure in response to mechanical stress or sound. We start to concentrate on those who have problems with hearing, not only limited to those with damaged hair cells in ear or other components of ear, but also all of the people with hearing loss in different extents.
We designed a questionnaire on the Internet (link: sojump ) to collect information about the understanding and care about hearing-impaired people, and to find a way that can help them in the most comprehensive and effective way. Meanwhile, we included introduction about iGEM and the basic status of those people and we called for attention to care about them at the beginning of the questionnaire.
To minimize the acquired hearing impairment caused by noise and electronic equipment, we also designed a brochure named ""Shape and Sound"". We printed more than 500 pieces and handed out on our campus as well as several residential communities. In the 6-pages brochure, we introduced the mechanism of hearing forming and the status of hearing-impaired people around the world. We called for concerns about them and also gave several tips for ear caring in daily life in order to reduce chronic hearing loss, which is popular nowadays but draws little attention actually for time course.
Booklets ""Shape and Sound"" designed by ourselves independently. We focused on ear caring and called on public awareness on hearing loss.
We gave out our booklets ""Shape and Sound"" in"

1. Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
     The main idea of our system was inspired by the urgent need to achieve the maximum productivity and maintain healthy soil at the same time. We participated in Asia Agri-Tech Expo to know the current fertilizer status. Also, we visited the Agricultural Improvement Station and Professor Yang, a Chung Hsing University professor, to find out the problem of unbalanced microbiota. They gave us tips on how to perform our experiments and meet the needs of the public.

After the culture reached an OD of 0.7, expression was induced by adding 20 ml of 500 mM Arabinose solution to each flask. Protein expression was continued for 4 hours.
Then the cells were pelleted by centrifuging for 10 min at 5000 rpm.
The pellets were resuspended in 20 ml SA buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml Lysozyme.
After short incubation the cells were disrupted by the application of ultrasound.
The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 20000 rpm for 1 hour to remove cell pieces and aggregate.
The supernatant was put in dialysis tubes and suspended in SA buffer overnight.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Practices#DualUse_-_-_TEXT.html," non consistent definitions in such an important field, we see the necessity of an international definition to establish a uniform basis for discussion and establishment of guidelines. Containing both definitions, namely the potential use of goods or technologies for military purposes as well as the potential misuse of information and knowledge, we find the definition of the WHO to fulfill those needs. We consider biosecurity to be not only the protection of material, but also the prevention of risks that arise by the knowledge provided in research.
Laws
In our analysis, we find the legal situation in the European Union ( European Union,2014 ), Germany ( Federal Republic of Germany, 2012 ) and the USA ( U.S. Government, 2015 ) to be inconsistent. Most laws only apply to the dual use items, such as chemicals. In some countries publications are dealt with as such dual use items and laws are applied, in others not. This inconsistency lead to a broad ethical debate.
Since it seems to be unclear, whether the existing laws apply, we see a definite need for an international regulation and a guideline. Such are proposed by various advisory boards, non governmental organizations and ethical committees. We further describe the laws in detail, possible guidelines, implications and proposals of those boards and committees and display various opinions in the broad field of ethical questions concerning dual use in our report.
Ethical questions
The discussion about moral and ethical questions of the dual use matter is of very broad range. The complete understanding of the ethical basis is far beyond the size of this record and requires a deep understanding of ethics. To display various points of view beyond the laboratory work and to complete our findings we contacted several experts and display a summary of different points of view.
Freedom and responsibility in science
The advances of communication technology create free access and communication. This is promoting the progress of science. Simultaneously, this freedom creates the possibility of access of this information for potential misuse ( DFG/Leopoldina, 2010 ). Freedom of science and the possible need for restriction of information for security purposes are hence controversial and need to be weighed carefully.
Self regulation vs. institutional oversight
A self regulation process needs responsible participation of everyone involved in the path of research and its publication: researchers, funding institutions, cooperators, coworkers, editors and reviewers of journals, ethics councils and legal institutions. While this responsibility is called for by various advisory boards and non governmental institutions ( European Commission, 2014 , NSABB, 2007 ), the need for institutional oversight is still  stated. Different points of view from experts are discussed in detail in our report. Among them is the point of view"

High Efficiency Yeast Transformation Protocol
(Modified from Agatep, R. et al. (1998) Technical Tips Online)
Inoculate a 50 ml ypd liquid culture (with a single yeast colony). This volume depends on how many transformations are needed. Allow about 5-10ml of culture per sample. However, never start a culture less than 50ml.
Grow overnight with shaking at 30° C.
In the morning, read the OD of the culture. A culture in mid-log with an OD between 0.5 and 0.6 is ideal (which represents approximately 2.0 x 107total yeast cells per ml), but cultures ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 are also acceptable. If the culture is overgrown, dilute to approximately 0.2 and grow for 2 generations (2-3 hours). If efficiency is not essential, it is acceptable to use 10 ml of a culture at 0.3 OD.
