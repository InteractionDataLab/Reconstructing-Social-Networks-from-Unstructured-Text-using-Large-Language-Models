Adjust pH to 6.5. Filter sterilise (0.2µm). Store at room temperature.
Notes:
Warm clothing is recommended for day 3.
Prechill all equipment to be used in the cold room.
When working from day 3 (step 4) keep the cells cold at all times and perform re-suspensions in the cold room.
Make sure to read the protocol thoroughly before starting.
Method:
1. Streak a non selective LB plate with a dilution of the previous batch of Competent Cells, incubate at 37°C overnight.
2. The next day, inoculate a single colony from the plate in 2.5ml of LB broth. Incubate at 37°C overnight with shaking at approximately 225rpm.
3. The next day, use the entire overnight culture to inoculate 250ml of LB medium containing 20mM MgSO4 (a 1/100 dilution of 2mM stock). Take 1ml of the culture and keep in a cuvette, as blank for OD measurement. Grow the cells in an autoclaved 1L flask until the OD600 reaches 0.4-0.6 (check after 2 hours then keep testing until within the range). A 1L flask is necessary for proper aeration and growth.
4. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 4500g for 5 minutes at 4°C. For a 250ml culture use two 250ml centrifuge bottles in a large rotor (eg. Beckman), or if not available use 50ml tubes in a bench top centrifuge at 3500rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. Tubes need to be prechilled!
5. Re-suspend the cell pellets in 0.4 volume (based on the original culture volume) of ice cold TFB1, using vortex, in the cold room. For a 250ml subculture, use 100ml of TFB1 (50ml/bottle). Combine the re-suspended cells in one bottle. For the remaining steps, keep the cells on ice and chill all pipettes, tubes and flasks.
6. Incubate the re-suspended cells on ice for 5 minutes at 4°C.
7. Pellet the cells by centrifugation as per step 4. When transporting cells to centrifuge, keep them on ice.
8. Re-suspend the cells in 1/25 of the original culture volume"

Safety
When it comes to safety, LASA does not take short cuts
Safety is not something to disregard. Especially in a lab where one is surrounded by dangerous chemicals that need to be handled carefully. We at LASA understand the consequences of not following all safety regulations, so we make sure to avoid all accidents possible.
General Lab Attire
Gloves, lab coats, and pants are mandatory for protection from potential spills and to avoid contamination
Closed toe shoes are required to protect feet from spills and falling objects
Long hair tied back to prevent contamination and being caught on objects
Loose clothing and hanging jewelry are not permitted in the lab to prevent being caught on objects and contamination
Equipment
All laboratory equipment is checked constantly to make sure it is fully functional
Detailed logs are kept of equipment checks and who uses the equipment for the purposes of repair in the future
Organization and Storage
Laboratory supplies are kept in an organized manner so supplies for experiments can be located in a safe manner
Organization spreadsheets updated so all materials are accounted for
Flammables such as ethanol are stored safely away from flames
Acids and bases are also kept separated to prevent hazards
Although not used in our experiments, the team knows how to store cryogenics and compressed cylinders as other members of the lab use these hazards
Personal items are kept in a separate location from the laboratory to prevent tripping and also to keep better organization of materials
All items are properly labeled with name, date, and/or concentration (if applicable)
Training
All members in the lab are extensively trained in laboratory procedures
If members forget how to complete experiments, they have mandatory refreshers to make sure they are safe while completing the experiments
Always one experienced person working at the bench at a time
Lab Notebook
The notebook is used to keep all information about the whereabouts of objects known by all members
Chemical Safety
In order to ensure safe chemical usage in the lab, LASA puts extra effort into taking care of our chemical's needs, whatever they may be
First of all, we always pay attention to fire hazards by keeping combustibles at a minimum and only turning on gas or keeping an open flame when it is actively being used
While LASA has not specifically used them, flume hoods have been made available for"

Background
Metal ions detecting module
        We chose five metal ions to construct our metal detecting module, and three of them                     have outstanding response effect. It is remarkable that they all belong to the MerR family. So here we                     are going to explain how this family work.
        The MerR family is a group of transcriptional regulators with similar N-terminal                     helix-turn-helix DNA binding regions and C-terminal effector binding regions that are specific to the                     effector recognized. The few MerR-like regulators that have been studied experimentally have been shown                     to activate suboptimal σ
70-dependent promoters, in which the spacing between the -35 and -10 elements                     recognized by the σ factor is greater than the optimal 17±1 bp.
         So, how does it respond to heavy metal ions? Take MerR-pMerR as an example,                     it has several processes.
         1. In the absence of Hg2+ and MerR, RNA polymerase preferentially transcribes                     from the merR promoter, increasing the amount of MerR present in the cell.
        2. Once MerR binds to merOP, transcription of the MerR promoter is repressed                     and the DNA becomes bent and unwound at the operator sequence. RNA polymerase is recruited to the mer                     promoter, forming a ternary complex of DNA, MerR and RNA polymerase.
        3. Binding of Hg2+ to one of two binding sites on the MerR make DNA distortion                     at the centre of the operator which cause the reorientation of the -35 and -10 sequences make them interact                     with the RNA polymerase σ70 subunit to form an open transcriptional complex and transcription is initiated. [1]
         Our team chose several regulators (as the form below) in this family as our                     detecting module. And we also chose other regulators belonging to other family such as ChrB [4], RcnR [5].

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#Bielefeld_-_-_TEXT.html,"osyringone was used as a control. The cultures were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius until the cells reached stationary phase. A growth assay was carried out with measurements taken at OD550 every 2 hours for 10 hours. For further knowledge see raw data. Parallel with the OD550 measurements samples were taken and used for fluorescence measurements.
Figure 3: Typhoon trio fluorescence scanning of MG1655-pSB1C3-K389016 induced with 200 uM acetosyringone. Excitation: 633nm Emittance: 670nm. No RFP detection, any red seen in the picture is noise.
The fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer and the data was analysis with FL win Lab program. We did single read with excitation on 584 nm and emission 607 nm. We tried using both different excitation and emission slit size and performed the experiment twice but unfortunately we were unable to detect RFP in the cells. See the fluorescence raw data here.
We furthermore tested the cells on a Typhoon Trio but once again we could not detect RFP. We were advised by the Bielefeld team to use excitation at 584nm and emission at 607nm. This was done when using the Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer, but the Typhoon trio has limited settings and according to the Typhoon trio manual RFP can be detected at excitation R 633nm and emission at 670nm.
The picture above shows the fluorescence scanning preformed on the Bielefeld part induced with 200uM acetosyringone. We pelleted an over night culture of MG1655-pSB1C3-K38901 down, removed the supernatant and transferred the pellet to a glass slide and covered by a cover slide. No emissions are seen in the picture, any light seen on the picture is a result of noise.
None of us have any experience in working with the fluorescence spectrometer or the part it self. Further more our fluorescence spectrometer is different than the one the Bielefeld team used, therefore the instrumental settings might be different from their’s. Because we only had two days to replicate the experiment, we did not have time to try different settings. Overall the insignificant data are probably due to our lack time, experience with the brick and not the functionality of the biobrick, K389016.

Le plasmide thérapeutique exprime un ou plusieurs gènes thérapeutiques répondant à la physiopathologie ciblée. Il possède une séquence assurant son encapsidation dans le vecteur cellulaire , et une séquence DTS (DNA nuclear targeting sequence) pour son acheminement au sein du noyau de la cellule cible.
Le DVS améliore les problématiques sous-jacentes à la vectorisation. Les caractéristiques du vecteur tissulaire apportent une solution aux problèmes de spécificité et d’élimination par le système immunitaire rencontrés par les vecteurs. Les caractéristiques du vecteur cellulaire renforcent la spécificité du vecteur et apportent une solution pour le passage des membranes et de la délivrance d’agent thérapeutique.
Le DVS devient un vecteur des plus spécifiques permettant le transport d’un ou plusieurs inserts géniques dans un but thérapeutique avec une grande efficacité.

Application du DVS
La thérapie génique permet actuellement de traiter de nombreuses pathologies. Le DVS est un nouvel outil pour intégrer un insert génique dans une cellule cible. Nous avons choisi d’utiliser le DVS dans le cadre du cancer du poumon.
De nos jours, le cancer du poumon est le cancer le plus répandu. Souvent associé au tabac, il peut également toucher des personnes qui n’ont jamais fumé.
Le cancer du poumon peut être séparé en plusieurs types :
- Les cancers épidermoïdes (35-40 %)
- Les adénocarcinomes (25-35 %)
- Les carcinomes à grandes cellules (10-15 %)
- Les carcinomes à petites cellules (20-25 %)
Dans chaque cas, comme dans la plupart des cancers, les gènes suppresseurs de tumeur sont mutés et deviennent non fonctionnels. Le DVS apporte donc les gènes suppresseurs de tumeurs « wild type » et de leurs promoteurs dans les cellules cancéreuses du poumon.

On this page you find the results that we achieved during our Interlab Study experiments. Please use the above bars to navigate around the page. You can read about the Interlab Study here .
Construct Strains
We constructed multiple strains expressing GFP from different promoters of the Andersen Library.  12 out of the 15 promoters we intended to use were successfully transformed into DH5α. These 12 constructed strains were applied in the further analysis of the relatively promoter activity. The promoters J23111, J23117 J23109 were not successfully cloned into E. coli. We did not detect any fluorescence signal from these strains and our sequencing results confirmed that they were not correctly constructed. These 3 strains were excluded from the dataset. To measure the background signal a strain containing the E0240 BioBrick (GFP without any promoter) was used. A strain with the I20260 BioBrick was also applied. The I20260 BioBrick also contain the J23101 promoter upstream of GFP, but is present in another backbone than the remaining promoters.
Fluorescence Measurement on Cultures
Fluorescence was measured in the BioLector. A BioLector flower plate was inoculated with 15000 fold diluted O/N culture of the 12 above mentioned strains, the inoculations were performed in triplicates. Biomass and fluorescence were measured during growth.  Fluorescence signal through the growth was normalized by dividing by OD620. The average of the fluorescence is illustrated in the bar chard below, together with the expected values relative to the J23100 promoter. Orange is the expected values and gray indicates our measured fluorescence signal. The values indicated in the bar chart are mean values of all the measurements taken during a"

‘Synthetic biology for kids and adults and everyone in between’
The University of Melbourne took up the challenge of teaching synthetic biology to all ages, embracing a ‘science for everyone’ approach. In so doing, we engaged in education outreach activities with kindergarten students from three childcare centres as well as both university and high school students from across Australia.
 
For kindergarten students
We decided to write the first in a series of children’s books for pre-schoolers aged 4-6 themed in the spirit of iGEM entitled ‘The Adventures of E. coli’ for a number of reasons:
Children aged 4-6 are in a key learning stage, during which their interest in science can significantly influence their long-term science education outcomes (Bowman, Donovan, & Burns, 2001, pp. 8-9).
There are lots of resources about science for older kids but not so many for kids at such a young age.
Picture books provide a springboard for further classroom activities
With the assistance of IndieMosh (Publishers link is here: http://www.indiemosh.com.au/author-42-iGEM-Melbourne-childrens-biology-science ) – a self-publishing facilitator – we managed to get our book in print and on Amazon, please see http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-E-Coli-Bianna-Makogon/dp/1925219208/
After we successfully published our book, it was time to take it to the audience. We approached childcare centres across Melbourne and negotiated for our book to be read to pre-schoolers and for our team members to come along and teach the kids about science.
The book reading was well received and was followed by playing some science-related games, and having a chat about science in groups. Please check out the video we made about the day:
A big thanks to Kids Time Early Learning Centre (Moorabbin), Kids Time Early Learning Centre (Bentleigh East) and Coco's Early Learning Centre for inviting us to present our picture book to the kids.
We believe that through this book, young children can learn about basic concepts and the language of biology, forming a scientific foundation to be built on in future years. Moreover, it is our hope that this book will inspire children to continue to learn about"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

About us
Welcome on our Wiki competitors =P
We are a student-run team from the trinational graduate school ""École supérieur de Biotechnologie Strasbourg"" (ESBS) located in the capital of Europe - Strasbourg, France.
The ESBS is a joint-venture of the Universities of Freiburg and Karlsruhe in Germany, the University of Bale in Switzerland and the University of Strasbourg in France. Students come from all four partner universities and furthermore from all around the three countries.
Our project is about establishing a regulatory network over several cell generations in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We want to construct a toggle switch that is triggered by cell cycle dependent factors.  This would result in a binary expression pattern like for example GFP expression in every other cell cycle (0-1-0-1). There shall be the possibility to easily extend the system by adding further ""bits"" of similar construction (e.g. for the second bit the pattern 0-0-1-1). The resulting device would be the basis for a binary cell division counter.

iii We assume that mRNA, mutant Tor2 protein and FAP will degrade in a constant rate during normal metabolism in yeast cell.
To demonstrate the above complicated model more clearly, we simplify the original model and devide the whole network into four levels, which could form a feedback loop. After the simplification, it's much easier for reader without much professional knowledge to understand and more convenient to set parameters.
FAP bind with TORC1 to form a nonfunctional polymer, meaning the inhibition by FAP
TORC1 and Rtg1/3 form a nonfunctional polymer, which means that TORC1 suppress the activities of transcription factors in downstream. (This equation combines the equations with PP2As)
Functional transcription factors can activate specific target genes (mutant TORC1 here), and the following processes and equations are same with those in original model.
Follow the assumptions above, we set: i   No cross section with TOR pathway is counted in. ii  The amount of [TORC1] [Rtg1/3] [pCIT2] is unchanged during the whole process, however, each substance have different existing state. For example, Rtg1/3 has two states, one is functional ([Rtg1/3]) and another one is nonfunctional ([TORC1•Rtg1/3]) iii The mRNA, mutant Tor2 protein and FAP will degrade in a constant rate.
From the Figures above, we know that in the environment without FAP, the amounts of TORC1 and mTORC1 will lead to a steady level after a very short time. i TORC1: the amount is near 10.037, as we calculate before. ii mTORC1: the amount is near 0.2872, as we calculate before. iii Then total amount of functional proteins that could reach ""level 2"" is 10.037+0.2872=10.3242 .
When FAP are added, the amount of TORC1 is decreased sharply, and then after a period of time, it maintain in a relatively steady level in 48h's fermentation. And the finally amount is about 0.39. From this, we know that FAP greatly inhibits the activity of TORC1.
From the figure above, we found that the amount of mTORC1 is greatly increased after FAP are added in"

Aproximately this is the interval from 3 to 5. We also see that this interval gets smaller as we increase the voltage. The interval also becomes smaller with increasing volumes of V1. We have also found that three-droplet merging should be present at the very low and the very high values of V2/V1. We have then experimentally tested these parameters and have successfully reached almost 100% effective droplet merging using volume ratio of 3 to 5. We have then proceeded to use the parameters in our CAT-Seq workflow.

Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in the UK is 81, [22] however for those who have NSCLC, and thus are likely to have smoked, life expectancy is at least 10 years lower. [23] The quality of life score is assumed to be 1, i.e when someone is cured of NSCLC, the years of life gained are assumed to be in perfect health or any other factors that reduced their quality of life were not considered to be due to NSCLC. Thus QALYs gained = 70 - current age. If an individual is over 66, QALYs gained are taken to be 5, as the statistics used were for 5 year survival.
Cost per QALY was calculated by dividing expected cost by expected QALYs. If this is less than £30000, screening for the next 6 years is cost effective for that patient.
When building this model we tried to use reasonable estimates to ensure we do not overestimate the cost effectiveness of our test.
You can download our spreadsheet here .
The model showed that is is cost effective to screen most people who have smoked.
The American Cancer Society recommends screening for people: [24]
between 55 and 77 years old,
who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the last 15 years
who have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking
We entered the details for someone at the lowest thresholds: someone aged 55, quit smoking 15 years ago, has a 30 pack-year history of smoking along with the average American’s build: male, white, no history of cancer or any lung diseases, college educated and a BMI of 27. [25] They would cost £6900 per QALY to be screened, making our tool extremely cost effective by the NICE £20,000 per QALY target. It would therefore be cost effective, by our analysis, to screen people with our system with even lower risks of developing NSCLC. This is mainly due to the low cost of our test and significantly improved surival rates when NSCLC is diagnosed in earlier stages.
The one significant assumption we may have over-estimated is sensitivity, as it is unlikely to be 100% in reality. However, for the same individual it would remain cost effective to screen even if sensitivity were reduced to 34% (£19,800 per QALY). This would never be ethically acceptable, given the number of cases of cancer you"

MODELLING
The evolution of our bacteria-phage dynamic model helped us gain a better understanding of the interaction between a bacteria population and a phage population and its impact on the viability of our design. After defining a variety of parameters and making several assumptions, we showed that it is possible for our system of bacteria and phages to be self-sustainable. Comparing our model with our experimental results, we developed a second model where we accounted for additional factors such as a possible mutation in the bacteria’s DNA that results in resistance against phage infection. Furthermore, we modelled the copper-binding efficiency of CUP I (our copper-binding protein) to estimate the optimal ratio of enzyme and copper concentrations that would result in the most efficient binding in the implementation of our system.
DISCRETE TIME MODEL
Purpose: Given an initial Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) and infection onset point (during a bacteria lifecycle), determine how the populations of bacteria and phages change over discrete time intervals.
Assumptions:
There is no delay in infection
All bacteria are susceptible to infection, and all infections are successful.
All bacteria death is caused by infection (i.e. there is no natural death)
Definitions of Parameters and Variables:
1. Multiplicity of Infection (MOI): The MOI represents the initial ratio between the number of phages and number of bacteria at the time of inoculation. It is a decisive factor in calculating the probability that a bacteria will be infected by at least one phage particle. The equation that relates the MOI to this probability is:
where P is the probability, and m represents the multiplicity of infection. Although it is possible that a bacterium is infected with more than one phage particles, a research study conducted by Ellis and Delbruck suggests that bacteria infected with multiple phage particles had similar burst sizes than bacteria that were infected with only one phage.
2. Burst Size: the number of phages produced per infected bacteria.
3. Lysis Time:  the time it takes for a phage to infect and lyse a bacteria host.
Both the burst size and the lysis time depend on the point during a bacteria lifecycle when inoculation begins. One research study conducted by Zachary Storms and Tobin Brown shows how the"

These assays show the effectiveness of the BBa_K1336007 degradation device in decolourisation of the two tested dyes at the indicated conditions. It remains unclear why most of the decolourisation took place in the second part of the assay; a possible explanation fot this is that the temperature post-incubation was more optimal for BsDyP function.
The conclusion drawn for the decolourisation experiments is that it would be possible to integrate the dye-decolourising device BBa_K1336007 in a bioprocessing context aimed towards the"

Nordic iGEM Conference
After four weeks of thorough planning and a lot of skype-meetings with our collaborators from iGEM Stockholm, it was time for the Nordic iGEM Conference. The plan was to create a platform for future collaborations, get a chance to exercise presenting, and of course have lots of fun. This was accomplished with a mingling party in form of a BBQ night, project presentation session, a bunch of workshops and, once we've got to know each other, a final get-together with a bar crawl.
Invitations had been sent out two weeks in advance and we had received confirmation from eight teams. Students from Aalto-Helsinki,  Oslo, SDU Copenhagen, Gothenburg, LiU, Stockholm and Uppsala were on their way to the Nordic iGEM Conference. We also had the pleasure to have Randy Rettberg, the chairman of iGEM organization, as a guest.
The weekend started with a nice BBQ evening at EBC in Uppsala with some awesome games provided by Aalto-Helsinki.
The actual conference was held at the Biomedical center (BMC), where the Uppsala team’s lab is located. The day started at 08:00 with breakfast at the accommodation, followed by a walk to BMC where our lovely hosts Sangeetha and Hugi welcomed everyone. Soon thereafter, the project presentations started.
The judging panel consisted of a representative from each of the eight teams. The judging format was similar to the main Jamboree. After some contemplation the scores were set. When all the interesting projects were presented and feedback was given, it was time for lunch.
Now it was time for the anticipated workshops. With all these young scientist gathered, it would be a pity not to use the immense wealth of ideas. The themes of the workshops were:
Awesome solutions for the lab: Is there a technical problem you have solved that might benefit others? If you plan to attend this workshop this might be good to discuss with you team and think about this question before the conference.

After 18h, at a concentration of 285µM fusaric acid, the transformed cells showed more fluorescence than the wild-type cells, while both strains showed no fluorescence when no fusaric acid was added, indicating that the promoter is not active when no fusaric acid is present.
The wild-type P. putida cells showed some fluorescence as well. We hypothesized that the stress caused by fusaric acid caused the excretion of additional fluorescent compounds, such as pyoverdine. Also, we found that LB medium has some auto-fluorescence. Since GFP does not include an excretion tag, we solved this problem by removing the supernatant by washing the cells with PBS and measuring the clean cells afterwards.
After washing with PBS, the wild-type cells showed no significant fluorescence, whereas the transformed cells clearly did, (see Figure 4.) indicating that the promoter is functional in this experiment.
Figure 4. Both P. putida strains are grown in LB medium with 285µM fusaric acid and washed with PBS. GFP fluorescence was checked for 6 samples of each, at 395nm excitation and 501 nm emission. This experiment shows that the promoter is active in the presence of fusaric acid. However, the value of the fluorescence is a dimentionless unit relative to the wild-type, which means a characterized promoter with a downstream GFP gene should be added to the experiment as a positive control to characterize this fusaric acid induced promoter.
Futhermore, the WT cells showed growth on all concentrations of fusaric acid, whereas the transformed cells did not survive a fusaric acid concentration of 565µM and higher (see Figure 5), which supports our hypothesis that the inserted vector decreased the fusaric acid resistance of our transformed P. putida cells.
Figure 5. Fusaric Acid does not seem to influence the growth of the wild-type P. putida, whereas the transformed cells do not survive a concentration 565µM or higher.
A new growth experiment was set up, using M9 medium instead of LB medium, to prevent fluorescent background noise of the medium. In this experiment both the WT P. putida and P. putida containing BBa_K1493000 are grown"
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," proposal from Prof. Zhi Zhu. We incubated two groups, namely pure fluorescent aptamer as well as fluorescent aptamer with EpCAM without light at the same time, then adding binding buffer to the total volume of 200 μL. After incubation, we added 3 mL binding buffer for fluorescence polarization. Get more information of our experiment, click here.
Figure 2.1 Polarizing fluorescence intensity of fluorescent aptamer.
Figure 2.2 Polarizing fluorescence intensity of fluorescent aptamer with EpCAM, after incubation.
According to the principle of fluorescence polarization, the FP value would depend directly on the effective molecular size of the fluorescent group at fixed temperature and viscosity of solution. For small molecules (fluorescent aptamer) with fast Brownian rotation in solution, the FP value was lower; while for larger molecules (fluorescent aptamer combined with EpCAM), the FP value was higher. [2]
The FP value could be calculated by the following formula:
Below are four maximum fluorescence values for calculating FP values:
Later, we could calculate whether the FP value of fluorescent aptamer increased with EpCAM incubation according to the principle. If the FP value increased, it showed that fluorescent aptamer did bind to EpCAM. We calculated the difference herein:
With an increase of 0.142, the difference was rather obvious, which demonstrated that the fluorescent aptamer did combine with EpCAM.
Combination between SYL3C and the ""complementary strand"" (DNA Agarose Gel Electrophoresis)
We've been struggling for some time due to one problem about how to prove that our aptamer and the complementary chains were combined, which would be paramount for our following experiments.
We tried SYBR Green I, a fluorescent dye that could be embedded in a double helix of DNA and thus significantly enhance fluorescence intensity, since it could distinguish ssDNA from dsDNA obviously. However, there's no significant difference according to our results. We speculated that the sequence might be not long enough, coupled with the formation of secondary structure of aptamers, leading to no difference in fluorescence intensity.
Finally, we exploited the conventional gel electrophoresis method to prove this block, and then gel electrophoresis was performed immediately after grouping and denaturing annealing. Because the sequence was too short, we did not have the appropriate DNA marker to use. Get more information of our experiment, click here.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#FRET Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"enching reduces the fluorescence of GFP by a factor ~ 25 which means a quenching efficiency of ~ 96%!.
K139013 was not able to reach the same fluorescence level as the positive control in the previous experiment. Therefore a worse rate of functional expression of K1319013 compared to K1319014 is assumed. incorporating this, the difference in fluorescence between induced and not induced is still a factor of ~ 30 resulting in a quenching efficiency of ~ 97%.
Summary
The fusion proteins of GFP combined with REACh1 and REACh2 are not only fully functional but exhibit a great quenching efficiency of ~ 97% for REACh1 and ~ 96% for REACh2.Even though REACh1s quenching ability seems to be slighty superior, the expression level of the K1319014 fusion protein including REACh2 is nearly twice as high as the fusion protein K1319013 containing REACh1 and therefore shows a stronger fluorescence.  Ganesan et al. (2006) reported a reduction on emission of GFP of 82% for REACh1 and 98% for REACh2 but with a different Linker between the proteins and on a different vector backbone.
Comparing fluorescence kinetics of the GFP-REACh fusion proteins with a Standard lacI-inducible GFP Expression
To assess the kinetics of the fusion proteins K1319013 (GFP-REACh1) and K1319014 (GFP-REACh2), the double plasmid systems K1319013 + K1319008 and K1319014 + K1319008 were compared to a standard expression of GFP under the control of a lacI promoter in K731520 , a BioBrick made by the iGEM Team TRENTO in 2012. This tested the hypothesis of achieving a faster fluorescence response with the GFP-REACh fusion proteins compared to a standard expression.
K731520 and the double plasmid constructs K1319013 + K1319008 and K1319014 + K1319008 were cultivated in E. coli BL21(DE3), and fluorescence and OD was measured.The fluorescence was adjusted for the OD to show a relative fluorescence on a per cell basis. The difference between the induced and non-induced state, the fluorescence quotient, serves as a better indicator for a system used as a sensor because the difference between an on and off state is more important for a clear and unmistakable signal than the overall fluorescence. Hence, the OD-adjusted fluorescence"

To reduce the amount of fluid out of liquid waste , we slightly bend the infusion tube. And open the culture medium entrance,  to access the medium to constantly update the cell’s liquid environment.
    After a discussion about our literature, we settled the size of each trap and the length, width, and height are 100 um, 85um and 5um, respectively, which is the most favorable one for oscillation experiment and dynamic response model. Two traps stand 150um apart at the same side, while for the opposite side, the groove is 200um wide and 100um deep which is convenient for fluid to pass. Also, according to our calculation, we are quite sure that this design can increase the flow of AHL quorum sensing substance, and can let the cells at the edge of expansion colonies be washed away, making it possible for bacteria in the traps maintaining a continuous exponential growth.For observing convenience, we divide the traps into 4 groups, and each has 30 traps. The distance between two groups is sixty thousands um.

    For overall experiment, we also designed a device to help us using the microfludic chip. As for the body part, the upper platform has four through-holes, for putting in the LEDs. The lower part has the two slots, size of each slot are the same as the microfluidic chip. And we have a shading baffle whose size is appropriate with slots. Devices and shading baffle are produced by 3D printing, the material we chose is resin. It has smooth surface, high precision, and good hardness. Taking into account that the device will be placed in the thermostat, we used a kind of resin that has small thermal deformation coefficient, this will ensure that assembling won’t be a problem. In order to ensure that the experiment will not be interfered by the stray light, all surfaces are sprayed with black matte paint.
The LED we used is a common cathode four-pin light-emitting diodes, we only use 1 (red), 2 (negative), 3 (green) three pins. The wavelengths were 630 ~ 640 nm and 515 ~ 525 nm, respectively. The brightness of the lights is around gigahertz candela.  All of them can meet our experimental requirements

Le vecteur cellulaire : Le bactériophage Lambda [1,2]
Nous avons étudié plusieurs types de bactériophages afin de sélectionner le vecteur cellulaire le plus modulable et le plus contrôlable. Pour se faire, nous avons répertorié tous les types de phages et au sein de chaque type, les espèces les mieux décrites. Plusieurs candidats ont retenu notre attention, mais c’est le bactériophage lambda qui nous a semblé le plus adapté.
Le bactériophage lambda est un virus procaryote qui infecte naturellement la bactérie Escherichia Coli. C’est un bactériophage dit tempéré, car il peut alterner phase lytique et phase lysogène sous certaines conditions. Pendant le cycle lytique, l’ADN circulaire est répliqué en grande quantité dans le cytoplasme, des progénies viraux sont formés, conduisant à la mort de la bactérie et à la libération des virions. Au cours du cycle lysogène, le génome du bactériophage est intégré dans le chromosome bactérien et est transmis à la descendance. La réplication se fait alors au rythme des divisions de la bactérie.
Naturellement infectieux pour la bactérie Escherichia Coli, le bactériophage lambda, comme tous phages, n’est pas infectieux pour l’Homme. Cette caractéristique provient du fait que leur génome est régie par des promoteurs procaryotes mais également du fait qu’ils aient une très faible capacité de transfection des cellules eucaryotes.
Enfin, l’une des caractéristiques intéressantes du bactériophage lambda est qu’il possède un ADN double brin linéaire ayant des extrémités cohésives : 12 nucléotides simple brin complémentaire, appelés séquences « Cos ». Ces extrémités cohésives ont une fonction dans l’encapsidation génomique.

Step 3 is not vital, but simply necessary to compensate for the frames taken out in other steps. Empty frames can be used to replace the ones that were swapped in steps 1, 2 and 4.
Step 4 is necessary to make sure that there is no open brood present in the mite shower colony. If there is open brood, the mites will mostly go in the brood cells instead of staying on the honeybees. This will make it harder to collect them.
These steps need to be repeated once every week at the same day to prevent mites from entering brood cells. If done correctly, it will make the powdered sugar method 2 more effective.  The powdered sugar method can be used to detach Varroa mites from honeybees. For this method, the following items are needed:
Powdered sugar
A jar with a mesh big enough to keep honeybees in, but let mites out
Brush
A mite-tight container
A frame from the bottom half of the mite shower colony can be shaken over the jar, so as many honeybees as possible are trapped in the jar. After the jar has been closed, a tablespoon of sugar should be poured over the bees and the jar should be shaken thoroughly. When the bees and sugar are properly mixed, the sugar should be shaken from the jar. The mites should come off along with the powdered sugar.
The brush, when wetted, is highly suitable for picking up the mites without harming them. It can be used to move the mites to the mite-tight container. To keep the mites in a good condition, it is necessary to keep them out of sunlight and wash them as soon as possible. Being covered in the powdered sugar will kill them rapidly.  Additionally, they will only survive 24 hours without larvae to feed on, so make sure to gather some larvae as well.
Finally, return the honeybees to the companion colony. As the companion colony will only have a few young honeybees, the sugary honeybees can be used to replenish their population.

Some faculty members of Rice University generously supported us and gave us the chance to present our project in the Symposium along the Rice University iGEM team. We learned a lot from this experience. It was a sort of a pre-Jamboree for us. The feedback that we received was extremely useful for the final steps of our project.

Insights
Waste water levels of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have increased to levels that influences the behaviour of fish and birds. SSRIs are pharmacologically active in vertebrates, as they use similar serotonin systems. Thus, SSRIs potentially affects other smaller animals in lower concentrations.
WSSRIs are soluble in water and will not easily evaporate. Therefore, we should study the effect of the SSRIs on the aquatic environment first.
The receptor might not be as selective in ditch water as in filtered water.
Methodological analyses is needed to investigate the effect of waste water on false positives/negatives.
E. coli is common in the human body and can survive and multiply easily in various circumstances. When a strain gets pathogenic by accident and released in the environment, it could have severe outcomes for society.
Applied
Find more on the social relevance of SSRIs and their impact.
We will apply a purification step before measuring to lose lipids and other substances which disturb the outcome.
In the end product, there have to be measures to make sure the bacteria can only survive in the device to prevent bacterial leak into the environment.

Insights
Drug use and thereby the concentration of drug residues in surface water has increased steadily over past years and will continue to grow in the future.
Water quality is also checked at treatment plants to measure the efficiency of water purification.
Dutch surface water is a source for drinking water. Therefore, compounds in the surface water end up in the drinking water, posing a threat for public health.
There is a purification obligation in horticulture.

Lab 2
To end the week, the RX lab students began their day at the lab where they once again split into the two research and testing groups. Jonah began testing on the grown DH5 Alpha cells from the previous day.  He placed various levels of cinnamaldehyde into the DH5 Alpha in order to view its effects on the formed biofilm. Travis, Peter, and Chris performed a gel purification of the chitinase plasmid in order to isolate, amplify, and purify the desired band (removing the tyrosine) .

Monday (07/09/18)
Lab 1
IT WORKED!!! Annie exclaimed as she retrieved the plates from the incubator. The plasmid had grown up exactly as planned. They then proceeded and extracted the plasmid from the host DH5a in order to send it in for sequencing.
Lab 2
On Monday, July 9th, the RX students began work in the lab once again splitting into the two groups in order focus on each aspect of the project.  Jonah took the cinnamaldehyde cultures from the previous Friday and began the process of staining the well plate with crystal violet in order for the amount of biofilm to be measured. The process requires the well plate to dry overnight before any measurements can be taken so it will be continued the next day. Travis, Chris, and Peter worked on a second digest of the Chitinase Plasmid in order to collect more purified DNA for when the IDT order arrives. They also used the Nano-drop to test the concentration levels of the undigested DNA and took the data in their laboratory notebook.
Tuesday (07/10/18)
Lab 1
The sequencing results arrived early in the day, and the students were both excited and anxious to have a peek at the results. The last time, the results were unfavorable, but this time, with everything going right, the LabPats opened the sequencing document and examined the results. Almost every base pair matched up! It was a huge win and morale booster for the team, as now the students could begin putting the “CheZ” insert into the plasmid finally.

Environment & sustainability
One of the obvious concerns when we first settled on the sticker design was waste. Consumers eat fruit and throw stickers in the bin, or stick them somewhere they shouldn’t be. By mass-producing even more packaging in this way, we are perpetuating the issue of landfill and pollution.In conjunction with discussions we had with OzHarvest volunteers, it was agreed that the way to overcome this problem was to ensure our stickers are biodegradable.  See Integrated Human Practices and Applied Design for more!
Social Justice
Our interaction with OzHarvest, a non-for-profit organisation, was extremely influential in the design selection of our product, as they emphasised the importance of biodegradability. Engagement in this way also provided more depth in our outreach efforts, because we were engaging with an audience already educated in the issue of food wastage.
Collaboration
Collaborating with other iGEM teams worldwide was an invaluable experience. We did extensive collaboration with the UNSW iGEM and Hamburg iGEM teams in particular, as well as engaging in minor collaboration with 6 other iGEM teams. On top of that, we connected with 46 more iGEM teams on Instagram. Check out the Collaboration page for more details!
Integrated Human Practices
Through Skype sessions and site visits, we engaged with Zespri Kiwifruit, Avocados Australia, and Fresh Produce Australia, to gain an insight into the context of our project. To find out more about how we used this information, check out the Integrated Human Practices page.
Theory of Knowledge
This aspect of our human practices was somewhat unplanned. It came about following a discussion about our amilCP mutants, and how they should be classified. These mutants have identical sequences as the wild type, with the exception of a single nucleotide. However, they are all vastly different colours.  Is it appropriate to refer to them as amilCP variants, when amilCP is by definition"
Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#OpenScience_-_-_TEXT.html," of this development of open data is collaboration and communication. This is demonstrated in the iGEM gold medal criteria, which requires teams to collaborate. On the official iGEM website, it requires teams to follow specific collaboration protocol:
Help any registered iGEM teams from high school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team…helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem  (“Judging/Medals”, n.d.).
For collaboration to occur teams must share, release, and either use or reuse another team's data. Teams must also either “improve the function or characterization of a previously existing BioBrick part or Device"" (“Judging/Medals”, n.d.). This increases the probability for data reuse in iGEM.  Collaborations of this manner portray iGEM as a knowledge infrastructure that encourages the development of sustainable and open data practices in young researchers.  While it may not extend beyond the completion of the competition, this cross-disciplinary and inter-university collaboration breaks down some of the inherent competitive aspects of iGEM.
Given the global and commercial nature of genetic disciplines, this collaboration also introduces the undergraduate teams and individuals to the challenges and conflicts that arise in global collaboration or even amongst labs that are not within the same institution (Kelwick et al., 2015; Kotlarsky & Oshri, 2005).
Moreover, teams can also either build own their own research or another team’s research from a previous year.  It follows that the Registry of Standard Biological Parts has methods of standardized metadata, which allow data to be located effortlessly when needed. The ability to build on others’ previous works demonstrates iGEM's belief of advancing research and driving innovation. This allows teams to ask new questions based on previous works, which can be tested to attain answers. This should provide new insight within the field of synthetic biology as well as achieving one of the principal goals of open science. Additionally, to attain answers to these new questions, highly advanced technology including software and hardware will be needed. For instance, you will need a combination of modeling software, and complex biological technologies in order to create a functioning BioBrick. (Act on the comment mentioned here)
Registry of  Standard Biological Parts: Standards for Reuse, Documentation and Metadata
Synthetic biology is a young interdisciplinary field — two qualities not conducive to the existence of quality universal data standards. Yet, the notion of standardizing parts is necessary to ensure the accumulation of work in the field.  Both instruments and research methods are standardized in i"

From 2008.igem.org
Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

Brochures
To propagate iGEM and make our human practice easier, we also made a beautiful brochure which contains detailed explanations of the iGEM competition. ( Click here to get the PDF file. )
Collaborations
Apart from collecting information of our own project during the process this year, we also helped many iGEM teams this year. The iGEMers are a group of young people who have passion about synthetic biology and are representatives of the synthetic biology community. Our close collaborations with each other not only helps us know many friends, but assists in propagating our ideas and projects to the science community all over China.
Collaborations with other iGEM teams
 
1. Team Tianjin
 
At the beginning of the summer vocation, team Tianjin contacted us for help and support. They wanted a kind of bacteria called Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. We eagerly contacted Prof. Aijun Liao in our university asking for this species, cultivating it and then mailed Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 timely. After that, when they encountered some difficulties cultivating this species, we assisted them to get technical support about the conditions for culturing this kind of bacteria.
 
Later, in CCiC conference, we are pleased to know that team Tianjin managed to use Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 successfully and achieved crucial experiment results based on this species. Therefore, we took a picture with each other’s posters together to witness this collaborations. Besides, some of the team members in team Tianjin or team Nanjing-China made great friends and team Tianjin gave special gifts to us during CCiC to express their thanks.
 
 
2. Team NEFU-China
 
We got in touch with NEFU-CHINA during the CCiC conference by asking questions after their presentations. Most of our team members were really interested in their project so we meet them after the Q&A time of the presentation. In this meeting, our team members came up with some great ideas to improve their project. What’s more, when advisors in team NEFU-China put forward their difficulties of proceeding experiments, we offered to share some equipment with them and invited them to our lab. All of the teachers and students in team NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their"

Even though all the necessary infrastructure and investment required to implement a company of industrial production, there are other exes that compound the total capital investment required, taking on count the capital unfolding for its long-term use.
Companies have a continuous capital investment to sustain existing operations and expand their businesses for the future. The main type of capital investment is in fixed assets to allow increased operational capacity, capture a larger share of the market and in the process, generate more revenue (Miller, M., 2017). The Engineering costs cover the exes that involved the implementation of an industrial process, including all project management aspects of the installation. The contingency charge refers to uncertain situations that can occur or not in the future, situations in which the company faces specific incertitudes such as payment of credit for users and waiting to liquidate the debt at an indefinite time (Simple Economy, 2016). The working capital is the economic background which will be implemented by the corporation to reinvest and obtaining profits to maintain the current business operation (Rodas, F., 2012).

Annual Fixed Costs
Based on the components of our financial projection, we determined the annual fixed costs. We considered that our company is seeking for financing and investments; therefore we considered renting most of the facilities and technological devices in which we are going to focus on completing the manufacturing process for our final product, the main reason for this is the fact that we can't afford the equipment. We included exes that would be generated when having employees, and those from basic services, such as water, electricity, and gas.
After one year passed by, we are going to consider an increase on fixed costs due to the cover of any raise at the production capacity duplicated year by year.
Variable annual costs
For these costs, we are considering anything necessary for the production phase, promotion, distribution and commercialization of our product.
We also considered that commercial houses responsible for distribution and all the team members from Erwinions will receive 5% commission for each product sold.All of this because at this stage we can’t afford to pay salaries for all the team members that were essential on the"

Safety
Our iGEM team is committed to consider all aspects of the entire project, especially biosafety. For this project, two biosafety aspects have to be covered. On the one hand, we are using E. coli as genetically modified organism, and on the other hand, we are detecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen. It infects people suffering from cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency as well as severe burns or open wounds. When sampling P. aeruginosa, we should prevent proliferation and spread of the bacterium. For E. coli, we have to take care of biological containment of a genetically modified organism.
In general, we developed and designed the measurement device as closed system for a better safety handling. This way, neither the sampled pathogens nor the genetically modified sensor cells can escape our biosensor unit. For the detection, we are using one-time usage sampling and sensor chips which can be disposed of after autoclaving or irradation with strong UV light. Moreover, the electronic components are in a separate compartment and inaccessible for the user, preventing electric shock or other injuries.
Biosafety level for WatsOn
Don't forget to use WatsOn only in laboratoris with the biosafty standard 1
To detect P. aeruginosa, a sampling agar chip is slightly pressed against the solid surface to be tested. This sampling chip is put on the sensor chip and both are placed in a petri dish which is closed thoroughly. Thereby, the cells have no contact with the device during or after the measurement. However, the sensor chips must be handled in S1 environments only since they contain genetically modified E. coli. Afterwards, both chips can be autoclaved and disposed. The whole lining"

Revision 2 of the Uno board has a resistor pulling the 8U2 HWB line to ground, making it easier to put into DFU mode.
Revision 3 of the board has the following new features:
1.0 pinout: added SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. In future, shields will be compatible both with the board that use the AVR, which operate with 5V and with the Arduino Due that operate with 3.3V. The second one is a not connected pin, that is reserved for future purposes.
Stronger RESET circuit.
Atmega 16U2 replace the 8U2.
""Uno"" means one in Italian and is named to mark the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. The Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform; for a comparison with previous versions, see the index of Arduino boards.
Fluorimeter
A fluorimeter is an electronic device that can read the light and transform it in an electrical signal. In our project, that light proceeds from a bacterial culture that has been excited.
Its principle of operation is as follows:
First, an electrical signal is sent from Arduino to a LED to activate it. This LED has a specific wavelength to excite the fluorescent protein present in the microbial culture.
When these bacteria are shining, we receive that light intensity with a photodiode, and transform it into electrical current. Now, we have an electrical current that is proportional with the light and therefor to the concentration of fluorescent protein present in the culture. We have to be careful with the orientation between the LED and the photodiode because interferences may occur in the measurement due to light received by photodiode but not emitted by the fluorescence in the culture but scattered light emitted by the LED.  Also, a proper band-pass filter has been placed between culture and photodiode to allow only the desired wavelengths to pass through.
File:Fluorimetro1.gif
The electric current coming from the photodiode has a very small amplitude, thereby we have to amplify it and translate it into a electric voltage with an electronic trans-impedance amplifier. We can choose the gain of this amplification changing the value of resistances of the circuit. The resistances must be properly"

A strong RBS was chosen so that when a promoter was induced, the RBS would not be the weak link. This particular RBS was selected as a strong one because it has been shown to have high levels of translation specifically in Bacillus subtilis,[xii] even though many parts are E. coli specific and do not work well, if at all, in Bacillus subtilis.
sfGFP and mRFP were chosen as the reporters because they both are expressed in Bacillus subtilis (research revealed that RFP is not expressed in Bacillus subtilis and thus should not be used with it),[xiii] visible reporters are easiest to observe, and fluorescent proteins in particular are easiest of the visible reporters, especially since the bacteria would be in a dark soil medium. Two reporters were chosen instead of using the same one over so that it could be observed whether one or both plasmids were being expressed.
A relatively strong forward terminator with few base pairs was selected for its relative effectiveness, the fact that no reverse termination was required, and the number of base pairs was to be minimized as much as possible without impairing function.
Phytosiderophore Genes
Different organisms have slightly different DNA sequences for phytosiderophores production, and corn DNA was selected as our source for two main reasons. Rice experiences less iron deficiency than corn (M. Levy, personal communication, June 30, 2014), and in case the phytosiderophores could only be used by the organism from which the DNA came, we wanted to make it more likely corn would be aided. Another reason was that the corn genes were shorter than their rice counterparts. The corn genes were codon optimized for Bacillus subtilis using information on codon usage.[xiv] Rare codon optimization occurs because different organisms use the various codons which code for the same amino acid at different frequencies; switching out a codon that the organism from which the DNA came from uses often but the new organism uses rarely for a codon that the new organism uses more frequently can increase the rate of gene expression.
Two of the genes, nas and naat, had separate forms. nas has variants nas1, nas2, nas3, nas4, nas5-1, nas5-2, and nas6, while naat has naat-A, naat-B, and naat1, among others. nas1 was selected because, in a previous experiment, it was able to, alone, produce NAS.[xv] naat1"

The toxicity of the formaldehyde is high and unstable, especially for the cells. Thus, based on the ways to fix the carbon dioxide by electro-transformation, a one-carbon product with low toxicity and high electro-conversion efficiency should be found, and then we design the pathway of it to assimilate.
New Formaldehyde Assimilation
Background
    In nature, few other species have this function, besides the C3 or C4 cycle of green plants can accumulate aone-carbon compound into multi-carbon compounds like saccharide. The team AACHEN 2015 used the Methanol Condensation Cycle[3]. It transforms methanol into formaldehyde that will be condensed into six-carbon sugar with five-carbon sugar produced in E. coli, and then goes to the subsequent glycogen polymerization.
   How to synthesize five-carbon carbohydrates from formaldehyde?
New Formaldehyde Assimilation
   we have designed a new formaldehyde assimilation pathway, which realized the efficient synthesis of D-xylulose by formaldehyde. This part is “Bearing before and after” part in Blue Leaf as well as the determined factor of whether the entire device can achieve the synthesis of starch by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source.
   We found two enzymes with different condensation functions, BFD and TalB , the former could condense formaldehyde into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and Glycolaldehyde. The latter could condense two intermediate products into five-carbon sugars compounds: D-xylulose. BFD derives from Pseudomonas putida and TalB derives from E. coli.
Figue 2, New Synthesis of D-xylulose by Formaldehyde Assimilation.
   Though this new approach, we have achieved the synthesis of D-xylulose by formaldehyde as the sole carbon source. In the next route, we used Methanol Condensation Cycle. D-xylulose was phosphorylated to 5-phosphate-xylulose and then went into the methanol assimilation pathway. Finally we could synthesize glycogen though Glycogen Metabolism.
   The synthetic pathway we designed was completely untested. So our experiments also focused on the validation of this pathway and the efficient expression and the efficient catalysis of both enzymes.

The costs are based on the following assumptions:
Labor costs are based upon the conventional labor costs for the concerned groups, taking into account the number of fte’s. The salaries of the management are deliberately low in order to increase the growth potential of the company. The whole team agreed with this. Most of the consulting and supporting will be done by employees from the TU Delft. For example, within the TU Delft there are multiple experts in the field of solar panels that could help us to develop the prototype.
The costs for the business establishment are based on information provided by Delft Enterprises.
Costs for intellectual property are based on information provided by the Valorisation Centre. They can eventually also help us with the patenting process.
The costs for regulatory approval are an educated guess and are based on among other things the expected required time of external parties, traveling costs, etc.
The expenses for the consumables and chemicals are based on the real expenses during the iGEM project.
The rent concerns costs for a laboratory and production facilities of the TU Delft. The TU Delft can provide those facilities as in kind contribution in return for a larger share in the company.
Distribution costs are estimated based on maximal expected distribution distances.
Marketing/Sales costs are based on the opinion and expectations of an expert in this field.
The interest costs are based on the expected loan.
The overhead and unforeseen costs are equal to 10% of the total costs. This is common practice. Among these costs are administrative costs, telephone costs, but it is also a buffer for costs that in reality are larger than estimated.
Based on Table 4 it appears that the expected required budget for the first 4 years of the startup is equal to about €1.200.000. In the first phase we want to apply on grants"

so by taking
$$t_{1/2}=\frac{ln(2)}{d_{GFP}}$$
from experimental curves, we are able to retrieve
$$d_{GFP} = 4.9 . 10^{-3} min^{-1}$$. For very low initial concentrations of initial AHL and considering degradation, we have
$$ \frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}][AHLi]^2e^{-2d_{AHL}t}}{K_{d4}K_{d3}}-d_{GFP}[GFP].$$
We find
$$ [GFP]=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}][AHLi]^2}{K_{d4}K_{d3}(d_{GFP}-2d_{AHL})}(e^{-2d_{AHL}t}-e^{-d_{GFP}t}).$$
This curve has a maximum at
$$ t_{max}=\frac{1}{d_{GFP}-2d_{AHL}}ln\big(\frac{d_{GFP}}{2d_{AHL}}\big).$$
This way we can find from experimental curves $$d_{AHL}=4,0.10^{-3} min^{-1}$$
This AHL degradation rate is alumped parameter between internal and external degradation rates, equivalent to
$$d_{AHLext}+\alpha d_{AHLint}$$
where α is the fraction of the volume occupied by cells in the whole culture. From that on we could find reasonable values for internal and external AHL degradation rates.
Finally the curves simulated by our model with these parameters fit the experiments quite well:

KUAS_Korea,2018,Team:KUAS Korea#HumanPractices#PublicEngagement_-_-_TEXT.html," suggested the outlook of synthetic biology in a developmental and ethical aspects. The way to develop synthetic biology can be told it is on an extension of its history so far. The direction of synthetic biology is on the two points; decentralization and convergence. Decentralization is shown through the effort to distribute the authorities of bioscientists. The increases of RSBP(Registry of Standard Biobrick Part), SBOL(Synthetic Biology Open Language) and DIYbio are all the present-progressing consequences. Meanwhile, setting up of many synbio communities (such as GENSPACE, bioCURIOUS and LA PAILLASSE) let all the synthetic biological studies collected, integrated and arranged easily. The development of this field is important because biology has a lot of possibility to be combined with other field such as space science. However, it is inevitable that current aggregates of the researches also have some shortages. The basic problem is attributed to the properties of synthetic biology that it uses very sophisticate stuffs and methods for study. This property causes an incompleteness and uncertainty of all registries. These prospects and challenges are the tasks facing us.
Throughout sessions, participants got an opportunity to encounter a new sector of biology and broaden the knowledge of synthetic biology. Progressing the seminar, they were inspired to this area and showed an interest in iGEM competition and our academy. There were even students from other majors that are not related to biology. Feedback was generally good in that the field was new for them, thus interesting and discussed subjects were somehow related to their lives

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

Team Description
We are a very ambitious group of 10 students from five different disciplines: medicine, biomedicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, mathematics and chemical engineering. Because  we didn’t know each other before the team was formed, we expect to evolve as a group and learn to  use our differences -both professionally and personally- to achieve a synergic teamwork. We have  big expectations for the team, the competition and ourselves. We are prepared to use our holidays  (and the only sunny months in Denmark) to work hard on a meaningful project that will, hopefully,  be of use for someone. We want to do this in order to get more practical experience and have a good  time with other engaged students. Some of us have never been in the lab before, and other feel that  the scheduled lab-exercises in our studies are just too predictable. At this point, we wish to design a project that will span the subjects of synthetic biology, characterization, mathematical modelling and simulation of a biological system as well as a broader outreach to general public.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," around the CRISPR-Cas9 protein as an example. This protein makes the editing of the genome quicker and cheaper than ever, thus opening new perspectives for genetic manipulations applied to animals, and ultimately humans. This technical breakthrough has had the side effect of shining the spotlight  on  the very fundamental issue of what is acceptable or not when it comes to manipulating our genes at will as well as the risks involved in trying to do it. When using the CRISPR technology, one of the important technical difficulties is the presence “off-target effects” that can lead the protein to cut in an unwanted spot in the genome. The imprecision of the technology could have dramatic consequences if used in a medical environment. However, we can hypothesize that an overly alarmist media coverage of these “off target effects” could lead the general opinion to be definitely opposed to any further research concerning CRISPR-Cas9, especially future therapeutic applications. From this assumption, a solution would be to not even be discussing those “off target effects” until they are resolved by the researchers. “Managing transparency is a work the scientist could do and would be a lot more productive than not saying things, or exposing extreme points of view in order to tame the public’s concerns” claims Prof. Gaia Barazzetti, ethicist specialized in bioethics. “I believe  that publicly speaking about risks - if scientists ever agree on a way to do it - could be a good opportunity to build trust with the general public”, she continues, stressing that a constant race for spectacular innovation is not the only way forward in science. Time should be taken to talk about risks and how to reduce them, she adds. Conversely, according to Prof. Duboule, public exposure of the current technical issues encountered by a technology such as Cas9 tends to move the debate away from the really important questions. “For me, those [off target effects] are secondary problems that will be solved in the coming decades. The real question is: how will we apply this technology?”
The desire for a constant and transparent flow of information is certainly praiseworthy, but how exactly could it be achieved? Traditional media such as newspapers, radio and television can participate in this process, but they tend to focus on science only in the case of significant scientific breakthroughs or important scientific fraud and polemics, as they need to stay entertaining and relevant for their respective audience. “There is unfortunately no room  in mainstream media to talk about science and the actual process of research: how research works, where the money comes from, how papers are reviewed and published”, regrets Aur"

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#Cell Free Model_-_-_TEXT.html," sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to determine the most suitable parameters to change to have the best impact on the hirudin production rate.
[Fig 6]
The vertical axis represents the different model parameters and the horizontal axis represents the relevant outputs of the model. The first five columns are the end-point (t = 3600s) concentrations of the respective species. The last three columns are metrics representing the dynamics of hirudin production. Initial hirudin Rate is taken to be the average rate over the first 10 seconds, which is useful in knowing the response delay. hirudin Rise Time is the time it takes to reach 90% of steady state (in this case, the end-point), which is a common way of measuring a system’s dynamic. The last is the just the maximum derivative of hirudin concentration.
The sensitivity of each parameter to each output is normalized to represent the ratio of the relative change in output to the relative change in the parameter. We see that changing the reaction kinetics of cruzipain will have a large effect on the final concentration of TetR, which is as expected. To find the best parameters to increase hirudin production rate, we see it is sensitive to the parameters k_TX, k_TL, ka_RNAP_DNA and K_Rib. Hence, changing the promoter strength or ribosome binding site (RBS) strength could increase the production rate.
However, a better method is to add amplification to our system.
2. Assumptions
Due to the slow rate of directly expressing hirudin. We decided to include an amplification step into our system. This is achieved by producing TEV instead, which will then cleave a sterically inactivated form of hirudin to release hirudin.
This is modelled by adding the following reactions and replacing the translation product with TEV.
\(K_{b}\)
[Insert HTML]
[Fig 7]
The graph shows that using an amplification step will greatly increase the speed of the release of hirudin. The threshold time is reduced to 11 minutes from 31 minutes. Even though the production of TEV is slower as TEV has a longer sequence, it was still able to accelerate the release of hirudin.
As 11 minutes is very close to the common blood coagulation initiation time of 5-10 minutes, it is hard to tell if the blood will clot or not. Hence, we ran the blood coagulation model with this model’s output.

The importance of education was apparent throughout the summer. We as a team learned a tremendous amount from molecular biology techniques to designing animations. Our outreach activities proved to be the most rewarding, having interacted with school children from the ages of 11 to 17, we learned about the impact that education has from a teacher’s perspective. Whether it was witnessing a student’s reactions to painting fluorescent bacteria or learning about their ideas on GMOs, we quickly started to appreciate the effect that education can have. In this regard, we wanted to do more, we wanted to foster interest in synthetic biology in people who might otherwise never learn about it. Not only did we aim to foster scientific curiosity, we hoped that by improving the scientific education in the largest university in Honduras that it could have a positive impact on local communities and down the line mitigate the risk of disease transmission for leishmaniasis and other diseases prevalent in Honduras.
Another potential cause for the spread of the disease is due to the lifestyle of the people in the choluteca region. The region has experienced a prolonged drought in the last two years which has limited water supply and exacerbated plagues. Subsistence farmers in particular have been affected as they lack irrigation systems and have traditionally relied on rainwater. The drought has caused the loss of up to 90% of crops (Maize and beans) which has led to chronic malnutrition in 25% of children between the ages of 6 months and 30 months. Our team had very little experience in this area but decided to investigate it further. We looked at the potential of using genetically modified crops in honduras since there are very few regulations in relation to the GMOs there. Our investigations also led us to Golden Rice, we decided to use this as a tool to educate students on the benefits of producing genetically modified crops. Drought resistant crops could be extremely useful in this"

Eric Holmes
In the 1980’s , as the Cold War raged, American strategists struggled to devise a means of countering the threat of Soviet submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM’s). Efforts to train sperm whales to seek and destroy the Russian subs had failed, so the Central Intelligence Agency sought to develop a marine organism of its own. To this end, Eric Holmes was created. Capable of extended sorties of up to three months, Eric proved to be highly effective at the hunter-killer role. His relatively slight frame allowed him to stalk Soviet submarines without being detected by their sonar systems. If the order came, he would use his powers of telekinesis to send his enemies to the bottom of the sea, thereby ending the communist threat in the Pacific. The Cold War has since ended, and Eric has assumed the cover of a high-achieving Cornell student. The only subtle hint of his storied past that he retains is his undying love of the sea and his piscine friends that call it home.

5. If there is a tool that can solve these problems, what functions do you expect it to have?
1. Signal amplification
2. Fast-response
3. Noise reduction
4. Stable-state enhancement
5. Threshold adjustability
6. Others(please specify)
Most respondents (taking up 58.33%) thought that threshold adjustability is the most desirable features of such a tool. Fast-response, Noise reduction and Stable-state enhancement take up 50% , ranking No.2 among all choices.
Therefore, we concluded that what people exactly need was a tool to make their circuit more robust and stable in response to input signal fluctuations. Being bothered by unsuitable promoter, what they also desire is the capability of toolkit to not only control gene expression to adapt to various inputs but also adjust threshold intensity of input to satisfy their requirements on different purposes. And according to our design, this is just what we want to do for all iGEMers. We have already create two versions of gene expression toolkit and we are heading to the next！"

1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher, public or environmental safety?
Biosafety Level
We are only working with E. Coli (NEB DH10B), which is classified as a biosafety level 1 organism. We are not using any toxin-producing plasmids. We are developing pseudorandom novel sequence, but the sequence is checked to ensure it does not code for any protein (translation start codons are removed).
All of our wetlab team members have received lab safety training. This was a two-hour training session covering safe handling and disposal of lab equipment and reagents. All of our bacteria are non-pathogenic and we are not using any highly toxic or carcinogenic substances, so even if something does go wrong, there is little risk to team members.
In terms of public and environmental hazard, risk is minimal. Our cells are lab strains, unlikely to survive in the wild. We do use antibiotic resistance for selection, so there is always a risk of transfer, but such risk is empirically quite small, since such selection has been performed for years without significant problems. Our project focuses on computational parts, so there is little risk of abuse. Even if everything goes wrong and the bacteria escape the lab, they will quickly die off and are unlikely to cause any disease or environmental imbalance.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of the parts we are working on raise safety issues. They are only promoters and RNA-based repressors; we are not submitting any protein-coding sequence. None of our constructs significantly affect pathogenicity or evolutionary advantage of the bacteria.

Achievements
We were able to design a fully functional cre reporter cassette and transformed a functional Cre recombinase, which we could show by Luciferase assays. We could show that Dronpa is photoswitchable and built a device which could theoretically photoactivate Dronpa, if using higher light intensities. We could show this using fluorescence microscopy.
We constructed a caged Cre recombinase, which is inactivated by dimerizing Dronpa proteins, attached at N- and C-terminus by linkers with varying length.
We improved the already in the registry existing pRS315 ( BBa_K106006 ) part by removing all RFC10 restriction sites in the plasmid backbone and replacing the MCS. Furthermore, we modified the pRS313 and pRS316 plasmid in the same way
We improved the characterization of the Split-Intein( K1483003 )-NAGA ( BBa_K1483000 ) construct by expressing the construct and showing that the Split-Intein is working.
We improved the characterization of the pSUC promotor ( BBa_K950003 ) part by using different sugars and concentrations
We improved the characterization of the pFET3 promoter ( BBa_K950000 ) and the mPRs ( BBa_K950006 and BBa_K950007 ) by co-transfecting yeast cells with these constructs and observe the effect of the mPRs on the pFET3 promoter
We shipped a total of 27 parts to the registry (part numbers BBa_K1680000 to BBa_K1680027 )

UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#es#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," en presencia de microorganismos contaminantes, “las células asesinas” inducirán a las “células trabajadoras” adyacentes a diferenciarse  en mas “células asesinas”, potenciando así su labor. Después de la eliminación de los contaminantes por las células asesinas, la proporción de células trabajadoras y asesinas regresará a su monto inicial.
Basados en nuestro modelo, dividimos el proyecto en tres sub-partes.
Mecanismo de reconocimiento
Mecanismo de diferenciación
Mecanismo ""killer""
1) Recognition mechanism
Our idea is based on the premise that the engineered E. coli most be able to recognize contaminants in the culture medium as non-self. As most bacterial species produces AI2 (auto inducer 2) as a secondary metabolite, we decided to use this compound as a recognition factor. Our E. coli will be an AI2- strain and won´t produce native AI2. The presence of AI2 in the culture medium indicates the presence of contaminants, which will be recognized by an AI2 sensitive promoter present in our E. coli.
In the absence of contaminants, the amount of worker cells will be much higher than the number of killer ones, so the industrial process will occur at maximum efficiency.
Contaminants in the culture medium are recognized by the presence of AI2.
2)  Differentiation mechanism
The initial differentiation mechanism is based on a random slippage mechanism that will determine the expression of a CRE recombinase in a small percentage of cells. This device is an adaptation from the device presented by the Caltech 2008 iGEM team. When expressed, the CRE recombinase will remove a device from the genome – containing a gene involved in the cell cycle and a gene that represses conjugation – and thus lead to the differentiation into killer cells. Killer cells are unable to reproduce, but able to conjugate. This device is an adaptation of the device presented by the Paris 2007 iGEM team.  Moreover, the presence of AI2 in the culture medium will also trigger the expression of CRE recombinase and thus induce the differentiation of more worker cells into the killer cells, so the proportion of killer cells will be elevated during the decontamination process. After a certain number of generations, the proportion of killer and worker cells will return to its original state, due to the killer cells being unable to reproduce.
3) Killing mechanism

When we performed Gibson Assembly reactions, 200ng of DNA (backbone and insert with a ratio of 1:2) were mixed in a 15uL total reaction, using NEB’s 2X Hifi DNA Assembly MasterMix. The mixure was incubated 1h at 37ºC.
Induced protein expression by the use of expression systems
We used E. coli BL21(DE3) as our expression strain. Cells transformed with our constructs were incubated at appropriate temperature until they reached an OD(600nm) of 0.4-0.6. They were then induced with 0.5mM IPTG for 5 hours.
Preparation of cell extract for protein activity testing
We performed our cell extract preparation using ThermoScientific’s B-PER Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent with Enzymes.
His-tag purification of proteins
We performed the purification of our proteins using ThermoScientific’s His-Pur Ni-NTA Resin and all buffers as indicated by the manufacturer.
SDS-PAGE analysis
We analysed our proteins using pre-made, 10% SDS-PAGE gels from BioRad. As a ladder we used Kaledoskope from BioRad.
Assaying the binding strength of the Fabric Binding Domains.
We assayed the strength or the Fabric Binding Domains using the assay developed by our team, carrying cotton, wool, silk and linen untreated, unbleached fabrics. Cell extracts of BL21(DE3) strains carrying GFP-FBD fusion proteins were performed and 1/10 dilutions were made. The diluted cell extracts were incubated in the 96-well-plates-based assay with the fabrics overnight. Several washes of the fabrics were performed using water, PBS, BSA 5%, Ethanol 70% and Catechol 0.03M. The several measurements were performed in a Infinite M200-Pro Tecan plate reader.
Assaying the enhanced stain removal activity of fusion proteins
We assayed the stain removal activity of our fusion proteins in our assay, with the different fabrics stained with wine. The different measurements wera carried out in the Infinite M200-Pro Tecan plate reader.
BpuI activity was measured in Citrate Phosphate Buffer at pH"

The result shows that the colour has changed besides plasmid with lipase (Figure 11), showing that LipB2 gene is correctly expressed in BL21 E. coli.
         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55"

Thermostability Expectations
Given the large decrease in predicted ΔG of folding from 8.44 kcal/mol to -36.83 kcal/mol, we expect the thermoengineered monomer to be more resistant to denaturation at higher temperatures. While we cannot predict the exact melting temperature of the protein, the increase in hydrophobic residues and removal of unstable noncovalent interactions should improve the stability of the molecule. The griffithsin homodimer's ΔG of folding was predicted to be decreased from 21.1 kcal/mol to -17.93 kcal/mol. Shown below are the two thermoengineered proteins colored by their B factor. When compared to the B factor models of the non-thermostable Griffithsin proteins on the ""Trials"" page, one realizes that the variants on this page have less unstable/red residues and have greater stabilizing interactions.
Thermostable GRFT constructs pictured above have amino acid residues with much lower B values than the normal protein shown previously, suggesting less amino acids are subject to thermal motion and have greater stability
Docking Expectations
Since the binding loops were preserved in the mutation of thermostable griffithsin, binding to gp120 was not altered between the variants and the thermostable proteins ligated gp120 at the same binding sites as non-thermostable griffithsin. The docking models of HIV and Zika antibodies with the thermostable monomer ligated to gp120 showed that the thermostable protein would be a good candidate for the lateral flow assay tests and forms stable interactions between the antibodies at predictable binding sites.
In the future, we hope to use these results to construct a cheap and reliable lateral flow assay which uses this thermoengineered GRFT to immobilize the gp120 protein found on the HIV viral envelope. In addition, we have proven in"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
