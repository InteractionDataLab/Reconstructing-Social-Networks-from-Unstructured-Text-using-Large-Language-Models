NU_Kazakhstan,2014,Team:NU Kazakhstan_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant DNA into a competent bacterium. However, E. coli itself has a low tendency to uptake DNA from the environment. The competence needs to be induced by either electroporation or treatment with divalent cations. Electroporation can make the bacteria competent only for a very brief period, while chemical treatment takes at least two days and then requires storage of bacteria at -800C, otherwise, they will lose the competence. Therefore, our team decided to find a way of introducing inducible competence into E. coli.
Gp16 protein is phi29 ATPase, which is a part of viral DNA packaging motor. Hydrophobic protein gp16 was previously introduced into a lipid bilayer in vitro. We are planning to introduce signal leading peptides from the iGEM distribution kit upstream of p16 gene in order to incorporate gp16 protein into bacterial inner and outer membranes. In addition, p16 will be expressed IPTG-inducible promoter, so that the bacteria will become competent only when needed.  Furthermore, chaperonin GroEL/ES will be co-expressed in order to ensure correct folding of gp16 protein.
Overall, the proposed method aims to reduce time and cost in the preparation of competent cells.

Freiburg,2011,Team:Freiburg#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," towards the Nickel. Histidines can coordinate ligands with their free electron pair pointing planar away from the imidazole ring. What we further realized from the structure file was, that the ends of the LRR segments were “open”, meaning the hydrophobic core of the protein was exposed and as it is visible in the prediction, curled in on one end into a sort of helix. This means the protein folding is not reliable and the structure needs some sor of cap on either end in order to stabilize the LRR core motif.
superimposition of a Nickel ion into our first I-TASSER structure.
Dotted lines show the distances between the atoms, angles were
analysed to see whether binding is likely to happen or not.
Histidine residues were analysed for flexibility in the backbone
and their potential to orient towards optimal binding.
A solution to this was shown by Schmidt et. al. 2010, who crystallized the TLR-4 receptor.  In this very useful work he dissected the TLR4(PDB: 3FXI) into 3 parts, since it was too large and unhandy to be crystallized at once..
stabilizing the structure
Kim, Ho Min 2007: TLR-4 receptor in 3 pieces for crystallisation. Each piece was capped by Hagfish domains. Afterwards all three pieces were assembled by superimposition.
To overcome this problem of an exposed hydrophobic core, he used the N- and C-terminal protein fragments of a LRR protein derived from hagfish. They tried a variety of different versions of how to glue together his fragments and these N- and C-terminal caps until they found a working one.
We used this knowledge for our purpose, applied the same sequences and attached them to our protein sequence. These caps do still in parts show the typical LRR consensus sequences (which luckily is highly conserved in all kingdoms of life!), which made it possible to fit them onto our stack of LRR loops in the right position.
To the outer end the protein has a helix on the N-terminal side, shielding off the core and the C-terminus while the LRR disappears slowly turn by turn with more and more hydrophilic amino acids replacing the LRR consensus sequence.
optimzing the sequence
After combining these caps with our structural analysis for possible Nickel binding sites and filling the empty positions of the consensus sequence with the ideal sequence derived from the ligase sequence (see above), we were still unsure whether this would work out. To increase our chances of success we designed six different versions with distinct"
Evry_Paris-Saclay,2018,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," subunit of B. subtilis RNA polymerase can readily interact with both ligand bound and apo phAimR. However, an extra interaction is observed for the apo phAimR with the B. subtilis rpoA that is not present for the ligand-bound version. This extra interaction might be necessary for stably fixing RNA polymerase to its cognate promoter. Next, we wanted to see how phAimR binds to the α subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase. Hence, rpoA of E. coli was docked with phAimR. The docking results are found in Figure 9.
Figure 9: Interactions between E. coli rpoA and phAimR (Top) Interaction with apophAimR (Bottom) Interaction with ligand bound phAimR.
These results show that AimR can interact with E. coli rpoA in its ligand bound and apo form but only with the CTD tail. Neither structure gives the extra interaction with rpoA observed for apo phAimR. Hence, we concluded that the ability of AimR to interact with RNA polymerase and stimulate gene expression in E. coli might be impaired.
In summary, we have docked phAimR with both B. subtilis and E. coli rpoA to see if AimR interacts with rpoA as part of its regulatory mechanism and to see if this interaction is maintained in E. coli. We have observed that an interaction between apo-phAimR and rpoA of B. subtilis is not found in the ligand bound case or in interaction with rpoA of E. coli. We concluded that AimR activation may not be maintained when using AimR in E. coli and recommended the experimental team to redesign their genetic construct as a repressor so this loss of interaction would not give any problems. Sadly, our attempt to computationally estimate phAimR-DNA interactions yielded inconclusive results that prevented us from supporting this choice further.
Predicted AimR toxicity: spurious binding sites in the E. coli genome
An important issue when trying to express a heterologous gene inside a new host is the risk of toxicity caused by overexpression of the protein. We did not find a computational service that would help us predict the risk of toxicity when overexpressing AimR in E. coli, but we did find a publication that determined the factors that are predictive of overexpression toxicity [16]. The authors found that transcription factors tend to be toxic when overexpressed and suggested that their"

Bacteriocins - They work!
We designed BioBricks, which contain the genes encoding a single or a hybrid bacteriocin. We purified the bacteriocins using the IMPACT method and determined the respective concentrations using a Bradford Standard Protein Assay with Bovine Serum Albumin. In order to purify the bacteriocins we correctly incorporate the bacteriocin into the IMPACT vector pTXB1.
Purified bacteriocins inhibit the growth of MRSA and P. aeruginosa
Our MIC-tests showed growth inhibition of the strains MRSA:USA300, MRSA:CC398, hetero-VISA and P. aeruginosa:PAO1. The bacteriocins LacticinQ and the hybrid Laterosporulin-ThuricinS did not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa. However, the absence of inhibition could be due too low concentration used in the MIC test.
Synergistic effect of bacteriocins

Figure 1: visualizes MIC values for each bacteriocin towards each tested strain. The respective strains are listed on the x-axis and the MIC values are plotted logarithmic(2) on the y-axis. The lowest bar indicates the bacteriocin eliciting the strongest effect.
Figure 1: visualizes MIC values for each bacteriocin towards each tested strain. The respective strains are listed on the x-axis and the MIC values are plotted logarithmic(2) on the y-axis. The lowest bar indicates the bacteriocin eliciting the strongest effect.
Our results showed that the bacteriocins have a similar or better effect compared to traditional antibiotics. The bacteriocins therefore show promising results to support the idea of bacteriocins being a supplement for traditional antibiotics.
The bacteriocins did not only inhibit the growth of the tested strains but also showed synergestic effect . This is indicated by the decrease in MIC when Laterosporulin and ThuricinS are combined as a hybrid compared to each respective MIC value. The hybrid LacticinQ-LacticinZ also showed a decreased MIC compared to the value of LacticinQ. The absence of"

If the costs of recurrence, as estimated by Cancer Research UK were taken into account - £16000 for stage 1 and £17000 as the average cost of other stages [19] - the cost per QALY would still only be £8300, and at 39% sensitivity would be £19900 per QALY.
Our modeling therefore proves that our sensor would be cost effective in reducing mortality rates from NSCLC. The same principle on which this model is based could be applied to any cancer to screen those with sufficiently high risk using miRNA biomarkers.

Duke,2013,Team:Duke#Modeling#Thermodynamic Model Application_-_-_TEXT.html," that there were two types of Fregs: one for strong binding and one for weak binding. The effect of different combinations of weak and strong binding was demonstrated by plotting the fold change in Pbound for 5 Binding sites for the following cases:
5 Strong Binding, 0 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong)5
4 Strong Binding, 1 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong)4 * (Freg, weak)
3 Strong Binding, 2 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong)3 * (Freg, weak)2
2 Strong Binding, 3 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong)2 * (Freg, weak)3
1 Strong Binding, 4 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong) * (Freg, weak)4
0 Strong Binding, 5 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, weak)5
The result of having different combinations of strong and weak binding for a promoter with 5 binding site is plotted below. Plots on the left have more strong binding sites (Black = 5 Strong, 0 Weak), and plots on the right have more weak binding sites (Pink = 0 Strong, 5 Weak).
Figure 3.3.4. Graph of Fold Change in Pbound vs. Combination of Weak (10nM) and Strong (0.1nM) Binding
Again, when a Hill function was fitted onto these data points using ""cftool"" command on MATLAB, the apparent Hill coefficient were determined and labeled next to each plot. As shown, the apparent Hill coefficient is lowest when the degree of unbalanced binding strengths is greatest, and is higher at both ends where the binding strengths at the five binding sites are equal.
An important conclusion that can be drawn from this result is that balanced repressor binding strengths among the battery of repressor binding sites is crucial for increasing cooperativity. Also, even though the dissociation constant of weak repressors was hundred times higher than that of strong repressors, the difference in apparent Hill coefficients was relatively small.
Now that we have demonstrated the effect of number of binding sites and binding strengths on cooperativity using a thermodynamic model, we now move on to characterizing the effect of several parameters on the stability of a system using a Kinetic Model .

Construction Methods
We have utilised three different construction methods in our project. Please find details of each below.
3A Assembly
This is the standard iGEM assembly technique for ligating BioBricks to one another. We initially found no problems with the technique, but as we moved onto more complicated experiments and ligations, we found that the technique wasn't working especially well for us. We consulted with a variety of PhD students, our supervisors and other scientists in the department, who offered a wealth of advice on the subject.
We tested a variety of variations on the standard procedure on the iGEM website; different concentrations of DNA (it was suggested that we had been using concentrations that were too low to show up well on our gels or give good results for the ligations), different types of enzymes and buffers (we had initially been using FastDigest enzymes, but also worked with standard enzymes from New England BioLabs) and switching from Purite water to RNAase-free water.
We were lucky enough to be given several sets of new FastDigest enzymes, DNA ladders, protein purification and mini-prep kits from Thermo Scientific, which seemed to break our cycle and we suddenly started seeing successful gels and ligations. We did have limited success with the 3A Assembly technique, and would probably have had excellent results if we weren't under the time constraints of the summer.
Gibson Assembly (gBlock synthesised by IDT)
Working with IDT was an excellent decision for us; the gBlocks were simple to order, easy to assemble and worked well for us. We did invest a significant amount of time into check the sequences we were sending off, and correcting any problems with the sequences (hairpin bends, excessive or insufficient levels of G and C nucleotides, repeat sequences, etc), but this allowed us to feel confident in the sequences and encouraged us to look very closely at the best way to build our constructs.

Due to the time constraints posed by the iGEM project, and the size of our construct to be synthesised by DNA 2.0 being over 3kb we have not had any experience with the success of this assembly method"

We made some plating at different time: time0, time2, time4.
The idea was to explain the absence of bacteria in our experiments. Indeed, when we were making theses experiments, we always had at the end fungi at the end.
But we should have also some bacteria because bibliography shows that some bacteria are able to degrade Quercetin. By plating at different time we hope to see the difference of diversity of microbes in the plate.
Unfortunately, we were not able to observe some bacteria on Quercetin agar plate. In fact, Quercetin is green and it’s hide the bacteria that are growing on the plate.
During two days we didn’t see any growth of microbes and at day 3, fungi appears.
We have to keep in mind also that fungi, thanks to micellium are able to search for nutrients in the plate while bacteria are not. There is a sort of competition between bacteria and fungi for the use of Quercetin.
Above: two fungi isolated on M9 Quercetin agar plate. We can easily see a clear halo that mean the Quercetin was removed from the plate by the fungi.

Possible Alternatives
As a result of a meeting with one of our key stakeholders from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) we were introduced to the use of a 'Vortex Bio-reactor'     in conjunction with an anti-microbial agent as an alternative form of bio-security. The anti-microbial agent used by the PML were copper alginate beads. The investigation they had     conducted was to compare between the use of UV and copper alginate beads within a Vortex Bio-reactor as an effective pathogen destruction technology. It was     found that the use of copper alginate beads was superior to UV and significantly so when applied to organisms resistant to UV-C.    This is seen in graph below where the UV resistant organisms, D. radiodurans, shows a significant decrease in survival rate between the two techniques.
Figure 5: This graph demonstrates the survival under irradiation of UV-C 10 mJ/cm2 E. faecalis (○), E. coli ATCC 1775 (□) and D. radiodurans (Δ) with increasing concentrations of cellulose, (Simon F. Thomas et al, 2014).
However concern has been expressed over the use of copper as a bactericide as the copper must adhere to the cell surface in order to kill the cell. This of course could prove problematic in that our project, which aims to bind metals ions to the protein on the ends of pili, would reduce accessibility to cell surface. In addition to this the authors of the paper have mentioned that more research surrounding the longevity and robustness of the beads is needed to quantify the risk of the beads breakdown and releasing copper back into the water.
Another possible alternative to UV that we are considering is the use ozone. However we choose not to explore this method due to concerns over it contaminating/reacting when used in high concentrations.

ETH_Zurich,2016,Team:ETH Zurich#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"0 19 . Generally, the use of engineered probiotic bacteria as a delivery vector for in vivo produced therapeutic agents has been described multiple times.
As the gastrointestinal tract is a rough environment for non-adapted (probiotic) bacteria, we envision our bacteria to be encapsulated in a hydrogel-coated pill. This would protect the bacteria and ensure the recovery of the reporter strain. The method of encapsulation is well known for oral administration in animal models (e.g. Prakash et al. 20 ) and is summarised in several reviews.
READOUT OF RECOVERED REPORTER BACTERIA
Our complex design with its potentially modular setup serves mainly one goal: to measure multiple candidate molecules in parallel through several bacterial reporter strains combined in one pill. Thus, it is curcial to understand how the read-out of our system works, once the reporter strains are recovered from a patient.
The recovered bacterial strains now form a complex mixture and it is not possible to separate them again. But with our system this is not even necessary. The procedure to easily figure out if a specific candidate molecule has been associated with inflammation is the following:
The recovered bacteria-containing capsules are split into different vials. Each vial  thus contains the same composition of bacterial reporter strains.
To each vial a different candidate molecule is added.
In case one of the bacterial strains has encountered this specific molecule it will ""remember"" (as their plasmids / genomes made an irreversible rearrangement due to recombinases, Cpf1 or Cas9).
Cultures which show an a green colour (GFP, positive signal) - additionally to orange (mNectarine, negative control) - have successfully associated intestinal inflammation with the candidate molecule.
mNectarine will always be present, as only one or no strain will react to the candidate molecule.
IMPROVED PARTS
The parts we used for our constructs were partially already described and used by former iGEM teams. We have three major parts that we could improve - either be codon optimization and/or characterization. These are BxB1 recombinase, tp901 and the pNorV promoter. Please see our Demonstrate for further information.

To validate the results in a quantitative way, we selected Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test of Block Design as a model, in which the sum of Wilcoxon Rank Sum statistics Wj (1≤j≤m) of each block was calculated as
With the data of our experiment substituted, the statistics WBD was calculated as
Therefore MTB and control strain (E.coli) are significantly different in signal. That is, our PC Reporter system is able to distinguish the sequence of MTB genome from that of other non-specific strains.
Methods
Clone construction of split luciferase-dCas9 fusion protein
We cloned our split luciferase-dCas9 fusion protein in the pET-21a by Golden Gate assembly (Figure 14a,b).
Figure 14. Plasmids of split luciferase-dCas9 fusion protein in pET-21a. (a) Plasmid of Nluc-dCas9 fusion architecture with T7 promoter, Cluc-dCas9 coding sequence and T7 terminator. (b) Plasmid of Cluc-dCas9 fusion architecture T7 promoter, Nluc-dCas9 coding sequence and T7 terminator.
Selection of test target sequence
Before taking the sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) genome as target of our PC reporter system, we first performed our experiments within a test target gene, which must not only conform to the substrate requirements of dCas9, but also harmless and safe enough to its bacteria carrier after chemical transformation. After screening over iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we finally took Part: BBa_K909009 (cDNA of UV-B sensing protein UVR8 from Arabidopsis thaliana (from iGEM12_ETH_Zurich) as the test target(Figure 15).
Figure 15. Schematic of Part: BBa_K909009.
sgRNA generation
To obtain sgRNA, we used SSPD to screen out all guide sequences from the entire genome and Oligo Genrator to generate oligos for Golden Gate Cloning, then inserted all guide sequences into sgRNA Generator backbone (Figure 16). Through PCR amplification and cell-free transcription using HiScirbe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs), the sgRNA was produced and purified at last.We specially thank ZHAO Xuejin (Research Assistant, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for providing us with the sgRNA Generator!

Isaac is stuying for his probability exam so he wasn't here either. Wish the best of luck for Thursday (yeah, you'll need it).
Wednesday: The day started off with a meeting with Copenhagen team through Skype. Valencia could not come. Basically we discussed what constructs we could exchange. As Copenhagen is having some hard time with the assembly technique and don't have anything ready yet, we scheduled a next meeting for Monday. Also, they kindly offered us help with the modelling part and we think are going to accept their offer. Thanks guys!!
After lunch, Max and Carla had a meeting with Rodrigo Gutiérrez to design the wiki sections. There's a lot to work to be done!!!
Juano (electronics advisor) is trying to get the light sensor working. He could solder wires to the tiny sensor terminals (after a lot of failed attempts!!) and now the piece looks like Frankenstein. We'll be trying Frankestein in the next days. As we had two sensors, the normal one will receive tech support at Olimex on friday.
Wetlabing... well, we managed to purify C4 open and Pcaa promoter from gel (PCR run last Friday... friday xd). And with these parts did a Gibson for C 1.1 and C1.2. We also did a PCR with parts for future assemblies. Day ended plating the transformed E. coli.

2. Second Day
After the first successful day, the meetup continued into a new direction: learning new skills that can be applied to one’s iGEM project. Dr. Franklin Nóbrega and Ms. Dorothy Zhang, from Delft University of Technology and BGI college, respectively, gave a clear and interesting talk about the decoding of iGEM, explaining how to ensure a fruitful outcome of a project. Subsequently, the two of them led a workshop that taught skills and more insight about approaching a potential iGEM project. Like the previous day, half of the teams got the chance to present their project to the others.  With the newly gained knowledge from the presentation and workshop, we dug into a poster session, where all teams engaged with each other and gave feedback on their projects.
“I really enjoyed the How To iGEM workshop. It helped me think critically about my project.”

3. Third Day
On the third meetup day, we focused on increasing awareness towards bioethics. The day started with a presentation given by Ir. Britte Bouchaut, a PhD student from Delft University of Technology, who imposed the importance of the concept Value Sensitive Design in any iGEM project. This was followed by another presentation by Mr. Hui Kang from BGI, who explained how Chinese myths and legends affect people’s attitude towards biological issues. After the presentation, teams were given the chance to discuss two bioethics topics in a workshop and to apply what they learned throughout the day to their projects. Finally, teams that excelled in various parts of the meetup were awarded in our prize ceremony.  iGEM EPFL was awarded with best engagement and poster, while XJTLU China was awarded with the best pitch. The best presentation was awarded to GreatBay China from Group 1, and Marburg from Group 2, who had to convince the judge panel on a sudden death round against TJU China.
“I think bioethics is very very necessary because we are human beings and we live on this earth, and when we do anything we must think of the outcomes.”

However all of the models described above are relatively complicated for handling, and not that easy to manufacture with 3D printers techniques available to us. If possible, we were aiming at designing a prototype that would be easy to produce and easy to handle.
A radically new design was needed - simpler and smaller.
The inspiration came from the very thing that we were trying to get rid of: the screws. Why having external, metal screws if one can design chamber components to be ""big hollow screws?""
Inclusion threads inside the walls of chamber components meant that parts can be simply screwed one into another, eliminating any need of external holders or screws. Admittingly somewhat a challenge for a designer and a test of precision for 3D printer, at least it would be very simple for the end-user.
It is relatively simple to design a 2 components system where only 2 threads are used, however when having thread on both sides of the middle part (coloured blue in Figure 6), one has to pay attention not to ""slice"" with the threads through the walls of the body of the component. To make screwing easier, a hexagon extension was envisioned at the top of two upper parts allowing for use of tools if necessary.
An example of cross section can be seen in the following illustration (Figure 5).
Figure 5: A cross section of design for Bacta_tank3. Components can be seen to fit nicely and a simulation was performed many times to check for any issues prior to printing.
Figure 6: Another view of the Bacta_tank3 design, both assembled and disassembled.
As can be seen on the picture, including threads considerably simplified the use of ""Bacta tank"". The membrane would be placed between the upper and middle part, and protein wouldl be collected in the lowest chamber, while bacteria culture would be cultured in the utmost top. The threads allow for customisation of the volume of collection buffer in collection chamber, while also allowing for careful fixation of the membrane between upper two parts.

pleuratus ostreatus was re-inoculated on the solid agar plates by placement of around 8 mycelia ""balls"" under a fume hood and left at 30 degrees Celsius. As to save time, fewer plates were inoculated and a YBD plate was included.
Today, we had gotten another species, Schizophyllum commune, in two forms: a wildtype as well as a mutant (Δsc3) which were also inoculated on PDB, MEA and YBD plates.
22/6/2018
The first sign of growth in our species was showing and pictures were taken of every plate as to count pixels and indicate the growth rate. Pictures were taken every morning for 5 days.
Week 26 (June 25 - July 1)
SynthLab Overview
26/6/2018
Aspergillus oryzae was received and inoculated on MEA, PDB and YBD plates (5 days of photographs will follow this species's growth in the same manner as the other species).
Today we decided that our species had grown enough and the samples were then removed and stored at a cooler temperature excluding those used for later liquid media.
Liquid PDB (PDA) was prepared for growth in our ""brick""-molds without the addition of agar. 500 mL was created for each species. The PDB concentration chosen was the middle concentration in the table as these showed the strongest growth.  At the end of this process, we should be ready to start with the actual growth of our building material.
Week 27 (July 2 - July 8)
Mycolab Overview
2/7/2018
Boxes: Initialisation of tests to determine best substrates and conditions for formation of a brick made of fungi. Saw dust was autoclaved.
Spore suspension: Spore suspensions are made for easy storage of spores. The spores are used for protoplastation and inoculation of boxes and plates. A. oryzae did not sporulate. It was incubated from June 26th to June 29th. Three days is not enough time for it to sporulate. P. ostreatus and S. commune did not sporulate either.
Reinoculation: Fungi strains were reinoculated onto new plates that all contained the same medium.  Plates were checked for best growing conditions for the different fungi. PDA was in general the most promising medium and this was chosen as the medium used going forward."

The anti-smell team Paris Bettencourt have established a contact with us via Sylvia Yang in the first few week of iGEM, by asking us to joing the weekly newspaper. But after one week (yes... one!) we could not catch it in the midst of other lab things, administrative, and school! So we are very sorry to have dropped the chance to contribute in the weekly synthetic biology newspaper.
After a few months (two?) of dessertation, Aakriti then mailed one of our member to help them review and make a few annotation on their MOOC Project, aimed to help educating the high school students that are considering themself to join iGEM HS. We then make a few annotation and comments, and a little bit review and rebuttle to their arguments written in the article. We really hope to see the next improvements of the articles!

PCR
When we extracted the DNA from the leaves, we used a mortar, water, and some ethanol to gap their cellular wall. After crushing them we used filters from the ""Nucleospin DNA Extraction Kit"" to extract the DNA from the remains. When using this kit, you need two filters, one container for the flow-through, liquids included in the kit and a centrifuge. The kit basically binds the DNA to the filter, washes out everything else through the filter and in the end, you use an elution buffer to elute the DNA from the filter. For the PCR, you have to prepare your sample by adding the nucleotides, the primer, the polymerase, and some water. Afterward, you put the samples into the PCR machine. It goes through many cycles of changing temperatures. In that process, the DNA parts into two strings and the primers bind onto their complementary sequence and ""shows"" the polymerase where it has to start synthesizing on. Next, the polymerase goes along the string and copies the sequences with the opposite nucleotides. By that process, the DNA was multiplied. When the PCR was finished, we performed a gel electrophoresis. The gel electrophoresis consists of an agarose gel, TAE-buffer, an anode and a cathode, and a connection to electricity. Since the DNA has a negative charge, it moves towards the anode. The gel electrophoresis can be evaluated by putting it into a bath of a coloring chemical. The gel is afterward put into a dark chamber and gets lit by UV-Light. Hereby, the gel electrophoresis pictures resolve.
Assays
The cracking of pollen is related with the destruction of pectin and cellulose. Therefore we need enzymes like pectinase and cellulase. At first, it is important to prove the content of cellulose and pectin in specific substances. Therefore we used both natural and pure alcohol. If there were small bubbles in the substances to see, then we successfully proved pectin and cellulose in the samples. This is important for proving the appearance of pollen. After a while, pectinase and cellulase should have destructed the pectin and cellulose. The experiment is successfully performed if there aren't any bubbles in the samples.

We visited the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to get some information from their data base. With them we got to know the sequence of the amino acids in the DNA of the tree leaves"

Abstracts or summary of different teams’ projects that worked with riboregulators
The usage of the riboregulator system can be versatile; Different teams utilized the system in different ways. In general, introducing the riboregulator system to a certain circuit allows another level regulation. The new level of regulation then can give possible outcomes such as: specific interaction/communication (UC Berkeley 2006/ Caltech 2007); minimization of leakage by introducing post-transcriptional repression (Calgary 2007); and modulation of different concentrations of desired outcome (K.U. Leuven 2009).
One drawback of riboregulator system in the context of iGEM is that teams that originally have riboregulator incorporated in their systems drop the use of riboregulator of because of time restraint (Calgary 2007). This is because when riboregulators are used to introduce another level of regulation, it becomes a supplementary part of the project; Usually, even without the extra level of regulation, the teams can prove the functionality of their systems. Therefore when the time is limited, and when the teams prioritize the things they need to do, they end up dropping the riboregulator system.

Abstract: “Networks of interacting cells provide the basis for neural learning. We have developed the process of addressable conjugation for communication within a network of E. coli bacteria. Here, bacteria send messages to one another via conjugation of plasmid DNAs, but the message is only meaningful to cells with a matching address sequence. In this way, the Watson Crick base-pairing of addressing sequences replaces the spatial connectivity present in neural systems. To construct this system, we have adapted natural conjugation systems as the communication device. Information contained in the transferred plasmids is only accessible by ""unlocking"" the message using RNA based 'keys'. The resulting addressable conjugation process is being adapted to construct a network of NAND logic gates in bacterial cultures. Ultimately, this will allow us to develop networks of bacteria capable of trained learning.”

Once they reach the root, they can be actively taken up by the plant as demonstrated in a recent study on bacterial uptake of GFP expressing E. coli into Arabidopsis roots.  This module has the potential to serve as a platform technology to deliver natural compounds specifically to plant roots. The second module, Auxin Xpress , involves heterologous expression of IAA in our chassis, via the indole acetamide (IAM) pathway. IAA is known to promote root growth and therefore if it is supplied inside and around the root of a plant, should promote soil stability and prevent erosion. The third and final module, Gene Guard , was designed as a novel safety measure to minimise the risk associated with release of GMOs into the environment. This involves a toxin/anti-toxin mechanism to prevent horizontal gene transfer of plasmid DNA from our modified bacteria to existing soil bacteria.
Module 1: Phyto-Route
Module 2: Auxin Xpress
Module 3: Gene Guard
The engineering cycle
Each module follows the synthetic biology engineering cycle. Since human practice had a huge influence on our project, we included it at the start of the cycle which was followed during the development of our project.
You can read more about the specifications, design, modelling, assembly, and testing of each module following the clickable icons above.
Figure 2. The engineering cycle (Diagram by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
Human practice
Human practices were an extremely important component of our project and strongly influenced our design . During very early design stages of the project, we consulted social scientists and NGOs (Greenpeace and the Berkeley Reafforestation Trust) about the viability of our project. In addition, we talked to plant scientists and ecologists to learn more about the specifics and wider impacts of our project. We held two human practices panels that greatly influenced our view of the issues surrounding synthetic biology in general and our project in particular.
We chose our chassis based on concerns surrounding spread of our engineered bacteria into non-targeted environments. In addition, we designed Gene Guard , a novel containment device that prevents the spread of genetic information via horizontal gene transfer. While our project is only at proof-of-concept stage, we wanted to ensure that our approach was as viable as possible. Accordingly, we have created an implementation plan that is based on plans utilised in the agricultural industry for the research and development of new chemicals but also incorporates advice we received from an ecologist and charity members. Finally, we have investigated the"

For PotD, it is clear from the gel that it is being successfully overexpressed since there is an intense band present at the 37kDa marker which corresponds to the expected size of PotD in the induced culture sample. For SBP, there is no band present which suggests SBP is being overexpressed.

Now we have focused on analyzing how some parameters affect the output of the system. Firstly, we duplicate the strength of the promoter 2.

If the system is evolved with no inputs, we can see that LacI still wins the battle against c1ts.
Turning off the bistable
It is logical to think that if the c1ts promoter is stronger the state 0 will be more stable. However, there are still oscillations that lead to a LacI victory. In any case, is interesting to remark that in this experiment a sharp increment of c1ts is produced at the end, that suggests that the competition is not so unbalanced.

What if we add now IPTG? The results suggest that if we increase the number of operating sequences for both promoters, the stability zone of c1ts is bigger. However, we can still see unexpected peaks of LacI expression and, after some hours, LacI win again the battle for the control of the system.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

The whole team decided to start on human practice ideas and beginning to brainstorm ideas. Some of these discussiontopics included: Introduction of the open forum idea at Carroll High School, for which Travis was put on task for the day on making a flyer to hand out at the Carroll High School schedule pickup day;  grade school presentation, which Jonah was tasked with; music video, for which Chris and Peter began deciding on a song and writing the lyrics; and Attributions for RX, which was delegated to Max. They also put on their calendars of every due date in the future and when to have completed items to be sent in for base clearance   Each of the students began work on their designated tasks.  Afterwards, the RX students met their colleagues from their lab for a lab outing and bonding. After the lab bonding, the team went to base to met and talk with Chia about their cancelled IDT orders.   With the assistance of Chia, the team fixed their sequences and split the cinnamaldehyde order into 3 parts instead of two. They also discussed the plan for the next couple of days in lab involving the Interlab.

Another big component of the project would be to test the motility of the cell. By testing cells with the CheZ knockout strain and ones without, the students can observe the motility of CheZ. The cells with the CheZ knocked out doesn’t move and grows a single colony, while the ones with the CheZ should be able to expand and grow many colonies all around the epicenter.

The RX students began their day in lab where they split into the two research groups.   After collecting the digested Chitinase Plasmid DNA from Monday, Peter, Chris, and Travis created a 6 well agarose gel to run the digested DNA on.  After running the gel, the students then performed a Gel Purification which isolated the desired Ice nucleation protein from the tyrosine They then Nano-Dropped 2 purified DNA samples that they had collected Max and Jonah completed the staining process of the biofilms treated with different concentrations of cinnamaldehyde.  They also began the process of treating the 96 well plate with Isopropanol in order to cleanse it for the experimentation  After completing the lab work, the team headed to UES where they each continued work on their delegated tasks from the previous day.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Techniques_-_-_TEXT.html," does not mean that vertex 2 is necessarily also connected to vertex 1.
Also, edges may have a certain weight, which results in a weighted graph. If all the edges have a weight of unity, the graph is unweighted.
A graph is called a simple graph when it has no loops, that means edges that start and end at the same vertex, and no more than one edge between any two vertices. Also, it has to be undirected and unweighted [6]. A graph is called connected when there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex in the graph. When this is not possible, the graph is called disconnected [7].
For instance, if we create a graph where vertices are cities and edges are the roads between those cities, we have a undirected graph. Also, as no roads go from a city to that same city, the graph is a simple graph and if we assume that it is possible to reach any city from any other city, the graph is connected. Now, as the edges represent the roads between the cities, we could give them weights, where the weights represent the length of the roads. In that case, we have a weighted graph. However, in that case the graph is no longer a simple graph, as simple graphs have to be unweighted.
As the example above shows, it is quite easy to make a graph representation from a real world phenomenon. This is done quite often in physics and engineering problems, as graph theory is a very elaborated framework in mathematics and a lot of theories and algorithms are available to solve problems for graphs.
So, a good method is to translate your physics or engineering problem to a graph representation and find an algorithm or theory that solves your problem for that graph. Then, implement that algorithm or construct an algorithm based on the theory, and solve your problem for the graph you created. Subsequently, translate your result back to your physics or engineering problem to obtain the solution to your problem. This is exactly what we did for the curli module.
An example of a graph is displayed in figure 3. This graph is undirected, unweighted, simple and connected.
Figure 3: A representation of a graph that is undirected, unweighted, simple and connected. [12]
A graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix A. Vertex i is adjacent to vertex j if there is an edge between them. The adjacency matrix of a graph with n vertices is an n by n matrix, where the coefficient \(a_{i,j}\) of the matrix is equal to 1 when vertex i is adjacent to vertex j and equal to"

The development of free data base, like NCBI, allows people to make comparison between sequences or genomes, and then some predictive biology. This brings us back to the development of IT. Internet and Banks help biologists to communicate and to have information quickly. But then, this spreading of information allows anyone to get it. In lots of fields, to slow down the Internet machine is out of control. Everything can become free to download and you can find whatever you want. And the following step is the use of the Synbio to synthesize the wanted organisms… All the consequences depend on the persons. Students like us, try to make predictive biology to synthesize a multi-functional enzyme, to improve the health of some patients. Bioterrorists can synthesize the virus or the bacteria of the future…

Is it really safe to let all these sequences open sources ? At the first look, it sounds like a non-sense! But open-source biology can be the solution for the developing countries. In the objectives to overcome the occidental weight and develop their own products, Synbio can be a way to get this freedom and balance the pay-off's priorities of the northern countries. The little needs of infrastructures and devices, would allow them to develop the products they really need, like anti-malaria or anti-HIV drugs (C subtype, essentially present in developing countries, whereas A and B subtypes are found in rich countries and are the target of actual researches), without being dependent of the patent and multinational companies. Patent seems safer, but increases the dependence North/South.
There is an example, stuck in the head of anyone: the GM corn. Because of a corn gone sterile by genetic manipulation, farmers were dependent of an American company and had to buy corn every year to this company to continue their production. In this case, patent is a synonym of addictivity… And open source biology can be a way to abrogate this. We can deepen this parallel with the GMO, because it represents a sum of errors to avoid. Whereas GMO are based on the modification of an existing organism, Synbio consists on the designing of new types of life. The tools and methods are different: trials and errors for the first, software programming for the second… And the implications in the biodebate are totally different:

The interface between the homodimer includes a large network of hydrophobic interactions. This is a phenylalanine- and leucine-rich interface. The H148 residue forms two hydrogen bonds that ""connect"" the two backbones of the ß-barrels. The histidines and their hydrogen bonds are depicted in Figure 7.
Figure 7: The interface between the homodimers consist primarily of hydrophobic interactions and two hydrogen-bonding histidine residues. The histidines and their hydrogen bonds are shown. PDB ID: 2WIQ
KillerRed contains many sulfurous residues (10 methionines and 6 cysteines) to protect the protein against ROS damage2. Figure 8 depicts the homodimer with these residues visible.
Figure 8: The protein produces superoxide anion radicals, which can react with proteins and lipids to deactivate them. KillerRed contains many sulfurous residues (10 methionines and 6 cysteines) that can act as antioxidants. The large volume of the sulfur atom stabilizes the radical and prevents significant damage to the protein's backbone and side chains.2,3,4 PDB ID: 2WIQ
The superoxide anion radical is likely formed in this 8-membered water channel depicted in Figures 10 and 112. The carbonyl on the imidazole ring (Figure 9) hydrogen bonds with the water molecules and reacts with them when the π-electrons in the chromophore are excited. The lifetime of the fluorescence allows enough time for the reaction to occur and the superoxide to be produced2. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that fluorescent proteins are light-induced electron donors6, which would allow for the electron transfer to the water molecules, causing the superoxide to form. It has been shown that sing"

Safety
Practical scientific work is crucial, especially for future scientists like us. We like to keep focusing on what science is able to achieve, but then again, risks and dangers may never be out of sight.  Science holds a lot of potential to help and improve, but also to damage and destroy. It takes a lot of time, preparation and precaution to avoid situations where the health of people or the environment are endangered.
Thankfully, during our time working in the lab, no hazardous situations occurred, even though most of us were relatively inexperienced in carrying out an experiment by ourselves. This is partially because everyone was taking extra care on what they were doing (and also on what others were doing) and because everyone was required to be well prepared to start working in the lab.
Preparation
Unexpected situations lead to danger, that is why we implemented a seven month preparation time.  During this time the topic in general and all experiments were planned in detail. In regular seminars and emails our advisors and instructors were informed about progress and any questions that emerged.
Due to the low practical experience of most of us a project had been worked out that did not contain dangers coming from strains or chemicals.
Only S1 organisms (according to the GenTSV and the GenTG, eng. genetic engineering safety ordinance and genetic engineering law) were used and the practical work took place in an S1 lab. The restrictions say that S1 organisms contain only minimal potential for danger to people and the environment. The strains we used were:
• E. coli : DH5 α
• E. coli : JM109
• S. cerevisiae : YPH500
None of them is known to be toxic to aquatic systems, environment or organisms. [1"

In these active oxygen response genes, we focused on the promoter of ahpC, dps, oxyR, sufA, and yaiA. These genes carry no recognition sequences of EcoRⅠ, XbaⅠ, SpeⅠ,and PstⅠ restriction enzymes. These restriction enzyme sites would be used for cloning into the pSB1C3. The promoters of these genes cloned into pSB6A1 are listed in our Biobrick site.
In the SoxRS response, SoxR works as a transcription factor. SoxR is constantly expressed in cells. SoxR binds to the promoter of SoxS, and represses its transcription without hydrogen peroxide. With hydrogen peroxide, SoxR activates the SoxS gene transcription. SoxS also works as a transcription factor of two or more downstream genes responsible to the hydorogen peroxide. In these hydrogen peroxide response genes, we focused on the promoter of acrAB and sodA. Both of these genes have no sequence of EcoRⅠ, XbaⅠ, SpeⅠand PstⅠ restriction enzyme sites. These restriction enzyme sites would be used for cloning into the pSB1C3. The promoters of these two genes cloned into pSB6A1 are listed in our Biobrick site.

1-4 Active oxygen response promoters
Out of these seven active oxygen response promoters, we here shows the structure of ahpC and sufA promoters.
ahpC promoter
Fig.1 OxyR is the transcriptional regulator for the expression of antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress.The OxyR protein is constitutively produced and oxidized by hydrogen peroxide.The oxidized form(active form) of OxyR binds to the promoter region(OxyR binding region:OBR) of ahpC gene and promotes the transcription of the ahpC gene.
ahpC-F are the genes involved in oxidative stress defense. Transcription of these genes is regulated in response to H2O2. The ahpC and ahpF genes encode the small subunit and large subunit of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, respectively. The complex of AhpC and AhpF reduces alkyl hydroperoxide. The ahpC promoter is controlled by the OxyR protein, an oxidative stress responsive transcription factor. OxyR is constitutively expressed"

The 2008 Edinburgh team designed the genes required to break down cellulose into glucose ( http://parts.igem.org/Protein_coding_sequences/Biosynthesis/Cellulose , https://2008.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh ). These are an exocellulase (cex from Cellulomonas fimi), an endocellulase (cenA from C. fimi), and a beta-glucosidase (bglX from Cytophaga hutchinsonii). Other enzymes required to fully degrade plant material would be added as well.
In field testing
The next stage of the project is infield testing, we have contacts through our school at the Chimfunshi wildlife orphanage and will be purchasing cattle and goats to test the product in the environment we plan to implement it in.

Promoter Library Sub-Project
Introduction
Up until now, this sub-project has seen the pGFP-rrnB plasmid backbone digested and linearised with restriction enzymes EcoRI and NheI. The resulting 8kb fragment (which is the plasmid backbone) has been successfully excised from agarose gel and purified; it is into this plasmid backbone in which we will place our sigA promoters.
Today's work involves the amplification of the promoter library (a collection of sigA promoters specified by degenerate sequences) using PCR.

A highly specific test will have lots of false negatives but few false positives. Switch to high sensitivity .
The sensitivity and specificity of a screening tool depend on the cutoffs used on a Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and as one increases the other is likely to decrease. Depending on the type of screening we want to do, we can alter the cutoffs on the ROC curve.
For a high-risk screening (e.g. heavy smokers for NSCLC), we would set the cut-offs at 100% sensitivity so it would always pick up NSCLC, and compromise on the specificity which would be at 84%. For mass population screening, we would use a 100% specificity cut-off which would cause the sensitivity to be 56%. The cutoffs here are based on Hennessy et al.'s ROC curve for miRs-15b-5p and 27b-3p in diagnosing NSCLC. [3]
The ROC curve for the two miRNAs we are using is shown here. The area under curve (AUC) of 98% represents the accuracy of the test.

The choice to use high specificity for mass population ensures would minimize false positive rates for cost efficiency necessary for population wide screening. However, the low sensitivity means that some people with cancer may not be referred for further testing, and are thus left untreated. Through using many miRNA signatures in tandem, we would try to reduce the rate of false negatives.  The goal of mass population screening is also to pick up as many people with a cancer, as early as possible, not everyone, meaning the lower sensitivity would be acceptable.
In the case of high risk screening, the low specificity (and thus higher false positive rate) is less problematic than it may seem, as the ratio of positives to negatives in the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz"

Faisal Naqib
I'm a graduate student in physiology at McGill University where I'm studying the application of mathematical modeling to the field of neural plasticity. Before I came to McGill I completed a Bachelor of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada majoring in applied mathematics and minoring in biology. I'm interested in translational sciences, whether it be mathematical biology and medicine, synthetic biology, or using sophisticated mathematical techniques and engineering principles to figure out how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.
Also, I'm apparently the only team member that could find a picture of myself that did not involve me wearing a lab coat. Success.

Special Collaboration
This summer we decided to work on Interlab and tried to construct the basic parts needed. Although we tried several times to construct the device BBa_J23101 + BBa_E024, we did not achieved it. Fortunately, we keep comunication with Tec-Monterrey and found that they were having the same problem with the device BBa_J23115 + BBa_E024. Because of that the best way to finish properly our work we exchange devices.
Protocols
The protocols that we use are the same that we specify in our section “Protocols”, but in this case we describe the specific details.
Selection of DNA from distribution plates
We selected the DNA from the recommended wells to work with them.
Parts used to the interlab work.
Transformation
1. Add 50 µL of E. coli Top10 Ca+2 competent cells to a pre-chilled centrifuge tube. Keep always on ice until step 4.
2. Add 1 µL of every DNA solution to the tubes and mix.*
3. Chill the tube on ice for 20 - 30 minutes.
4. Expose the reaction mixture to a 42ºC for 1 minute heat-shock.
5. Put the tube on ice for 2 minutes.
6. Add 200 µL of antibiotic-free LB media.
7. Incubate at 37ºC for 20 - 30 minutes.
8. Spread the appropriate quantity of cells (50-200 µL) on selective LB agar plates.
9. Incubate overnight at 37°C.
10. Select colonies from the plates and culture them for 15 hours in microcentrifuge tubes with 600 µL of LB media. The tubes must have a tiny hole in the cap to allow the oxygenation.
*The parts that were transformed are BBa_I20260, BBa_J23101, BBa_J23115 and BBa_E0240.
Minipreparation
1. From the cultures, take 50 µL and store them at 4°C in new microcentrifuge tubes.
2. Centrifuge the other 550 µL at 14"
UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to collect and organize the results. So I passed most of the time at the PC, because the Registry pages of my parts had to be ready as soon as possible to be a model for the other guys of the team. But among this mess and infinite charts I found also the time to go to the cemetery to pick up a huge piece of tombstone. Fortunately Giaco helped me to pick it up with his car, because I would have had some problems in transporting 100kg-marble stone on my poor motorcycle....
This was one of the weeks that I had more fun: we have built a crustonator! After following the useful advices of Damiano and reading careful the instructions on a paper by M. Gomez-Heras, the acid-rain simulator was finally completed and ready to start to produce a lot of black crust. For the first attempt we put in the box four white marble pieces, we will wait now for 9 days to observe the black crust formation.
Giaco on 29th August had the last, huge exam before graduating: Physiology! It means that he had to worry about that, and I went on testing the terminators efficiency. This week I did in vitro measurements with the pure system in the Mansy lab.
Week 16 (09/03 – 09/09)
Time is running out, so we started to apply our fantastic bacteria on the statues! We had finally collected all the stone pieces we need, so we started with the applications. We are using Anna’s egg beater to make the gel! Ross had a great idea on how to apply the bacteria. We made a jelly pudding type layer of agar. We pored the gel on the marble and wait that it solidifies. With a syringe we made holes in the gel and applied in each hole a mixture of induced bacteria and agar-MOPS.
We thought about interviewing some experts of the field, so I contacted Flavio Deflorian, an engineer who works in the field of restoration and material chemistry. He was very kind to have lunch with us and come to our lab, where we interviewed him with some questions and he gave us a lot of precious advices and information.      In the meantime I completed to upload my characterization results on the Registry pages, and started to worry about the two exams approaching next week.
We are getting ready for our graduation. We have only few weeks left to our defence. This is also a good opportunity to put together the project page of the website. Jason is still the web designer!

It plays significant role in multiple physiological processes, including sensing touching and shear stress of blood flow for proper blood vessel development, regulating red blood cell functions and controlling cell migration as well as differentiation. [10]
With the increasing importance of Mechanical sensing ion in pathology (many diseases are associated with them, including cardiac arrhythmia (such as atrial fibrillation) [11] cardiac hypertrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and other cardiovascular diseases [12] ), there may be more and more researches that focus on it in the future. We hope that this preliminary exploration with quantitative measurement of MS channel’s sensibility will provide people with a better understand in the functions and mechanisms of it.

It might seem a very good candidate for further work given the startling degree of congruence between the hit and the gene, but we were yet to verify the reliability of the reconstructed regions of the genome scaffolds where mRNA sequence data was unavailable.
We also observed that the majority of the better hits fell along middling regions of the predicted genes. This seems reasonable given that Arabidopsis thaliana emerged approximately 10 million years ago [10] and Marchantia emerged around 400 million years ago [1] , so there would have been sufficient time for non-essential amino acids to get knocked out or replaced by genetic drift, with the essential ones (e.g. molecule binding motifs) being conserved.
Conclusion
We have produced a shortlist of 27 potential promoter regions in the Marchantia polymorpha genome that may be regulated under phosphate starvation, sulphate limitation or in the presence of nitrates. The sequences for the regions can be found in the iGEM Registry, under the following catalogue numbers:
Part:BBa K1484319 to Part:BBa K1484325 inclusive; Part:BBa K1484327 to Part:BBa K1484334 inclusive; Part:BBa K1484336 to Part:BBa K1484347 inclusive.
Our analysis mostly supports promoters related to nitrate regulation as most of the best hits were found in this group. Further experimentation is recommended in order to verify these as useable parts. We would like to highlight Part:BBa_K1484333 and Part:BBa_K1484336 as promising candidates based on the frequency of good blast hits with the corresponding predicted M. polymorpha genes, and the congruence of these genes to mRNA transcripts.
These results form part of the ‘Marchantia Starter Kit’ we have prepared to help future iGEM participants and others who wish to work with this plant chassis.

Week 5: TS, TK, MS, AB
MutB construct:
PCR, gel extraction and ligation of MutB blunt end fragments was repeated. To increase the amount of DNA, the product was amplified by PCR. Additionally, we tried to phosphorylate the MutB2 blunt end fragment before ligation.
For Wet Lab:
designing primers for MutB1 and MutB2 with blunt ends
Collaboration:
Patrick from the iGEM Team TU Darmstadt introduced their project to us and we discussed possible collaborations.

Dry Lab:
Our binding proteins might only be partly loaded. We could check this quantitatively through Western blot using the epitope tag or the His-Tag.
Giant Jamboree:
We started looking for flights to and from Boston and discussed hotel options. Everyone has to do the ESTA registration to be allowed to travel to the USA.
Financials:
At the beginning of August we will check how much money is available for the Giant Jamboree.
Human practice:
We want to participate at the “GZMB Sommerfest” and will contact the responsible persons. Additionally, we will try to develop a concept for a school project and might organize interviews with experts.
Cooperation:
The iGEM team Leuven is working on an interesting project and we might be able to cooperate with them.
16/07/11:
Wet Lab work:
We reported the general laboratory progress to the team members who had not been working in the lab for some time and to our supervisors. The ligation of MutB was still not successful and we discussed further approaches including the introduction of blunt ends to the two MutB fragments.
We were also informed that the -80 °C freezer with our electrocompetent cells broke down during the weekend which means, that we have to check if our electrocompetent cells still work.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2018,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"rosstalk with other variants of this communication system as well as with other natural communication systems inside the cell. Therefore, we found the “Arbitrium” bacteriophage QS [6] to be a good candidate, since the orthogonality would be better using a bacteriophage system non-native to our bacterium.
Finally, in the native “Arbitrium” system we have a promoter that is activated by an activator protein, which in turn is deactivated by a small signalling peptide. Since the activator is expressed constitutively, the overall system behaves like a constitutive promoter that can be inhibited by a peptide signal. This kind of promoter is very useful for logic gate constructions. However, many labs and companies are used to working with promoters that are activatable by an inducer molecule, such as pLacI by IPTG, pBad by arabinose, pLtet by tetracycline and pLasR by acyl-homoserine-lactone. Therefore, we investigated whether our system can be switched from a repressible promoter to an activatable promoter, using the original promoter as an operator sequence downstream of a constitutive E. coli promoter. Consequently, we developed a promoter which responds to a constitutively expressed repressor and a “de-repressor” peptide.
Choosing the chassis
After we identified the “Arbitrium” system, a decision had to be made: which chassis should we use? We initially thought of using B. subtilis, which is the host of the SPbeta bacteriophage group, to characterise a library of orthogonal QS signals. However, our Human Practices research revealed that most labs and companies are working with E. coli. So, we decided to adapt the “Arbitrium” system to fit the E. coli chassis, which as a Gram-negative bacterium does not naturally use a peptide based QS. Once we are able to establish a peptide based QS in E. coli, the characterisation of a library of new QS peptides would become possible.
Popularising the project
During our Human Practices research, we realised that it was not easy to explain our project to the general public and make people interested in it because it was very abstract for them. So we decided to do two things. First, we investigated a number of potential applications arising out of our project (see the Applications), such as gene regulation, distributed logic gates, and multiplexed biosensors. Next, we have created many different media to educate the public about each of these applications. The orthogonality of a communication system is explained through our video"

Confirmation of the clones:
We performed a double digestion by EcoRI and PstI to release the cloned fragment from the recombinant vector. The digestion products were resolved on an Agarose Gel by Electrophoresis and the size of the fragment confirmed the correct clone.

IV - The Problem:Heme-
The biggest problem which we encountered was that the heme synthesis was much less as compared to our overexpressed protein.  Heme :
Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) prosthetic groups perform a wide range of functions in nature including
1) electron transfer
2) oxygen transport and storage
3) catalysis
4) gas sensing
5) gene regulation
Types of Heme :
The most common types of heme are heme b and heme c.  Heme b: It is iron-protoporphyrin IX that is bound noncovalently to protein  Heme c: heme c has two covalent thioether bonds formed between Cys side chains and the heme vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 . The stereochemistry of heme attachment is the same in all known examples of heme c, and the vinyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are attached to the N- and C-terminal Cys of the CXXCH motif, respectively.
Other, less common, derivatives of heme include heme d1, present in cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase, heme a, found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the related heme o, found in some bacterial oxidases. From a chemical perspective, hemes b and c are very similar to each other and thus are not expected to display significant inherent differences in electronic structure or reduction potential.  From a biosynthetic perspective, however, these types of heme are quite different; because heme c is synthesized from heme b, the use of heme c requires a greater investment from the organism.  The heme which is found in NrfA is Heme c
Heme Biosynthesis Pathway :
Incomplete heme incorporation into recombinant protein has been a frequently encountered problem .A population of protein will fold without heme cofactor under condition where folding outspaces heme delivery
Cytochrome c biogenesis:
Natural modiﬁcations to heme occur after the ferrous iron (Fe2) is inserted into the porph"

Collaboration Overview
We are proud to collaborate with fellow iGEMmers from Cornell, the University of Michigan, Northwestern, and the University of Southern Denmark to produce a video series on GMOs, or Genetically Modified Organisms. We hope to engage the general public in a thoughtful conversation on this hot topic by discussing the history, ethics, and future of several GMO areas, all of which have been effected by the innovations of synthetic biology.
Over the past few weeks all of us have been hard at work doing preliminary research, reaching out to the synbio community, and writing shooting scripts. As we move forward and begin shooting our videos, stay tuned for updates and sneak peeks

Plated out pRS305 + pRS306 on a triple dropout plate that had been supplemented with 100 uL of 10 mg/mL tryptophan.  Used the same plating scheme as for the other transformations.  (transformation mix and its dilution from yesterday).  These will definitely have lower efficiency than the other plates, and will be ready a day later, but will hopefully yield at least a few colonies.  Put into incubator around 6:30 pm along with a control plate that was triple dropout supplemented with tryptophan in the same manner.
Planning to run a test of activator parts on Friday.  Will build the test of our repressors into Test #2 instead. Thus, we have decided to make the following transformations for Test #2:
1. pRS304* added to the pRS305 + pRS306 strain in W3031a
2.
Transformations:
Note that we have received the specified parts from Smolke.  This includes a plate of the W3031_alpha strain that has GAL2 knockout, as well as the plasmid that contains the G418 gene.  Now it will be necessary to order primers for the GAL2 gene (the sequences for the primers were also provided by Smolke) so that we can make a PCR product using the G418 as template to create the proper knockout DNA.  We can then apply this.  We will also need to order G418 for growing all of our new strain of GAL2 knockouts

(2) Meet up with advisors, professors, and iGEM NCTU
In May 2017, we invited Assistant Professor Warren C. Ruder , PITT, Professor Wen-Liang Chen , NCTU and Professor Chao-Min Cheng , NTHU, to review our project. Meanwhile, we also shared our project with “ NCTU iGEM ” mutually. This meeting was held before we could start our plan, which halted us from rushing forward. We stopped, reflected and then adjusted our orientation and strategy:
1. Our project contains too many high techniques or skills like EIS, Monobody application, frozen cell technique, gold plating, IoT integrate, etc. Combining all of these together is somewhat complicated and never was there a team who successfully did so. However, it would be a standout if our team managed to pull it off. We should reconsider simplifying our project. On the other hand, every technique needs a lot of tests to fit new working environment or for a different application. With a limited time, it is hard to achieve.
2. The condition of wastewater is always harsh. To put an exquisite device to dispose of it with such a great amount remains problems to be solved. We should better consider some other more valuable target.

(1) The Wastewater treatment plant of Science Park
When we talk about water disposal, the first thing comes into our mind would be wastewater treatment plant (WTP) since most water that is contaminated or used by humanity would all eventually go to WTP. Thus, WTP becomes our primary target for practicing and working out our idea. In September, we went to WTP of National Science Park for investigation and sampling. There were three engineers in WTP who helped us realize the whole plant including monitoring station. We learned much about how WTP dispose of the wastewater step by step and also how they control the"

Collarboration with NTHU_Taiwan
2018.08.03
Team Collaboration
As a team composed of members from biology background, we gladly offer help and troubleshoot the problem on making construct for team NTHU_Taiwan, being insufficient with members from biology department. Since August 3rd, we had several meetings               with 2018 iGEM team NTHU_Taiwan.
Earlier before the meeting, NTHU_Taiwan designed the gene of insert for their experiment. After getting the synthesized gene part from IDT and digesting both the inserts and the vectors, they proceeded to ligation, which failed after times               they tried.
We went through details from their design of the gene, cutting site and protocols. Later we concluded that the major reason for failing to make the constructs is due to low concentration of the inserts left following digestion and purification.
We re-designed primers for NTHU_Taiwan and suggested NEBuilder Assembly kit, so that they can avoid the loss of their inserts while digesting and purifying the DNA. The kit requires lower DNA input and can save time by avoiding PCR amplification               steps.
A few weeks later, we were informed that NTHU_Taiwan still failed to make the constructs. Therefore, we provided our lab for their experiments and kept an eye on them through out their experiments to make sure that there’s no man-made technical               false.
Gladly, after several meetup with us and our assistance in lab, team NTHU_Taiwan successfully made all three constructs they needed-- pSB1C3 - AHL snesor - Anti – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLac – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLux – GFP. It was very pleasant experience               to work with NTHU_Taiwan.
Since we urge to seek help in building wiki page, in return, NTHU_Taiwan also give us host a meeting with us teaching coding and giving us tips that help making wiki page easier for us. We took the wiki pages designed by previous teams               as examples to learn and practiced basic coding skills.
Validating construct used in our Biowatcher experiment is also involved"

We attended the 88th Genetic Society of Japan and had a discussion with 4 other Japanese iGEM teams ( Gifu , Kyoto , Nagahama , and UT-tokyo ). We had a good opportunity to exchange information and to deepen our friendship. This was provided by Nagahama. It was very significant and stimulating discussing each other's project. We really appreciate the above teams, especially Nagahama , who acted to take the lead.
We answered a survey and questionnaire from METU HS Ankara and Kyoto . METU HS Ankara created protocols' database in every language. So we helped them to translate iGEM experiment protocols to Japanese. Kyoto made new software of notebook on wiki. We advised some points to be improved. We hope their plans go well.
with XMU-China
We introduced our team in the newsletter published by XMU-China this year. The newsletter is separated into two parts; “Part version” and “Team version”, composed of 5 topics; Introduction, Human Practice, Collaboration, Discussion and Survey.  Our article is included in “Team version”, and we introduced our daily activities, progress of the project, and what we have done for human practice. Including us, 41 teams from 21 countries and regions were involved in making these issues. It was not only interesting to know about other teams’ activities through these newsletters, but also it provided each team good opportunity for new collaborations.
with Heidelberg
We gained the assay protocol for circularized protein from iGEM Heidelberg team. This year we came up with an idea to utilize SAP for circularization of a protein, which is intended to gain thermostability and pH stability of enzymes. Team Heidelberg also worked on circularization project in 2014, with a different approach from ours. Therefore, it would be an interesting comparison if we use the same protocol"

Intellectual Property
As the paper that we based our project on cited a granted patent, we wanted to explore intellectual property in more detail to determine how this may influence our project. As none of our team members have any experience in intellectual property rights, we consulted experts in the field to seek guidance and answers. We contacted Dr. Rick Watson from the University of Manchester Intellectual Property office and Dr. Linda Kahl from the BioBrick Foundation. Through e-mail exchanges and a phone call discussion, the details of the intellectual property surrounding our project became much clearer. This directly impacted the development of our business plan and consequently shaped our experimental ideas. Click here to read our full report on intellectual property!
E-mail Exchange with Dr. Rick Watson - University of Manchester Intellectual Property (UMIP)
We wanted to know whether our project would be viable for a patent. To understand this, we reached out to Dr. Watson from the University of Manchester Intellectual Property (UMIP) . Through e-mail, Dr. Watson gave a very thorough explanation that helped us to understand the patent situation of our project.
We were told that a granted patent is different than a patent application because if the patent has not yet been examined, we do not know for certain which of the claims are approved as written by the applicant, or which of them may be modified or refused as part of the examination process. In addition, we learned that holding a patent in a certain territory will give a monopoly not only over that territory but it also stops products created outside from being imported into those territories.
If we were to commercialize and patent our project, we learned that we will have to consider all previous patents and all previous scientific literature known as the ‘prior art’. This is because to be patentable, our invention would have to pass four basic tests:
1. Is it novel? Has our idea been thought of before, and put into the public domain by either us, or someone before us? - if our idea is not novel then it fails this test and we cannot patent it
2. Our project will have to have an ‘inventive step’ that is different from other previous patents - and not just an obvious thing to"

Team Uppsala 2012 chromoprotein attracts many interests because its more convenient than fluorescent protein to be use as a reporter. However, few characterized data can be found for these proteins. SUSTC-Shenzhen this year want to tackle with theses problems. At first, we want to characterize plasmid assembled by 3 promoters, 3 RBSs, and 4 chromoprotein (36). Because time limits, we choose 2 promoter, 2 RBSs and 4 chromoprotein (16). However, we found construction with E1010 is very hard because the promoter we used (J23100 & J23106) can express chromoprotein E1010, which makes it difficult and unnecessary to distinguish between these proteins. So we abandoned BBa_E1010 and do experiments on other chromoproteins.
Results
We successfully constructed 8 parts, and they all are characterized. And 6 parts were sent to Registry of Standard Biological Parts. See them | HERE .

Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Safety
        In the whole competition, safety always comes first. So we make efforts to protect ourselves and the environment                             from any potential harm in the project. All efforts we do for safety can be summed up into two aspects: Safe                             Project Design and Safe Lab Work.
Safe Project Design
        In our project, we are trying to build a group visible and low-cost bio-sensors of heavy metal, which can detect                             heavy metal ions in aqueous solution. We standardize the lysis gene SRRz and the β-galactosidase gene as a reporter, and link some specific inducible promoters of heavy metal ions to this reporter. Then we transform                             these devices into E.coli BL21 to construct engineering bacteria that can rapidly detect heavy metal ions                             in aqueous solution. To ensure the safety of our project, we take following measures.
1. Non-pathogenic Chassis
        We choose E.coli BL21i as our genetically modified chassis organism in our project. Our chassis bacteria have                             not acquired any characteristics that would enable them to compromise human immune system/other systems or                             evade detection and destruction by the former or facilitate spread between people/animals, which makes them                             harmless from both a personal and public health point of view.
2. Harmless Parts
        Our parts are all safe for human. We ensure that none of the genes or parts that we were assembling would act                             as virulence factors according to current professional knowledge, and that no known pathogens would be involved                             in our research. It is thus conclusive that none of the parts would raise any safety issues.
3. Safe Gene Circuits
        We use a series of specific inducible promoters of heavy metal ions, which guarantees that our bacteria won’t                             produce large amounts of protein without being induced. And as we use lysis gene SRRz as the reporter, once                             the promoters are induced, the cells’ wall will be lysed and the cells will die.
4. Proof-of-concept Experiment
        The original intention of the project is to develop a group visible and low-cost bio-sensors to detect heavy                             metal ions"

Today we went to know the laboratory of Mineral analyzes of Geological Service in Brazil (CPRM – Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais/ Company of Mineral Resources’ Research) and the equipment that will tell us if our bioaccumulation Mercury Bacter takes Hg from the medium. The DMA - 80 (Direct Mercury Analyzer) is an equipment capable of detect and quantify the total mercury presence in samples with a minimum limit of 0.02ng.
Before getting any samples measurements on DMA, we must do a calibration curve before, where will have patterns of analyzed mercury quantity in form of a graph, where it will also show dots correspondent to mercury quantities on our gene constructions samples.
But, the equipment wasn’t working properly, requiring a technical calibration so we can make our calibration curve later.

What is BioHub 3.0
BioHub 3.0 is a synthetic biology community, integrated Intelligent Search Engine and the online report editor. It brings you a new way to edit your reports and search whatever you need only in one step.
The Editor
We established a standardized description of experimental steps. The editor can help you complete high-quality lab reports quickly just by choosing steps and filling in the blanks. Custom steps and protocols are also supported. And in our report editor, biologists could use a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation and writing articles, which improve the efficiency of completing the experiment report.
Intelligent Search Engine
We developed our search engine on the base of 2017's project. Our engine has a better command of language recognition. It supports semantic recognition, like ""reports today"", ""reports by ana"", ""reports this year"" and edc.. Meanwhile, we listened to the opinions of the judges. This year we added advanced search and we can now sort the results by time, labels, etc.. It is easier for synthetic biologists to find what they need without many input's instructions. Additionally, we have added many useful databases and academic websites to our search engine, so biologists could search information more quickly.
The community
In this community, bio workers can record their experimental process and release those reports. Meanwhile, they could also read and comment on other scholar's reports. In this way, we make the academic discussion more convinent. We provide both site search and off-site search to provide better user experience.
Motivation
After consulting with several synthetic biology workers, we found that they would inevitably suffer from the need to spend a lot of time to complete the experimental report during the experiment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a editor that provides a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation, writing articles by dragging steps or protocols to improve the efficiency. So it can replace the original Pages or Microsoft Office for its convenience.  As we all know, too programmer-style search engine is very unfriendly to synthetic biologists, so we reidesigned functions of search engines. Researchers can easily find reports written by others after inputting some key words. They could also search information in some databases and websites directly though this engine.  For most synthetic biology workers"

The design of the measurement standard construct for shRNA or miRNA silencing strengths has been done by the students with support by advisors. This standard has been inspired by the measurement standard for synthetic promoters (Team Heidelberg 2009, RFC 41 ) and the prokaryotic promoter measurement kit (Jason Kelly, RFC 19 ). The design in annotated sequence format of the final construct has been conducted by students. The basic construct has been synthesized by Geneart, and the following replacements of parts (in particular binding sites) within the construct have been cloned by students. This includes the design of cloning strategies.

The design of imperfect shRNA sequences to achieve various silencing strengths has been designed by students with support by advisors/instructors. The design in annotated sequence format and cloning of these sequences into the miMeasure construct has been done by students.
Measurement of shRNA silencing strengths
Measurements were done by the students under close supervision by advisors of the team to avoid the risk of damages to the expensive devices such as a wide-field and a confocal microscope, a flow cytometer, and a microplate reader. Measurement settings have also been designed in agreement with instructors/advisors.
miBEAT
The design of the model to predict silencing strengths of imperfect shRNAs has been done by the students with support by advisors. The implementation itself has been done by students. The design of the miBEAT-GUI to access the gene silencing model has been inspired by alumni of the iGEM Heidelberg 2009 team, the implementation has been done by students from our team.
Hepatocyte Identification via miR-122
The strategy to design a miRNA binding site pattern within the miMeasure construct using random assembly PCR (Heidelberg 2009 team, RFC 42 ) has been developed by students. Theoretical background on miRNA expression profiles has been given by advisors.
Virus capsid shuffling
We have followed two approaches for the capsid shuffling: (1) it has been conducted using the Alberta approach from 2009 ( RFC 47 ) in all respects by the students; (2) it has been conducted using"

What is BioHub 3.0?
BioHub 3.0 is a synthetic biology community, integrated Intelligent Search Engine and the online report editor. It brings you a new way to edit your reports and search whatever you need only in one step.
The Editor
 
We established a standardized description of experimental steps. The editor can help you complete high-quality lab reports quickly just by choosing steps and filling in the blanks. Custom steps and protocols are also supported. And in our report editor, biologists could use a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation and writing articles, which improve the efficiency of completing the experiment report.
Intelligent Search Engine
 
We developed our search engine on the base of 2017's project. Our engine has a better command of language recognition. It supports semantic recognition, like ""reports today"", ""reports by ana"", ""reports this year"" and edc.. Meanwhile, we listened to the opinions of the judges. This year we added advanced search and we can now sort the results by time, labels, etc.. It is easier for synthetic biologists to find what they need without many input's instructions. Additionally, we have added many useful databases and academic websites to our search engine, so biologists could search information more quickly.
The community
 
In this community, bio workers can record their experimental process and release those reports. Meanwhile, they could also read and comment on other scholar's reports. In this way, we make the academic discussion more convinent.  We provide both site search and off-site search to provide better user experience.
Motivation
After consulting with several synthetic biology workers, we found that they would inevitably suffer from the need to spend a lot of time to complete the experimental report during the experiment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a editor that provides a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation, writing articles by dragging steps or protocols to improve the efficiency. So it can replace the original Pages or Microsoft Office for its convenience.
As we all know, too programmer-style search engine is very unfriendly to synthetic biologists, so we reidesigned"

Introduction
If our project is to process cadmium and not other metals, we need to genetically engineer Bacillus subtilis to carry out a set of cellular processes based on the action of metal sensors. These metal sensors will detect cadmium through a system known as AND Gating. This system of combined metal sensors ensures the Bacillus subtilis cells have a tightly controlled cadmium sensor, as naturally occurring metal sensitive promoters can respond to OTHER metals too
There are two metal sensing repressors, which are known to respond to cadmium: ArsR and CzrA. However, their specificity for cadmium is not unique. ArsR also detects arsenic and CzrA also detects zinc and copper. The table below shows the metals which release both ArsR and CzrA from their DNA binding sites:

By positioning the operator binding sites for these two metal sensing repressors next to each other in a promoter region, the gene regulated by that promoter will be transcribed only when a metal that binds to both sensors is present; in this case Cadmium.
This is a combinatorial approach for gene expression regulation. To read more information on the cadmium sensor, please visit the Cadmium Sensing section of the Project Overview.
