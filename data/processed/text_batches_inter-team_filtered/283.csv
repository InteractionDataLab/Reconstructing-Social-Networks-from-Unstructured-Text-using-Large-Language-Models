TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," velocity is 1 for every stage except the marrow reticulocytes, where the time cells stay in this stage depends on the concentration of EPO.
The commitment of stems cells to becoming red blood cells is an irreversible event ( Fuertinger et al. 2012 ). Cells cannot regress back to a previous cell type or switch to a different differentiation pathway. For this reason, assumption 1 can be made. A change in time will lead to an equal change in the age of the cell. As a result, the finer you make the population mesh the smaller the time step is. This increases the accuracy of the model as the cells react to changes in EPO concentration in time faster. Once they reach the age at which they differentiate into another cell stage, the resulting growth and decay rates that govern them will change.
Figure 14. Transition of cells from one stage to another through differentiation. (a) Follows one population set of reticulocyte cells as they age over time and transition to marrow reticulocytes. (b) Shows the result of a simulation of the population density of cells every 0.1 days of maturity at a steady state EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml.
When a time step occurs, the cells in each mesh point (\(u_n\)) experience growth or decay based on the stage they are in. The new population of cells is then shifted to the next age mesh point. The general form of the equation that governs the change of population density at each time step is below.
$$ u_n = u_{n-1}\times e^{(\beta-\alpha(EPO(t)) \times \Delta t} \tag{20}$$
$$ u_{n+1} = u_{n}\times e^{(\beta-\alpha(EPO(t)) \times \Delta t} \tag{21}$$
$$ \Delta t = \mu_{n+1} - \mu_n = \Delta \mu \tag{22}$$
The dynamics of the mesh in response to a gene doping injection can be seen in figure 15.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 6_-_-_TEXT.html," for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Project Abstract: Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Integrated Human Practices
Providing society with clean water is important to maintain the general health of the population, and there are many regulations and restrictions on how to do it. We want to contribute to the work by cleaning water from pharmaceuticals with our enzymatic solution. We have therefore consulted with experts within wastewater treatment, hospitals and academia. Furthermore, we have gotten valuable feedback from other creatives from the field by joining the new Open Innovation platform ""HelloScience"" created by Novozymes. Here we got questions about our project, allowing us to create an early user connection to adjust the feasibility and impact of our solution. The methods used today within wastewater treatment were discussed in great details with experts, but also future treatment systems and the practicability and sustainability of our product. The key in our work was defined by talking to people within the community providing transparency and open discussions.  The result of our meetings and people that crossed our path became Biotic Blue - a reflection of integrated influences and the community.

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4
Demonstrate
In order to fulfill the goal of creating an automated system that selectively dispenses the output of a microfluidic chip, TERRA is required to have certain functionality.
Functional Requirements:
Application agnostic - treats the user’s microfluidic chip as a black box system so that TERRA can handle a variety of different applications and microfluidic chips
Selectively dispense microfluidic output - uses a UI and XY translational stage to move a well plate so microfluidic outputs are dispensed into user selected wells
Fully Automated - output selection is facilitated by automating valve actuation for each output
Integration with benchtop analytics - Dispense the sample volume inputted by the user into selected
Cost effective - Less than current options and accessible to researchers; >$1000
We have designed TERRA to fulfill all the requirements.
Application Agnostic
Creating an application agnostic system ensures that TERRA can handle a variety of different applications and third party microfluidic chips. In order to make TERRA application agnostic, the system has to treat the user’s microfluidic chip as a black box and work solely with the outputs of the user’s microfluidic chip. In addition, treating the microfluidic chip as a black box offloads the burden of microfluidic expertise off the user, making TERRA accessible to the greater synthetic biology community.
To make TERRA application agnostic, we designed the TERRA Adapter. The TERRA Adapter is a microfluidic chip that connects the user’s microfluidic chip to TERRA, mediating selection and redirection of outputs. The TERRA Adapter is currently a feature available on 3DuF so that users can manufacture and assemble their own TERRA Adapters for their experiments.

Safety Q&A | Human Practice
Q: Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
A: Biology research may raise safety issues to some extent, since the utility and study of plasmids and bacteria may lead to potential risks. However, we believe that the bio-safety in our laboratory can be guaranteed during the research process, for our attaching great importance upon this issue. We act under the principle of the experiment and the regulation of our university.
Moreover, we make guidelines for our laboratory in the usage of devices, the preservation of the bacteria and the dealing of waste, in order to keep us behaving properly and thus keep off the safety issues. Additionally, our project ideas only focus on the sequence of the gene, and are unlikely to produce new and unexpected substance. With all measures above followed, the risk can be decreased to the minimum.
Q: Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
A: No. As far as we are concerned, with the regulation and restriction followed, and the operation of the innocuous genes only, none of the new BioBrick parts or devices we made this year raise safety issues.
Q: Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
A:  Yes. Our project is supported and financed by Department of Automation with the help of Department of Life Sciences. Professors and supervisors keep in contact with our team, evaluate the procedure and give us necessary advices during our work, and safety is required to be concerned as the prior issue. What’s more, laboratory assistants participate in the research and thus lead the teammates to conduct in a right way.
Q:  Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Standardization contributes to the bio-safety. With a proper standard on BioBricks, the utility of parts and devices and the synthesis of new ones will"

Inhibitor
Background
IDEA
In molecular genetics, inhibitor is a DNA or RNA binding protein based on its function that it can inhibits the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator or associated silencers. A DNA binding repressor can recognize special operator gene, then it will block the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter or prevent RNA polymerase to move along the direction of DNA, thus it can stop genes from being transcripted into messenger RNA.
The RNA-binding repressor binds to the mRNA to prevent the translation. However, all is fair, this repression can also be relieved by some inducers. If an inducer, which can initiate the expression of gene , is present, it will interact with the inhibitor protein and detach it from the operator. RNA polymerase will have the chance to transcribe.
Corepressor is the molecule which can combined with inhibitor, helping it bind to the operator more tightly and repressing  transcription. An inhibiter that binds with a corepressor is termed “aporepressor” or “inactive repressor”. One type of aporepressor is the trp repressor, an important metabolic protein.
The above mechanism of repression is a type of feedback mechanism because it only allows transcription to start if specific inducers are present.
Inhibitor protein is widely used in logical gene circuit construction, controlling the expression of special genes or important metabolic processes
Mechanism
We choose three types of inhibitor-promoter: LacIq-plac, CI-pR and TetR-ptet to regulate the threshold based on our need.
LacIq-pLac
LacI repressor is a DNA-binding protein which can inhibit lac promoter from expressing genes, which are relative to lactose metabolism( from expressing lactose metabolism relative genes).
These genes are repressed when lactose is not available to the cell, ensuring that the bacterium only invests energy in the production of machinery necessary for uptake and utilization of lactose when lactose is present.
When lactose becomes available, it is converted into allolactose, which combines with the LacI and inhibits the LacI’s DNA binding ability. Loss of DNA binding by the lac repressor is required for transcriptional activation of the operon. LacIq is a mutation type of LacI"

Perchlorate Mass Balance
Theoretical Efficiency of Oxygen Production from Chlorite
The production of oxygen from chlorite, as catalyzed by chlorite dismutase, proceeds via the following equation:
Given the measurements below,
[ClO2-] = 0.500 M
vClO2 = 50.0 mL
The chemical amount of chlorite is given by
nClO2 = [ClO2-] × vClO2 = (0.500 M)(0.0500 L) = 0.0250 mol
Because there is a one-to-one relationship between oxygen and chlorite, the theoretical amount (nO2) of oxygen produced is given by
nO2 = nCl2 = 0.0250 mol
If we assume SATP, the relationship between the volume and molar amount is given by
V = 24.8 L/mol
Therefore, the theoretical volume of oxygen produced (vO2T) is given by
vO2T = V × nO2 = (24.8 L)(0.0250 mol) = 0.620 L
The experimental results show that the experimental volume of oxygen (vO2E) produced is 69 mL. Therefore, the efficiency of our reaction is
% efficiency = vO2E⁄vO2T × 100% = 0.069mL⁄0.620L = 11%
Conclusions for Oxygen Production
Based on our data, in our first attempt, our engineered E. coli were able to produce 69 mL of O2 from a standard solution of ClO2- with 11% efficiency at a rate of 0.27 g of O2 per hour. Although our rate of O2 production pales in comparison to NASA’s Mars Oxygen IERSU Experiment (MOXIE), which is able to electrochemically break carbon dioxide to produce oxygen at a rate of "

About Frontend Framework
​ To make it easy to build applications with the web, we use advanced frontend framework Angular6 which is an open source framework maintained by Google. It is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture which ordinarily utilized for planning rich web applications. Angular6 combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. It helps developers to build cross-platform applications that live on the web, mobile, and desktop across Mac, Windows, and Linux.                         ​ Angular6 makes our web pages extremely high performance. It turns templates into code that's highly optimized for today's JavaScript virtual machines, giving us all the benefits of hand-written code with the productivity of a framework. And Angular apps load quickly with the new Component Router, which delivers automatic code-splitting so users only load code required to render the view they request.                         ​ Thanks to Angular popular, many well-known code editing products support Angular, like Visual Studio Code, Sublime text and WebStorm. We choose WebStorm as our IDE to makes code easily and spend less time.                         ​ When setting up our development environment, Angular CLI plays an important role. Angular CLI is a command line tool which makes build, add components and test faster. It has become one of the most essential tools for Angular.                         ​ We use Angular6 modularity system and component system to work together more easily and efficiently. The modularity system differentiates and combines the same and different functions and the component system can use less code to do a good job. Benefiting from Angular6’s performance and rendering mechanism which are better than most current mainstream frameworks,  including Vue and React, our web pages has faster response and more comfortable experience. With Karma for unit tests, our codes become stronger.                         ​ One of the important reasons we choose Angular6 is the issue of network security. Angular6 has built-in protections against common web-application vulnerabilities and attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks. To systematically block XSS bugs, Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template"

Due to inexperience in computational mathematics, we were not able to incorporate some of these more complex features in our model.

ABCD system
Ideas
During our brainstorming, we read the project of the 2017 Munich team , which established a system for the universal detection of RNA biomarkers. Therefore, we hope to improve the entire detection system and establish a system that can detect protein biomarkers universally.
Luckily, our ABCD system has appeared. Later, we discussed how could it be implied in synthetic biology. We found the answer ultimately in cell-free synthetic biology. In addition, after exchanging ideas with the Munich team, we were more certain that we did use engineering principles to re-edit the biological system.
We have divided our ABCD system into three modules, using engineering ideas, so that each can be ""plug and play"", but also can be ""replaced"". The three modules are ""Sensor"", ""Amplifier"" and ""Reporter"".

Sensor
In the Sensor, we first selected the epithelial cell adhesion molecule as the object of our detection. The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, also known as ESA or CD326) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates epithelial cell-specific intercellular adhesion and involves cell signaling, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. EpCAM has"

Failed to load tracking. JS is probably not enabled
Background
Controlling the movement of our E. coli was essential for tracking down the pathogen. We chose to do so by controlling the expression of cheZ, a gene in the chemotactic pathway of E. coli. Without it, E. coli is immotile.
System design
A construct with an RBS, a promoter and cheZ was created and inserted into a cheZ-knockout strain to see if motility could be restored. In a later stage, cheZ was to be coupled with our Sensing system.
Result
We used a swarm plate assay to assess if motility had been restored. Motility was successfully restored in multiple strains. Extent of swarming seemed to vary with promoter strength.

The assembly plan of the Targeting system.
Background
Movement and Chemotaxis
Chemotaxis is the cells system for directed movement which allows the cell to move towards nutrition sources as well as away from toxic substances. The chemotactic system is a complex chain of phosphorylation reactions. At the end of the chain is the flagellum-binding protein CheY. The phosphorylated CheY (CheY-p) binds the flagella and causes the cell to tumble in place, essentially remaining immotile. The phosphatase CheZ dephosphorylates CheY"

Arguments in Bioethics
There are different arguments in the discussions. The subject of discussion changes depending on what technology or therapeutics is in question. But behind the different-sounding arguments there is a structure or a system. Most of the arguments falls under different categories:
Autonomy and utility
Dignity and integrity
Teleological, natural and religious
Slippery Slope
An argument in category A is an argument that appeals to either the autonomy of an individual or that it will promote utility in the society. It’s a type of argument that one often hears from a proactionist, who normally will focus on the good aspects of an emerging technology or therapeutics. Appeal to autonomy is often motivated from a deontological point of view, but the appeal to utility is often utilitarian in nature KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
Dignity and integrity is mostly seen as a reply to an argument from category A. It’s therefore often used by a precautionist, as their way of saying “slow down - somethings are more important than utility”. The core idea is that living matter has a dignity and integrity that we as a society should respect, but living matter can be defined in many ways allowing room for a versatile argument KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
The teleological, natural and religious arguments are grouped together, due to their habit of being intertwined in an argument. Teleos is the ancient greek word for ‘goal’ or ‘striving’, meaning that all things have a form of ‘striving’ in their essence - the world included. So the argument normally goes: “There is a bigger purpose with the world, that we shouldn’t try to change or interfere with”. Sometimes it’s intertwined with religion, stating that one shouldn’t try to “create”, because that is only meant for the divine KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universit"

Uhuuu!! Super digestion!! As we could see, the samples 4-11 show the expected profile, meaning the presence of it respective fragments and vectors. What intrigued us were the samples 1, 2 and 3. But we’ve passed through this before. What happened is that the fragment has about the same size as the vector, making it difficult to separate them using agarose gel.
To solve this problin, we’re going to digest only using EcoRI to make it linear and with EcoRI + PstI to show the fragment and the vector. If the one digested with EcoRI is the sum of both fragment + vector, it is right! We bet it is! What do you think?!?! We’ll have the answer tomorrow.

Derivatization reaction
Diamine deritatives were obtained by the reaction of 180µL of borate buffer 0.05M (pH9), 60µL of 100% methanol, 47µL diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate without any pretreatment. The samples were heated at 70)C for 2h to allow complete degradation of excess DEEMM and derivatization.
HPLC analysis
After derivatization with diethyl ethoxymethylmalonate, analyses were performed on a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC Agilent technologies, 1260 Infinity) consisting of a binary pump, an inline degasser, an autosampler and a column thermostat. Chromatographic separation was carried out by reverse-phasechromatography on a C18 column maintained at 35°C. Mobile phase A was composed of 100% acetonitrile, and B was made up of 25mM aqueous sodium acetate buffer (pH = 4.8). The flow rate of 1mL/min was used, with the following gradient program : 0-2min, (20-25% A; 2-32min, 25-60%A; 32-40min, 60-20%A. Detection was carried out at 284nm.
Protocol #10 : SLIC (sequence- and ligation-independent cloning)
Procedures
1. Digest vector with restriction enzyme during 3h and purify the linearized vector with a commercial PCR purification kit. Elute DNA with elution buffer or 10mM TrisCl, pH 8.0-8.5. Do nnot elute the DNA with water or TE. Measure the concentration of the vector.
2. Amplify your gene of interest by PCR using primers with 15 mer (or inferior) homology extension to the linearized vector end. We usually use 15bp homology for single fragment cloning, and 20bp for multiple fragment cloning. Purify the linearized vector with a commercial PCR purification kit. Elute the DNA with water or TE. Measure the concentration of the insert(s).
3. Mix the linearized vector and insert at a molar ratio of 1.2 ina 1.5mL tube. An examble is shown as follows. (Vector to insert molar ratio of 1/1 for single fragment cloning"

The phosphatase CheZ dephosphorylates CheY, causing CheY to unbind to the flagella, resulting in directed movement of the cell [1] . More factors are involved in the full chemotactic pathway of E. coli, although they are not of importance for our project.
Using Chemotaxis to track down a pathogen
Due to the complexity of the chemotactic pathway of E. coli, controlling the steering of this chemotactic car was not an option. Instead, we decided to manipulate the breaks, so that our bacteria would stop moving once close enough to the pathogen and deliver a deadly dose of bacteriocin.
To achieve this stop-and-kill mechanism, focus was laid on the protein CheZ. As mentioned above, the bacteria cannot move straight in the absence of CheZ, but tumbles in place instead, so by stopping the production of CheZ we essentially get immotile bacteria. Then, by producing CheZ under controlled manners, the bacteria would ideally become motile again but on our terms. The production of CheZ would be controlled by a system based on the quorum sensing (see the Sensing system) of our pathogen, designed by the Sensing group. The result would be low production of CheZ when close to the pathogen and high production when far away from it.
System design
The ultimate design of our system was the CheZ gene combined with our regulatory Sensing system. However, merging systems is quite a big first step so we decided to divide our work in stages where the final stage was CheZ and the Sensing system combined.
Stage 1
As our goal was to restore motility by inserting CheZ we obviously needed a cheZ-knockout strain of E. coli. We speculated whether we could create such a strain ourselves using various gene-deletion methods but this would require a lot of work on its own. Instead, we received two cheZ-knockout strains and one motile “wildtype” strain as a kind gift by Prof. Parkinson (see Acknowledgements). The two cheZ-knockout strains were called RP1616 and UU2685 and the wildtype RP437. Note that we could not use the standard E. coli lab strain DH5-alpha for our experiments, since it is lacking flagella [3] .
The final stage, were the Targeting system is combined with the Sensing system. In the absence of Yersinia enterocolitica, the activator YenR"

Figure 7.3: The structure of valencene, an intermediate of nootkatone
The intermediate valencene is then converted into nootkatol by a P450 monooxygenase as well as into small amounts of our desired product nootkatone.  The P450 monooxygenase we chose for this project was taken from the bacterium Bacillus megaterium. In this  case it is not only a simple P450 monooxygenase, but an entire P450 system, consisting of a soluble P450 fused to a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) enzyme, making an additional reductase obsolete De Mot et al. (2002) .     Unlike eukaryotic P450s, which are mostly membrane bound, this prokaryotic BM3-P450 is located in the cytosol facilitating an easier transport into the peroxisome, as membrane integration of proteins is a more difficult task to achieve than import of cytosolic proteins Girvan et al. (2006) .   BM3 normally catalyzes the hydroxylation of long chain fatty acids Narhi et al. (1986) , which in our case could inhibit the conversion of valencene. For that reason we used a mutated version of BM3, which is called AIPLF. This variant is an enhanced version of the BM3 AIP version, which has a ten times better substrate oxidation rate for valencene than the wildtype BM3 and produces less byproduct when valencene concentration is saturated. Additionally to previous named benefits the AIPLF variant with 5 point mutations in the active side has a significantly lower binding affinity towards long chain fatty acids and therefore increase the transposition rate of valencene.

The alcohol dehydrogenase from Pichia pastoris subsequently converts nootkatol into nootkatone by oxidation. It uses NAD+ as a cofactor which is reduced in the reaction. The regeneration of this cofactor is facilitated by the BM3, which oxidizes NADH Schulz et al. (2015) .

Rethinking our PCR:
Since we definitely need to Biobrick the TEF promoter, we have decided to rethink our PCR approach.  As mentioned before, one possibility is that our template DNA is bad.  Another is that the 20 uM solution for our primers could not contain any primer"

Non-viral vectors can also be used for gene therapy. Free plasmids can be delivered into the cells using physical methods such as: electroporation, gene gun, ultrasound and hydrodynamic pressure. Non-viral methods were at a disadvantage because of their low efficiency, but with the development of more efficient vector technology, non-viral vectors are becoming more popular; they can reduce problems that occur while using viral vectors such as endogenous virus recombination, oncogenic effects and unexpected immune responses (Huang & Niidome, 2002).
Biosafety & Bioethics
As promising as gene therapy appears, there are many biosafety issues that it raises. The indisputable concerns are whether transferring genes is safe and whether the transferred genes could lead to harmful effects. Technical issues also exist. For example, the use of retroviruses raised criticism from the start. Because of transgene integration that can cause mutations, the use of retroviruses is considered most dangerous for patients. The main argument against gene therapy is that in the worst scenario, unexpected changes in the genetic makeup of the gene therapy patient may be passed down to offspring. To refute this argument, some scientists say that other therapies such as mutagenic drugs and radiation therapy can also cause genetic alteration that can be passed down to offspring. They argue that these therapies are being used without extensive biosafety concerns (Wirth, Parker & Ylä-Herttuala, 2013).
Bioethical issues are also a great concern surrounding gene therapy. The first concern is that there is no clear boundary on what is a “good” or “bad” use of gene therapy. It is also very hard to determine what traits are normal and which traits should be considered as disorders. Gene therapy might also be used not only to cure a disease, but also to enhance basic human traits such as height and intelligence causing social disparity between the poor and the rich (Handbook, 2013).
Our Project & Gene Therapy
With the background information mentioned above, we have investigated the application of gene therapy for our project. It seems like gene therapy is a feasible method to deliver desired genes into target human cells. Currently, gene therapy, however, is only tested and used for incurable diseases such as cancer and rare genetic diseases (Handbook, 2013). The complication that we want to alleviate, obesity, at this current stage of scientific research is not considered an incurable disease. In fact, many people do not even consider obesity as a"

Protein modeling with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from E. meningoseptica
Our modeling aims to improve the activity of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from E. meningoseptica . There would be many practical advantages for a more efficient enzyme: For instance, conversion has to be completed as fast as possible for routine tasks in hospitals. An another example would be to compensate for a possible loss of activity, by being fixed onto a membrane. In order to achieve this we used the experimentally - determined structure of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Liu et al. (2007) .
As described in “Bacterial glycosidases for the production of universal red blood cells”, the active site consists of Tyr307, Tyr225, His228, Glu149, Tyr179 and Arg213. With this we tried to examine the interactions of the residues with the substrate. The precise distances, which would allow interactions, are listed in Table 1. The values refer to Schulz & Schirmer's „ Principles of Protein Structure “.
Table 1: Different distances between residues which would allow interactions.
It was found that the substrate in the active site (Figure 1) is not stabilized at OH - 6 by residues (Substate Structure) , as already mentioned in Liu et. al. (2007) . It has been verified with the Protein Interactions Calculator that no interactions with OH - 6 were detected.

Survey on the Streets
August 15, 2014
Our team members held a survey on people's awareness about genetic engineering on the streets in Kyoto. We asked the same questions as we had asked to high school students at the campus visit to see the broader trend. We also explained how genetic engineering is close to our everyday life by showing a genetically engineered potato chips.  The result suggested that the general public feel distant and rather negative about genetic engineering.

After the meeting we communicated with some students having great interest in our project and expressed their concerns about the risk of immunoreaction caused by bacteria in hemodialysis device. We interpreted our plans trying to avoid this problem and decided to thoroughly and systematically think about the solution to immunoreaction.
Another purpose of us in this experience sharing meeting is to propagandize synthetic biology and iGEM to medical students. We introduced the concept of synthetic biology, the research contents of synthetic biology, the recent research progress in synthetic biology, the connotation of iGEM, our iGEM team, what we had done, etc. Many students are fascinated by synthetic biology and iGEM, and asked a lot of questions such as detailed research contents of synthetic biology and requirements for going in for iGEM. We answered their questions carefully and encouraged them to join us. Medical students with abundant accumulation of biological knowledge and further potential in research are the ideal audiences for our promotion of synthetic biology and iGEM, By this chance of sharing, we try to call on more people to join us and we hope they can fall in love with synthetic biology and iGEM.
“YUZHANG BIG BANG THEORY” Scientific Research Project Competition
12 July 2017, we participated in Yuzhang Big Bang Theory Scientific Research Project Competition together with students from KU Leuven, Ghent University and Wuyuzhang Honors College of Sichuan University. This competition is held by Wuyuzhang Honors College of Sichuan University aimed at helping students from different fields sharing their research works and experiences. This competition is presented as research project competition, and students got onto the stage to introduce their projects and answering questions asked by judges and students under the stage. At last, competitors will be awarded according to judges’ scoring. Judges of this year are prof. Ben Earl Alexander from Harvard University and Mrs. Zhang Lulu from Sichuan University.
We introduced our project of this year to everyone there and got praise from judges. And we are awarded with the Best Academic Performance Award. What is more important is that , we presented our project to students from different background, different countries and different majors with an international mindset. And we promoted synthetic biology and iGEM, and helped students to get to know what they are and what they do. Besides, students asked questions about iGEM such as how to participate, how to decide the project, if there must be people of biomedical majors in the"

PS: the fluorescence intensity of above transformants was divided by the OD600 value and minus that of negative control.
 
From above figures, we could conclude that the Ptet and mRFP1 in BBa_K108701 6 worked well. It was comparable to even stronger than the positive control BBa_I13521 in fluorescence intensity. For BBa_K108701 6A, it expressed about twice fluorescence of BBa_I13521. Results for sequencing suggested that the first half of the Ptet was lost in BBa_K108701 6A, which may account for its increase in strength.

One recommendation from the doping authority is to expand our research to urine. While blood samples are also taken for doping tests, these are not implemented in all human sports and are also more invasive than urine samples. Urine sampling is prefered by athletes as well. A sample preparation method including urine would be a promising extension to ADOPE. However, with the current method our test is already applicable to be used in many athletic disciplines.

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," removed the barriers of entry into the world of synthetic genetic production, thereby not only establishing a comprehensive database of operons and their interactions with one another, but also enabling new, novel discoveries between operons in new, novel ways.
Enabling young scientists to enter the field of synthetic biology means nothing if they are unable to generate data of some significance, but it is important to understand that SBiDer enables just that.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started the Living Foundries project to fund many scientific endeavors to aid in the transformation of biology into an engineering endeavor by pursuing biological projects with efficiency and efficacy and establishing the technical means for other scientists to do so. DARPA funds projects in the hope that some will aid in the government in its continual pursuit of national security. One recent project to emerge from the Living Foundries project is called 1,000 Molecules , aimed at building a “scalable, integrated, rapid design and prototyping infrastructure for the facile engineering of biology.” SBiDer itself meets these criteria by aiding users in the pursuit of novel circuits by combining operons in previously unimagined ways, but it also allows others to complete projects that fall within this criteria as well. One such project that would have benefitted from the service that the SBiDer application provides is the Spider Silk project from the Lewis lab. The project focused on genetically engineering E. Coli to produce spider silk in mass quantities to be potentially used in protective equipment similar to kevlar. Their polymer relies highly on arabinose, which is a species with many connections within the web of SBiDer database.
The SBiDer application has a variety of potential uses within the synthetic biology community. The cultivation of algae for biofuels is an inefficient process that could be aided by genetically engineered colonies that produce high lipid content but also grow efficiently in culture could drastically reduce international dependence upon fossil fuels.
Synthetic biology also has the potential for significant impacts in the field of agriculture. Drought resistant wheat has made the year-round cultivation of wheat a possibility, and has made cheap food for many available. Of the potential inhibitors to proper and sustained crop growth, drought is the most prohibitive. By reducing the dependence of crops on water, food production could be expanded to previously unexplored regions. The ability of our application to accept new operons to our database means that the wide acceptance and use of the SBiDer application will enable projects such as the drought tolerance of plants to build on the success of previous endeavors and to integrate information from other synthetic biology projects.

Silk Functionalization: Developing the Next Generation of High Performance Fibers
Background
Abstract
Silk fibers possess the potential to be transformed into functional biomaterials that can be exploited in an array of biomedical applications, from aiding nanoscale drug delivery to simulating medical sutures. However, traditional methods of incorporating functional domains into fibers involve difficult, costly, and time-consuming processes. We propose an in vitro, co-spinning method to quickly and efficiently functionalize silk fibers. In essence, we spin a mixture of wild-type silk dope spiked with a small volume of functional domain. This functional domain which will bind to the native silk proteins when co-spun, thereby incorporating itself into the final synthetic fiber. To ensure proper binding of our functional domain, we created a co-spinning module. This module is a genetic construct consisting of our gene of interest flanked on either side by the N and C terminal domains of Bombyx mori (silkworm silk). When co-spun, the termini on our synthetic protein will bind to the respective termini in the native silk proteins, thereby functionalizing the fiber. Our goal is to develop, optimize and experimentally validate our co-spinning module, and assess its potential as a scalable and powerful tool to manufacture silk fibers with an array of functional capacities.

Introduction
Native silk fibers exhibit great tensile strength, elasticity, and flexibility. These mechanical properties, coupled with the non-immunogenic behavior of silk proteins, render silk fibers a worthy candidate in the realm of biomedical applications. Due to the potential of these fibers as a vehicle for nanoscale drug delivery or a scaffold for tissue engineering, there is much interest in attaching domains onto these fibers to"

It’s essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. Based on the growth model which built by BNU-CHINA team, we gathered the data of sunshine, water temperature, nutrient content in water and so on from various papers. Meanwhile, SCUT-China A team helped us to test the real temperature in Guangzhou which has many problems about mosquitoes.
Based on the historical data and growth model, we predicted the growth curve of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in various environment. And we summarize the typical results to guide people to use our product easier."

They argued that biology students may have operation mistakes so that these bacteria could separate into environment and cause danger. We explained that we had a serious trainning to prevent any mistake during experiments. Furthermore, any biomaterial in lab must be treated before entering environment.
GMOs are popular in US, they usually have better properties. However, more and more people concern about the safety of genetically modified food, though some authentic organization such as FDA or WHO announced GM foods are absolutely safe. We wanted to find Chinese people’s views on GM foods, thus we ask them question 5, 6, 7 and 8.
Question 10
Which foods do you think are genetically modified? Please choose one or more.>
你认为哪种/哪些食品是转基因食品？请选择一个或多个选项。
We listed many genetically modified foods, which were obtained from internet. Results were that the majority of people know the soybean was GMO as well as anti-virus pimento. While, less than half of people considered that cherry tomato, which means many people still did not it is genetically modified. Particularly, only a few people thought the potato with smooth surface as GMO, but most of people did not know. In conclusion, we thought Chinese people could distinguish some common GMOs, however some they could not. Therefore, more information about genetically modified foods should be provided to public.
Question 11
Have you bought and eaten genetically modified food?
你曾经购买并食用过转基因食品吗？
We found that about 44% of people had bought and eaten the GM foods while only 4 people clearly knew that they never bought or ate any GM foods. We were surprised found that over a half of people were not sure they ate GM foods. Reasons for that is GM foods were not obviously labeled in China or they usually ignore the label.
Question 12
Why did you chose them? Please choose one or more.
为什么你会选择它们？请选择一个或多个选项。
Most of people thought that GM foods had good looking so they choose them. Many people thought they were delicious and contained additional nutrition. Also, many people were curious about GMOs and never saw them before. However, some people chose GM foods because the foods were cheap and no organic food was available. Additionally, a few people thought GM food could be preserved long time and had other better properties.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#HBK_-_-_TEXT.html,"0.75 and 3 days. An increase in EPO concentration shortens the marrow transit time of reticulocytes.
Once reticulocytes are released from the bone marrow and enter the blood, they mature into erythrocytes (red blood cells) within 1-3 days. Reticulocytes have a hemoglobin content of around 27.5 ± 2.8 pg per cell and, red blood cells have a hemoglobin content of around 26.4 ± 2.4 pg per cell ( Fishbane et al. 1997 ). Due to the similar ability of blood reticulocytes and red blood cells to carry oxygen, when red blood cells are discussed, we refer to both blood reticulocytes and mature red blood cells.  The lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs) in healthy human adults is about 120 days before their components are recycled by microphages ( Jandl 1987 ). Over the course of this time a small number of RBCs die due to random daily breakdown or, internal or external bleeding. This is taken into account with a small apoptosis rate for RBCs. Adults have a red blood cell count ranging from about 20 to 30 trillion. Women have a blood cell count range of 3.5-5.5 trillion cells per liter, while men have a range of 4.3-5.9 trillion cells per liter ( Dean 2005 ). The average red blood cell count is estimated to be 24.98 trillion by Lichtman et al. 2005 . The entire process, from stem cell to red blood cell recycling by microphages, takes 141 days.
The endogenous release of EPO is inversely related to the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. The partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is proportionally related to the number of circulating red blood cells. An increase in the red blood cell population in blood will decrease endogenous EPO production. If the concentration of EPO in the blood falls below a certain level (9.8 mU/ml in the case of this model), neocytolysis is triggered. Neocytolysisis the selective lysis of young red blood cells by the body to allow it to decrease its red blood count at a higher rate and reach the desired partial pressure of oxygen in the blood.
The series of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe red blood production was modeled with a simplified linear age population method which provided similar accuracy to more computationally intensive PDE solvers. The red blood cell production"

Feb - Mar :
Studying about iGEM, and the past software teams' projects.
Apr - May :
Decided to take part in “May Festival”, our university's festival with team UT-Tokyo, we talk about the software exhibited at that time.
Gamification -- turn non-game concepts into game -- is our main theme, because we think it is important to attract people who are not interested in synthetic biology to enjoyable games!
And after discussions, we create the “Memory Game”. This game uses BioBrick-like materials.(-> you can play it here )
This colorful game gathers visitors' attentions.
Jun - Jul :
Talking after talking.
We gather and talk about our projects a lot.
What we should create? What is its feature?
Aug - Sep :
Program the software, receive feedback from other teams as well as members, and improve.
On August 13th, we participate “iGEM JAPAN exchange meet-ups” and make a presentation.
And now, we prepare for the asia Jamboree.

Ninth meeting - Conclusion and ethics
Finally, we discussed in our last meeting about the implications of our epistemological analysis for the synthetic biology and for society. In addition we studied different ethical approaches and tried to apply them to the products of synthetic biology ([17],[18],[25],[26]). Many of the approaches failed to justify if the synthesised entities have a moral status or not, revealing the necessity of novel bioethical theories. Some of our team members sympathises with Sune Holm’s biocentric view, because he also refers to the organisational account of biological functions for the foundation of his position ([18],[26]). Some other team members believe that the notion of a ‘natural purpose’ and the naturalisation of teleology and normativity (as the organisational account does) need further examination.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," for Startups Program. The goal of the program is to help early-stage startups to take advantage of the cloud and get resources to quickly launch their idea on google platforms.
This was a wonderful opportunity for us as we were already using google platform to train or Generative Adversarial Networks for novel protein generation. The problem was that the training was very resource intensive and we did not have enough finances run it for a long time.
So, as the partnership between Startup Lithuania and Google has begun, we have submitted an motivational and strategic application to Startup Lithuania.
Soon after, we have received the sponsorship and were extremely happy we can accelerate our research on generative adversarial networks for unique catalytic biomolecule creation.
Protection of the Intellectual Property (IP)
As we are planning to commercialize our solution after the iGEM, we have had to carefully consider on how to protect our work throughout the iGEM year, yet still provide ourselves and other teams the full open-source iGEM experience. For this reason, we have strategized to submit a patent application on CAT-Seq system just before the biological part submission date.
There are some things we also plan to keep as a trade secret (for everything that will be developed after iGEM). For example, it would be smart to keep the connection between our experimental CAT-Seq pipeline and computational Artificial Intelligence pipeline a trade secret. That is because it would be very hard to protect it as a patent. That’s because here would be virtually no way to determine who would be using it, if it would be published as a patent. In contrast, it could be kept as a trade secret for a long time.
Right before the part submission deadline we have successfully submitted a national patent application. Writing the application was extremely challenging for us, as it was the first time for everyone. For that reason we have consulted with the IP department of our sponsors Thermo Fisher Scientific, which have helped us immensely to prepare a solid application. We plan to expand our patent application to USA and to the rest of Europe shortly after the iGEM competition ends.
A short iGEM guide on protecting IP using patents
As we have spent a large amount of time considering and planning the best ways to carefully protect our IP, while still being an active, we thought that this collected knowledge would be useful for the future iGEM teams.
1. A patent is basically a right to prevent others from manufacturing, using or selling your invention. They are very important in biotechnology industry as it takes a long time and to develop a novel product or technology and, also, the cost of that development is extremely"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

Impact of iGem:
Renewable energy resources are increasingly in demand. Current mechanical systems such as a combustion engine are not as efficient as biological systems such bacteria.  Using biological systems as a template for mechanical systems may allow for a potentially efficient production of energy. Hydrogen has the greatest potential for clean, renewable energy because it produces only pure water emissions from a fuel cell.  The UC Merced iGEM team hopes to impact the field of biofuels by producing hydrogen gas through E. coli using the dark fermentation pathway to increase hydrogen yield, thereby generating hydrogen through a renewable source that is widely available to any biological laboratory. This experiment aims to lessen the impact of greenhouse gasses by proving a potential renewable source of clean energy derived from bacteria.

We received the Bronze Medal at this years Jamboree!
Dalhousie’s iGEM team has sufficiently met all of the criteria to achieve gold this year. First, to achieve bronze status, we have completed all necessary paperwork, and intend on sending nine members to the iGEM jamboree. We also have completed all deliverables, including a wiki with proper attribution page, safety forms, and have prepared a twenty-minute presentation for the jamboree. Finally, we participated in an inter-lab study which compared the expression of a GFP between promoters. Next to achieve silver, we have successfully characterized one of our biobricks: beta-xylanase. This novel beta-xylanase from the microbiome of the porcupine that has never before been sequenced was successfully shown to be able to be expressed in the pET26b(+) expression system in BL21 DE3 E. coli via a Coomassie Blue total protein stain. Taking a step further, we also sought to characterize the enzymatic activity of the protein via cleavage of its substrate conjugated to a fluorophore. As the fluorophore was released we were able to calculate relative light units given off compared to empty vector. We found that the protein was not able to cleave under the experimental conditions, most likely due to the protein being designed for an anaerobic environment while the experiment was conducted in an aerobic environment, possibly affecting protein folding or function.  Collaborations were done with several other teams, including University of Waterloo, University of Toronto and University of Calgary. With Waterloo, we provided our cloning expertise and assisted in designing primers, in exchange, they trained our members in metagenomic library construction. With Toronto, we provided information about our team for their podcast, in exchange they filled out our questionnaire on science communication. With Calgary, we summarised our work for their newsletter, while they provided a platform for Canadian iGEM teams to explain their projects. For our human practices, we interviewed many experts on science communication and enticing industries to adopt our technology. To achieve gold, we decided to integrate our human practices and improve a part from a previous project. To integrate our human practices, we incorporated"

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", phytoene synthase (PSY) is involved in carotenoids biosynthesis. (Rodríguez-Villalón, Gas and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2009). Carotenoids are isoprenoids essential for plant life and human health, working as antioxidant molecules. Epidemiological studies correlates lack of carotenoid consumption with different diseases related with oxidative stresses and chronic disorders. Induced expression of PSY-encoding genes in transgenic plants results in increased carotenoid levels. However, constitutive expression of PSY-gene causes dwarfism in transgenic tomatoes, interfering in both behavior and development of the plant.
HOW CAN WE COMMUNICATE WITH PLANTS?
In our work, we demonstrate that not only delivering orders into plants is feasible but also that plants are able to notify us of any change in their status. A leaf’s colour change apprises us whether plants are affected by any stress through our Colour Code System. Thus, we resolved to control biotic and abiotic stresses using a modular and orthogonal genetic AND gate.
TOGGLE SWITCH
Genetic switches allow biological systems to process information of a determined stimulus in order to produce a desired biological response. To date, different synthetic and biostable genetic toggle switch designs with the ability to flip between stable states have been reported. As a cellular memory unit, the continued presence of the inductor is not required in order to keep the toggle in one state or another (Gardner, Cantor & Collins, 2000).
Here, we report a genetic toggle switch as an ideal system to allow an easy spatiotemporal manipulation of gene expression that is tuneable, reversible and repeatable. ΦC31 is a serine recombinase with the ability of performing a site-specific recombination between two attachment sites attP and attB (Keravala et al., 2006). After recognition process, site-specific recombinases cut off DNA strands (within recognition sequence) and perform a chain exchange with a subsequent religation to complete recombination event without addition or removal of nucleotides (Figure 2).
For that reason, once ΦC31 mediates recombination between attP and attB, the recombinant sites (attL and attR) are produced. This reaction proceeds exclusively in a unidirectional manner because PhiC31 integrase is unable to synapse attL and attR sites per se. However, a recombination directionality factor (RDF) was identify recently to reverse the recombinase action and now, the activation or inactivation of any"

Project goal: to genetically modify a phage capable of suppressing toxin production in C. difficile by integrating our genetic constructs into its genome. We are using a phage known to infect strains of C. difficile called phiSBRC. The genome of phiSBRC will be packaged with constructs to suppress toxin production either via a CRIPSRi (dead-Cas9) approach or via asRNA. The asRNA parts were created to target the two well characterised C. difficile toxins, TcdA and TcdB. These toxins are responsible for the characteristic symptoms of C. difficile infection. The parts were constructed in such a way that they targeted both toxins simultaneously because both toxins have been shown to have independent roles.
The asRNA parts are downstream of a PCac_thl promoter and a PCsp_fdx promoter. Between, the promoter-asRNA pairs, there is a transcriptional terminator (fdx). As a result of GusA and GFP assays, we determined that PCac_thl promoter was the strongest promoter, followed by PCsp_fdx promoter in C. difficile. Together, the basic parts produced our composite part.
Longer asRNAs give a higher degree of suppression but generally have more unwanted off-target effects which could be due to increased similarity with other mRNA transcripts. As the amount of DNA that phiSBRC can package is limited shorter asRNAs would be more desirable. As a result, we created two versions of the composite part which we named ‘asRNA Construct One’ (BBa_K2715007) and ‘asRNA Construct Two’ (BBa_K2715008). For each part we varied the length so that ‘asRNA Construct Two’ had 26 more base pairs complementary to the toxin gene mRNA than ‘asRNA Construct One’."

In order to make a further analysis on stability of the system, sensitivity of parameters, feedback factors-we manipulate all the arguments and parameters to make them dimensionless. Analysis of this part is crucial since parameters in vivo experiment may be different and even at odds with modeling ones but a proper dimensionless can reveal the mathematical essence of our model.

General Remarks
1. Prof. Skerra recommended to stick to a consistent structure when presenting research results.
Short summary of what you are about to say (e.g. ""AlcR is a simple two component system from aspergilus nidulans which can be induced with ethanol"")
Give detailed information, such as: nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, Link to PDB-entry, ...
Last but not least, Your personal view & comments
Please make sure to update your entries to match this structure
2. There are some general arguments in favor of our project idea. One of them is, that the application of genetically modified yeast should be legal, because beer is filtered anyway, so no GMOs would be released from the closed system.
Promoters
Ethanol-inducible Promoters
KlADH4-Promoter
The information given in our wiki was presented. The main question discussed was whether this system works specifically (similar to the lac-operon) or unspecifically (similar to a general stress response). If the system works specifically, it is unlikely that the KlADH4 promoter is going to work in S. cerevisiae, because in this case, an unknown specific transcription factor is most likely involved which is not present in s. cerevisiae. If the system works unspecific, we thought that only general stress factors and transcription factors are involved. In this case, chances are that KlADH4 can work in s. cerevisiae,"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," there was no part available in the registry consisting of promoter, RBS, GFP coding sequence and terminator Therefore, we constructed five new composite parts to provide single complete biobricks for GFP expression. These new parts were characterized and show a bright fluorescence, according to their promoter strength. All in all, our new parts provide a ready-to-go expression device for green, yellow, or cyan fluorescence, which can be very usefull for future iGEM teams.
Coating the cell in polysilicate using silicatein
Introduction
For both the biolaser and the biolenses we need a coating of polysilicate, biological glass, around the cell. For the biolaser this glass will form the cavity that will enable the cells to emit laser-like light. For the biolens, the glass will give optical properties for the cell. E. coli is intrinsically not able to coat itself in polysilicate. However, upon transformation of the silicatein-α gene, originating from sponges, it is possible to coat the bacterium in a layer of polysilicate (Müller et al., 2008; Müller et al. 2003) . Therefore, we are transforming E. coli with silicatein-α. We test the use of two different silicateins, one originating from the marine sponge Suberites domuncula (Müller, 2011) and one originating from the marine sponge Tethya aurantia (Cha et al., 1999) . We express the enzyme in three different ways. First of all, we expressed the gene from S. domuncula (Part K1890000 ) and see if the enzyme is transported outside the cell as described by Müller et al, 2008 . Furthermore, we express a fusion of silicatein from T. aurantia to the trans-membrane protein OmpA (outer membrane protein A) from E. coli to anchor the silicatein to the membrane (Part K1890002 ) (Curnow, Kisailus, & Morse, 2006; Francisco et al. 1992) , which might make coating the cell specifically in polysilicate more efficient. We also express a fusion of silicatein from S. domuncula to the transmembrane Ice Nucleation Protein (INP) from Pseudomonas syringae (Part K1890001 ), a popular protein for membrane fusions (Kim & Yoo, 1998) . Using these different approaches we expect to coat the cell in polysil"

Analyzing the other Biobricks, we found that the strains with less expression of the constitutive promoter are those ones with higher expression when we use the Ptet promoter (but JM109 and BB1), which agree with our prediction.
Orthogonality
Plasmid dynamics have been studied exhaustively over these years using mathematical models: from how plasmid growth is regulated to plasmid partitioning after cell division. However, little is known about how two identical plasmids interact with each other. This part of our modelling project aims to shed light upon this issue using previous models of ColE1 plasmids and the properties of two different plasmids with same origin of replication when these are introduced in a cell. We employed both deterministic and stochastic models to try to answer whether two plasmids behave independently, and developed some approximations to highlight important features of the system.
Deterministic model
This model is taken from [16]. Here, plasmid levels are regulated both by an RNA molecule that inhibits plasmid replication and by the dilution of plasmids as a result of cell growth and division:  $$ \frac{d P}{dt} = r \cdot P \cdot R(s) - \frac{\log 2}{\tau} \cdot P, $$  $$ \frac{d s}{dt} = \alpha \cdot P - \beta \cdot s, $$  where $P$ is the number of plasmids, $s$ is the number of RNA inhibitors, $r$ is the plasmid growth rate, $\tau$ is the cell growth rate, $\alpha$ is the RNA inhibitor synthesis rate , $\beta$ is the RNA inhibitor decay rate and $R(s)$ is the repression effect of RNA inhibitor with  $$ R(s) = \frac{1}{(1+\frac{s}{s_0})^n},$$ where $s_0$ is the value of RNA inhibitor necessary to repress half of the replication events and $n$ is the cooperativity. Plasmid levels are regulated both by a negative feedback and by cell growth. If we consider several plasmids, we get
$$ \frac{d P_i}{dt} = r_i \cdot P_i \cdot R(s) - \frac{\log 2}{\tau} \cdot P_i,$$  $$ \frac{d s}{dt} = \alpha \cdot \sum \limits_{i=1}^n{P_i} - \"
Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Respire RESPIRE, National Association for the Preservation and Improvement of Air Quality, is an association of citizens, founded in February 2011, dedicated to the improvement of air quality. She specialized in understanding the issues related to air pollution in France and Europe, be they political, economic, social and health. It builds on existing scientific and public data as well as regulations to inform, communicate, develop technical tools and build advocacy. The 31st July, we met Sébastien Vray, the president of this association to discuss our project and better understand the issues of air pollution in France.
French Ministry of Environment On August 8th, 2017, we met Mr. Hubert Holin, in charge of air quality at the Ministry of the Environment. We introduced him to iGEM, our project, and the application scenario we envisioned. M. Holin comforted us in our idea of ​​targeting indoor pollution. Indeed, he said that to clean the outside air, it is better to fight the sources than to propose a solution downstream. He also described the energy autonomy of our product as a great advantage for some emerging countries, where access to electricity is not always guaranteed. He told us that it would be interesting to have a first commercial phase (in the scenario, we considered rather a free distribution) on a smaller scale (10,000 copies for example). Such an approach would show the politicians that there is an appetite for the general public and that there is a real solution to the problem of indoor air pollution. By mapping the pollutants, we could also sound the alarm. Finally, Mr. Holin gave us valuable advice on how we could get funding for our project.

It pushes the structures of Ile-de-France and develops employment and the economy around the fight against pollution.

Jacqueline is a year two student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Apart from being a junior member in iGEM team, she is also the secretary of the team. Claiming to have above-standard laboratory skills, she performed various kinds of experiments. Quite often, she will work in the laboratory from 9am to 6pm. Unsurprisingly, she likes to attend every meeting and make reminders and minutes for every meeting. EVERY MEETING! (To those who don’t read her emails, be careful). Enjoying iGEM competition, she likes to perform site directed mutagenesis and Gibson assembly daily. Rapping is one of her precious abilities as well as stalking others. Indeed she is the number ONE stalker in the team. Although she tried very hard to shed this title, the fact that she is a stalker will not change.

Background
The Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study is one of the largest collaborative studies ever performed in synthetic biology, featuring the work of iGEM teams across the world. Each annual iteration of the study is dedicated to identifying and rectifying sources of variability in measurements and protocols across lab settings. This year’s edition primarily focused on standardizing absorbance and fluorescence measurements of GFP-expressing bacteria, correcting for human and machine variability across labs.
Per the iGEM protocol, we transformed New England Biosciences 5-alpha E. coli with the eight following plasmids from the iGEM Distribution Kit 7:
Positive Control: BBa_I20270
Negative Control: BBa_R0040
Test Device 1: BBa_J364000
Test Device 2: BBa_J364001
Test Device 3: BBa_J364002
Test Device 4: BBa_J364007
Test Device 5: BBa_J364008
Test Device 6: BBa_J364009
Bacterial colonies were grown either in liquid cultures or plated with Luria Bertani (LB) broth and chloramphenicol; Each plasmid backbone confers bacterial resistance to chloramphenicol (pSB1C3 backbone).
Calibration: 3 Experiments
1. OD600 reference point
The purpose of the first calibration is to establish a conversion from “absorbance at 600nm” (Abs600) data in our 96 well plates into an “optical density at 600nm” (OD600) measurement, as would be obtained in a standard spectrophotometer. “Such conversion is necessary because plate reader measurements of absorbance are volume dependent; the depth of the fluid in the well defines the path length of the light passing through the sample, which can vary slightly from well to well.”   To do so, we first measured the absorbance values of LUDOX-S30 versus deionized H2O. Reading the LUDOX-S30 absorbance value from our spectrophotometer, we subtract"

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Presentation_-_-_TEXT.html," exoglucanase, attacks the end of a chain, producing disaccharides called cellobiose.
Another type, endoglucanase, cuts the chain in the middle.
We can immediately see that these two facts mean the enzymes work best together: the enzyme that cuts chains in the middle also produces new chain ends for the other enzyme to attack.
Now consider the following:
Exoglucanase is inhibited by the presence of cellobiose.
A third enzyme, β-glucosidase, cuts cellobiose into glucose.
Here then we have another case of enzymes working best together.
We constructed computer models to investigate the above phenomena.
C
[Slide: C animation]
Our first model is an ad hoc model written in C. Here cellulose is placed on a two dimensional grid, and cellulases move over the grid. There are two simulations: in one, the enzymes move about freely. In the other, enzymes travel in triplets, each triplet containing one of each enzyme.
The dark regions show areas where cellulose has been broken down to free glucose. As can be seen, the synergistic model breaks down cellulose faster...
[Slide: C graph]
... and here's a graph of the results. What we're most interested in are the blue lines, which represent the amount of glucose produced in the synergistic and non-synergistic systems.
This model is very simplistic but does show that the synergy effect makes sense.
Kappa
A more sophisticated model uses the Kappa modelling language. This includes two models - one preliminary model in Kappa, and another model in Spatial Kappa. Kappa is a language for running stochastic simulations of biochemical systems. It uses probabilistic kinetic rates to advance simulation. The preliminary model was developed based on Kadam et al (2004) and generates similar looking graphs for both synergistic and non-synergistic systems:
[Slide: Normal Kappa graph]
The problem is that Kappa cannot see the advantages of synergy since it has no concept of space. Therefore we used Spatial Kappa by Team Edinburgh 2010 (Donal Stewart). The added functionality means we could develop a model where the enzymes were kept close together, and compare it to one where they were not:
[Slide: Pacman animation]
This model proved quite scalable - we can manipulate initial conditions, add more cellulose - emulating a biorefinery.
Most importantly - it shows synergy (dependent mostly on diffusion rate).

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China_-_-_TEXT.html," Its appearance was designed as a carton train. We named it Forest Train and the name meant that its destination was our rose forest. Anyone “takes” it (that means he/she put a plate in Forest Train) would see beautiful rose produced by E. coli.
PROOF OF CONCEPT & DEMONSTRATE
For more precise control of the color, we explored the relationship between fluorescence intensity and the wavelengths and intensity of input light using ELIASA (microplate reader) and flow cytometry. After quantitative analysis, we could predict and control all kinds of colors our bacteria would produce. Our concept of mixing color on the bacteria cells were also proved to be reasonable and provided a convenient way for scientists and artists to create new colors and artworks.
To finally demonstrate our project, we constructed a plasmid containing mrfp, gfp, and bmst1 genes as actuators, and transformed it together with pJFR1-3 plasmids into our E. coli, which could be induced to produce red, green colors and flower fragrance by red, green, and blue light, respectively. A fragrant and vivid flower was created!
IMPROVE
We greatly improve the previous projects of KIT-Kyoto 2010 and Pairs Bettencourt 2014.We must show our respect for the projects and the teams mentioned above, because they inspired us to pay attention to the combination of art and science, and they did really good job. We wish we can prompt the people’s understanding of art and science by our project, on the basis of the wonderful works done by previous iGEM teams.
MODEL
We developed the dynamic model of the expression of our outputs, to precisely describe, predict and control the expression of the proteins and the generation of our colors. What’s more, our modelling also provided instructions for our experiments.
PARTS
We modified the plasmids we used in the RGB system and tandem expression module and submitted all the parts as a part collection to the registry. Therefore, we provided strong tools for future iGEMers to create fancy artworks and achieve precise control of multiple gene expression by light.
HUMAN PRACTICES
As Wilde conveyed in his story, the barrier and combination of art and science still remain worth discussing, so we explored in depth the relationship of art and science in the Human Practices section. One prime barrier of outstanding art and science is the stereotype of defining art as being too selfish and far from the public and science as only about reality with no emotion. We surveyed university students from science and art backgrounds, and to our surprise we found the unconventional idea that"

Imperial_College,2016,Team:Imperial College#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," visualisation strategy:
After discussions with students at the Royal College of Art about our project, we realized we were having difficulty communicating about our project with them to inspire future applications.  We developed graphics which made it easier to understand our project.  The artists we able to more easily grasp the concept of co-culture.  We realized the difficulties with science communication and creating graphics that explain foundational technologies.  We realized the importance of engaging with the public about basic scientific research to shape their future development.  Therefore, we developed a strategy to make effective visualisations to communicate about foundational technologies.
Visual Strategies
One of the key outcomes of our reflexive analysis was the development of our “Visual Strategies Experiential Guidebook”. We realized that there were many opportunities for designers and artists and sociologists and other non-specialists to have an impact                             on the future applications of our enabling technology. However, it was extremely difficult to communicate the power of our technology to these audiences. After 6 hours of official meetings and several hours of discussion with                             students and faculty at the Royal College of Art, we realized that visual media was the key to quick understanding. We refined our presentations, developing interesting graphics. We took feedback from our small audience. We                             researched best practices for the composition of graphics. We finally created visualisations that were easy for them to process and synthesize meaningful feedback. Moreover, after finally creating a visualisation that was easy                             to understand, we were astonished by some of the things they suggested. One of those things was modular phenotype engineering. This was a concept we had not considered for our project. From this experience, we decided that                             our project needed more input from non-specialists. Therefore, we compiled all of the information we had received from literature and from these artists and designers and created a visualisation guidebook. The visualisation                             guidebook has had an impact on the presentation of our project, most notably on the infographic and computer game Go-Culture we presented at the New Scientist Live in London. We included our thought process and some of the critiques we received from the artists and designers at the Royal College of Art in the book.
Some of the highlights from the book and our research were:
Choosing a compelling story that can be supported with interestingly represented graphical data
Classification and examples of visualisations in synthetic biology
Rules for compositions of graphics to create easy to follow visual hierarchies that guide viewers through a process or story without the use of extraneous arrows or other symbols
Interactive content is best for increasing comprehension and satisfaction with audiences

Send LuxO D47A in psB1AC3 Colony 2 to get sequenced
Although RD and PCR are effective means of verifying the presence of a sequence of DNA, the gold standard for verification is DNA sequencing. LuxO D47A in psB1AC3 Colony 2 was sent to the University of Calgary DNA Sequencing Facility (University Core DNA Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Primers used were VF2 (anneals near the BBK prefix on the BBK vector - used as a forward primer) and VF1 (anneals near the BBK suffix on the BBK vector - used as a reverse primer). The template was prepared such that there was 100ng/1kb of DNA (gene of interest + vector).
After analyzing the sequencing results, it was evident that luxO D47A was absent from the psB1AC3 vector.

During this extrusion, shear forces on the silk solution cause the amino acids of the proteins to align in a way that allows the strong beta sheets of the silk structure to form. Multiple proteins are similarly aligned, causing separate proteins to interact and form larger structures.[2]
We used a 21 gauge needle to load the silk dope into a 1 mL BD syringe with luer lok. We then replaced the needle with PEEK tubing of 0.127 mm inner diameter. We used a syringe pump to extrude the silk at a rate of 10 uL/min into a coagulation bath of 90% v/v isopropanol and water. After the fiber formed, we drew it out of the bath and wound it around a motorized godet to collect the fiber as it formed.

Co-spun silk after removing from the godet. A small volume (~500 uL) of dope yields a very long contiguous length of fiber, but in order to remove from the godet without inadvertently stretching the fiber, we had to cut it.
Measuring fiber diameter and fluorescence
We used an EVOS light microscope to image the fibers under white light and blue excitation light. We used ImageJ to determine fluorescence of the fiber.
Testing the composite silk
We tested our co-spun fibers in an Instron model 5564 table mounted system with a 10kN load cell. To prepare our fibers for testing, we mounted them on cardstock frames with 10 mm gauge length. We then loaded the carded fibers into the Instron with pneumatic grips and cut the sides of the cardstock frame. We then had the machine extend the fiber at a rate of 0.1 mm/min and measure the tensile force of the fiber.

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara_-_-_TEXT.html," olfactory organs of Drosophila melanogaster, and it is used as a model system to investigate the biophysical nature of alcohol-protein interactions at alcohol concentrations that produce intoxication in humans. In this study, by using NMR spectroscopy, they have identified the regions of  LUSH that show increased conformational stability on binding alcohols. These residues primarily line the alcohol-binding pocket. A direct measure of the degree of stability that alcohol imparts on LUSH has been provided. LUSH was originally identified as responsible for mediating an avoidance response to short-chain n-alcohols.
The general structure of odorant binding proteins consists of six α-helices surrounding a hydrophobic ligand- binding pocket which differs in size and shape between each protein. All these odorant binding proteins have a set of six cysteines that form three conserved disulfide bonds. In the study, by observing the X-ray crystal structures of LUSH-alcohol complexes, it was found that alcohol binds to a single site in the protein formed by a network of concerted hydrogen-binding residues located at one end of hyrophobic pocket. This binding site has some sequence and/or structural similarities to regions of several ligand gated ion channels (LGICs) that have previously been implicated in inferring sensitivity to alcohol. It is hypothesized in the study that the alcohol-binding site in LUSH may represent a more general structural motif for functionally relevant alcohol-binding sites in proteins. The characterization of the effects of n-alcohols on the structure and stability of LUSH is presented. Also, in the absence of ligand, LUSH exists in vitro in a partially unstructured state and binding of alcohols shifts the solution conformation to a more compact folded state which is accompanied by an increase in the overall protein stability. Those regions of the protein that show the largest changes in local dynamics on binding alcohol have been identified and it have been shown that these are predominantly associated with the residues that line the alcohol-binding pocket. The results provide a quantitative measure of the ability of short-chain alcohols to stabilize protein structure at physiological relevant concentrations.

Lab Project
Our lab project focused on the enhancement of a mechanosensitive channel called TRPC5. Since TRP channel had been found hair cells in ears [4] , our work may enlighten future hearing impairment therapies. In our project, we are developing a modified TRPC5 by random mutagenesis at specific region of the channel. With the accumulation effects of random mutagenesis (error-prone PCR), we may generate the TRPC5 mutant that has the highest fitness of the protein landscape [5] .
For a more detailed explanation of our project, see our home :)

Lane 4 is top10   control group, lane 3 is constitutive GvpA and GFP generator, lane 5 is constitutive GvpC and GFP generator. The upper   white boxes are in the position about 26KD are GFP protein (25.8KD). The lower white box in the position of about 20KD is   GvpC-20 (20KD). Because the MW(molecular weight) of GvpA protein is too small, it’s very difficult to see it on the SDS-  polyacrylamide gel. But the expression of GFP suggests it may be expressed. Some papers say that GvpA is difficult to see is that GvpA is too hydrophobic to run out of sample hole.
Figure1.The result of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lane 4 is top10 control group, lane 3 is constitutive GvpA and GFP generator, lane 5 is constitutive GvpC and GFP generator. The upper white boxes are in the position about 26KD are GFP protein (25.8KD). The lower white box in the position of about 20KD is GvpC-20 (20KD).
Because the GvpA protein can’t be seen on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we wanted to use GFP to detect the expression of GvpA. We use a polycistron of gvpA(gvpC) and gfp to detect the RFU. We can see that, the RFU of Gvp and GFP Generator is about 2000, and the RFU of Gvp and GFP Generator is about 4000, while top 10 is about 0 as control. First, the RFU of these parts are rather high. Second, the E.Coli with these two plasmids can float. Third, we can see GvpC on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. So, we can see the two parts can express Gvp Protein and work well.
Figure2.We can see that, the RFU of Gvp and GFP Generator is about 2000, and the RFU of Gvp and GFP Generator is about 4000, while top 10 is about 0 as control.

Introduction to Synthetic Promoter Libraries
Modulation of gene expression of i.e. cellular enzyme activities (Solem and Jensen 2002), as well as regulation of transcription are amongst some of the areas where SPLs are currently being used. SPL provides an alternative method for gene regulation compared to older methods, namely those of gene knockouts and strong over expression. These two methods are usually based upon apparent rate limiting steps within metabolic pathways (Jensen and Hammer 1998).
When working with gene regulation, it is important to elucidate where expression levels are optimal for the given gene being worked on. Under these specifications it is essential to be able to have slight increments in expressional strength when attempting to optimize gene expression. This can be achieved by the usage of an SPL, where the variability in strengths can be achieved by either randomizing the spacer sequences, namely the 17 bases that reside between the -35 and -10 consensus regions, and/or some of the bases within the consensus regions, being the -35 and -10 regions.
The spacer sequences that surround the consensus regions contribute significantly to the strengths of promoters (Hammer et al. 2006). In our design, we decided to both randomize the spacer sequences as well as two bases in both consensus regions as seen in Figure 1 below. N stands for 25% each of A, C, G and T, while S stands for 50% each of C and G, and W stands for 50% A and T.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"
