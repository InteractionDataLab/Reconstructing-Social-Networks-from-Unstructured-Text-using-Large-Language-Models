Overview
On July 25th 2014, the iGEM team SCU-China from SiChuan University went to our school and communicate with us. We exchanged our project to each other. We leaded them visit our lab, we talked about the school life in our school respectively. The number of people from SCU is 6, and we have a big lunch at noon.
nap chat at the outer room of lab
we sit together to chat, and briefly talk about our project and experimental schedule. They were astonished that we chose plant as our target, cause the lifecycle of plant is a little bit long. And they said they chose microorganism as targeted object.
visit of our lab
After the chatting, we led them visit our incubator room where reposed our transformed tobacco. We introduce the transformed tobacco to them, and briefly give an account of the experimental schedule of our project. We all felt a little bit nervous if we can finish our project at the end of September.

RESULT: EtnR1 was characterised as binding to EtnP, and so functions as a likely transcription factor for regulating ethylene metabolism.
Figure 9. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for EtnP DNA. The 250 bp region of EtnP was PCR amplified and 100 ng of DNA incubated with 6 mg of protein. The protein-DNA mixtures were run on a 3% agarose gel at 150 V for 100 minutes and stained with Gel Green overnight for visualisation. Lane 1: NEB 100 bp ladder. Lane 2: EtnP DNA only. Lane 3: EtnR1 protein only. Lane 4: EtnR1 protein and EtnP DNA. Lane 5: BSA protein and EtnP DNA.
Next Steps
Given more time, we would like to fully investigate the rest of the proposed regulatory system - specifically the interaction between EtnR2 and ethylene, and the interaction between EtnR1 and EtnR2. We would plan to use a phosphorylation assay and a pulldown assay to test these respectively, as outlined in Figure 5.
Leading on from our characterisation of EtnR1, we would aim to confirm that it acts as a transcription factor, and investigate whether it acts as a positive or negative regulator. Lastly, we would like to examine the strengths of putative promoters from other ethylene-metabolising strains of Mycobacterium, and determine whether the NBB4 system is homologous in other strains.

iGEM Columbia
Our iGEM team collaborated with Columbia University’s team to create an anonymous survey focused on understanding the perspectives people may have on specified treatments for illnesses. This was done to analyze the possible perceptions people may have concerning our treatments and the resulting products. The surveys were distributed primarily through an online format among individuals with differing factors such as age, gender, and educational background. To ensure responses relating to both teams’ projects, we decided to include questions that prompted individuals to consider different areas of treatment. Our team included questions pertaining to whether people would be willing to receive antimicrobial peptide treatments, while Columbia’s team included questions specifically"

ABOUT LAB AND HKU
We are the undergraduate team from the University of Hong Kong. Established in 1992, The University of Hong Kong is the oldest institute of higher learning in Hong Kong. Built nearby the sea, the medical campus has a different location from HKU main campus, and is where the LKS Faculty of Medicine locates.
During the project, we use the teaching lab from School of Biomedical Sciences, LKS Faculty of Medicine to carry out most of our experiment. We also used the research lab of the Biochemisty Department for the procedures that requires advances machines and apparatuses."
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#testing_-_-_TEXT.html," cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 8].
Figure 1: Small Strongyles.
Symptoms
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [5]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [9].
If farmers had the possibility to know when to treat their horses, prevention of mass rupture and other severe consequences like increased resistance development could be achieved. To reach this goal we have developed a model that (based on multiple parameters) calculates the optimal amount of treatments in a specified period. This will avoid unnecessary use of anthelmintics by raising the awareness in farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.
Current Methods for detection
Current Methods for detection
Currently the only method for detecting/counting how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires time sensitive shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing; treating their horses regardless of need which contributes to the resistance problem [10].
Resistance Development
Resistance Development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance [2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].

Seeker Tools
Right from the start, we decided that we were going to develop software tools to make the work of our team easier. We also wanted to share the tools with the iGEM Community to help everyone else, too!
We made two different Seeker brand tools (BioBrick Seeker and Team Seeker) for making the research part of iGEM projects a little easier. Both have tens of thousands of lines of data to search through, but the results update in real-time. Both get their content from JSON files that can be easily added to and which are completely separate from the code, so expanding the tools for the future can be done by just adding new data!
Both of the Seekers were written in JavaScript using the Angular.js library. They use Yeoman for scaffolding and deployment, and they are currently running on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a free service that handles requests very quickly, so the Seekers will stay available for the foreseeable future.
All of the code is available as open source on GitHub and is free to be reused, modified and expanded. All of our programming projects can be found through our GitHub organization Quiet Sushi Force .
Awesome work! Very nice tool for fast search through the list of parts, very much appreciated.

BioBrick Seeker
BioBrick Seeker was created to make searching for the needed BioBricks in the 2014 iGEM Distribution a bit easier. It can be used to find Bricks with a certain keyword or list all from a certain type. It even has a search for the part names to see if the Brick you need is in this year's distribution.
All of the code and installation instructions for future development are available on the BioBrick Seeker GitHub page .
BioBrick Seeker Reception
The tool was received very well and got a lot of mentions on Twitter and got even featured on the iGEM 2014 Help page. We put Google Analytics on the site to get a rough idea of where in the world the tool was actually used. It turned out that it has been used on five"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," our target demographic (14-18). In an attempt to better understand how BioMech had been received, we conducted a survey with the students. The raw data (PDFs of surveys) and the full data analysis are available upon request.
Of the 23 responses to question 7 - “Did our board game change your perception of synthetic biology? If so, how?” - 78.3% were positive answers that indicated the respondent had enjoyed the game and had learned from the game. Answers included “It helped me remember most of the information because it was fun and engaging” and “It was a fun way for learning about synthetic biology”.
The criticisms however were that it was difficult for the students to understand how the game works without having had a demonstration done in front of them, first. Because of this feedback, we aim to create instructional demonstration videos to accompany the downloadable, online version of BioMech in an attempt to make BioMech more sustainably accessible without the need for our team to be there.
We demonstrated this in a year 9 physics lesson and in both the presentation and activities with the students, we were able to highlight the physics applications alongside the biology ones. It is interesting, therefore, how well received the game was to both the teacher and the students considering that prior to our lesson with them, they might have assumed that synthetic biology is a purely biology-based field. Consequently, we want to stress that BioMech is a board game that can be, and has been, used in non-biology based lessons and we think is a great resource for teachers and students to engage with the field.
Future
Having tested the board game in the Judd School, Colyton Grammar School and two separate science fairs, as well as making BioMech available to download for free, we are looking to the future, to what we can do next. We plan on making BioMech as accessible as possible, thus are looking to create a Braille overlay version of the game, so that those people with or without sight can play simultaneously, and it not affect the game. We are also looking to make versions of BioMech suitable for those suffering for colour-blindness and have instructions written in multiple languages. We don’t want to exclude anyone from playing and using BioMech in schools, as we want to encourage any and all students to take an interest in synthetic biology.
We have also sent copies of BioMech to a number of schools in the UK and even in the US. Copies were sent to The Judd School and Colyton Grammar school, as a thank you for helping us develop BioMech throughout the progress however"

BIT-China for BNU-China
This year we collaborated with BNU-CHINA team and held a meeting on July 11st, 2015. During the meeting we exchanged our ideas and discussed on our projects. Finally, we confirmed our collaboration relationship.
Because most of BNU-CHINA’s team members were freshmen for iGEM, after the discussion, we decided to help them for parts of their gene circuits. Meanwhile, we had some difficulties in modeling and expressing functional gene NhaA and NhaB, so they offered help to solve these problems.
Fig.1 meeting with BNU-China
We helped them finish the light regulation system (Pcons+B0034+PcyA+B0034+ho1). In this system, Pcons is one of the constitutive promoters (from BBa_J23100 to BBa_J23119) which can be used to tune the expression level of expressing part and what we chose was J23100. B0034 is a kind of strong ribosome binding sites (RBS). PcyA and ho1 are two requisite genes which are required for the transformation from heme into phycocyanobilin (PCB). Ho1 will oxidize the heme group and then generate biliverdin IX alpha, and PcyA converts biliverdin IX alpha into PCB.
Fig.2 Gene circuits of light regulation system
Overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR) was used to finish their gene circuits. However, there were secondary structures in this part. So we could not get the part at first. Then we changed DNA polymerase Pfu to Primer STAR, which performs better than Pfu. Finally the light regulation system was constructed successfully.

In this period, we also had some discussions about experiments and modeling face to face. Through these discussions, we learnt more about each other and made progress together.

Fatty Acid Quantification and Cell Viability
Overview
Since the project measures fatty acid (FA) up take rate at different fatty acid concentrations, cell viability was measured to assure that cells are stable and alive in various FA concentrations. The change of FA uptake rate is expected to be affected by both the inducible and constitutive glyoxylate shunt transfected into human liver cells, respectively.
Cell Line
HepG2 cells were used for testing constitutive and inducible glyoxylate shunt by measuring change in sodium palmitate uptake rate by the cell.  Ultimately, we are testing the glyoxylate shunt inside HepG2 cells, thus it was subject of study in our cell viability test.
Cell Viability
To make sure the whole system we created works well in cells, we also have to use MTT assay to test cell viabilities in different FA concentrations. The optimal goal is to determine the range of optimal concentrations of fatty acids to introduce into HepG2 cell and achieve more than 60% viability after 24 hours incubation and/or more than 50% in 48 hours.
MTT assay description
Cell viability was measured to identify the amount of sodium palmitate that we need in the medium to do our characterization, including to make sure that the enzymes are expressed stably inside cells.  High concentration of sodium palmitate can induce cell death.  We, therefore, had to determine the concentration of sodium palmitate that is high enough to activate our promoter, but not excessive to kill our cells.
MTT assay was used to measure the cell viability. It measures the enzymatic activity of oxidoreductase enzymes that only show activity when the cells are alive. MTT, a tetrazolum dye, is redued into an insoluble formazan , giving a purple color. Organic solvent such as DMSO can be used to dissolve the formazan. Absorbance at 570 is measured"

In order to address this challenge, we measured a) a given promoter with its corresponding regulator and a different inducer molecule, b) a given promoter with an unspecific regulator and a particular inducer, c) a given promoter with both regulator and inducer being unspecific, and always included the correct combination of inducer molecule, regulator and promoter as a positive control. This gives in total 27 possible combinations. The output was assessed via sfGFP and measured in terms of fluorescence on microtiter-plate scale.
Figure 1 Each quorum sensing system is based on three components: a signaling molecule, a regulatory protein and a promoter. These elements are here ordered into three layers. Cross-talk evaluation can be done by comparing all combinations of those three elements. After collecting the experimental data of all possible pathways, we modeled their influence.
Summary of experimental results regarding quorum sensing
The following matrices serve as an overview summarizing the most significant results of our experiments to characterize crosstalk on different levels.  On the horizontal top row we see the three different inducer molecules (3OC12-HSL, 3OC6-HSL, C4-HSL). In the top left corner we see the quorum sensing promoter used for all the experiments summarized in this matrix. On the vertical axis we see the three regulators ( LuxR, LasR, RhlR ).  These matrices are giving an overview of the experimental results conducted in relation with quorum sensing and crosstalk. The graph shown in each matrix on the very top left describes the situation where the correct autoinducer molecule has bound the corresponding regulator and this complex has then induced the correct promoter.  The solid lines in the graphs show the model data , whereas the data points indicated with standard deviation show experimental data in triplicates (mean values of triplicate micro titerplate measurements).
Table 1 Crosstalk matrix for the promoter pLux ( BBa_R0062 )
In all the measurements conducted to create this matrix the promoter pLux was the basis and was induced in six different variations shown.  The dark blue points in the graph top left show the activation of gene expression when pLux is induced by 3OC6-HSL (Lux-AHL) binding to the corresponding LuxR regulator .

2. Poster Session Open to the General Public
 
We participated in a poster session held at the University of Tokyo on May 18th. iGEM teams from all over Japan gathered at this event and introduced their project to the visitors. Not only students and professors at the university, but also people without any scientific background came and listened to our projects. After introducing our projects, we asked visitors for feedbacks to make our projects better. Our central purpose in this event was to let people know what iGEM is, and to change the negative thinking about synthetic biology that many people have.

2-1 The Projects
To introduce our projects to the visitors, we made a poster for each project. Using figures, we tried our best to make it easy for people from any background to understand. Besides posters for our projects, we also made an introduction to iGEM to let more people know about it.
The five projects that we introduced at the poster session were: solar battery, treatment for pollen allergy, lie detector, Bank E. coli, and fertilizer.
 
Solar Battery
Fig. 6-1-2-2. Bacteria-using Solar Battery Poster
Solar energy is one of the alternative sources of energy widely used in the world. In this project, we made a solar battery by using photosynthetic bacteria and current generating bacteria to generate power. Wherever sunlight shines, electricity can be generated by this solar battery. It was invented and improved in several institutes, but the low efficiency and inconvenient hardware still tend to be a problem. Therefore, we tried to improve the efficiency of the existing bacteria-using solar battery to make it practical.
 
 
Treatment for Pollen Allergy
Fig. 6-1-2-3. Immunotherapy Poster
In Japan, it is said that one in five people suffers from pollen allergy. More than twenty million people suffer from symptoms, and the number is increasing every year. In order to cure this, we thought of using E. coli in immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a recently developed treatment that can completely cure the allergy. You introduce allergen into the body in very small amounts, and by gradually increasing it, you can suppress the body′s hyper-allergic"

Cytochrome_Engineering
1. Cloning of AP Cytochrome PACE: As the assembly of the AP worked, the next aim was to produce AP variants with different ORIs. To achieve this, PCRs of the backbone (all plasmid parts except the ORI and AmpR) were performed. Unfortunately problems occured, which is the reason why series of following PCRs have been performed under different conditions (different polymerases, different annealing temperatures, adapted cycler runs). After all those actions had no promising effect we assumed, that there must have been a mistake in the previous procedure.
In order to repeat the CPEC, one part (LuxAB) was still needed. So in the following PCRs were performed to amplify the missing LuxAB. This again beared problems, so different conditions were tested again (different polymerases, different primer concentrations, DMSO, Betain, different cycler runs, touch down PCR, slow ramping after denaturation)
After none of this worked, we decided to chose mNeonGreen as a reporter instead of LuxAB, as this one has already been amplified.
Now all necessary parts for the CPEC were abundant. The CPEC product was then transformed into chemically competent cells. On the next day colony PCRs have been conducted with 6 clones and simultaneously the corresponding growths were purified.
2. Cloning of SP Cytochrome PACE: In parallel to the Plaque Assys, plaque PCRs have been performed to check for the correct SP. These PCRs unfortunately did not show the correct outcome. Also new Primers have been designed and ordered, that amplify a smaller fragment of the SP making the test PCRs more efficient.
When the new primers arrived test PCRs of the phage supernatant were performed, as an inefficient PCR could not be clearly excluded as source of error at this point. As this PCR also did not show the correct bands we decided to repeat the SP assembly with new backbone template. Those templates needed to be generated first. So PCRs from SP CBX TAL were conducted. These PCRs did not lead to the desired result and were repeated with different conditions (different polymerase, DMSO, Betain, cycler run). The changed conditions helped optimize the PCRs so that the products could be isolated from the agarose gel.

The full PCSK1 product was cloned into the shipping vector. Cloning primers were not designed for PCSK1 with flanking BioBrick consensus sequences. PCSK1 was cloned into the pCR®Blunt II-TOPO® vector, provided by Invitrogen.
E. coli C2566 cultures were transformed with PCSK1- pCR®Blunt II-TOPO®. PCSK1- pCR®Blunt II-TOPO® was isolated  from transformation cultures and used as a template for PCR amplification of PCSK1 with our insulin primers that contained the BioBrick consensus sequence.
Two transformations were performed using Escherichia coli C2566, one with pSB1C3-Insulin and another with pSB1C3-PCSK1. Both constructs were submitted for sequencing.
Results
The products that were cloned into the shipping vector were verified by gel electrophoresis (Figure 1).
Several colonies were identified in colony screens for PCSK1 and insulin in transformants containing the shipping vector. Seen below are verification gels for PCSK1 and insulin.
Figure 1. PCR colony screen of PCSK1-pSB1C3 transformants. Note the banding in each lane at roughly 750 bp, consistent with the second fragment of PCSK1.
Figure 2. PCR colony screen of Ins-pSB1C3 transformants. Banding can be seen at roughly 333 bp, consistent with the full insulin ORF.  Sequencing data received for both PCSK1 and insulin was inconclusive.

When our project is ready to be popularized to the general public, they would love to cooperate with us. In this process, we become familiar with the operating model of some navigation companies, which make us realize what else we should do to achieve the commercial value of our project.
4.Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
Bridge PCR
Put all diluted sites and lines together into the PCR tube, forming all possible DNA fragments, or the different pathways.
DNA Ligation T4
DNA ligase is added to connect sites and lines.
DNA Gel extraction In the last two steps, gel extraction is needed to remove impurities.
PCR
Carry out PCR to amplify all fragments which begin with site 2 and end up with site 8.
Gel extraction
Carry out the gel electropheresis and the gel extraction, cutting respectively the gel volume of 200 bp, 250 bp and 350 bp.
Transformation and filtering of target genes
Import the target genes into the plasmids, deliver the plasmids into E.coli and coat the competent cells on the solid medium. Then screen out of the strains that we need in the medium containing chloramphenicol.  After the screened strains were amplified in liquid medium, purify the plasmids and identify them. The last step is to send into the company for sequencing.

Personal protective equipment
As soon as we manipulate in the lab, we have to wear the following personal protective equipment:
- A conventional lab coat, closed with long sleeves
- Closed shoes
- Gloves
- Glasses if needed (UV exposure, hot water or chemicals manipulation.)
Basic rules in a lab
We have to apply the basic safety principles into a laboratory room:
- It is forbidden to smoke in all rooms.
- It is forbidden to drink and eat in the laboratory rooms.
- It is compulsory to wear a closed lab coat in cotton.
- It is compulsory to wear closed shoes.
- Long hair must be tied back.
- Oral pipetting of any substance is prohibited in any laboratory.
There are also others precautions when working with biological organisms:
- We need to wash our hands regularly.
- It is compulsory to wear gloves except with the use of an electric burner.
- In some cases (UV light, projection risk), it is compulsory to wear protection glasses.
Different apparatus are used to work a sterile area.
Waste
Different trash containers are available in the lab:
- One for biological waste (yellow). This waste will be autoclaved before being thrown out.
- One for common waste (green or orange).
- Special waste for chemicals.
Devices and Material
We use a lot of different devices, and each one involves a particular risk. Here we described how we use this material safely to reduce risks:
Chemical storage
We have three cupboards dedicated to the different kind of chemical products we use:
- Flammable
- Acids
- Bases
Those cupboards are key-closed.
Ethidium Bromide
We have a dark room dedicated to the use of EtBr and UV. This room is key-closed and everyone entering into the room must wear gloves, glasses and lab coat. Everything which is in direct contact with something in this room has to stay here.
Two specific trash cans are dedicated to the gloves or paper and the agarose gels contaminated.
Biological safety cabinet
We use a Biological safety cabinet (FASTER – Ultrasafe) to manipulate into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms. We clean the bench of the BSC with ethanol before and after each manipulation. We also clean the BSC completely every two weeks. Because we work with fungi, we have to be very careful with the cleanliness of the BSC.

Acetic Acid
Goal: To reduce the acetic acid metabolized by microorganisms.
Achievement: The enzyme have not been successfully expressed in E. coli BL21
Part: BBa_K1919233
Introduction
Acetic acid is the metabolic product of microorganisms on foot that contributes sweat odor in foot odor. In order to reduce the acetic acid production, we utilize Succinyl-Coenzyme A (CoA): Acetate CoA-Transferase (aarC), which is derived from Acidophile Acetobacter aceti. aarC can transform succinyl coenzyme A and acetate to acetyl coenzyme A and succinate
There are two benefits owing to the metabolic pathway: First, acetic acid can be involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) rather than be discarded as waste. Second, E. coli can also use the acetic acid or acetate from outside for its growth.
Design & Result
Figure 1 shows how aarC works (Figure 1).
Figure 1
We got the coding sequence of the enzyme in the NCBI database. After codon optimization, the gene is synthesized by Synbio Technologies Co. Ltd. In order to preliminary detection and optimize subsequent experiments, we use PCR method to clone gene then use enzyme cutting and connection to load it into pET 32 vector for expression. Product detecting by SDS-PAGE method
Figure 2. Line 1 is supernate after cell disruption. Line 2 is precipitate. Line 3 is whole cell. Line 4, 5, 6 are half loading.
pET32a+ vector involves His-tag and T7 terminator. His-tag can be used for Western-blot to detect. We cloned aarC coding sequence, His-tag and T7 terminator from the pET32+ vector together by PCR.

Fig. 3-3-3-7.  The experimental result of 2008_Caltech
2008_Caltech only submitted fimE ( BBa_K137007 ) and showed data about inversion (Fig. 3-3-3-7.). 2008_Caltech wanted to determine the range of length in which fimE ( BBa_K137007 ) will function and to determine how the length affects the activities of FimE. Thus they tested how the length of the recombination site affects FimE’s ability to detect the two flanking binding sites. Therefore, GFP fluorescence / OD600 was observed in each sample in which the length of the inversion site differs.
However their data cannot be trusted completely with respect to inversion of fim switch. There are several reasons. First of all, they did not set Positive controls and Negative controls. Because of the lack of controls, we cannot confirm that FimE inverts the fim switch in [ON] state to [OFF] state predominantly. Secondly, they didn’t write down the information of plasmids used"

UN Climate Change Conference
Summits like the UN Climate Change Conference are the wrong approach to problems such as antibiotic resistances, says Lars Fischer. Picture from the Intern Blog of American University.
International collaborations against antibiotic resistances are all well and good, but the UN Climate Change conference of all collaborations shows why coordination at the government level is the wrong approach, says Lars Fischer, editorial journalist at ""Spektrum Der Wissenschaft"". Not even a century ago, the discovery of antibiotics caused a decisive turn for the better in the millennia-long battle against infectious diseases. But while many already saw pathogenic agents eradicated and a golden age of medicine seemed within reach, we have now however reached an abyss: a dramatic relapse into a world looms ahead, where microorganisms are again rulers over life and death.
The threat emanating from the increasing antibiotic resistances is existential—for every one of us, as well as the countries and society itself. That the world community unites in a supranational board in order to face the latter, suggests itself. However, as alluring as the vision of an intergovernmental panel on antimicrobial resistance may be, as evoked by Mark Woolhouse and Jeremy Farrar (authors of the Nature article ""Policy: An intergovernmental panel on antimicrobial resistance"", published May 2014), this thought is gravely mistaken.

Genetic parts to program bacteria (discussion on Thursday, June 11)
How do you think we could use synthetic genetic circuits to control metabolic pathways? - GMcArthurIV 18:57, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
We could use a genetic circuit to switch the metabolic pathway on or off using an external signal.  This would be useful to minimize the stress on the cell and colony while it is growing, then once the colony is at the desired size all of the cell's resources could be used for the metabolite.  We would also have to down regulate the replication function within the cell. - Bussingkm 15:38, 11 June 2009 (UTC)
The article mentions using synthetic genetic circuits to produce a series of metabolic proteins ""at the precise time and amount required for the maximal synthesis of a drug or energetic compound, while diverting the flux from competing pathways"" (pg 554).  Using the information-processing common to electric circuits, a cell can be programmed to perform a series of coordinated tasks such as maximizing certain metabolic pathways. -"

Synthetic biology has a huge potential for improving the welfare of humanity, but being such a young discipline, at the same time has many issues yet to be resolved, including ethical, legal concerns and safety issues.  In US or EU, thus, it is not uncommon to see close cooperation between the government and private enterprises to create an ideal research environment and efficient legal and regulatory framework.
No such environment exists in Korea, at least up to the level of efficiency found in US or EU.  We have concluded that the policy makers and important players (such as colleges and research institutes) must be better informed of the new field so as to provide an environment that is favorable for the advancement of  synthetic biology while safe enough to prevent hazardous events.  We have also identified that it is  necessary to promote fundamental concepts of synthetic biology to younger generations, including high school students and younger. Keeping these social environment of Korea in mind, Elan Vital Korea has established 5 goals for our human practice activities:
- first, enhancing public awareness of the synthetic biology;
- second, promoting the importance of the field to policy makers, research institutes and journalists;
- third, promoting the public awareness of the importance of the early detection of contagious pathogens;
- fourth, putting safety first for our projects;
- and finally, close cooperation and co-work with other iGEMers in Korea.
First, we continuously and strenuously strived to enhance the public awareness of the synthetic biology, especially among younger generations. We have participated in Korea Youth Expo and operated a booth (from May 22 to May 24), and worked hard to communicate with participants in 2015 Science Festival (from July 27 to August 2).  We offered basic education sessions on DNA and synthetic biology, and conducted surveys to better understand the level of general awareness of the synthetic biology and iGEM. Based on the information and data we gathered from them, we have developed the long-term education plan for primary and secondary school students.  We have reached the National Science Teachers"

The AcCELLerator
LINK-IT - gaining acceptance by overcoming fears
In the beginning of our project we wanted to achieve the gold medal criteria for policy and practice by doing lot of public work like informing the public about our project. After our balloon Saturday night fever action and talking to friends and family we became aware of the fact that the main reason people are skeptical towards synthetic biology were safety concerns. These concerns were often not funded. To gain statistically funded data about the opinions regarding synthetic biology we started a survey about synthetic biology in general and the main concerns of people towards synthetic biology. (Auswertung ergab_ ) As a team from Germany we dealt with a lot of prejudices about genetically modified organisms. To point out the general opinion, we created a mindmap giving you a small collection showing mixed opinions of the public.
We also wanted to consult experts on the field of scientific law and ethics. Therefore we partook in a symposium, learning about conferences from the experts. We also consulted an expert of synthetic biology ethics, Dr. Joachim Boldt. During this learning process, starting with talking to the public to consulting different experts, we became more and more aware of the problem we really wanted to encounter: How can we, as a small student group alleviate concerns that running through all walks of life. For us it was crucial that the only way to gain acceptance was to overcome the fears.
This is the reason why we started LINK-IT. Becoming aware of the safety concerns, let us see our project from a different angle. After doing so we also concerned ourselves with the ethical aspects of our project. The problem of safety concerns does not only lie in the way people observe laboratory work but also starts with the way terms are used in synthetic biology. We analyzed ethical problems regarding the terms ""living machine"" and ""artificial cell"" and came to the conclusion that for a public debate a clear and precise nomenclature of terms used in synthetic biology is very important. For the reason that synthetic biology is a young field of research we have now the chance to build up an informed basis for debate. We propose the usage of ""mechanical living organisms"" and ""genetically artificial"" cell as proper terms for the discussion. As a new field of science synthetic biology has the opportunity to  model the public awareness. Synthetic biology has the potential to change the life of people and to solve important problems"

Glasgow,2016,Team:Glasgow#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," gene was not able to occur and blue chromoprotein was not synthesised. This is unlikely due to the consensus sequences of ribosome binding sites for both organisms being similar, with the only nucleotide base difference between the two being energetically equivalent (ACCTCCTTT/A).
Each of the BioBrick parts in the construct was suitable for S. thermophilus, but the cellular conditions meant that the expressed amilCP was degraded before any visible pigmentation could develop.
The low copy number of the plasmid meant that although amilCP was expressed, it was not expressed in a large enough amount to be visible to the naked eye.
There was a mutation in the p25-K592025 BioBrick which we did not discover until our submission BioBricks were sent for sequencing. This mutation, though small (1bp deletion in the -35 region) could have affected transcription of amilCP in S.thermophilus but not in E.coli>. This mutation is described on our BBa_K2151010 parts page for this BioBrick.
It initially appears that amilCP is not a suitable reporter for S. thermophilus, however we cannot directly conclude this from our results. We would need to carry out more experiments in order to ensure the other BioBrick parts we used were all suitable for S. thermophilus before committing to the idea that amilCP is not useful in this organism.
Parts submitted to the registry
We ligated Uppsala's BioBrick BBa_K592025 to the three native S.thermophilus promoters we worked with throughout the project and submitted three new BioBricks. These could be utilised by teams working with S. thermophilus in order to expand upon the results we gathered.

2. The reactions contained a volume of digested insert, a volume of digested linear pSB1C3, 1uL T4 DNA ligase, and 1x T4 ligase buffer, and Molecular Water to a final volume of 10μL.
3. Incubate the ligation at 16°C overnight.
Ligation Screening
1. Before transforming the ligation, we tested the ligation reaction using PCR to determine whether we could detect the presence of inserted DNA in the vector. This is a step that we have not seen many labs use and we were excited to implement it.
2. Using 1 uL of ligation reaction, perform PCR as usual using primers that target sites flanking the insertion site.
3. If the agarose gel shows a product of the correct size, proceed with transformation. If not, then re-ligate using a different proportion of Insert:Vector DNA and try again.
Transformation
1. Label one 1.5 mL tube as a positive control (with vector and insert ligation) and one 1.5 mL as a negative control (vector only).
2. Thaw competent cells on ice. Pipette 50 uL of competent cells into both the positive and negative control tubes.
3. Pipette 2 uL of DNA into the competent cells. Gently mix by flicking the tubes.
4. Incubate both tubes on ice for 30 minutes.
5. Heat shock the tubes at 42ºC for 45 seconds. Put the tubes back on ice for 2 minutes.
6. Pipette 900 uL SOC media to the positive and negative control tubes. Be careful not to contaminate the SOC.
7. Place the tubes in a shaking incubator. Incubate at 37ºC for 1 hour at, shaking at 200 rpm. About 15 minutes before incubation finishes, remove plates from the fridge, label appropriately and leave them at room temperature.
8. Take tubes out of incubator. Spin cells at 6000 rpm for 30-60 seconds.
9. Pour off the supernatant, leaving 100-200 uL in each tube.
10. Gently resuspend the pellet in the tubes using the supernatant left.
11. Pipette the resuspended cells onto the selection plate.
12. Add 15-20 glass beads to each plate. Put lid back on each plate. Shake both plates so that the cells can spread around. Once done shaking, pour the beads out"

Two of the 2 mL tubes for each of the antibiotic and control 2 mL tubes were each placed into a 35x10 mm Petri dish. This was repeated with five other Petri dishes.
Three of them were rinsed after 15 minutes while the other three and the control were rinsed after 30 minutes.
These were then recultured by pipetting 100 μL of LB media into the rim of the 35x10 mm Petri dish. This was then pipetted back into the tube along with 5 μL of KAN.
The Petri dishes were then put into an incubator for 24 hours at 37 ℃.
Typhoon:
To get quantitative data, we used the Typhoon.
An area on the grid of the typhoon was chosen depending on how many 35x10 mm Petri dishes we used.
Fluorescence scanning was chosen; the setting for that was 580 BP, AlexaFlour546, PMT: 600, and with a green laser.
The pixel size used was 100 microns.
The focal plane used was +3 mm so that it would scan through the plastic bottom of the Petri dish."

We hypothesize that these organisms will form a codependent relationship that will act as a proof of concept for future researchers to develop their own multicellular, multispecies machines. It is possible that these species will form an aggregate of interconnected yeast and E. coli which could be the first steps towards designing entirely synthetic biofilms. The possibilities that could result from such systems are endless, and are limited only by the imagination of the designer. We believe that the next step for synthetic biology will be the progression from construction of single-species machines to the construction of multicellular, multispecies machines to perform specific and complex functions.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Delay Results Continue_-_-_TEXT.html," negative cascade and control have shown same growth pattern. This is very good for our fluorescence measurements interpretation.
In figure 3 the fluorescence (GFP) measurements of control is shown. We can see very clearly that IPTG induction has an effect on the increasing change in fluorescence. Also the fluorescence decreases after a period which show that GFP gets degraded since it has LVA tag and also IPTG has been fully consumed. Also in figure 4 the negative cascade starts to produce fluorescence very lately around 600 minutes.  This shows that Delay device works fine.
Also from the above graphs we found that the GFP is produced in non induced E.coli (K12) cells (both control and negative cascade containing cells) which is supposed to have LacI repressor. We think the reason could be the LacI repressor produced by the cells were not enough to repress the higher number of pLacI in the plasmids. hence to characterize the negative cascade plasmids we used relative mean (mean/mean at time of induction) and constructed the comparison graphs of control and negative cascade samples under the three conditions (No IPTG, 1xIPTG and 2xIPTG) which are shown in figures 5,6 and 7. From the figures it is clear that the change in measurement is statistically more than the change in noise.
In figure 5, it shows that the non induced negative cascade sample shows high variability in GFP expression in initial stages then it steadily increases higher than the control. This same behavior is seen in other 1xIPTG and 2xIPTG conditions. Also interestingly all the Negative Cascade samples starts to produce relatively higher amounts of GFP around 595 to 615th minute which is also possible according to the model developed in which there could be a condition when the delay time could reach high values if the cI produced is degraded slowly. Thus the experiment proves that the delay time caused by our transcriptional cascade is around 10 hours (600 min) with high transcriptional leakage of GFP.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#rMFC#GeneticalApproach_-_-_TEXT.html," succinate into the medium. This occurs especially under anaerobic conditions because bacteria use fumarate as a final electron acceptor instead of oxygen. Besides this effect could be observed if high fumarate concentrations in the medium are available. The produced succinate would be transported out of the cell via the C4 carboxylate transporter dcuB. ( Janausch, 2001 ; Unden et al., 1997 ) In connection to our second module we planned on working under oxygen limiting conditions, hence effective carbon dioxid fixation is possible. To achieve an effective electron uptake and prevent any succinate excretion, the C4 carboxylate antiporter DcuB has to be knocked out in our E. coli strain.
In conclusion we are going to modify the metabolic pathway of fumarate by a knockout of the C4 carboxylate antiporter DcuB in E. coli and overexpression of different fumarate reductases. Furthermore the outer membrane porine OprF had to be integrated into the bacterial chromosome to ensure a constitutive expression of OprF and reduce the plasmid overload of bacterial cells.
Figure 3: The electron flow in the respiratory chain. Different complexes of electron transport chain under aerobic conditions are visualized. Free energy (E0´) change from negative to positive during electron transfer from NADH to oxygen finally.
Fumarate Reductase
We worked on the expression of different fumarate reductases: Fumarate reductase (Frd) from Escherichia coli ( BBa_K1465102 ) and Fumarate reductase (Fum) from Actinobacillus succinogenes ( BBa_K1465103 ; BBa_K1465104 ) both under the control of the T7 promotor in different E. coli strains. In figure 4 our concept is visualized with neutral red as a mediator. The fumarate reductase has a key role in our first module because this enzyme makes sure that electrons are transferred from the reduced mediator into bacterial cells. This leads to an increased succinate production, which support ATP production and generation of reductive power, for example FADH2.
Figure 4: The electron flow mediated by redox active mediator (for example neutral red) in interaction with fumarate reductase in E. coli cell. The electrochemical reduced mediator has to cross outer membrane via genome integrated outer membrane porines OprF. The fumarate reductase in the inner bacterial membrane get electrons from the mediator for reduction of f"

Jamboree Results
The good news at the beginning: At the regional jamboree our team won a gold medal and qualified for the international finals at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Yeay!
During the Europe Jamboree in Amsterdam we had a great time. It was amazing to see how many young scientists from all over Europe and also from Africa came to the jamboree and presented their various ideas. At the presentations it was interesting to get an idea of the diverse applications of synthetic biology since there where so many different topics. In the poster session and afterwards at the great dinner and party we were pleased to talk and have fun with the other teams.  Also it was great to stay at a camping site and to do a boat cruise on the Amsterdam canals. All in all we had a lovely European Jamboree and are looking forward to the World Jamboree at MIT.

Samples before and after induction were analyzed by western blot. After harvesting, fractions of cytoplasm, spheroplasm and periplasm were separated. Samples of the fractions were submitted to the B12 plate assay and the photometric assay as well as to SDS page and western blot. The same was done for aerobic cultures of S. blattae and R. planticola with Glms w/o Thio as well as with BtuF w/o Thio. These cultures were grown with B12 present in the medium.
Both Western Blots show the expression of BtuF and GlmS  in R. planticola, and BtuF in S. blattae
.
The plate assay gave no evaluable results. In the photometric assay, B12 could be detected in the cytoplasm and periplasm of R. planticola and S. blattae. Additionally, the western blots showed expression of BtuF in the periplasm of R. planticola and S. blattae.

SDSZ_China,2018,Team:SDSZ China#ioe_-_-_TEXT.html," us together: we are a group with same biology dream. As a result, every time we discussed our research design together, an invisible tie connected us: we were better to collaborate. When we were facing some difficulties, we were more likely to get through, because this was the opportunities for us to realize our dream since childhood. We were inspired to enhance our project.
In addition, during the presentation, we have found that many students were unfamiliar with synthetic biology. For instance, few of them understood the concept of “enzyme”; in fact, few of them even know the Chinese character “enzyme.” Therefore, we tried different approaches to address our project, in order to make it more accessible and understandable. We used several models of crabs and shrimps to arouse their interest. We explained that enzyme is a kind of substance that can make chemical reaction more effective, for instance, in our bodies. We came up with real-world sceneries to express the obscure concepts of synthetic biology. We emphasized the real-world issues that synthetic biology would be able to solve, rather than in a theoretic level. We therefore improved our education, better expressing our ideas and passions to ordinary people in an accessible and interesting way.
- Suzhou The trip to Suzhou visiting a international company- Symbiotechnology helped the practice of our project a lot. In an emerging high-tech industrial park, the staff led us to visit their professional labs and invited us to give a presentation on our project in a conference room and  communicate with their researchers. This exchange brings valuable experience to our projects and clarifies the goals we pursue in our experiments.
First, after listening to the initial ideas of our research, some experts helped us to exclude eight genes we were going to explore based on the projects they had studied. Some genes are excluded because they are too rare for large-scale production or low productivity. This saves us a lot of researching time. Second, experts have highlighted the importance of conversion efficiency because the productivity of today's mainstream solutions is not high, but it is not low, so our solution must not only focus on the impact on the environment, higher conversion rate is also very important.
Although it took a few days to finish, we have gained a lot of important information, which is definitely helpful for our follow-up experimental design.

白血病は根本的な治療法が未だに発見されていない重病である。「不治」という恐怖に加え、いつどれほどの痛みや苦しみが待ち受けているのか「予測ができない」という恐怖とも闘い続けなければならない。
そこで我々はキイロショウジョウバエの白血病疾患モデルを用いて、病状の可視化が可能となる簡易検査キットを提案する。これはキイロショウジョウバエの表現型と人体に表れる病状を対応させることにより実現が予想される。これにより、今までは計り知ることのできなかった恐怖や苦しみを定量化することができ、白血病をむやみに恐れず向き合うことができるのではなかろうか。
私たちKIT-Kyotoは、ショウジョウバエの白血病疾患モデルの作製に挑みます。ショウジョウバエは、ヒトと約60%遺伝子が同じであるので、多くの遺伝性の疾患モデルとして利用されています。

Experimental introductory synthetic biology courses
Through this short-term course series, we've discovered some patterns on the way these high school kids interact with introductory synthetic biology courses. Generally, due to lack of background knowledge, at first, they appeared indifferent about the theoretical knowledge, such as the assembly of the gene pathways. On the contrary, stories.
Motivation Investigation
As we've all acknowledged, successes and breakthroughs in iGEM are tightly linked with the ability of the participants to self-motivate to learn and improve themselves. So we employed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) to assess iGEMers's motivational orientations and their learning strategies within the Chinese iGEM community. In total, we've collected 53 questionnaire results in Chinese community.
The MSLQ is based on a general cognitive view of motivation and learning strategies. There are essentially two sections to the MSLQ, a motivation section, and a learning strategies section. The motivation section consists of 31 items that assess students' goals and value beliefs for a project, their beliefs about their skill to succeed in a project, and their anxiety about tests in a project. The learning strategy section includes 31 items regarding students' use of different cognitive and metacognitive strategies. In addition, the learning strategies section includes 19 items concerning student management of different resources.
Through our adapted questionnaire, 11 scales of feedbacks on students' motivation towards iGEM could be presented, which are Intrinsic Goal Orientation, Extrinsic Goal Orientation, Critical Thinking, Rehearsal, Elaboration, Organization, Metacognitive Self-Regulation, Time and Study Environment, Effort Regulation, Peer Learning, and Help Seeking.
In order to set up valid control groups, we dissected the respondents by their gender and role in the team. Specifically, we did two comparisons. One is between male and female respondents, the other one is between team leaders and the rest members of a team. To analyze the data, we conducted significance test for two comparisons respectively to see what happens. As a result, we did get some amazing results.
1. Leaders do distinctly better in Critical Thinking, Elaboration and Peer Learning.
Comparison between leaders and non-leaders
In the comparison between team leaders and the rest of the team, leaders scored higher in almost all scales. And the test results showed that there were significant differences in Critical Thinking, Elaboration and Peer Learning. Based on the result, we interpreted what these three scales mentioned above contributed to being a successful iGEM leader.

Next, the full insertion sequence was also generated on Gene Designer. >Mutant Cage Full Insertion GGCCTGGTTCCCCGCGGTTCAGGC >Full Insertion GLVPRGSG This allowed easy insertion of the sequences.  The full sequence was inserted where needed after removing redundant bases.
For the prefix and suffix, the sequence was obtained from this site.  The first prefix sequence was used. http://parts.igem.org/Help:BioBrick_Prefix_and_Suffix prefix-NdeI-gene-XhoI-Histag-suffix
Concluding remarks: Before the rest of the sites are revisited, a meeting will be set up with David and/or Fasih to check our design rationale.
Intro: today we realized that our work the previous day (June 23) was not useful. We had used Dr. Yates' original cage sequence instead of the optimized sequence, which would yield poorer results. Thus, the same procedure of using Benchling to design new cages with the inserted thrombin recognition sites was performed with the new cage sequence above.
Procedure:
1. The cage sequence optimized by Dr. Yates was copied into a benchling file.
2. The thrombin cleavage site was inserted at the area of interest of each site.
3. The resultant sequence was then codon optimized. Integrated DNA Technologies Codon Optimizer, set to Escherichia coli K12, was used. https://www.idtdna.com/CodonOpt
4. The optimized sequence was then cross checked with benchling’s digest function for EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, and XbaI restriction sites.
5. Any residues containing the restriction site were exchanged with different codons to preserve the reading frame and remove undesired digestion.

-PCquad sequence was copied onto Benchling and the mutation was inserted onto this sequence       -Then this sequence was codon optimized using the Gene Designer tool        -Then the sequence was checked for containing any iGEM restriction enzymes(Pst,EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI,NotI) and were removed by replacing nucleotides to avoid unwanted digestion.

We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE diagnostic and treatment pathway (in the case of NSCLC). [11]
The distribution of test values in the target population should be known and a suitable cut-off level defined and agreed.
There should be evidence from high quality randomized controlled trials that the screening programme is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity or evidence from high quality trials that the test accurately measures risk when helping a patient make an “informed choice”
Hennessey et al.’s cohort was not large enough for this to be conclusively known. [3] Further validation with a larger data set is required. The same is true for the links between miRNAs and disease more widely. However, preliminary results are promising. Our test would also need to undergo clinical trials - to test the efficacy of the toehold switches in measuring miRNA levels.
There should be evidence that the complete screening programme (test, diagnostic procedures, treatment/ intervention) is clinically, socially and ethically acceptable to health professionals and the public
To be clinically acceptable our test would need to to undergo large scale clinical trials. This would validate our research showing that it would be specific and cost effective. Socially and ethically, there should be no issues, for the same reasons as above.
The benefit gained should outweigh any harms from screening such as overdiagnosis, overtreatment, false positives, false reassurance, uncertain findings and complications.
The NLST showed 20% reduction in mortality with high risk screening for NSCLC using LDCT. Screening is therefore recommended in the US to high risk population groups. However, our test could prevent unnecessary further testing in many - and overdiagnosis could be reduced by examining the miRNA signature of the tumor. Furthermore, as mentioned in silver human practices , our test would not be offered as a conclusive diagnosis - only to rule out cancer in some and refer the others for further testing. There would also be psychological benefit using our test compared to existing methods in that a possible cancer could be ruled out far more quickly.
The screening programme should be economically balanced in relation to expenditure on medical care with regard to evidence from cost benefit and/or cost effectiveness analyses
We have created a cost effectiveness model - that works out who we should screen for the sensor to be cost effective and result in the cost per QALY being within NICE’s guidelines.
Clinical management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening"

In a synchronized oscillation circuit, each A, B and C plasmid is necessary. The plasmid A expresses GFP reporter and LuxI proteins, which is the positive feedback in oscillator; the plasmid B expresses protein aiiA to degrade AHL and acts as the negative feedback in oscillator; the plasmid C expresses NAD-2 to generate H2O2 to communicate between colonies, is the coupling part in circuit (Fig 2-5).
Fig. 2-5 Plasmids A, B and C in oscillation circuit
You may have noticed that these three plasmids have different resistant genes and replication origins on their backbone. Different resistant genes are used mainly for selection. And since different replication origin means a different copy number of target genes in this plasmid. Using different replication origins is to produce different target proteins in an appropriate ratio, and only in this way can oscillation be observed. Just like a glee needs Soprano, Tenor and Bass to cooperate to finish a song. Besides, three artificial plasmids with same copy numbers always have a competitive relation in one cell and cannot be well expressed.
Plasmid A has two different backbones with high and middle copy numbers respectively. We built them to see the copy numbers' effect on oscillation. Results can be seen in Exploration (For a better Glee).
All of the plasmids we constructed are confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and result can be seen in Parts , where you can also get the link to parts we submitted.
After the onerous construction work, our glee is ready to perform the synchronized oscillation song, so we have to find them a stage. Let's go to see the beautiful opera in Microfluidics (Stages) .

Some of the improvements that could be implemented without making the program much more complex is the strength of the SD or adding a cycle life to the ribosomes and the RNA polymerases. A more interesting improvement and still plausible could be representing the growth of the bacterium while the time goes by and the sharply decrease of the size to the half after the binary fission.

Transformed the part <partinfo>BBa_B0014</partinfo> from the distribution kit, and re-transformed pllD in pSB1C3 with DNA taken from the sample shipped to the RHIT team yesterday.
Reviewed the data from the oxygen-promoter experiment on monday. In conclusion, it appears that oxygen levels in the induced (anaerobic) cultures were not as low as desired, as growth rates were very similar between the aerobic and anaerobic cultures, while one would expect anaerobic cultures to grow slower. After correcting for OD, the fluorescence in the cultures at the end of the experiment was lower than the fluorescence measured from a control culture with no expected production of fluorescent protein. For this reason, a full analysis of the rest of the data was not performed.

AHUT_China,2018,Team:AHUT China#INTEGRATED FOR GOLD_-_-_TEXT.html,"2018 in the college students' activity center held a grand event report announcement, attracted about 600 students attend the meeting. This lecture had received much attention and wide influence in the school.
Firstly, the team tutors and 27 team members were introduced by our student leader Lou feiyue, and he showed our cooperation with famous universities at home and abroad and various vivid and interesting human practices. He also answered many students' questions about the iGEM competition, such as: what is iGEM? What improvements can iGEM bring? Moreover, he invited the present students to pay attention to the public account of iGEM team of Anhui university of technology, which was established by us, so that students could have a more detailed understanding of our team news.
Later, Pan Luyao, the leader of the experimental group, introduced our competition program this year to the teachers and students. By introducing our project of using carbonic anhydrase to absorb carbon dioxide and alleviate the greenhouse effect, students learned about the interest and practical value of synthetic biology.
Finally, professor Xu Xiangrong gave a concluding speech and made a prospect of the future, which fully aroused the students' enthusiasm for the competition. Our tutor and team members also took a photo with students who were interested in participating in the New Year.
Our iGEM team vividly introduced the teams, requirements, objectives and procedures of the competition through video and Powerpoint. The scene atmosphere was hot, students were looking forward to anticipating. This talk had served as a good guide for recruiting new members for 2019, as well as expanding the influence of the iGEM race.

Electroporation buffer (680 mM sucrose, 7 mM K2HPO4, pH = 7) (sterile filtrated)
Overnight culture of Vibrio natriegens inoculated from plates or cryostock in LB + v2 salts (e.g. 5mL, 37 °C; at 200 r.p.m) ( 10mL Falcon from the box )
Pre-chill the electroporation buffer (approx. 500 mL) and the centrifugation tubes you want to use (on ice)
On the following day, 500 mL of the LB + v2 is inoculated with the overnight culture with a final OD of 0.05
The culture is grown at 37 °C in a baffled flask with shaking at 200 r.p.m. until an OD600 of 0.5
Procedure
Divide the culture into two (or more) pre-chilled centrifugation containments
Put the culture on ice for 15 min
The cells are pelleted at 3000x g. for 20 min at 4 °C to avoid cell damage
The supernatant is carefully decanted and the cell pellets of both containers are gently resuspended in 10 mL of chilled electroporation buffer
The suspensions are transferred to two chilled 50 mL Falcons
The tubes are each filled to top with additional chilled electroporation buffer
(max. 50 mL in total or fill to maximum volume in accordance with manufactures instruction)
The Falcon tubes are inverted several times
The cells are centrifuged down at 3000x g for 15 min at 4 °C
The washing step (resuspend, fill-up, invert, centrifuge, discard supernatant) is repeated two times for a total of three washes• After the final wash, the supernatant is carefully decanted and the cells are gently resuspended in                   residual electroporation buffer (equals approximately 500 µL)
Measure the OD in a 1:20 dilution against electroporation buffer (e.g. 950 µL buffer & 50 µL sample)
The volume is adjusted with additional electroporation buffer to bring the final OD600 to 16
Cells are aliquoted (80 µL) into chilled tubes, frozen in liquid Nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use
Evaluation
Competent cells were used for electroporation at 0.9 kV to successfully transform cells.
Results
20 aliquots were stored at -80°C in the freezer ("

Collaborations
Although iGEM is officially labelled as a competition, this term does not fully portray the spirit of the event. Besides the integral research aspect of the event, another key characteristic of iGEM is its incredibly connective nature.
In that regard, teams from around the world get into contact with one another, for a multitude of reasons; to improve on their own projects, to exchange knowledge and scientific advice, to get to know each other personally, or even to join forces to create exciting projects together.
Animated Edutainment
Our team for example has created an educational animation movie, which was published on YouTube, and is accessible to everybody. Our movie comprehensively illustrates the idea behind our         project and introduce the viewers to the basic biological concept of biocatalysis via enzymes. The video is primarily targeted towards a broad audience, especially including viewers without academic background in life         sciences. Through a playful and vibrant animation style, the video aims to convey scientific knowledge in an easy-to-approach way, with the ultimate goal to excite the viewers interest for scientific topics in general.         We believe that the internet poses an extremely good medium for scientific education. To ensure that everybody interested can enjoy our movie regardless of their linguistic background, we have         collaborated with a variety of other teams, who generously provided us with subtitles in their respective mother tongues. On this notice, we want to wholeheartedly thank the iGEM Teams of Düsseldorf (Italian), Graz         (Austrian), Hamm-Lippstadt (Viatnamese) and Athens (Greek) for their great support.
In this matter, we provided german subtitles for their video project about synthetic biology in general. Thank you for your collaboration!
Security first!
We also collaborated with the iGEM Team of Bielefeld. For this, Verena got in contact with Bielefeld, which provided her with informational material and a presentation explaining the concept of dual use in science, so she could teach us with a presentation         in our meetings. Thereby we learned a lot about the issues of biosecurity and dual use. We want to thank iGEM Bielefeld for their truly enlightening work, the provided"

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended the appropriate safety courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we participated in a general molecular biology workshop to refresh our memory of techniques used in molecular biology.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. This week we also divided up into our respective groups for the project and decided research priorities.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
We examined three problems related to ferritin. Firstly, we investigated protein isolation of ferritin. We are considering the protocols created by Santambrogio et al. (1993), as they have been used by multiple other authors as well. This paper uses precipitation followed by column chromatography, and verification with spectroscopy, PAGE and SDS-PAGE (Levi 1994). Alternatively, we may consider using his-tags for Ni-NTA column purification.
Secondly, we examined the feasibility of using magnetism to manipulate ferritin. Commercial horse spleen ferritin was tested on a magnetic Dynabead rack, and as expected, it did not move, as the core should not be magnetic. We must thus synthesize magnetoferritin wherein the native ferrihydrite core is converted to magnetite--a paramagnetic material which can be attracted to magnetic fields (Jordan et al. "

Ces symptômes découlent de la colonisation du tractus respiratoire ou gastro-intestinal et de la diffusion possible à d'autres endroits du corps. Les M.avium sont peu pathogènes; c'est pourquoi elles peuvent coloniser des sujets sans avoir d'effets indésirables sur leur santé. Les sujets immunocompétents qui n'ont pas de maladie sous-jacente ont un très faible risque de présenter des symptômes d'infection par M.avium. Des rapports épidémiologiques ont récemment montré que l'on retrouve de plus en plus la présence de M.avium chez des sujets, notamment des femmes, qui ne semblent avoir aucun trouble pulmonaire ou immunitaire prédisposant. La majorité des sujets en bonne santé qui sont atteints d'infections causées par des M.avium ont une infection localisée ; par contre, on constate des infections par M.avium disséminées chez un pourcentage important de patients atteints du SIDA (80 % des patients colonisés), ainsi que chez d'autres populations dont le système immunitaire est déficient, comme les sujets qui ont un syndrôme d'immunodéficience combinée aiguë ou qui ont reçu une transplantation et  chez les patients traités aux corticostéroïdes ou avec des médicaments cytotoxiques.
M.avium semble être un candidat des plus intéressants pour le vecteur tissulaire. Cette bactérie résiste au système immunitaire et est peu pathogène pour l’Homme.

Résistance au système immunitaire du vecteur tissulaire [3,4,5]
Le système immunitaire peut s’avérer être un ennemi redoutable, détectant et éliminant tout ce qui n’appartient pas à l’organisme. Ne pouvant être furtif à ce dernier, il faut être « blindé ».
Pour cela le vecteur tissulaire possède deux atouts, un système de détournement du système immunitaire et une paroi robuste.

A major problem is their bioaccumulation, which leads to toxicity and long term effects which include fatal diseases like cancer (Martin et al. 2009), Parkinson`s or Alzheimer’s disease (Gaggelli et al. 2006) (figure 1).
Which heavy metals? The heavy metal sensors we chose for detection are specific to arsenic, copper, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel. Their concentrations in drinking water are regulated by the WHO, because of their immediate and long term health effects (figure 2).
Our biosensors We decided to work with already existing, well-characterized sensors as well as with established but not well-characterized concepts of other teams and moreover create new sensor systems. Therefore, we established a basic construction plan for our sensor systems, which is based on a promoter with a specific operator region in front of a super folder GFP (sfGFP), which was used for detection trough fluorescence analysis . In addition we used fitting activators or repressors for our inducible promoters under the control of BBa_K608002, which consists of a constitutive promoter with a strong ribosomal binding site (RBS) (figure 3).  We combined these into a device consisting of constitutive promoter and RBS reverse and the promoter and operator region in upstream of the sfGFP. So we have repressor or activator constitutively expressed in reverse orientation. This was done to minimize the background transcription of the inducible system in upstream of our heavy metal promoter operator system. In addition, these devices are optimized for the usage in a cell free protein synthesis( CFPS ). This is the basis for the development of cell free biosensors on a test strip, which can be used to detect several heavy metals at once in the open field.

Occurrence
Arsenic is found in nature in both organic and inorganic forms, typically as arsenite (AsIII) or arsenate (AsV). The average arsenic concentration in sea water is about 1-2 µg/L ( Kaur et al. 2015 ). Inorganic arsenic is naturally present at high levels in the groundwater of a number of countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, China, India, Mexico, and the USA ( World Health Organization 2012 ).  Arsenic contamination is most dramatic in Bangladesh, where over one million people suffer from arsenic poisoning. Strong local and seasonal fluctuations in arsenic concentrations make it necessary to test each well regularly ( van der Meer 2003 ).

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html," its innate immune ability in order to survive disease. This has proven effective at a population level so far: no pathogen has driven us to extinction. However, in the last two centuries humanity has added new weapons to its disease fighting arsenal: antibiotics reduced bacterial infections from life-threatening to trivial matters. Antiviral drugs have rescued those infected with HIV from the brink of death. For a time, these drugs were so indisputably effective they were thought of as “magic bullets” and thrown at pathogens indiscriminately. Unfortunately, their efficacy has been diminishing. In a textbook example of selective pressure, the most susceptible bacterial pathogens were wiped out while those able to withstand antibiotics have thrived.
Antibiotics have several modes of action: beta lactams inhibit cell wall synthesis, aminoglycosides interfere with translation and lead to misfolded proteins, and fluoroquinones disrupt DNA gyrase and topoisomerase during cell replication. In response, bacteria have evolved the ability to degrade these molecules with enzymes such as the beta-lactamase, or to actively remove them from the intracellular space by means of efflux pumps. Such pathogens are deemed resistant to antibiotics as they can grow and persist in their presence unperturbed.

Laying low
“He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious.” – Sun Tzu, The Art of War
Efflux pumps and hydrolytic enzymes are by no means the only evolutionary strategies which pathogenic organisms have in order to escape destruction. Many bacteria have the ability to reduce their metabolism to a minimum and enter a dormant stage in which little to no new cell wall construction, protein translation, or DNA replication occurs. (2) (4) (5) As a result, any cells that have in effect shut down are in practice impervious to the modes of action of modern antibiotics. Such cells do not need to be genetically resistant because their ability to become dormant allows them to tolerate the presence of antibiotics. (2) The strategy is effective not only against toxic chemicals, but also applicable during periods of overcrowding or low nutrient availability.
Cells entering a persistent biofilm undergo a transition from a more motile state to a sessile state, and use their extracellular projections to attach to one another and to their surroundings.  In addition to clumping together, certain bacteria secrete a polymer which forms a protective matrix around the cells. In human wounds infected with P. aeruginosa this exopolymer matrix is effective at denying macrophages access and preventing them from digesting the dormant bacteria. Should antibiotic-susceptible"

Afterwards, our team introduced the project this year, and have a heated discussion. The third part is NYU-Shanghai introducing their project. We raised important conflict that their work might be repeating one team in 2015, and gave some suggestion for improvements. In the end, we visited the NYU campus in Shanghai, then send farewell to each other. This meeting improves the relation between both teams, and we all gained vital information by collective minds.
Meet-Ups
NCKU Asia Pacific Conference
We took part in the 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 at National Cheng Kung University from 2016/08/08 to 2016/08/14.It’s the first time for Tongji, a young iGEM team to join such an international conference, We get a opportunity to communicate with teams from Asia-pacific region.
We held an impressive presentation and poster exhibition in NCKU with the topic of an optimized targeted breast cancer therapy. Meanwhile, we received plenty of constructive advice from our audience, especially experienced related scholars, which help us to optimize our cancer therapy design.
We truly believed that by this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, we, as well as all the other teams are able to have communications, achieving better results. What’s more, we build a consensus that multidisciplinary cooperation could be better improved by involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competition.

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Human Practice#Experts_-_-_TEXT.html," is also an interesting approach. I am very interested in wether this will work, because it could be a great challenge to improve the reduction of the mediator in the bacteria. But it is very important to pay attention that the potential of the membrane is not too low. This is the most important aspect that you have to look at.
We are also developing a MFC for our engineered E. coli. Does there exist any important rules we have to follow for example regarding the size of the MFC?
You have to minimize the distance between the different parts in your MFC. Every distance is a resistor and will decrease your demand. The optimal size of your MFC depends on the application you want to choose. For testing the principal of your system the actual size of your MFC is good. If you want to get it smaller other problems will appear which you would have to solve. If you want to integrate your system you have to conform it correspondingly.
We have got a special biosafety system including the D-alanine auxotrophic E. coli and the Colicin E2 (at this time we thought that we might use this part from the partsregistry instead of Rnase Ba). Do you think that system is a good one?
The system what you want to use is a good one. In my opinion it is safe and I don’t think that it will be a problem to use it. Another good biosafety idea exists, but it's for Geobacter sulfurreducens. If you would work with this bacteria you could use the aspect that this organism use only one electron acceptor when it is growing under anaerobic conditions. When this organism gets out of the MFC it will die because there wouldn’t be the one electron acceptor which is needed. But as E. coli is facultatively aerobic this system won’t work here, because E. coli has several possibilities to oxidize the substrate.
How do you assess the chance of the MFC in general to take a role in bioremediation and producing energy in the future?
It is a very interesting new idea with a high potential for producing compounds/energy or degradation harmful substances. Many scientists from different fields of knowledge research together. There is much research necessary but in the future it will take a part in different fields. For remediation it would be the best to use mixed culture, while Bacteria as E. coli have the most potential to combine synthesis and energy production. Another challenging aspect would also be to introduce biosynthesis specific with electrons. As you see there is a lot of interesting work to be done and I hope that your"
