Our Team
Tsinghua-A first entered the iGEM Jamboree in 2011 and progresses have been made ever since then. With instructors and team members from the Department of Automation, we have an advantage in modeling construction. We have team members from all kinds of departments, School of Life Science, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences and Department of Automation. Hopefully we can do better this year.
Instructors
Our instructors come from Bioinformatics Division & Center of Synthetic and Systems Biology, TNLIST in Tsinghua University.

Hi, everyone~ I am a girl from medical school and always insists on healthy lifestyle. However, I have stay up late for iGEM recently. I guess tomorrow my anatomy teacher will give his advice about health again~
Zhanhao Peng | Undergrad
If you ask me which one do I prefer, coding or iGEM modeling? I will definitely say iGEM modeling.
Luning Yang | Undergrad
I’m so lucky to be in the Tsinghua-A team and I love this iGEM Jamboree. In the last whole year, I spared no effort to the lab work. It is so cool I have the chance to meet with all the youngest synthetic biologists in the world and all those craziest ideas. It is an unforgettable experience for sure~~
Chumeng Xu | Undergrad
As one of the team members from computational background, I was supposed to do most of the ""geek"" stuff. However, I have dealt with people a lot more than code through this amazing experience :D. Interdisciplinary subjects are all about communication and collaboration. Looking forward to meeting all the fantastic young minds!

Shuttle vectors
To express our genes in endophyte, we found some broad host range shuttle vector and get it from addgene.
We decided to replace the ori from pSB1C3 with the replication-related proteins and ori on the shuttle vectors. After           we searched for the restriction sites, we decide to add BamHI and HindIII by PCR on the shuttle vectors and pSB1C3,           then, digest it and ligate it (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Shuttle vectors construction process.
pME6010 is a small, stable, high copy number (n = 5.9 ± 1.8) shuttle vector based on the minimal pVS1 replicon for use in gram-negative especially plant-associated bacteria with tetracycline resistance. The vector we used was originally from Dr. Herman Spaink’s Lab, Leiden University. We bought it from addgene as the name, pMP4657, which contains pLacZ-EGFP[4,12].
pBBR1
pBBR1 is relatively smaller in size (<5.3kb), and they possess an extended multiple cloning site (MCS). They have the LacZα peptide that allow direct selection of recombinant plasmid in Escherichia coli. Moreover, pBBR1 provide four different antibiotics including kanamycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamycin. This let pBBR1 broaden it usage. The plasmids have been tested and found to replicate in Pseudomonas fluorescens. According Burkholderia genus and Pseudomonas fluorescens are close, pBBR1 can express in Burkholderia genus[7].

Experiments:
Goal: To  ligate RBS-tetR-TT with PcI-RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT
Isolated  plasmids and digested for ligation. After running a gel,  bands appeared not having been digested  completely. Still did the ligation anyway.
Cell  Immobilization:
We  started thinking about methods to establish our numeric display device and to  bring our engineering bacteria into operation. Obviously, the foremost thing we  should do is to fix the engineering bacteria from freely suspended cultivation  to the tubes of our device, namely cell immobilization. Meanwhile, cultivation  condition and fluorescence intensity of immobilized cells should be made  certain.
After  studying literatures and asking senior students for help, we decided to explore  three kinds of methods of immobilizing our engineering bacteria: 1) calcium  alginate beads; 2) PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules, 3)  intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules.

Experiments:
Goal: To  verify Part I and perform ligation if Part I is right.
Isolated  plasmids and digested both for restriction analysis and ligation. The result  was so upsetting: the construction of Part I was still unsuccessful. Better try  another ligation next day.
Cell  Immobilization:
Added  100uL PBAD-RGT aliquot into LB medium with Ampicillin，37°C shaker  incubated for 12h.
Goal: To  test if PDMDAAC will restrain growth of the engineering bacteria.

This is why we founded an organization called Aalto-Helsinki Synthetic Biology ry, for all the members of the previous years’ and the present year’s teams. An organization would provide a great channel for communicating with the old teams and also helped a lot with handling our finances.
As we were at the Nordic iGEM Conference, there was a lot of discussion of collaboration between different teams’ iGEM organizations. The discussions even led to the idea of a Nordic iGEM organization, which would function as a community for all the nordic iGEM organizations. However, as we had just founded the Aalto-Helsinki Synthetic Biology ry and wanted to get that running smoothly first, in addition to having to focus on our iGEM project, nothing concrete was decided yet. The discussion of possible collaboration will probably start again after the Jamboree.
“ We decided that it was time to strengthen the continuity of the team and also provide basis for an Aalto-Helsinki community ”
Software
The CollabSeeker
CollabSeeker is a collaboration search tool for the iGEM community, available at collab.aaltohelsinki.com . It is intended to help iGEM teams easily find the contact details and project information of other teams for collaboration purposes.
The original version of the CollabSeeker was made by the last year’s Aalto-Helsinki team. It was based on the idea of teams writing their project and contact information into the system, with CollabSeeker essentially functioning as a communication platform. Other similar platforms are available, such as the iGEM Matchmaker and the iGEM Match website of the UC Davis team.
None of the available platforms have been very popular, however. The main problem is that these sorts of platforms only produce value once a large user base already exists, but a large user base can only form once the platform produces enough value to attract new potential users. In order to fix this problem, we knew we had to come up with a way to produce value and attract users without having an existing user base to back us up.
Enter CollabSeeker 2.0! This time around, we would not require teams to fill in their information for us. Instead, we would mine igem.org, Facebook and Twitter for the project descriptions and Facebook and Twiter pages of all the iGEM teams around the globe. Of course it would be pure insanity to try to do this manually, so we created a suite of small, automated software tools for the purpose.
We hope that the whole iGEM community will embrace the CollabSeeker"

$N_R$, $N_A$, $N_L$ and $N_K$ represent the total number of repressors, activators, locks and keys present in the circuit. S does not reflect the quality of a circuit design. The score is intended to characterize its practical realizability. There might be millions of circuits generated automatically by computers, but we only choose the most reliable and representative results for users according to the score.
Promotion of Simulation Methods
We use the Tao Algorithm based on probability. We have optimized Tao according to some specific characteristics of biology reaction, and have used cache to avoid repeated calculating.
Cache of Simulation Results
Our bio-system is a kind of graph. The core idea of cache is to find out whether two graphs are the same (isomorphic exactly). As we may know, it is NP-Complete to make sure that two graphs are isomorphic, which means it is very hard to calculate on any computer. But our bio-system is more than just a graph: it has a flow-like direction, to which topological sorts can be applied. However, such kinds of sorts are far from figuring out whether they are isomorphic. So we tried to resolve the graph into chains. It can be proved that these chains can fully describe the graph in our cases. For the depth of our graph is tiny, the algorithm becomes effective. Then we hash the chains, make it easier and faster to sort. After the sort we hash them again to get a number which is big enough to avoid the collision. Then we convert a bio-system into a number. The same numbers imply the same bio-systems. So we will compare the numbers of bio-systems to make sure whether a cache is needed. We store the cache in a folder and limit the total cache size for safety. After all the process above, you can finally use it securely.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Population_-_-_TEXT.html," have to consider the replication         and death mechanism for P because the rates are balanced for S and N.
Because we could not conﬁrm the reaction constants for lox66 and lox71, we decided to proceed with the model using         the simpliﬁed reaction kinetics for lox.
Diagram illustrates a plasmid (S) undergoing recombination process (the knockout of origin of replication), resulting in proportion of plasmid (P) that consists of GOI but does not undergo plasmid replication and another proportion of plasmid (N) that only has origin of replication and undergoes plasmid replication.
2 Approximations and Simpliﬁcations
2.1 Recombination Simpliﬁcation
In this model, we consider P separately from N as a diﬀerent entity. That is, P is a GOI plasmid and an ORI plasmid,         while N is an ORI plasmid that does not have a corresponding GOI copy. We make this simpliﬁcation so that we may         use the ﬁtted model from the Cre module.
2.2 Constant Cre Recombination Rate Approximation
In this model, we assume that Cre is constitutively produced, and that the forward and reverse reaction constants remain         constant. In reality, the concentration may have changes, such as during replication, but because the amount of time         spent under such conditions should be short, we decide to simplify the model by not considering them.
3 System of Reactions
We can describe the model as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
The ﬁrst two reactions come from considering the death and replication of P respectively, while the second two come         from the ﬁtted result of the Cre model.
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied         the approximations as stated.
Fig. 1 Simulation of knockout efficiency with cell death and replication
As we can see from the graph, the concentration of both S and P gradually approach 0 over time.
This is because the replication of P only produces N while cell death would reduce P. As P decreases, the reaction         equilibrium between S and P is pushed in the forward direction in accordance with Le Chatlier’s principle, and so         S will also decrease. Meanwhile, N’s proportion is being increased do to the replication of P and eventually all         of the plasmids are in the form of N.

Illinois-Tools,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Notebook#Week4_-_-_TEXT.html," this type of function would be very useful to us.  This would be useful in determining a host organism by seeing which organisms each reaction can take place in.  Therefore, using the new tools I had learned for Python and the KEGG API I started making programs that compiled lists of information from the KEGG database that I could use to perform this organisms, and hopefully vice versa for get_organisms_by_reaction.  Before I started making code, I made a map of going from Organsims, to genes, to enzymes, and finally to reactions.  My first task was to compile a list of Organsims and the 3 or 4 letter codes that KEGG has assigned to each organism.  These code names are needed when doing certain queries to the KEGG API.  In particular, I needed this list of code names for the Organisms to genes step via the command get_genes_by_organisms. I ended up writing my code to retrieve all of the genes by code name for every organism listed on the KEGG database and compiled these lists of genes for every organism into one HUGE list of lists.  I ended exporting this extremely large list of lists of genes by organism to a text file via the pickle module for python.  This text file is the biggest text file I have ever seen, coming in around 200 MB.  LOL....  This program also took a long time to run as well, took about 3 or 4 hours to finish.  Since this list is so huge, I decided to just work with Ecoli for now, and move on to S cerevisiae and other organisms later.  My next step was to get enzymes by genes.  I did this for Ecoli only, and compiled and exported the list to a txt file.  This also took quite some time.  I started working on getting reactions by enzyme, when I learned something interesting, yet annoying.  Enzymes are given a code name in the form of 'ec:1.1.1.3' on the kegg database.  This code name is ""non-organism"" specific.  Therefore, getting reactions by enzyme has the potential of retrieving reactions that do not occur in Ecoli, since the enzyme name is a  generic name for any enzyme that performs a reaction.  Sometimes, enzymes can facilitate more than one reaction.  In terms of Ecoli, not all of these reactions that an enzyme can perform can necessarily occur in Ecoli. Therefore, I discovered I must find another way that will be organism specific throughout the whole process of going"

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html," inflation of the treatment cost as well.
Overall, the two most easily accessible and realistic solutions for the removal of pharmaceuticals are Ozonation and Activated Carbon (GAC & PAC).  On the one hand, the by-products produced after the redox reaction catalyzed by ozone (O3) have unknown ecotoxic effects. Coupled with slack control of removal rates due to the variability of wastewater content, skepticism is raised regarding Ozonation’s suitability. Commenting on Ozonation, Cristian Baresel voiced: “Ozonation of untreated wastewater leads to the ozone targeting other carbon sources than the ones you want (i.e. pharmaceuticals), which leads to high ozone levels needed, which is not economical. Ozonation large scale system like the size of Linköping (serving approximately 100.000 people) is 0.1 SEK/m3 which is relatively affordable. However, you need polishing after Ozonation, and that pushes the cost quite higher’’ (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
On the other hand, despite sufficient efficiency of Activated Carbon on removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater, financial concerns associated with its usage keeps its implementation limited. Regarding Activated Carbon Christian claims that: “Activated Carbon is a better solution than Ozonation because combined with biological filters (MBR) tenfold increase can be achieved in the lifetime of activated carbon granules. However, you need to have really clean water in order to use it. Otherwise clogging becomes an issue” (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018). Even in this case, the increase of activated carbon granules’ lifetime cannot offset MBR’s installation and operational costs.
In our quest for understanding better the profile of the existing solutions we visited Kungsängsverket WWTP, located in Uppsala. There, we learned that investigator engineers, Elin Kusoffsky and Jesper Olsson, concluded, after conducting a thorough assessment, that either Ozonation, Activated Carbon or a combination of both could be the chosen solution for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals in their WWTP. Specifically, the designated investigators estimated for Uppsala WWTP that 15gr of O3 per m3 of wastewater and approximately 20 minutes retention time will be needed for sufficient removal of pharmaceuticals, resulting in acceptable costs for Kungsängsverket WWTP standards. Although it was clearly admitted that the energy consumption will be increased from 0.05 to 0.1 kWh/m3 (between 10 and 30 % more of the existing value without advanced treatment) the"

UNIPV-Pavia,2009,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Project#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," energy production mechanism coupled to glicolysis in prokaryotes and is also present in eukaryotes were it is an alternative to the more efficient oxidative phosphorilation.
The starting compound in the fermentation pathway is pyruvate, which is usually produced from sugar substrates, such as glucose and lactose through the glicolysis pathway. In lactic fermentation, pyruvate is directly transformed in lactate by the enzyme Lactate Dehydrogenase.
In alcoholic fermentation, pyruvate is first transformed in acetaldehyde by pyruvate decarboxylase, with the production of a carbon dioxide molecule and then in ethanol by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. From a molecule of glucose, 2 molecules of ATP, the ""molecular unit"" of energy inside the cells, are produced.
Fermentation is exploited industrially in a wide range of preparations: bread and wine-making, beer brewing, cheese and yogurt production.
Lactose transformation into ethanol is a process that involves both glycolisis and alcoholic fermentation. Since glicolysis starting point is a molecule of glucose, lactose molecules have to be firstly broken into the two monosaccharide units, glucose and β-galactose. The latter sugar is then converted into glucose by the action of three different enzymes, known as the Leloir pathway. The two molecules of glucose are then oxidized in the glicolysis pathway, in which we have the production of a total of 4 ATP molecules and 4 molecules of pyruvate per lactose molecule. The pyruvate is then reduced into ethanol and carbon dioxide with a 1:1 stochiometry.
Ethanol
Molecular formula C2H6O
Ethanol is an alcohol that is a colorless liquid at ambient temperature, extremely flammable and volatile. It is used for several purposes. For example it is present:
- in food, after alcoholic fermentation (e.g. in spirits, wines and beers);
- in biofuel generally mixed to the common gasoline (e.g. the Brazil is the country where bioethanol is mainly used; Sweden is the European country where the market for bioethanol is mostly developing);
- in manufacture of perfumes, in cosmetics;
- in disinfectant, both for home use and professional one.
In this project, our attention will be focused to ethanol as one of the most important renewable fuels (biofuels). The possibility of obtaining a renewable source of energy is one of the challenges. Bioethanol as the other biofuels"

Measurement Study
All competing iGEM teams were encouraged to participate in interlab study which aims to assess how close measurements with a robust procedure can be when fluorescence is measured all around the world.        Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component to all engineering biology. However, the ability to repeat measurements in different labs has been difficult.
Antifungal peptide collection
Day 1​: transform Escherichia coli DH5α with these following plasmids:
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
Day 2​: Pick 2 colonies from each plate and inoculate it on 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 2-20 rpm.
Day 3​: Cell growth, sampling, and assay.
Measurements must be made in a plate reader, as the plate reader with a 96 well format is ideal as it provides a convenient format for multiple measurements.       The first objective is to obtain standard curves for fluorescence based on the sodium fluorescein reference material provided. The standard curve must be obtained under       exactly the same instrument conditions that you will use       when you do your cell based expression assays.

This would be achieved by the cloning of plasmids containing the cellulose synthase operon acsABCD, utilising the two parts BBa_K1321334 and BBa_K1321335 , constructed by Imperial College London 2014. This would enhance the cellulose biosynthesis and thereby optimise the energy outcome of the entire system in our project.

Cellulose Biosynthesis
Approach
Optimised Cellulose Biosynthesis in E. coli
To enhance the cellulose biosynthesis, parts containing the coding sequence of the Cellulose Synthase enzyme were cloned into the E. coli strain MG1655. The original idea was to clone the entire cellulose synthase operon acsABCD into one vector under control of the Ptac, as seen in Figure 1. With a plasmid with a total length over 9000 bp, the cloning emerged difficult. After several unsuccessful attempts, a different approach was sought.
Figure 1. The acsABCD operon controlled by Ptac cloned into one high copy vector.
In this design, it was attempted to implement the acsABCD operon into E. coli MG1655 on two separate vectors, with both parts controlled by Ptac, BBa_K864400 , ensuring equal expression levels of the parts. The AcsAB dimer, encoded in the part BBa_K1321334 , was attempted to be inserted into the vector pSB1C3. The part BBa_K1321335 , containing AcsC and AcsD, was inserted into the vector pSB1A3. Several combinations of the two parts and different vectors carrying different resistance cassettes were attempted, but unfortunately without success. Correspondence with a supervisor from the Imperial College London team , revealed that cloning with these parts had emerged difficult for them as well. Due to time constraints, it was decided to prioritise other aspects of the project and therefore keep this part theoretical henceforth.
If the cloning of the acsABCD operon had been successful, the cellulose biosynthesis would have been tested using fluorescent brightener 28. This is a colourless organic compound that fluoresces with a bright blue color under ultraviolet radiation, and it is used as a fluorescent brightening agent for polyamide and cellulose fabrics.

Selection: Cm & Amp
Results
Even if we recover the double transformants in the presence of Glucose to tightly repress the expression of the meganuclease, we still have no colonies on the plates containing both Amp and Cm. This is a sign that our construct is leaky, and the expression and function of I-SceI is so efficient that it digests all plasmids containing the corresponding restriction site, and the cells are no longer resistant to Amp.
Measuring the I-SceI efficiency (TUDelft parts)
In 2009, TUDelft iGEM Team has already tried to design a Self Destructive Plasmid based on I-SceI meganuclease. For their experiments, they designed a generator to produce I-SceI meganuclease and used the same pLac promoter, but they had two essential differences with our system:
They used a strong RBS .
I-SceI meganuclease they used had an LVA tag.
Moreover, they didn't submit the meganuclease alone as a biobrick, so it couldn't be used for constructing new composite biobricks controlled by other promoters, which would be very useful for the modularity of our system. That is why we started working on our own constructions of meganuclease first. However, we asked TUDelft to send us two plasmids that they designed, so that we can test and characterize them:

Since pET30a(+) has His protein tag, they plan to add HA protein tag and Flag protein tag to the down stream of α-tubulin and β-tubulin respectively . The target fragments are amplified by PCR and cloned to T vector and sequenced. Then they link the confirmed gene to pET30a(+) (enzyme site: XhoI, HindIII). After that, they transform the recombination vector into expression strains(BL21) for culturing. When the concentration of bacterium is appropriate (OD is 0.6-0.8), they induce the strains by 1 mmol IPTG. By using ultrasonic waves to break the cell of bacteria and centrifuging, they obtain the pellet and deal with the inclusion body for the further experiment of Co-Immunoprecipitation(CoIP).(See more in our collaboration. Click to see. )
2. FLC based fusion protein design
According to previous research, taxol can not only longitudinally stabilize the dimer in protofilament but also laterally stabilize neighboring protofilaments [1] [4] . Since taxol interacts with β-tubulin [4] , we design to fuse luciferase fragments to α-tubulin in order to avoid the potential steric effects.
The luciferase was split into N-terminal(amino acids 1~416) and C-terminal(amino acids 417~570) fragments. When treated with luciferin B, two sides of luciferase could combine and emit fluorescence in 560nm wavelength. Thus, we design and synthesize primers based on the sequence of luciferase, using FLC plasmids pCambia1300-N-Luciferase and pCambia1300-C-Luciferase as PCR templates to get the gene sequence of n-luciferase and c-luciferase respectively.
We design primers to add EcoR I as well as Xho I restriction enzyme sites at two sides of n-luciferase and c-luciferase. We ligate n-luciferase and c-luciferase fragments to pET30a(+) vector. The target genes are on the up stream of his-tag and downstream of T7 promoter. After constructing the vectors successfully, we transform them into E.coli TransB(DE3) for protein expression. We use Ni beads to purify the expressed proteins. Purified n-luciferase and c-luciferase are mixed together,"

“Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the    world, and how the world affects your work.” - Peter Carr
In this part of Human Practices of CryptoGErM, we decided to get in    contact with the main audiences that we consider important for the    realization and execution of our project:
National Institutions: What are the current     challenges that the experts in the field have to overcome in the     area of encryption and cybersecurity?
Potential Users: What are the current     requirements that a potential user of CryptoGErM needs?
Society: What is the current perception     about cybersecurity among society in general and how can we     get them closer to our project and synthetic biology?
National institutions
National Cyber Security Center from the Ministry of Security and Justice of the Netherlands
We got in contact with the National Cyber Security    Centre (Nationaal Cyber Security Centrum, NSCS) from the Ministry of Security and Justice of the Netherlands, in order to understand what the current challenges and   requirements in the development of a system for the storing and sending    of sensitive information are. Such requirements are important for our    project since we are able to have a clear idea of the actual and real    application of CryptoGErM.
The feedback received from the NCSC relies in trying to solve two    problems that are present each time that the storing and sending of    sensitive information is intended. The difficulty, according with the    comments from the National Cyber Security Center, in securing stored    information generally does not lie with the encryption methods, but    rather with two other problems:
How we propose to approach these problems:

$20-30/kg
Glutamic acid is the world's largest producer of amino acids and can be used in industrial production, food processing, medicine, scientific research, etc.
As an important intermediate metabolite in cells, glutamate can be converted into surfactin and γ-PGA by its own metabolism
Analysis of our research results, we found that the current production technology of glutamate was so mature that the price was very cheap. Novozymes and other biotech companies chose to produce polymers to form new materials that ultimately increased their added value. At the same time, glutamate was also a very important substance in cells. What’s more, the use of surfactants was very extensive. As a reason of the current production technology could not form large-scale industrial production, no wonder that the price was high; γ-PGA could be industrialized, but the current production cost is very high, resulting in its price was also very high.
Based on our findings, we finally chose to use intracellular glutamate to synthesize surfactin and γ-PGA to verify the feasibility of our project.
Questionnaire Analysis
In the analysis process,we tried to find the relationship between the two questions ""Do you understand the use of surfactin and gamma-polyglutamic acid?"" and ""Do you think that the intelligent metabolic pathway we are studying meets the needs of current production and research?"". Therefore, we performed the cross-over analysis. The analysis results show that the majority of"

Mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 4 hours and digested with 2 µL DNAseI for 15 minutes at 37°C.
Checking transcription products on urea gel
In vitro 5 µL of the transcription products, as well as 1 µL low range ssRNA ladder, were mixed with 2x RNA loading dye, incubated at 90°C for 5 minutes and put on ice immediately thereafter.
1.5mm urea gels were poured and left to polymerize for >30 minutes. Gels were assembled and prerun for 15 minutes (15 mA for 1 gel, 35 mA for two gels). As a running buffer, 0.5x TBE was used. Before loading the transcription products, wells were flushed with running buffer to remove urea from the wells.
Samples were loaded and run for ~1 hour.
To visualize the RNA on the gels, they were stained with SybrGold (Thermo Fischer Scientific) in 100 mL 0.5x TBE for ~20 minutes. After staining, bands on the gel can be visualized with UV light. The RNA transcripts might appear as big, uncolored blobs; in that case, there is so much RNA that the dye does not penetrate the gel completely.
If gels showed RNA bands of the right size, the remainder of the transcription products was loaded on the gel for subsequent purification.
RNA purification from acrylamide gel
RNA bands of the correct size were cut from the gel, cut in small pieces with a syringe and incubated overnight in 1 ml RNA elution buffer.
The next day, the elution buffer was divided over 3 eppies and 990 µL of pre-chilled (-20°C) 100% EtOH was added. Samples were incubated for 1 hour at -20°C, spun down in a microcentrifuge for 20 minutes, 13000 rpm, at RT. At this point, a pellet can be seen that is usually translucent, but in our case whitish and flakey. Pellets were washed with 1 ml 70% EtOH (combining them again), spun down again for 5 minutes, 13000. The majority of EtOH was removed, and the remainder was evaporated"

6. Mg++ and additives: Mg++ concentration of 2.0 mM is optimal for most PCR products generated with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. When used at a final concentration of 1X, the Q5 Reaction Buffer provides the optimal Mg++concentration.
Amplification of some difficult targets, like GC-rich sequences, may be improved by the addition of 1X Q5 High GC Enhancer. The Q5 High GC Enhancer is not a buffer and should not be used alone. It should be added only to reactions with the Q5 Reaction Buffer when other conditions have failed.
7. Deoxynucleotides:  The final concentration of dNTPs is typically 200 μM of each deoxynucleotide. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase cannot incorporate dUTP and is not recommended for use with uracil-containing primers or templates.
8. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase concentration: We generally recommend using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase at a final concentration of 20 units/ml (1.0 unit/50 μl reaction). However, the optimal concentration of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase may vary from 10–40 units/ml (0.5–2 units/50 μl reaction) depending on amplicon length and difficulty. Do not exceed 2 units/50 μl reaction, especially for amplicons longer than 5 kb.
9. Buffers: The 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer provided with the enzyme is recommended as the first-choice buffer for robust, high-fidelity amplification. For difficult amplicons, such as GC-rich templates or those with secondary structure, the addition of the Q5 High GC Enhancer can improve reaction performance. The 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer is detergent-free and contains 2.0 mM MgCl2 at the final (1X) concentration.
10. Denaturation: An initial denaturation of 30 seconds at 98°C is sufficient for most amplicons from pure DNA templates. Longer denaturation times can be used (up to 3 minutes) for templates that require it.
During thermocycling, the denaturation step should be kept to a minimum. Typically, a 5–10 second denaturation at 98°C is recommended for most templates.
11. Annealing: Optimal annealing temperatures for Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase tend to be higher than for other PCR polymerases. The NE"

We have therefore designed and tested two promoters based on the NemR response described above. These are parts ( BBa_K1398004 ) and ( BBa_K1398007 ). BBa_K1398004 includes the entire region upstream of the nemR coding sequence, placed in front of our reporter gene, iLOV. BBa_K1398007 instead uses the specific sequence known to be the NemR binding site, and places it between the -35 and -10 sections of a high-level constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 developed as part of the Anderson Collection of promoters. See Composite Parts for a deconstruction of each part.
We observed the change in production of the fluorescent protein iLOV at varying concentrations of TNT and NG. We did this by measuring the growth and fluorescence of 200ul cultures on a 96-well plate. We found that BBa_K1398004 appears to express protein constitutively relative to growth, while BBa_K1398007 had increased expression in response to higher levels of TNT.
The Project: Testing the sensitivity of our promoters to TNT/NG
Experimental Overview
We have tested how well our promoters responded to non-lethal doses of TNT and nitroglycerin by observing the change in fluorescence over time in a fresh culture after a set volume of the chemical had been added. A set volume of overnight culture was added to MYE media in a 96 well plate, as well as a volume of TNT/NG. By using a 96-well plate we were able to massively increase the range of concentrations of compounds we were able to test. The information used to find out lethal and non-lethal levels of TNT came from our studies into The Toxicity of TNT and Nitroglycerin to E. coli .
Throughout this experiment several strains of E. coli were used. 004- and 007-Top10 were being tested for their fluorescence in response to TNT/NG. WT-Top10 cells were used as a negative control, to ensure we weren’t recording any natural fluorescence of Top10. GFP-Top10 was used a positive control to ensure we recorded the fluorescence of the cultures correctly. As MYE media was used to grow the cultures it was also used a negative control, to ensure we weren’t measuring any fluorescence from the media.
Experiment One: Is iLOV fluorescent when expressed in E. coli?
Experiment Two: Are our promoters functional with and/or without TNT?

Tongji-Software,2018,Team:Tongji-Software#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," biochemical production should coincide with the central metabolic pathway of chassis cells as much as possible to get high yield according to the experience in experimenting. It inspired us that we could design a scoring method based on the coincidence of the pathway to be evaluated and the core metabolic pathway in chassis cell.

Fig. 14. Prof.Yang show us around and help us get to know more about metabolic engineering. Improvement in pathway ranking: We integrated the new pathway ranking method into our previous criteria, which meets our users’ needs better. Also, we found that the verified pathways in papers had a higher score in software assessment.Check it in Validation . 3. Organism recommendation Inspiration from iGEMers: We attended the iGEM Eurasian meet-up in August and communicated a lot with other iGEM teams. Through those communications, we learned that most of them faced the problem of organism selection in pathway engineering. It inspired us to add a new function, organism recommendation to make our software more practical.
Fig. 15. Other iGEM teams came to our poster and proposed advice to us. Improvement: Based on this human practice, we develop a model to scoring each microorganism. After ranking all those score, we provide users with top five organisms to choose. At the same time, related information about organism and pathway are optional to get. 4. SMILES Comparison Inspiration from R&D staffs in WuXi AppTech: Original thinking about SMILES comparison is derived from our visits to WuXi AppTec. Experts of WuXi AppTec proposed an idea to us. They said that sometimes their company got or designed a novel compound which did not exist in current database, and they want to find a possible way to synthesize it. So it came to our mind that what if we could compare the similarity between different compounds and select the most similar compound as a trigger to help us design new synthetic pathway, which can be very useful in small molecular drug discovery and synthesis.
Fig. 16. Original thinking about SMILES comparison is derived from our visits to WuXi AppTec. Experts of WuXi AppTec proposed an idea to us. Improvement: We added a new function called SMILES Comparison into Alpha Ant. First we convert user’s input SMILES into molecular fingerprints by using RDkit toolbox. Then we compute similarity score between input compound and compound in databases by comparing their fingerprints. At last, we offer the similarity score and ranking list to users.

Extracellular enzyme scaffold
Overview
A cell-associated protein scaffold which could accommodate various enzymes or binding proteins can create a cellular assembly line by drastically reducing inefficiencies of product and reactant diffusion and by aligning binding sites to targets.  This concept is what makes the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum and other organisms so efficient at breaking down cellulose.  See the review by Schwarz for an overview of this system.  A protein known as scaffoldin is a consistent part of each cellulosome, and provides the basic structure to which each catalytic enzyme attaches.  In many cases a cohesin module can bind a wide range of proteins to the scaffoldin, and a dockerin module binds the scaffoldin to the cell surface.  If we could export the scaffoldin and a dockerin module to E. coli, it may be possible to add the cohesin domain to the non-catalytic regions of desirable enzymes and create a synthetic ""reaction line.""
Problem areas
Protein folding may be quite different in E. coli, especially from thermophilic source organisms.
The dockerin module binds to the cell wall of the gram positive source organisms, which ecoli of course doesn't have...
Integrating a foreign cohesin domain into native enzymes is in the realm of protein engineering, with which I am not familiar

Project Pneumosensor Abstract
Figure 1. Pneumosensor Overview Diagram
Quorem-sensing peptide CSP produced by S. pneumoniae is detected by the Detection Module; the response regulator ComE links the Detection Module to the σx Promoters Module which ultimately drives the expression of GFP.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths every year mostly in developing countries where vaccination      is unaffordable (World Health Organization, 2014). Current methods used for diagnosis of pneumococcal diseases include X-ray imaging of chest, PCR assay using blood and Gram stain using sputum (Muench, D. F., 2014). They require sophisticated equipments, help from physicians or laboratory settings, all of which are limited to people in third world countries. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, we are engineering an E. coli ""Pneumosensor"", that will      work inside as an in vitro diagnostic device. Such a device should provide diagnosis result in absence of laboratories, medical equipments or doctors, making it more accessible for the people. Through this cheaper and easier diagnosis method, people can prepare themselves better against the      transmission and adversity of S. pneumoniae.
Pneumosensor has a rewired comCDE signal transduction pathway native to S. pneumoniae that detects     autoinducer molecules released specifically by S. pneumoniae. Upon detection of Streptococcus pneumonia, Pneumosensor will produce a fluorescence signal. Apart from that, Pneumosensor is also equipped with a new promoter, Com-Box promoter, for the specific and tight regulation of target gene expression in E. coli.

In the same way, we conduct a series of experiment to confirm that our cellubiose-utilizing pathway also worked.
For the cellulose plasmid, we integrate cellubiose-degrading gene CDT and GH-1 into pYC230 by Gibson.

We introduce the plasmid into S.cerevisiae EBY100 and construct the cellubiose-utilize strain successfully and then test the growth rate of both our recombinant strain and negative control.
We cultivate the EBY100(CDT-GH1) and the EBY100(control) in SC adding 2% cellubiose as the sole carbon source, adjusting initial OD600 about 1，and placing in the shaking incubator of 30℃，180rpm to ferment.
Using HPLC we detect the changing concentration of cellubiose. The result shows that the concentration of cellubiose decrease with time, indicating a well utilization of cellubiose.
The following chart shows of both our recombinant strain (left) and negative control (right).
To examine the production of ethanol, we use the SBA-Biosensor, the same as in the xylose pathway.

Grow 1-5 mL culture overnight in a 10-20 mL                             culture tube.
Centrifuge at 10.000 x g for 1minute at room                             temperature. Decant or aspirate and discard the                             culture media.
Add 250 ul Solution I mixed with RNase A.                             Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly.                             Transfer suspension into a new 1.5mL                             microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 ul Solutions II. Invert and gently                             rotate the tube several times to obtain a clear                             lysate. A 2-3 minute incubation may be necessary.                             Avoid vigorous mixing and do not exceed a 5 minute                             incubation.
Add 350 ul Solution III. Immediately invert                             several times until a flocculent white precipitate                             forms. Centrifuge at maximum speed (>13.000xg)                             for 10 minutes. A compact white pellet will form.                             Promptly proceed to the next step.
Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL                             Collection tube.
Transfer the cleared supernatant from Step 6                             CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind DNA Mini                             Column. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.                             Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection                             tube.
Add 500 ul HBC Buffer diluted with                             isopropanol
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.                             Discard the filtrate and reuse collection                             tube.

Maya 2012 couldn't open the Ferritin file created in Maya 2014. So I switched to Maya 2014 and now everything worked fine.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
The modelling is finished for now; until data from our experiments start to coming in, there is nothing to model. To help prepare the experiments I was spending time studying experimental design and analysis techniques, with focus on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and factorial design. The book I had chosen to study from was Montgomery's Design and Analysis of Experiments textbook.
Week 10: July 1 - July 5
After talking to Taylor it has been determined that we shall do a factorial design to investigate the effects of concentration and PH on the magneto-ferritin we will prepare in our lab. The goal is to quickly find better operating conditions to move on to next stages of the experiment. But not until the raw materials has arrived and prepared, so far I can only try to learn more about factorial design.
It has been decided that for the modelling in Autodesk Maya, we shall use the plug-in ePMV, which is only available for 2013 as the latest version. So installing both Maya 2013 and ePMV. Our vision is to simulate the bonding between parts, so I was studying dynamics and other related techniques in Maya as well.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
This week's focus has been on Maya. Mostly figuring out how to import protein data base files (.pdb) and how to install and use various extensions in ePMV. I found out that the ePMV website doesn't help much but YouTube has wonderful video tutorials on ePMV.
Cesar complained about he can't import ferritin sphere into Maya. I tried and it took me about 4 minutes to load the protein database file. To change the color scheme takes further 40 seconds at least. The resulting Maya file can be as large as 50 MB, sometimes 100 MB more.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
Kept working on Maya. Now all parts of the assembly have been loaded to Maya and ribbon, coarse surface, surface and atom models have been constructed. We were trying to print the modelled scenes from Maya, by rendering the scenes to images. But so far we have no success; all rendering methods in Maya resulted in poor images that we can't visualize the 3D structure. Sometimes the colors were lost resulted in a region of red surface. This problem occurred"

Fig 1.2 Number of teams who did human practice from 2008-2013
The graph shows the percentage change of teams who did human practice for the period from 2008 to 2013. It can be clearly seen that there has been a large increase in the percentage of iGEM teams who participated in human practice.
The percentage of teams who did human practice has risen considerably over the time period. In 2008 there were nearly 80 percent of the teams who did not participate in human practice. This percentage decreased to approximately 40 percent in 2010, and then dropped dramatically to 5 percent only after three years. Since 2008 there has been a steady increase in the number of the teams who participated in human practice, with around 20 teams increase annually.
There are multiple reasons for this phenomenon. First of all, it could be caused by the increase of interest towards human practice within the iGEM participants. With the rapid development of synthetic biology, promoting the correct information about this area of science became important. Since the main goal of human practice is to promote synthetic biology and explore different topics towards the work, students are willing to promote synthetic biology in creative ways through human practice.
Secondly, the increasing trend in human practice may have been led by emphasis on human practice by the iGEM headquarters. Human practice is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public. The value of human practice has been increasing recognized with the abrupt emergence of issues regarding bioterrorism. Furthermore, being able to communicate is as equally important as doing the lab work.  For the reasons mentioned above, the role of human practice grew in iGEM.
To sum up, human practice has become an increasingly popular destination for iGEM teams, especially in recent years.

The pie chart above represents the percentage of projects done for each type. While each team has a different way to refer to their projects, all the projects were classified into 17 categories for the sake of this analysis.
Talks seem to be the majority of the types done in the past. 288 talks were delivered from year 2008 to 2013, taking 21% of the entire projects. 11% of the projects were performed in the form of survey, becoming the second largest portion. Workshops and articles were the third biggest contributors, scoring 145 and 143 times respectively, taking 10% each of the entire projects. Books and Business were the least"

Welcome to iGEM Aachen 2016
Toxicological Assessment
In order to evaluate the safety of our LIPs, we made a toxicological assessment, considering how humans and the environment could be affected when getting in touch with it and how probable an exposure is. We collected all data we could on the substance we want to replace. Furthermore, we examined the cleavage product of the protection group we intended to use. We compared the required amounts of chemicals with the existing solution to the amount that would be needed for ours as well as the dangers those substances pose.
Exposure
In our daily lives we get in touch with the contents of liquid washing detergents in several situations:
A. Production
During production of washing detergents, the factory workers are potentially exposed to high doses of the inhibited protease. There is a risk of dermal contact and inhaling the compounds.
B. Home usage
When washing at home the washing detergent can be spilled onto the skin of user. Thereafter residues of the washing liquid can remain in the clothes because of incomplete rinsing and cause dermal exposure.
C. Drinking water
Waterborne substances like boric acid, which cannot be filtered out in purification plants expose consumers via their drinking water.

“Scientific pursuit is an end in and of itself.  The vast majority of objections to this kind of work stem from irrational fears and high handed moralizing”
Pete, 39, Molecular Biologist
“While there is a lot of ethically centred regulation and legislation in biological study, there will doubtlessly need to be some more, tailored to the particulars of synthetic biology. Local states would be worse than useless in dealing with regulation; any ideas would be lost in a mass of bureaucracy.  Hospitals and Institutes would be best to operate on personal guidelines, while complying with a national set of legislation.  I think that ethics boards are often unsuited for a project remit.  A solution could be an empty seat on an ethics board to be filled by a specialist in the area the work covers to contribute their expertise to an issue.  An example would be a recent project of mine concerning public health on social networking sites and I think that none of the members of the ethics board were suited to grasping the particulars of these forms of interaction, which did to some extent impede our work.  That said, I don’t think science should be controlled by public opinion.  Most people don’t understand but subsequently form opinions, making working with the “general public” quite difficult at times.  There is a great level of media hype and misinformation, driven by profit rather than a desire to tell the facts of an issue.  These fears also are present and inflated by popular culture, such as constant sci-fi dystopias which must at some level permeate individual’s feelings about many new areas of research.  However, there are some things in the industry that I feel are beyond what I’d call ethical.  Australian companies going to third world countries to do research they wouldn’t get permission to do here for example.  Another would be a recent thing here where a group wanted to recreate the polio virus and when rejected, kicked up a fuss about ‘violation of scientific goals’ which I feel is deluded nonsense.  Such research should always have a purpose beyond the design remit and be driven by a sociological context than privatised motivation or profit.”

Groningen,2017,Team:Groningen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," product, we performed several colony PCR's on the resulting colonies. We did this with the same primers that were used to construct all the separate fragments for the gibson assembly (see left gel). Based on the gel we selected two colonies for which we were most confident that they contained the correct construct. After sequencing it turned out that the I473F gblock fragment of the gene contained the wrong sequence (see figure below). Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to repeat the construction of the biobrick compatible hCas9 operon.
Besides the biobrick compatible hCas9 operon, we also wanted to create the tracrRNA. We created a tracrRNA under the constitutive pUSP45 promoter, which is also submitted as one of our parts BBA_K2361003 . We first checked it on gel (see right gel) before it was sent for sequencing for verification.
Considerations for replicating the experiments
To repeat the experiment, we would suggest to adopt a different strategy. The segment of the gene for which the I473F gblock coded could also be obtained from the pRH180 plasmid, which already contains the I473F mutation. This can be done in combination with the unaltered parts of the hCas9 operon gene. So, a gibson assembly with only two fragments would have to be performed. The prohibited EcoRI site could be removed with quick-change PCR.
Future plans for the project
First a working version of the hCas9 operon has to be created. To experimentally experimentally validate that the hCas9 operon an on plate phage assay could be performed. The pUSP45 tracrRNA could be experimentally validated in the same way, either with our own hCas9 operon or with another Cas9 operon.

This 50ml of LB (in a 100ml flask) was placed in the orbital incubator for overnight growth at 37ºC.
2) Second attempt at ligating together cadmium sensor
a) Digesting the BBa_J33206 backbone and cadA promoter
Because the attempts to transform E. coli with the ligated cadmium-sensor didn't work, the Metal Sensing team faced having to carry out the ligation again. The first step is to digest some more arsR backbone (BBa_J33206 without promoter) and cadA promoter with BamHI and NheI. The digests were allowed to run for 3 hours at 37ºC (regulated by water bath). The reactions were made up of the following:
20ul of DNA
5ul of 10x FastDigest buffer
1ul of FastDigest BamHI restriction enzyme
1ul of FastDigest NheI restriction enzyme
23ul of sterile distilled water
The digests were then cleaned up using Sigma-Aldrich's GenElute PCR clean-up kit with it's accompanying protocol; the resulting DNA was then stored in the -20C freezer.
b) Ligating the BBa_J33206 backbone with cadA promoter
Following the General Meeting on 16/09/09 , it was decided that the production of the cadmium-sensor would be put on hold and more concentration will be placed on the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick. The cadmium-sensor is being synthesized and will arrive shortly anyway.

For example, the sgRNA may bind with complementary sequence with one or two incompatible base pair. However, the corresponding T7 polymerase will continue to reunion and give out positive output. In this way, our system will generate a lot false-positive result in detecting point mutation or SNP because it will confuse the normal sequence and cancer sequence with one or two mutations. However, fused gene can obviate this problem. Fused ctDNA composed of two fused normal DNA, which means that if we design our two sgRNA binding sites separately in two sequence or located in the part they connected to with each other, we can avoid off-target effect of the report system. The EML4-ALK fused gene has two variants (A and B).

Also, there are other limits in selecting sgRNA binding site. First, it needs a PAM site next to it(NGG). Also, the distance between a pair of sites(SpaceDistance) should either too close or too distant(5-35 is desirable, as suggested by Peking University), so the choices of sites are further limited. First, we wrote a computer program to find all PAM site and find out of the combination with the distance between them. Computer stimulation for Variant A

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

Rational Plasmid Design and Pathway Library
Rational design of plasmids
Synthetic biology proceeded significantly in recent years and we have much knowledge about rational design of circuits and pathways.   Nevertheless, failures and unexpected outcomes slowdown scientific progress.   To tackle this issue, we decided to follow two approaches. On the one hand we planned to model our pathway and predict a – theoretically – optimal pathway, which we can then construct and test.   And on the other hand, we decided to build additionally to this particular pathway a whole library of many variations of this pathway with little differences.   In this way we create many producer strains in parallel and speed up the metabolic engineering workflow.  Our rational approach bases on a Michaelis-Menton-based metabolic analysis. For more details see our metabolic model .   Since there are no stochiometric flux data about V. natriegens yet, we used the data from E. coli, which has a very comparable metabolome to V. natriegens (citation needed).   For the model we only considered acc from C. glutamicum and mcr from C. aurantiacus, because they were from our point of view the most promising ones.   The model predicted, that
Acc
is the rate limiting enzyme in the pathway and has to be expressed ten times stronger than
Mcr
.   We used the promoter characterization data, obtained from our part collection team (For more details see the section about characterization of the promoters of our Marburg Collection) and introduced them into the model.   The resulting prediction was, that we have to use the promoter J23106 for acc and J2310 for mcr. Therefore, we designed the pathway plasmid according to this model.   We built the plasmid based on the Marburg Collection with 4 transcriptional units. For the ori we chose ColEI, which has a broad host range and a high copy number in V. n"

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Project#Future#Scaffold_-_-_TEXT.html,"ARNA tool of Freiburg RNA Tools . The software accurately depicts what the d0 structure looks like in the literature, therefore it was a reliable program which could be used to modify and visualize RNA secondary structures.
Fig. 4. Modifications to the d0 sequence were made by replacing the PP7 and MS2 binding sites with WT PUF-PIN and 6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN binding sites.
Fig. 5. The resulting scaffold of the changed sequence.
Fig. 6. The scaffold was further modified after research suggested that PUF binds best to nucleotides with an angle of curvature similar to its own of approximately 20o turn per repeat [3]. The hairpin loops were changed in order to accommodate this from 8 nucleotides to 18 nucleotides achieving a 20o turn per nucleotide effect. Sequences of the stem loop were further modified in order to keep GC content from being too high and to make a more stable structure. This DNA sequence was then synthesized through IDT’s miniGENE option.
Fig. 7. The final structure of the scaffold used in the project.
Fig. 8.[1] The figure above shows an important theoretical concept of the RNA scaffold. Assuming that the RNA binding proteins bind specifically, a spatial control of “cargo” can be made to serve various functions. In our project, we envisioned enzymes of the piceatannol pathway to churn out product due to the spatial proximity of one enzyme next to another, yielding increased reaction kinetics. However, in order to prove that such a concept is possible, a few assays need to be done.
Fig. 9.[1] A gel-shift in-vitro assay as the one pictured would properly demonstrate that distinct RNA binding proteins are binding to the scaffold and thus proper scaffold functioning. With addition of the scaffold, each separate binding protein causes a change in overall size resulting in a different band from each protein by itself. Due to assay shown being ran on a native gel, secondary structures and changes in electronegative affinities might explain the unusual effect of larger constructs being localized further down the gel.
Fig. 10.[2] This figure is shown from the Prof. Wang’s lab in UNC which characterized PUF-PIN (PIN being a non-specific endonuclease) functioning at various pH levels. A similar assay with our scaffold would show specific binding of PUF to its destined sites on the scaffold due to the presence of RNA fragments of expected lengths.

Design
To avoid having to test scFvs, which would significantly increase the amount of work needed, we will use scFv sequences that have already been characterized. Our antigen of choice is the HER2 receptor, due to the large body of research surrounding this biomarker and its overexpression in 20-25% of breast cancers (Gianni et al., 2012).
The design of our BiME followed the standard pattern of design laid out for BiTE using two ScFvs connected by a polypeptide linker (Baeuerle and Reinhardt, 2009). Thus, our first binding domain is specific to the HER2 receptor. The other binding domain of our BiME antibody is specific to the notch receptor domain, which in this case is populated by the GCN4 peptide sequence.  The HER2 scFv was based off the pACgp67B-Her2 vector plasmid, a high affinity ScFv found on Addgene which is designed to bind to human ERBB2 class molecules, which includes HER2. The scFv region was identified and the polyhistidine tail removed from the sequence (Song et al., 2005). This was then used as the first portion of the BiME antibody sequence. The linker sequence is a double length repeat of the standard (GGGGS)3 linker, creating a (GGGGS)6 linker for greater flexibility between the two binding domains (Trinh et al., 2004). The scFv for he GCN4 peptide sequence was then based off the pHR-scFvGCN4-sfGFP-GB1-NLS-dWPRE plasmid on addgene, which contained the scFV binding domain fused to  GFP and the Large T-Antigen nuclear localization signal (Tanenbaum et al., 2014). The GFP was removed  through  cross-referencing with the DNA and protein sequences of GFP (Prasher et al., 1992), and the nuclear localization signal was retained through the same manner (Hübner et al., 1997). The 6 histidine polyhistidine tail from the HER2 scFv was added to the end of the GCN4 sequence, before the nuclear localization signal. A diagram of the entire BiME structure can be seen below.

Melbourne
We assisted Melbourne with their model, and they helped us to distribute our survey in Australia in return.
Modelling
As part of our collaboration with the Melbourne iGEM team, we implemented an earlier version of the outer model on MATLAB, with the architecture to include their own interaction processes. The Melbourne iGEM team aims to increase the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway using their star peptide. After the completion of our combined model, the Melbourne team realized that the products from one enzyme reaction on one star peptide node do not show a clear flow towards the node of the other enzyme reaction, where they will be consumed. Otherwise, the contour lines would trace a pattern that contains both nodes (the contour lines surrounding each node will be joined). This flow was an assumption that the Melbourne team made in the formulation of their project. More simulations are needed to verify the accuracy of that assumption. In exchange for our assistance with the diffusion dynamics of their system, the Melbourne team assisted us with validating the diffusion solver of the RIOT Model’s inner model component. We provided a test case where lactate was released from the center of the bacteria, with an impermeable bacteria membrane. The Melbourne team showed that the concentration field within the bacteria homogenized within 200 milliseconds (see Figure below), which is what one would expect. This validated the diffusion component of our inner model.

For each hit, the output of Promotersweep contains the position of the motive relative to the TSS. So far we were able to analyse 4395 different promoter sequences, which hold 29966 TFBS in total.

The HEARTBEAT-database
In order to retrieve the information computed by promotersweep as fast as possible we decided to develop a database structure based on MySQL (My systems query language) [20] . MySQL is one of the most popular relational database management systems. It offers not only a language to set up a hierarchical database but also an interface for easy manipulation of data. The advantage of MySQL is its very intuitive command language and the table structure which helps to minimize redundant data. Simple queries are written in a “SELECT - FROM - WHERE” format. With SELECT value all requested columns are specified. The FROM value calls the corresponding table and WHERE allows a more accurate selection. For our database the average query duration is below 200 ms. This enabled us to provide a fluent online access of HEARTBEAT through the HEARTBEAT GUI . Our data is stored in the tables “Main_Info” and “Gene_Info”. Main_Info contains all necessary data to define the location, binding motive and quality of a TFBS, whereas Gene_Info offers additional information for the gene as well as several gene annotations, where the TFBS is located on. In table 1 and 2 the table structure is shown for Main_Info and Gene_Info.

By studying interactions between the 10 constructed Senders and F2620, we were able to analyze the systems for potential orthogonality. The resulting part collection allows direct comparison in AHL induction between multiple systems. The Part Numbers for these Senders are BBa_K2033000 , BBa_K2033002 , BBa_K2033004 , BBa_K2033006 , BBa_K2033008 , which correspond to the Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer, and Sin systems.  We believe that this Part Collection is a valuable addition to the registry, because while small in size, it contributes 5 Senders to the registry which contains around 6 Senders. In addition, this will add information about these new systems to a well-characterized and widely-used part in F2620. Not only will this determine interactions between systems, but also, provide characterization information for any future quorum sensing research involving those systems.
We also created Senders for the Esa, Las, Lux, Rhl, and Rpa systems, which already exist in the registry. These correspond to the following parts:
EsaI- BBa_K1670004
LasI- Bba_C0178
LuxI- BBa_C0161
RhlI- BBa_C0170
RpaI- BBa_K1421006
We added the induction data that we collected for these systems to their respective parts pages, which provides information on their compatibility with F2620.

Conclusions
The higher expression of the fluorescence, the stronger of the promoter. The strength of the promoter also affects the growth of the cells: the growth rate of high promoter is slow, which can be seen from the figure 3 and 4. Test device 3 showed the highest fluorescence expression during growth, while it grew a bit of slower than others. All the devices grew well, but only device 3, 5 and 6 can express fluorescence efficiently.
What’s more, the fluorescence per OD and the fluorescence per particle of all the devices decreased according to the data from the table 6 and 7. That is to say, with the increase of cell concentration, the total amount of fluorescence increased, but the fluorescence volume per unit cell decreased.

7)  Connecting to a Database
Some of  Clotho's most interesting features can only be utilized once we've connected to  a database.  Let's try setting up a  mySQL connection: on the Main Toolbar select ""PoBoL based mySQL"" from  the I/O drop down menu.  This should  bring up the mySQL/PoBoL Configuration window.   The first two boxes are username and password, but don't put anything in  them just yet.  First, select the ""Create New  Connection"" tab,  and enter the following information:
Name:
Host:
Port:
Database:
After  you're done, click ""Create"" and go to the ""Existing  Connections"" tab.  Select the  connection you just made from the ""Connection Available"" drop down  menu.  In the appropriate boxes, put in  the username **USERNAME** and password **PASSWORD**.  Then click ""Set as    Next, we'll setup the PoBoL binding file: click the ""View PoBoL  Binding"" button, and it should bring up the PoBoL Binding window.
We will be providing information to a dummy database for those that are serious about looking at Clotho further. Please contact us at: clothodevelopment AT googlegroups DOT com with the subject ""Dummy Database Information Request"" for more. Be sure to include your name, contact information, and a short description of why you would like access. <p>

Test PCR for specificity of DarRrev Primer/contamination of DarRrev PCR reactions
 
- Neg. control was not negative --> probably, primers or water are contaminated with M. smegmatis chrom.DNA (most likely because of order of pipetting the reactions) or they are non-specific generating another PCR product of the same size as DarRrev (seems very unlikely)
- Test PCR:
- 3 reactions, all reactions were pipetted individually (no mastermix)
- Old water from yesterday and old primer dilutions (1:20) from yesterday used (reaction A)
- Old water from yesterday and new primer dilutions (1:20) from today used (reaction B)
- New water from today and new primer dilutions 1:20 from today used (reaction C)
- All 3 reactions had the same composition as the neg. control reaction yesterday
- PCR program was the same as yesterday
- Gel run:
1%-agarose-1xTAE gel
Loading of 3 µl 2 log ladder as a marker
Loading of 4 µl PCR reaction (A, B, C or neg. control from yesterday’s PCR) + 1 µl 5xLD
Loading of 3 µl purified DarRrev PCR product (from yesterday) + 1 µl dH2O + 1 µl 5xLD
Run at 100 V
EtBr staining + destaining with water
UV detection
Loading: 2 log ladder/reaction A/reaction B/reaction C/neg. control from yesterday/purified DarRrev PCR product from yesterday/ 2 log ladder/ reaction A/reaction B/reaction C/neg. control from yesterday/purified DarR PCR product from yesterday/ 2 log ladder
-> The PCR product (ca. 630 bp + 2x 30bp = 690 bp) is only seen, when all old components are used, but not if new primers and old water are used --> old primer dilutions are contaminated --> dilutions thrown away
-> Since DarRrev-no template control was apparently positive because of not exchanging the pipet tip before adding the primers, the insert obtained from yesterday’s PCR will be further used for cloning…

In addition, with the interaction with biological company, we learned about the current situation in the policy and industry of viruses or exosomes in medicine. As to the policy aspect, we learned that in order to boost the development of new therapy, the government policies regarding the examination and approval of viruses as drugs is rather slack now. But some detailed tests as the intracellular remain of viral DNA or proteins or the endotoxin should be carried out strictly. Still, with the irreplaceable advantages, the viruses are still our top choice in gene therapy. To our relief, with the development of technology, the cost of developing is lower than before, which means that it is a better era of gene therapy. After the visit, we were convinced that what we were doing was greatly potential and good for the world.
CCiC
Conference of China iGEMer Community is a national iGEM communication summit hosted by Chinese universities. It was founded with the aim of idea-sharing, communication and cooperation among iGEM teams, and promoting high-level discussion of advanced issues pertaining to the promotion of international Biosynthesis issues. CCiC schedule simulates that of iGEM Giant Jamboree, with each undergraduate team presenting their project and display posters, seeking out to be an academic conversation and experience sharing conference, while providing an interactive platform for training teams at the same time.
In September this year, we participated in the annual CCiC summit held in ShanghaiTech University. There, we met more than 60 teams from all over China. While displaying our poster, we had close talks with numerous teams, introducing the project design and progress, and shared our achievements and puzzles when working on the project. From the discussion, we took their advice and learned from their experience to improve our project. For instance, there was a team producing their experiments without adequate control groups, decreasing the accuracy of the experiment and even bringing a failure of the project. So, we checked our project again and won the Best Presentation Award in the end.
Besides, we attended a communication meeting with iGEM teams in Nanjing held at Nanjing University. During this exchange, we communicated with Pro. Haoqian Zhang and shared experimental stories with several teams. By listening to diverse novel ideas, we marveled at all of the brilliant thoughts and were constantly developing our own project ideas.

urg1 promoter (Part: BBa_K510032 ): Uracil-regulable urg1 promoter that allows tight expression control of ectopic genes with otherwise minimal side effects on genome-wide gene expression. Transcription is activated after 5 minutes of uracil addition and peaks within 30 minutes. Similarly, transcription rapidly drops after transfer to medium without uracil. ( Watt et al, 2008)
T adh1-tetO2 (Part: BBa_K510030 ): It is composed of two parts. The first one is adh1 terminator, which functions as an insulator or boundary for transcription isolation. The second one is formed by two tetR operator sequences (tetO2), of 19 nucleotides each one, alternated with spacers. This composite part should be inserted just in front of a promoter, in order to control its regulations by generating a nucleated structure of heterochromatinic DNA, together with its associated part, tetO4-terminator. Compaction of DNA is due to binding of engineered silencing proteins (tetR+heterochromatin forming protein) to tetO sequences.
GFP-Tadh1-tetO4-Tact1 (Part: BBa_K510031 ): This composite part is formed by four main elements: GFP, adh1 terminator, tetO4 and act1 terminator. Coding sequence of GFP reporter protein is followed by the transcriptional terminator of adh1 gene. The next part is denominated tetO4, that consist of four 19 nucleotices tetR operator sequences, alternated with spacers. And the last part is the Act1 transcriptional terminator that function as insulator. This part should be interted behind a promoter. In association with Tadh1-tet"

Today the new prefix primer (Cage Prefix #2) came in. We resuspended it, made more agarose gels,  and ran a PCR with the first-round product containing the his-tag, the new prefix primer, and the suffix. We ran the PCR product on a gel, but got absolutely no bands at all. Tomorrow we will run another PCR with the new prefix primer and the first round suffix to see verify if the new prefix primer works. If it does, then the only problem is still the second suffix primer.

Phillip's notes
Introduction:  A PCR will be done to amplify the gBlock with the primers that incorporate NdeI and XhoI for pET22b.  This is in order to determine if a similar problem persists with the non-specific band and low product yield.  In addition, buffers for cell lysis will be prepared if the reagents are available.
Procedures:
PCR amplification with primers for pET22b:
Using the NEB Tm calculator, the annealing temperatures chosen were 64C, 68C, and 72C.  The following reaction components were combined in a mastermix, and 24uL were aliquotted to 3 reaction tubes. 5x Q5 buffer, 5uL 2mM dNTP, 7.5uL 20uM primer for pET22b forward, 1.875uL 20uM primer for pET22b reverse, 1.875uL 1ng/uL template, 0.75uL Q5 polymerase, 0.75uL ddH2O, 45.75uL
The thermocycler conditions were the same as on 07/24/15.  The PCR product was then ran on a 1% agarose gel for 20 minutes.

vir promoter part, <partinfo>K389017</partinfo>: <partinfo>K389017 SpecifiedComponents</partinfo>
composite
This is a complete VirA/G signaling system without a reporter gene, so any gene of interest can be assembled to a vir promoter. We assembled some sensitivity tuners and a luciferase gene behind this BioBrick, so we get an enhanced luciferase signal (e.g. in part <partinfo>K389421</partinfo>).
tightly controlled lac operator, <partinfo>K389050</partinfo>: <partinfo>K389050 SpecifiedComponents</partinfo>
composite
A lac operator is combined with a lacIq so there is always enough lacI to repress the lac operator. The system is still inducible with IPTG but it has a low basal transcription (in theory). This part should be used to test the sensitivity of the luciferase BioBrick <partinfo>K389004</partinfo> and compare it to the sensitivity of the mRFP BioBrick <partinfo>E1010</partinfo>. But the part did not work as expected - it had a very high basal expression. The problem is probably the lacI gene <partinfo>C0012</partinfo> from the registry which has a degradation tag. Either this tag leads to that quick degradation, that the lacI repressor cannot work as a repressor anymore or the repressor itself does not work properly.
tightly controlled lac operator + luc, <partinfo>K389051</partinfo>: <partinfo>K389051 SpecifiedComponents</partinfo>
composite
The part <partinfo>K389050</partinfo> is combined with a luciferase gene as reporter. But <partinfo>K389050</partinfo> does not work as expected so this part could not be used for its original purpose (demonstrating the sensitivity of the firefly luciferase).
tightly controlled lac operator + mRFP, <partinfo>K389052</partinfo>: <partinfo>K389052 SpecifiedComponents</partinfo>
composite
The part <partinfo>K389050</partinfo> is combined with a mRFP gene as reporter. But <partinfo>K389050</partinfo> does not work as expected so this part could not be used for its original purpose (comparing the sensitivity of mRFP with the sensitivity of the firefly luciferase).
