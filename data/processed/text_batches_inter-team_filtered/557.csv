Why focus on atmospheric pollutants and especially VOC?
Atmospheric pollution is characterized by the presence of gas and particles (nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, ozone, particles PM10 and PM25, Volatile Organic Compounds, black smoke) in the outside air with harmful impact on human health and/or on the environment. [1] [2]
It is known that pollution has harmful effects on human health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7 million premature deaths are due to atmospheric pollution, equal to one eighth of the world annual deaths. [3] The estimated cost of these premature deaths in WHO countries is $ 1.6 trillion per year. [4]
In France there are 3.5 million people with asthma, 50 000 people suffering from serious respiratory deficiencies, and 150 000 deaths of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. [5] All those diseases originate or at least are aggravated by atmospheric pollution.
In addition to public health issues, these pollutants can have a harmful effect on the environment as they acidify water and soil and decrease plant growth. These changes trigger a decline in agricultural yields and alter aquatic ecosystems. [5]
Atmospheric pollution is an accumulation of complex phenomena. To understand local and regional emissions, meteorological conditions, transport, and pollutant transformation must be considered. [2]
Our team decided to focus on VOCs for several reasons. VOCs are organic chemicals with"

Project Description
Organophosphates are a class of chemical compounds commonly used as pesticides that have also been used as chemical warfare agents (CWAs). Common organophosphate pesticides include glyphosate, a controversial pesticide that the Agency for Research on Cancer declared “a probable human carcinogen.""  Our team is currently working on creating a bacteria that will assist in the degradation of organophosphates, a class of chemical compounds used in many chemical weapons and insecticides. Organophosphates are not only highly dangerous to humans as nerve agents but their prevalent use in insecticides is also a threat to the environment due to many adverse effects and a very slow degradation rate. We believe that in our project we can create a bacteria that will help in creating a safer environment for us and our loved ones and the life around us as well.   So far, we have found pathways that can degrade many organophosphates, including sarin, glyphosate and paraoxon, into a product, para-nitrophenol (PNP) that we can then use to go into the Beta-Kap pathway. The Beta-Ketoadipate pathway is useful in converting aromatic compounds into food sources for bacteria. The Beta-Kap pathway will be useful in degrading the PNP resultant from our bacteria’s initial degradation of organophosphates.

Alkane Sensor
In the production of large chain alkanes for biofuel production, it is crucial for there to be a rapid and accurate diagnostic for comparing production rates in engineered strains of E. coli. To develop an alkane biosensor , genes from Pseudomonas putida and Alcanivorax borkumensis were isolated and constructed into a pair of plasmids which code for proteins that bind to alkanes. This induces a promoter upstream of a red fluorescent protein, which can be detected easily using various methods. Similar to our ethanol sensor , we can find a linear regression by gathering data at different concentrations of n-alkanes, allowing for the quantification of an unknown alkane concentration in a media based upon the level of fluorescence.
Experience
We attempted to use existing alkane sensor parts, K398300 (AlkS) and K398302 (PalkB), submitted by TU-Delft for this system. These genes were taken from Pseudomonas putida and we were unable to express the system sufficiently for our uses. Instead, we extracted the homologous genes from Alkanivorax borkumensis. Due to an internal PstI site, these genes cannot be submitted yet, but we have seen more robust response to alkanes.
One unforeseen issue with this system appears to be metabolic crosstalk. Specifically, it appears this system is repressed by the sugar arabinose. This is seen in figure 2, below. We intend to probe the system biochemically to determine the mechanism by which this acts, since there is no evidence of this in the literature.
Figure 1: In the presence of lactose, the PLac promoter will turn on transcription of alkS, which binds to the n-alkane. This complex then activates the PalkB promoter, which turns on transcription of our fluorescent protein.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Transcriptomics#Barcoding-Library Preparation_-_-_TEXT.html," general, library preparation has one issue which is common across all experiments. The issue is most likely loss of material during bead purification which leads to lower throughout as not all pores are occupied at all times.
Discussion
Library preparation is a complex procedure involving multiple enzymes and purification steps. Decreased efficiency of library preparation can be due to malfunctioning of any of the steps. The major issue in prepared libraries has been low sequencing throughput and low quality of reads. We have therefore tested if the issue is somehow connected to our samples or to the actual library prep. Since preparing library from supplied phage DNA was successful (high quality reads, decent throughput), we concluded that the issue was in fact in our input material. This has later proven to be true due to RNA contamination of the libraries as described in cDNA synthesis.
Even with RNA contamination as the potential explanation for low quality reads (RNA is being sequenced using algorithm for DNA and therefore the bases are not being recognized) the problem of low throughput persisted. Major losses are seen during the library prep (up to 75%). According to Oxford Nanopore, this loss is expected, Question is whether it would be worth to increase input material above the recommendation of the manufacturer to achieve higher throughput.
Sequencing using Oxford Nanopore has been used mainly for long fragments of genomic DNA. In our application we aimed to sequence very short reads (average about 1 kb) of cDNA. As this application is relatively new, we assume the process might not be fully optimized (eg. retention of small fragments by beads, amount of input library, etc.) for our application.
Additional troubleshooting would need to be performed to adjust the protocols provided by Oxford Nanopore to our application, which was unfortunately not possible in the course of this project due to budgetary and time restrictions.
Conclusion
Most issues connected with low sequencing throughput link back to contamination of the library with RNA. If this issue was to be removed, sequencing in sufficient throughput and quality would be possible as shown on the example of sequencing lambda phage gDNA.

Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4.
cIlam protein only forms dimer.
Only cIlam dimer binds with pcIlam gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," is important to be aware of these risks and to think about what can happen, how likely is it that it will happen and if it does happen, what the consequences are. This will give you the possibility to take measures in order to take away the risk or the minimize the potential (negative) consequences on time. There are many different types of risks, with negative consequences or positive consequences. To become successful as a company it is important to minimize the risks with negative consequences and to maximize risks with positive consequences (opportunities). We have used the risk matrix tool to analysis our possible risks with a negative consequence (Figure 7).
Figure 7: Risk matrix
Legal risks
The use of microorganisms is associated with some specific legal risks. First of all, it is important that it is allowed to use our product outside the lab. Therefore, we have to meet several requirements and gain the necessary safety and technology approvals. These requirements can differ per country and there is a risk that we are unable to meet the requirements in one or more countries. This could in the best case delay the market introduction, but in the worst case it could also result in an impossibility to introduce our product into the market. The consequence will probably be major therefore. Fortunately, there are a lot of measures that could be taken in order to minimize the probability this risk occurs. For example, we have to contact the organization that judge applications about the use of our product outside the laboratory in an early stage of the research and development phase. Then we can, if required, still make relatively easy adaptations in our product. However, it is still possible that we want to introduce our product in a later stadium in a foreign market with different rules that makes it impossible to introduce our product into this specific market. Therefore, we consider this risk to be unlikely.
When we are allowed to introduce our product into the market, there is a small change that it appears that our product causes harm to people and/or the environment. For example, any remaining part of the microorganism in our product to which the environment is exposed, could in theory make people sick. The consequences of such events would probably be catastrophic for the company. However, since the organism we use are very weak variants of the E. coli bacterium, the likelihood that this will happen, is considered to be small.
It is also possible that we are not able to patent our product. This automatically would mean that external parties are allowed to produce the biological MLA and this can worsen our competitiveness. We consider this as a possible risk with major consequences.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," chose 25 plasmids to run verification PCRs on (so we only had to use 2 machines, and not 3). The results from the 50 PCRs were unfortunately inconclusive, so I redid them. I let them run in the machines overnight, so they are ready to be run on a gel tomorrow (amazing how 9-10 hours of work can be described with just 4 lines!).

Ran a gel of the varification PCR products Lisa did yesterday. Some bands around 1200 bp and over 3 kb are slightly visible, however they don't look like PCR products. Lisa will redo the PCR tomorrow.
Did a miniprep of the c-colonies 1-13 (except 7 which showed very little growth). Hopefully the minipreps c1-c6 will contain pIGR05 (pBADZ1, RFP), c6-c10 will contain pIGR06 (pBADZ2, RFP) and c11-c13 will contain RFP.
Ran the minipreps on a gel. c11 looks gives a very weak band and no bands are visible in the lane with c13.

Juliet and I did a PCR on pAT15 with primers IG201 and IG202, cleaned it up and ran it on a gel to reconfirm that the insert was correct. It was, so we started a digestion of the PCR product using X and P. We cleaned up the digestion and ran it on a gel to see the concentration. pAT15 is now ready to be ligated to the SPL! :). We also made O/N cultures of pAT12-16 (6 of each, 30 in total).
After the digestion, Manos was ready to help Maya run her samples in the Biolector. Juliet and I helped her set it up, which took alot longer that expected since you have to measure the OD of each sample with the Nanodrop! With Manos' guidance, we loaded their 16 samples in the 48 wells (we did triplicates) and started the measurements.

1.Product Pamphlet：
In order to let the public understand our product in an easy way, we handed out pamphlets. In the pamphlet, we briefly introduced how our product is used, the technology applied, letting them know that Carindex is a genetic engineered product. For the biosafety,  we introduced the kill switch in our gene circuit design in order to introduce the concept of biosafety, and how safe our product.
2. Taiwan Health Insurance System：
Taiwan's health insurance has always been a discussed issue of social policy.
When we conducted the PMR market survey, we found that the general public did not have a rounded understanding on Taiwan's health insurance.
What’s worse is that this leads to the abuse of health insurance system, resulting in the waste of social resources and rising the burden of state finances.
Carindex is expected to be able to contribute to the country's health insurance system, since the users will be able to know and improve their oral condition with it.
Due to the nature of dental caries, they are easily ignored by patients since it don't hurt at the beginning.
Nonetheless, it would be too late to go to the dentist after feeling the pain. The worst condition might end up with doing a tooth implantation, which is painful and costly to the patient and the government.
Carindex can help users on early caries detection so that potential patient can go to the dentist early and cure dental caries before it became serious, which save the health insurance system and the patient time and money.
We want to let the public to learn more about the health insurance system and also having a correct concept about it, so we made a series of detailed introduction about it.
We explained the meaning of health insurance and it's condition in Taiwan over the past few years.
We hope that, this could give the public a correct concept and lead to a better use of the health insurance system.

1. Synthetic Biology Camp:
We set up plans to promote synthetic biology. We went to universities and senior high schools, introduced iGEM, synthetic biology and our project to the students so that they can understand biotechnology as well as the various aspects of the impacts from it. Many students had concerns about genetic engineered product at first, however, after introducing what we are doing and also the kill switch that we designed, we ease their concern. According to the feedbacks we collected after class, most of them grasped a better concept of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and also the biosafety.

Background
Firstly
In order to get a more detailed understanding of what our program means to the world and to be responsible for solving the world's drug resistance problem. We have reviewed a lot of literature on drug resistance and learned a lot of news about drug resistance in the past two years. Finally, we recognize that the problem of drug resistance has become a serious public health problem of international concern, seriously endangering human health. Therefore, our team expects to solve the problem of drug resistance.
Please click here for more details
Secondly
After literature investigation, we know that the problem of bacterial resistance is very serious. In practice, we wanted to learn more about the dangers of drug resistance, and we visited the people's hospital. Doctors told us that for the patients in the hospital, antibiotics are used for most of the symptoms, which aggravates the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. Resistant bacteria are everywhere and getting stronger. With the development of this way, some diseases of human beings may face the situation of no medicine.
The problem of bacterial resistance is a worldwide safety problem, which needs to be solved urgently and there is no better way to solve it at present. He thinks that the idea that we want to solve the problem of bacterial resistance is very meaningful. The doctor's words confirmed our desire to solve the problem of bacterial resistance.
Thirdly
We selected an aquaculture farm in Hangzhou for research. It mainly investigates the content of resistant bacteria in the aquaculture environment and the types of resistance genes contained therein. After the investigation, we found that most common resistance genes exist in the farm environment. If the degradation of a specific resistance gene alone does not solve the problem of a wide range of resistance gene contamination, we believe that we cannot just stop at the most resistant gene in the treatment environment should focus on bigger problems and solve the bacterial resistance problem as thoroughly as possible. After our investigation, we hope to solve the problem of bacterial resistance more, so we changed the experimental plan. For details, please see the results of the wet group; in addition, we collected water samples in the pond next to the farm, the river next to the farm and the river"

With the data generated, we can tell which synthetic biology words people were slowest and fastest to associate with negative, and in another block, faster or slower to associate with positive.
How did we set it up?
We set up the IAT using code graciously offered by PsyToolKit, an online bank of psychological tests and tools. The next step was submitting it to the University of Waterloo’s Office of Research Ethics. We wanted to ensure that we followed governing rules for research with human participants. As well, we wanted to make sure study participants were protected and that our research was conducted in a way that serves the needs of participants and society. In order to achieve this we made sure we made an official research review application to our university’s research ethics board. Once our survey and task got Ethics Approval, we shared the links to our task and consent surveys to our Facebook page. We will run the task until the end of term.
Methods
15 voluntary participants were recruited from Waterloo iGEM’s Facebook page to participate in this study. We assumed that Waterloo iGEM’s diverse range of followers is a reasonable representation of the public. Participants were given an online consent form to read and agree to before participating in the study.
After consenting to the study, participants were given instructions to download the IAT study and complete it. Participants sorted words into categories as they appeared on the screen using the “E” and “I"" keys on the keyboard. The first round was a practice and control round so participants could learn which words are in the biotechnology category and which are in the traditional technology category. Whether the participants had the biotechnology category on the “E” or the “I” key for the first block was random, so as to minimize introducing bias into the experiment.
After pressing a key (“E” for the category on the left, “I” for the category on the right) to sort a word, a smiley face would appear if the word was sorted correctly; a frowny face would appear if the word was sorted incorrectly or not sorted at all within 3000 milliseconds. The second block was entirely the same, with the exception that there was instead be a pleasant word category and an unpleasant word category. The third block was a combination of the first two (two categories will share the same key). The fourth block was the same as the first, with the categories switched to the other key they were not previously on. The fifth block was similar to the third.
After the task was completed participants were directed to a"

Mason Lab Ten-Phase, 500-year plan
The Case for Existence
1.  Assume that humans are the only species or entity with self-awareness of its own extinction.
2.  Assume that existence is essential for any other goal/idea to be accomplished (“existence precedes essence”).
3.  Therefore, humans who wish to accomplish any goal/idea should ensure the existence of our species, and all other species that enable our survival.
Proposed long-term goals of the human species:
Establish habitable environments in multiple star systems, to avoid extinction due to a cataclysmic event in one solar system.
Improve the ability of humans and other species to survive in spaced-based environments or on other planets
Genetic engineering
Requires a “do-not disturb” list for the human genome; regions that cannot or should not be altered
Engineer mammalian insulators that can carry genetic payload safely
Establish long-term safety, efficacy, and functional characterization of genomes which have been engineered
Improved DNA damage detection and repair (vis-à-vis Deinococcus Radiodurans)
Protective technology (Nano-fabrication of radiation absorbers)
Achieve peaceful relations between nations or planets
To accomplish these goals, the Mason Lab pursues an understanding of the human genome through a 50-year plan, with the final elements of the plan (of course) estimated to exceed the lifetimes of the founding members.
Phase 1 (2010-2020)
Experiments that complete the functional annotation of the human genome, specifically experiments that delineate base-by-base examination of those elements which cannot be changed, or those that are most flexible (tolerant of mutations).  We will use comparative, evolutionary functional genomics and an examination of those human diseases that constitute the most aggressive deviations from normal biological function ("

Description
Protein purification is important to both biopharmaceutical production and scientific research. Producing recombinant  proteins with high purity is essential for protein drug-based therapies, protein structural analyses and functional studies. Most currently used protein purification techniques, such as commercial resins conjugated by various ligands, different types of chromatography and ultracentrifugation, require expensive investment, special device or tedious procedure. Meanwhile, they have different flaws in getting purified proteins, such as low specificity, long-term operating procedures and harsh conditions to sacrifice protein activity; thus, many of them, even with their combinations, cannot meet the required protein purity and quality for many applications. For instance, affinity chromatography is reputed for its high affinity, but tightly bound proteins typically require relatively extreme eluting conditions to disassociate from affinity columns; ultracentrifugation or size exclusion separates samples based on molecular weight difference, but they can co-purify other proteins and large molecules of lipid or nuclear acids. Thus, developing fast, easy to operate and economic approaches to purify recombinant proteins with high quality is urgently needed.
Fig.1 Purification progress by using the Nickel column
Our team developed a novel protein purification approach that eliminates most weaknesses of other techniques. Our method is based on the highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation between Spytag (a peptide with 13 amino acids) and Spycatcher (a peptide with 116 amino acids). We also take the advantage of a magnetic bacterium AMB-1 that can produce magnet particles, also called Magnetosome, covered by a bilayer phospholipid membrane, in which Mms13 protein is anchored. We generate Spycatcher-Mms13 and express this fusion protein in AMB-1 bacteria to make Spycatcher linked to the Magnetosome. A protein of interest with a Spytag at its N- or C-terminus is expressed in E. coli and present in bacterial lysate. The Spycatcher-Mms13-linked Magnetosome can specifically and covalently conjugate to the Spytag-tagged protein in the bacterial lysate and they can be simply co-purified by a magnet. Due to covalent linkage, stringent"

Scientific reproduction
As conclusion we have a clear lack of absolute certainty in the natural sciences. Both because of the Humean problem of induction but mostly due to common errors and lack of understanding of the causal relations between objects. The lack of proof calls for more confirmation. In praxis this is partly solved by reproduction.
Scientific reproduction is a virtue of good science. For a theory to commit to it, it needs to be explained well enough so that another scientist can do the same experiments. The protocols need to be clear and all different results should be taken into consideration.
This is also relevant when discussing the Precautionary Principle. There we see the same problem - there doesn’t seem to be anything in natural science that can be known with absolute certainty and the consequences of a hypothesis can therefore never be fully anticipated. The decisions have to be made on an uncertain foundation, and which decision to take seems to come down to which experts one listens to. Therefore, testimonial evidence is an important part of the scientific community – the policymakers aren’t normally in the laboratory, finding their own results.
Outreach
We decided early on that we wanted to engage as much as possible with the society and especially high school students and children. The youth of the society are the upcoming in the field of science as well as the ones that will be most affected of the antibiotic resistance and plastic pollution. We believe that the more awareness of these problems the better - the same goes for general knowledge of synthetic biology and GMO’s.
We have raised awareness of iGEM, synthetic biology, bioethics and research ethics. The forms of engagement range from participating in official events at our university to a theme day both in the laboratory and in the classroom at high schools.
Research day
Every year in April the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) arranges a whole day filled with workshops, lectures and talks. This year the faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology had a big workshop area with the theme “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” : the probiotic bacteria, the pathogenic bacteria and the multiresistant bacteria. With our focus on antibiotic resistance we fitted right in. We spend the entire day discussing, explaining and teaching - we had so much fun and learned a lot both about how the concept of synthetic biology is perceived in the society, but also how we should communicate it.

01. Interview with synthetic biology experts
We attended 2018 CCIC meeting, interviewed with our consultants Dr. Yunzi Luo and Dr. Fei Huang, through which activities, we got a lot of profound and useful advice to optimize my project.
Dr. Yunzi Luo is an expert in synthetic biology and also a consultant for SCU-WestChina in 2017 iGEM. Her suggestions are as follow:
It is plausible to regulate gene expression by changing the extent of mismatch between sgRNA and target DNA, but up to now, there is no related model to measure this process.
Owing to the genome differences between E.coli DH5α and BL21 strains, we need to pay attention to sgRNA expression level in those two strains.
In order to make different plasmids compatible in one bacterium, we had better use the special strain with pRSF DUET and use plasmids with the different origin of replication (ORI)
Using antibiotic resistance genes would be more convenient than using GFP and RFP genes to verify our logic circuit. Because it is easy to measure the survival rates when using antibiotic resistance genes to measure the CRISPRi efficiency, while it is hard to measure GFP and RFP relative expression ratio to demonstrate the efficiency.
Softwares, such as Chopchop, can be used to predict the 3D structure of sgRNA.
Dr. Fei Huangis a biologist in a biological company and has been our team’s consultant for a longtime. He showed great interest in our project and gave useful advice, as follows:
chemical synthesis of indigo in the industry currently has caused great environmental pollution, while biological synthesis of indigo is pretty much more environmentally friendly and is promising to be used in the industry for mass production.
At present, regulation of multiple genes’ expression in industry is hard to fulfill. However, CRISPRProgrammer provide a insightful and innovative strategy to solve this problem because the regulation of multiple genes’ expression can be achieved by only transforming a small plasmid.
It is easy for bacteria to lose plasm"

trpL promoter
In order to construct the reporter system regulated by LovTAP, we have to fuse the promoter trpL with a reporter gene.
Experimental Procedure
First attempt
1.Insert the trpL promoter through a PCR reaction to the plasmid Psb3k3.

Zepeda screw it up twice when doing this, the first one was placing an SpeI site instead of an EcRI to use it to ligate to an XbaI site of the cI inverter, but then when he re synthesize it with the SpeI and had successfully ligated it to the cI inverter and GFP, he realized that the promoter itself had two SpeI sites, ergo the ligation could not be used.
Second attempt
3 -4 October 2010
In order to overcome the previous problem Claudia designed a primer to change the SpeI site to an NheI site, which is also compatible with XbaI, the PCR was done on the pSB1C3 plasmid because backbone Psb3k3 has an NheI restriction site.

To close the membrane hole that was introduced by the thin glass capillary, the Peptidosome was after injection again exposed to CO2 for 5 min. Followed by this procedure, the Peptidosome was transferred to water and as shown in Figure 10 E) the Peptidosome was stable.

Encapsulation of Bacillus subtilis in Peptidosomes
Before the encapsulation of B. subtilis inside the Peptidosomes, it was necessary to perform experiments to study possible interactions between the organism and the Fmoc-FF. One aspect tested was, whether the bacteria can use Fmoc-FF as a nitrogen source. And also, if the organism can survive the process of encapsulation, since the bacterial pellet is resuspended in the (high) alkaline Fmoc-FF solution.
Can Fmoc-FF use B. subtilis as a nitrogen source?
To test if B. subtilis can degrade Fmoc-FF, we tested bacterial growth on Jensen’s medium agar plates. This medium has all the basic nutrients that bacteria needs for growth, with exception of nitrogen.
The experimentally used agar plates were set-up as followed:
Nitrogen free Jensen’s medium
Jensen’s medium supplemented with nitrogen (adding Fe-[III]-ammonium citrate and potassium glutamate)
Liquid Jensen’s medium mixed with Fmoc-FF
Jensen’s medium supplemented with Fmoc-FF after the plates were dried
Type one plates serve as negative control, since B. subtilis (wild type) should not be able to grow in the absence of nitrogen. On the second plates, we added two nitrogen sources (Fe-[III]-ammonium citrate and potassium glutamate) allowing B. subtilis to grow. With plates of type three and four we intended to test if B. subtilis is capable of using the Fmoc-FF. We could only detect growth on type two plates, demonstrating that B. subtilis can neither grow with our provided nitrogen (type 1 plates) nor use Fmoc-FF as nitrogen source (type three and four plates).

Protein interaction domain-peptide systems have been used by synthetic biologists to oligomerize or localize proteins. In particular, protein-protein interaction pairs have been applied to both scaffolding and signaling applications with impressive results. In such systems, orthogonality of protein pair interactions is desired to reduce cross-talk between system components and allow synthetic biologists to gain more precise control. However, the limited number and diversity of well-characterized, orthogonal protein interaction pairs restricts the complexity of systems that can be designed.
Current screening methods for protein-protein interactions (such as transcription-driven GFP expression in yeast 2-hybrid systems) do not have high enough throughput to analyze large library sizes of protein interaction pairs.  However, with the utilization of MiCodes and microscopy’s ability to record spatial information, we were able to design an assay to directly observe and screen for orthogonal protein-protein interactions.
We adopted a bait-prey scheme in our experimental design. Two types of constructs were made using the golden gate cloning scheme detailed in our Construction page . The zipper parts were 3a parts, fluorescent proteins were 3b parts, and a peroxisome targeting tag-terminator sequence was a 4 part within our golden gate scheme. A diagram and description of these constructs is provided below:
Diagram of bait and prey leucine zipper constructs with fused fluorescent proteins and targeting tags.
""Prey"": The prey construct has a leucine zipper fused to a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mKate).
""Bait"": The bait construct has a different leucine zipper fused to a photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PAGFP) and a peroxisome targeting signal sequence (PTS1). PAGFP is primarily used as a positive control to ensure the bait constructs are correctly targeted to the peroxisome.
These two constructs are combined into a plasmid and integrated into yeast to create unique strains. Once expressed in the cytosol, the bait zipper will be recruited to the peroxisome due to the PTS1 targeting sequence. A range of possible phenotypes can be observed:
If the binding interaction between the zipper pair is strong, then the prey zipper will be recruited to the peroxisome along with the bait. Effectively, in the event of a strong interaction, the yeast cell will have red fluorescent protein concentrated in the"

* Roughly speaking, a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process's full history, hence independently from such history.
Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment"

Blog #3 - School Project Kick-Off
By NBailly 20:48, April 28 2014 (CDT)
Today was the kick-off for the cooperation between our iGEM team and the Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium, a secondary school in Aachen. In the upcoming weeks, exciting school lessons with members of our iGEM team await the students of the 9th grade biology-chemistry class. Different aspects of our project will be highlighted and explained to the students. Demonstrative experiments will explain the practical relevance.
In today's lesson, our members Nina and René offered the students a short impression of what to expect in the course of this teaching module. We also explained synthetic biology and the goal of our project.

After being shaken, 0.125mL of culture was added to a volume of 25 mL of SGx2 media, and 2.5 mL of 10% xylose was added to the tube not containing xylose already. This meant that both tubes had a concentration of 1% xylose in the end.  These were then shaken for 3 days and placed in the fridge, after which the spores were washed and resuspended in distilled water (refer to B. subtilis protocols) .
Spore treatment results:
There was growth seen for each condition, with exception to the spores being lit on fire in the Bunsen burner which was expected.  Overall, the long term storage spores, frozen, seemed to better survive the chemical conditions, and the short term,  fridge, spores seemed to better survive the extreme temperature conditions.  For long term storage, there was 3 large colonies seen on 1% Bleach plate, 5 large colonies on 70% ethanol, and 11 large colonies on drying.  Whereas, for short term storage, there was 2 large and 1 small colonies on 70% ethanol, 1 medium colony on 60 ° C, and 1 medium colony on 90 ° C plate.  It was later decided that the long term storage spores should be plated by themselves, without them being subject to any other conditions.  This resulted in a full lawn of large colonies after being incubated at 37 ° C for 72 hours.  From this it appears that long term storage is a better method for preserving the B. subtilis spores than short term storage for the purposes of our diagnostic device.

Habitat:
Sneha exhibits unique migratory patterns, spending disproportionately lengthy periods of the year in the middle of nowhere to develop the next paradigm in cancer treatment as a chemical engineer. Occasionally, she retreats to the lush fields of New Jersey to recuperate from the cursed basement of Weill Hall, where incompatible restriction sites will ligate. Rumors have also claimed that Sneha can be seen in the forsaken halls of Baker Laboratory at 4 am, simultaneously studying for linear algebra, organic chemistry, and statistical mechanics, with a grace and ferocity that inspires awe and admiration.
Characteristics and Behaviors:
Sneha is characterized by a 72-hour circadian rhythm, rendering her capable of juggling 50 credits of coursework, handling two project teams, and having personal conversations with struggling friends until 3 in the morning. This is attributed to a unique metabolic pathway whereby caffeine is directly converted to ATP. In addition, as a master of all disciplines, Sneha once trained elementary school children to become experts biochemical engineering, many of whom have become important figures in the booming biotech industry of Silicon Valley.

If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. (这里已修改)This is based on the assumption that the writer of template is always sure about the structure, he won't write a two-chain template if the parts are actually on one chain. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above."

Summary"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," markets and the reorganization of different actors from biotechnology, energy, and pharmaceuticals to food processing and petrochemicals sectors. Currently, the activities of these companies are separated into two distinct groups: the one of Gene Foundries that synthesize genes and more complex systems on demand, and the one combining the companies developing microorganisms able of producing biofuels, drugs or chemicals.
These many applications show the interest of synthetic biology to industry and the various benefits it can bring to society in the future.
However, these advances should not be to the detriment of the safety and security for society. It is therefore necessary to study thoroughly the balance “benefit / risk “ before developing a new use of synthetic biology. Taking into account all these elements is necessary to develop solutions and performing protocols to reassure the society, and thus ensure the sustainability of this new approach of biology.
Back to top
Introduction
The main concern of the scientific community with regard to synthetic biology is that we cannot really predict the risks. Indeed, current knowledge does not allow us to have hindsight in order to predict the evolution and behavior of synthetic microorganisms. The engineering of biological systems is currently expensive and hazardous mainly because the scientific community does not properly control the molecular and cellular processes to provide reliable solutions.
Three different strategies have been identified to address this problem:
The first is STANDARDIZATION. It consists in developing and promoting standards which we can also apply the definition, description and characterization of basic biological entities. The creation of the MIT Registry of Standard Biological Parts is a first step in this direction.
The second is the DISSOCIATION. This method allows separating a complex problem into a number of simple problems more important. We can thus advance in solving various independent problems, and therefore solve complex systems.
The last one is ABSTRACTION. It classifies information that describes the different biological functions, according to a hierarchy (which takes into account different levels of complexity).
These different strategies help to normalize and standardize the protocols and methods of synthetic biology in order to ease the use and thus limit the risks. Pending greater use of these three strategies, it is necessary to anticipate the potential risks for experimentation that will be developed in the near future for the standardization of synthetic biology.
Synthetic biology is only in its infancy; it is difficult to determine potential risks. Nevertheless, to discern risk areas, we can transpose the experience gained during the development of recombinant DNA to synthetic biology.
We can then distinguish three major types of risks:
The first one, microorganisms can escape from their confinement area, proliferate without any control and contaminate the environment, causing damage repair"

Figure 10.The simple picture for zinc finger.
Zinc finger proteins contain a DNA binding domain and a functional domain. DNA binding domain could recognize specific DNA sequence, which called DNA program. Zinc fingers could tightly bind to specific DNA or RNA sequence. We replace the zinc fingers' functional domains with our enzymes to create fusion proteins. (Figure 10.) With the zinc finger's ""hand"", the enzyme could bind to the specific DNA program. By doing so, the enzymes would no longer disperse around the cell. Therefore the productivity of isobutanol will be higher.
Figure 11.The intermediate and enzyme in the pathway.
With this feature, we expected to build a production line to help us make isobutanol. We put the enzymes in order. (Figure 11.) When the intermediates are produced, it could have the next reaction as quickly as possible. The final product, isobutyraldehyde will be converted into isobutanol by ADH in E.coli.
Point mutation for avoiding frame shift
Figure 12.Point mutation for avoiding frame shift.
We found that there are only five nucleotides between HIVC and ilvD genes. (ATG are the first three nucleotides of the ilvD gene.) (Firgure 12.) According to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, it would cause a frameshift mutation, which cause the condons code for incorrect amino acid.
In order to assemble a production line in E.coli, we have to transform DNA program as well as our fusion protein genes in to E.coli. The design of our biobricks has the same order of zinc finger as 2010 Slovenia iGEM team, so we decided to use their DNA program (BBa_K323066) instead of synthesizing one.
Point mutation for correcting DNA program
After cloning, we sent it to Genomics BioSci & Tech Co., Ltd. for sequencing. We found that there is a deletion of a base pair in the zif268 biding site. (Figure 13.)

Upon cooling the bottles and the sterile water, the liquid culture from the 2L flask was distributed evenly between three bottles (and balanced by adding sterile water).  The bottles were centrifuged at 6000g for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was discarded.  Each cell pellet was resuspended in 25mL of sterile water, and vortexed to resuspend.  Each bottle was pooled, mixed, and distributed evenly between two 50mL falcon tubes.  8mL from one was taken to be used for a small-scale protein purification.  The remaining bottles were balanced, and centrifuged again for 15min at 6000g.  The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was stored in the -20C freezer.  The sample for small-scale purification was centrifuged, resuspended, and transferred to a 1.5mL before collecting the pellet to be frozen at -20C.

Team Activity Tests: Today was the moment of truth. We received the first recombinant laccases from the cultivation team. We started with testing the supernatant from the cultivated cells to check whether they secrete laccase. We added 0,1 mM ABTS in each well that was filled with supernatant from E.coli KRX that contained the plasmid to produce ECOL, BPUL, BHAL, XCCL or E. coli KRX (negative control) and measured as usual. There was no change in the OD so that we assume that no secretion takes place.
Team Shuttle vector:
Electroporation of RFP::pSB1C3 was done to get more plasmid DNA, but the wrong competent cells and selective plates were choosen.
Phusion PCR of the tAOX1 part for the shuttle vector was done without betaine addition with the genomic DNA of P. pastoris GS115 and the wild type X-33. But only a small unspecific product was visible.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases: The transformation from the 21st July showed no results. The plates were unfortunately empty. So we did an another PCR. This time the Annealing Temp. was set to 56°C.
Team Fungal and Plant Laccases: Successful PCRs of laccase gene Tv5 from Trametes versicolor with plasmid DNA from Uni Greifswald as template.
Team Site Directed Mutagenesis: Transfered 4 colonies of each transformation to an new dish for plasmid-isolation.

Team Shuttle Vector: To get the fragment tAOX1 for the shuttle vector the Phusion PCR conditions were changed. A two-step PCR was done with the following conditions: After initial denaturation at 98 °C for 6 min, the first 10 cycles were run at: denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. The following cycles were run at: denaturation at 98 °C for 15"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html," protected by such mechanisms, therefore we tested the effect of arsenic on the synthesis of sfGFP. We observed no significant effect for the relevant safety limits of 10 µg/L and 50 µg/L.
Figure 5: Influence of arsenic on cell-free protein synthesis. We measured the expression of sfGFP ( BBa_K1758102 ) in the presence of the two internationally relevant safety limits of arsenic. The relative fluorescence was normalized to the fluorescence of a reference sample (culture supernatant of cells expressing sfGFP). Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
In order to test the arsenic sensor in our cell-free protein synthesis, we cloned a device containing sfGFP under control of the T7 promoter and the arsenic operator combined with our optimized untranslated region (UTR). We tested this device in a cell extract that had been generated from cells expressing the arsenic repressor. As our modeling had shown us, this approach is superior to co-expressing the repressor in the reaction. We observed an induction when adding arsenic up to a concentration of 1.87 mg/L. As high arsenic concentrations inhibit the performance of the CFPS, we normalized the results to this effect. In the final application, this task is performed by our app.
Figure 6: Induction of arsenic sensor in vitro. For this experiment, a cell extract that already contained the arsenic repressor was used in combination with BBa_K1758300 . Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Figure 7: Normalized induction of arsenic sensor in vitro. For this experiment, a cell extract that already contained the arsenic repressor was used in combination with BBa_K1758300 . The data were normalized to account for the negative effect of arsenic on cell extract performance. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Compared to the in vivo results, the response to arsenic was relatively small and we measured a high background signal. We assume that this is due to the different construct we used in vitro. This construct had been optimized for our CFPS by exchanging the natural promoter for the T7 promoter and exchanging mRFP1 for our optimized sfGFP. However, we assume that the repression in the presence of ArsR was not effective enough to observe a clear induction. The reason is most likely that the distance between the T7 promoter and the arsenic operator was too large. The distance was a result of our cloning strategy and would likely be suitable for E. coli promoters. However, the T"
Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," A method to circumvent the toxic protein problem for the chassis is to have the protein secreted from the cell to prevent accumulation within the cell.
Accelerating clay particle sedimentation
Without intervention, the (3) fine clay sediment found in the tailings ponds can take decades to solidify, but with the application of molecules such as polysaccharides that are found on the surface of bacterial membranes, the clay particles can be aggregated17,18. Once the aggregates of cell and clay have been formed, sediments can be formed by using an antigen that promotes rapid bacterial aggregation19. The aggregates will then settle out, resulting in clearer water. The Peking 2010 iGEM team successfully characterized Antigen 43 (Ag43) that successfully formed sediments 20 minutes after induction20. The Ag43 was used to sediment the chassis after absorbing mercury from a solution.
Environmentally safe organisms
To prevent environmental contamination by any GMO’s DNA, measures must be taken. One method is by expressing an endonuclease within the chassis causing the genomic DNA to be degraded and therefore removing the risk of the GMO’s DNA being released into the environment. This method is especially appealing because the potential of horizontal gene transfer between other species present in the tailings ponds is eliminated, while still ensuring relevant enzymes will not be destroyed. The UC Berkley 2007 iGEM team successfully characterized an endonuclease that degraded the genomic DNA of E. coli when induced21. The ability to induce the endonuclease will allow for the fully-functional organism to carry out the mechanism for which it is designed, whether that be (1) degradation of organic molecules, (2) decontamination of heavy metals, or (3) sedimentation of clay particles, before the organism is rendered inert by the degradation of genomic DNA.
Objectives of Proposed Research
The overall goal of the project is to produce a prototype tailings ponds clean up kit (Figure 2). The tailings ponds clean up kit will decontaminate (1) toxic organic molecules, (2) heavy metals, (3) remove the clay sediment, and (4) prevent GMO’s DNA contamination of the environment. The kit will allow for an efficient and environmentally friendly method of tailings ponds remediation. The methods used will also be applicable for large-scale treatment facilities to treat the tailings water before it is deposited in ponds thereby decreasing their negative environmental impact.
(1) Our aim is to produce optimized enzymes found in nature that will decontaminate toxic organic molecules found in the tailings ponds. In order to do so, we will"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#SD#DesignProcess_-_-_TEXT.html," fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

Microfluidics How-To Part II: Building Your Setup
Microfluidics Main | How-To Part I | How-To Part II | Tamagotchip
A basic computer-controlled microfluidics setup. Note the compressed air input split into two sides, both fed through a pressure regulator. The left side is the low-pressure manifold for the flow layer. The right side is the high-pressure solenoid array for the control layer.
Microfludic chips are nothing but a piece of moulded rubber. To actually get something out of them, an external setup of tubing, compressed air, and valves is needed to flow in fluids and actuate the on-chip valves. To see what's happening, you'll also need some form of microscope. No matter the application of the chip, whether it is designed to study fluid mechanics, to characterise protein-DNA interaction, or even cultivate bacteria and nematodes, the external setup remains essentially the same.

A basic microfluidics control setup
Building the setup is relatively straightforward, once you have determined which components are needed and their purpose, and once you have collected the parts. Connecting the components is basic plumbing: just remember to wrap plumber's tape around all metallic screw threads, and then connect the pressure regulators in the correct orientation. With this in mind, we'll go through the parts of a microfluidics setup one by one, and from there you should be able to build your own.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," his-tag to nickel ions, chelated by specific lipids composing membrane1,2. Our reasoning for this was threefold. Firstly, this would have allowed ribosomes to be correctly positioned. If the ribosomes were localized near the membrane, but the peptide exit tunnel hadn’t been consistently pointed towards the membrane, the entire benefit of reducing MP aggregation would be lost. By being able to create his-tagged fusion proteins specifically of the ribosomal subunits localized near the exit tunnel, we guaranteed that the exit tunnel could never point away from the membrane. Secondly, general protein synthesis should be the least impeded, compared to alternatives, such as introducing a lipid anchor via an enzyme, or creating a fusion protein with a self inserting MP. These latter methods would completely immobilize the ribosome onto the membrane, removing degrees of freedom. With the polyhistidine-nickel interaction the ribosome would simply exhibit a much greater affinity towards the membrane, while still being able to detach and reattach as needed. Lastly, the simplicity for this method seemed to be the greatest, as only modified ribosomes as well as the incorporation of nickel-chelating lipids during liposome synthesis was needed - this was far more important than it can appear, because it was vital for our overall system to be as robust as possible.
Fig. 1 Principle of ribosome attachment to the liposome membrane. The ribosome exit tunnel is localized near the membrane, resulting in transmembrane domains of newly synthesized peptides interacting with the membrane, reducing aggregation
Results
Designing the modifications
The basic procedure we designed to obtain our modified ribosomes is as follows: first, using CRISPR-Cas9, we modify the genome of E. coli (native strain MG1655) to incorporate his-tags onto the ribosomal subunits, as well as a Strep-tag onto the L12 subunit for ease of purification3. In literature a his-tag was described to aid purification when fused to subunit L12, however we exchanged it for a Strep tag, as it is also short in sequence and while being biologically does not interfere with the functionality of other his-tags. The subunits localized near the exit tunnel we chose as potential targets, in order of priority, were L24, L23, and L29. These subunits were chosen as they had free, unfolded C ends exposed to the surface at nearest proximity to the exit tunnel. These subunits are also not integral to the overall function of the ribosome, meaning that our modifications would have little to no impact on peptide synthesis4,5,6,7. After"
NTNU_Trondheim,2018,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in Norway.
Hans has a solid background in Molecular Biology, which he gained through his master’s degree at The University of Bergen. In his doctoral degree he studied the occurrence of bacteriophages in diary facilities, where bacteriophage infections can reduce both yield and quality of the desired fermented products. Despite this encounter with the negative effects of bacteriophages, Hans also recognized their potentials as something positive. Today Hans works as the research director in Nordli Holding, which is a firm aiming to increase the health and welfare of fish. As a part the solution, they use bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics. He also informed us about the nanobiome (viriome), which is the viral counterpart to the microbiome. The nanobiome is essential to maintain the balance of the microbiome in an organism and prevents the development of dominance by one single bacteria. With the knowledge of the nanobiome, it may be possible to specifically control the microbiome to increase the health and wealth of the host organism.
Even though Hans has mainly worked with natural bacteriophages, he still thinks our approach to constructing and using recombinant phages may theoretically be possible. He also gave us some input to improvements of our experimental setup. In addition to the biofilm reducing selective marker, he suggested us to design a second gRNA that targets a specific antibiotic resistance gene carried by the host bacteria. The degree of antibiotic sensitivity after phage infection can then be used as a measure of the phage infectivity and the effectiveness of the CRISPRi system. This may be an easier and more accurate method compared with the Crystal Violet assay. We probably do not have time to conduct this suggestion, but this could be implemented in future work.
Lastly, Hans gave us some insight into the public scepticism and legal restrictions regarding the use of bacteriophages. He informed us that he had met an impressively low amount of scepticism – The key is to spread knowledge about the natural occurrence of phages and the positive effects they can have. Regarding legal restrictions he told us that it strongly depends on the usage and claims of the product. Since our potential product falls within the therapeutic section, it is among others essential to extensively evaluate it’s positive and negative effects on both the environment and health as well as document the therapeutical effects it claims to have. Due to our product being GMO, he told us that it may be even more regulations involved in legalizing our phage delivered CRISPRi system for medical usage. This led us on to dig deeper into the GMO restrictions here in Norway, and we"

Online Survey

Welcome to the wonderful iGEM family! Nanjing_China_Bio team is conducting a brief survey to collect the problems our iGEMers have met, and hope that we can make the iGEM better for more students to enjoy. We hope your team would like to cooperate with us answering the following questions and sharing all the problems you met. The survey takes less than five minutes to complete. Thanks for your cooperation!
Chinses Survey
English Survey
We conducted an online survey in order to find out how the iGEMers communicating and collecting information during the preparation of the competition.  At first, we found problems when we entered the iGEM official website. It’s difficult or even impossible to log in.  What are worse, some official information provided on the website could be edited by guests, and BioBricks provided by the iGEM committee which submitted by the previous teams failed to function.  Many of our team members thought it essential to change this situation.  Based on this idea, we created a questionnaire on surveymonkey.com and send emails to teams in Asia Division to invite them to fill in our questionnaire.  In this way, we could get overall view of this phenomenon.  Soon, we got a great deal of feedbacks from different teams.  More than 80% of them thought it necessary to set up an exchange platform in the charge of the iGEM committee.  We produced the following charts to show our results.
As can be seen from the first chart above, more than half of the competitors surveyed preferred to set up a forum as the exchange platform.  Several people wish to build a social network like Facebook to realize the function of information exchange.  In the second chart, we can see that more than one third of the iGEMers have found that parts provided by the official unable to work.  This means that a considerable number of parts submitted by the previous teams are not qualified.  The iGEM committee should establish an examining department to cut down the occurrence of such incidents.
In addition, the iGEMers under investigation also put forward numerous constructive comments according to our topic.  For example, one of the respondents rise the problem that the long description of the BioBr"

Collaboration
We spent a happy summer working with our wet team, USTC-China, through intimate collaboration on how our software tool can help and guide their experimental designs before they are actually constructed in the tube. It cannot be denied that most of our members are lack of biological background but do not worry, they are there available to discuss with us to help us understand their proposals. Specially, we are going to thank Junhui Peng, the modeler of USTC-China, who contributed very much to our cooperation.
The main idea of their project is to use quorum sensing mechanism to guide bacteria towards the concentration gradient. The toggle switch plays a central role to run the device by switching the expression of chemotaxis protein cheZ on and off iteratively. When the density of the cell population has reached a certain criteria, the accumulation of AHL molecules exceeds the threshold and thus trigger the toggle switch to change its state from the other one(auotomatic toggle). More information are available here .
To test our software tool, we planned to use our rule-based modeling approach to get some insights about their work. It can be divided further to two parts: (1) automatically generate the biochemical network of the quorum sensing subsystem combined with toggle switch as a central part; (2) analyze the phase space of the toggle switch.
The design-b is our target system to be modeled. In terms of simplicity, we try to ignore their quorum sensing part by setting of parameter of the lasi catalyzing ability low, and add IPTG and AHL deliberately at certain timepoints.
From such a mere assembly, our software can generate the network associated with the assembly.
The network generated and visualized by our software's  rule based modeling part and visualization part is shown below:
There are so many species generated by our approch(however, this is an advantage of our approach, in the future version of our software, we plan to offer visualizing tool to show the structure of the species, ie,"

The rate constant is k but the rate law is not k*[S1]*V1, because the concentration conversion is needed. The correct expression is N*k*[S1]*V1. The volume strategy just uses N*V1 instead of V1 as the volume of the first compartment. To have a general definition, the volume of a compartment is defined as V*N1*N2, where:
V is the volume of the compartment itself;
N1 is the number of compartments located in its outside compartment;
N2 is the total number of its outside compartment
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
Chains in our Chain-Node model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those in the system.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: compare the first part of two chains by their partReference and partType in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or to the end of either chain. At this stage, besides partReference and partType, two parts are considered equal if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the unique order of the chain list. However, it is not always so: equal chains in the above sorting may be equivalent or not. It is due to the assumption that two bound parts are taken as equal if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those"

We must also take into account the relative difficulty that these BBs offer in their construction. They are all of the ones that have failed previous years. There are quite a few that are over 800bp in length. From our sequence data, transversions were the #1 type of mutations found in the LCR sequences followed by deletions which are then followed by transitions. These mutations occurred in very random places and never at the same place among same BBs. All the highlighted areas were based on the abi sequence files that had clear well-defined ratings for each mutation. All in all, these BBs were poor examples in terms of relative design and composition of BBs encountered by BAG students over the course of a semester.
The time that it takes the LCR to progress is staggering considering the workflow jams that might occur if more PCR machines are not introduced into the classroom. Testing for shortened annealing times in which 5 minutes instead of 15 minutes is used should be conducted. This would require a comparative study among the same BBs.
Next time a negative control is also needed for every step in order to prove that this LCR is created from contaminated reagents.
This protocol is excellent for pushing BBs through the FPCR stage. It’s ultimate accuracy is still up for debate as we have a very bad sample to draw any reasonable conclusions from. Ultimately, it may be that the commercial markets have not deemed the LCR reaction reagents as a low cost alternative to the Taq polymerase driven reactions of our TPCR.

Project Abstract: This is not a lemon!
Synthetic Biology has the power of potentially changing paradigms of society such as our conception of what living beings are. If we deprive bacteria from all their “unnecessary"" functions and have them produce what we need and desire, do these bacteria still possess the status of living organisms or have they become machines? To raise and explore this question, we adopted an artistic approach. Indeed, we think that Bio-Art is one of the best ways to reach the citizens and to spark debate and reflection.
We decided to create a concept organism that would reflect these interrogations. We plan to modify Escherichia coli in order to produce the fragrance of a lemon and simulate the ripening process of a lemon by changing its color gradually from green to yellow. A mixture of bacteria and solid growth medium will be moulded in a lemon shape: it will smell like a lemon, ripe like a lemon and look like a lemon, but ""ceci n’est pas un citron” - this is not a lemon… or is it?
With this project we invite everyone to think about the upcoming opportunities and the necessary ethical limits of designing living beings.
When life gives you lemons, break your taboos with Paris Saclay!
A Biologia Sintética tem o poder de mudar os paradigmas da sociedade, como a nossa concepção do que são serem vivos. Se privarmos uma bactéria de todas as suas funções ""desnecessárias"" e a fizermos produzir o que precisamos e queremos, essa bactéria continuará com um status de organismo vivo ou ela"

Background
Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. In 2008 alone, 13% of all deaths (7,6 million people) were caused by cancer, and it is not likely that the number will decrease. Lifestyle diseases, for instance, are huge risk factors for developing cancer, and diseases like type 2 diabetes are increasing rapidly on a worldwide basis. [1] , [2] .
One of the most challenging aspects of cancer medicine is the difficulty of drug delivery directly at the tumor area. We therefore wanted to develop a system for specific drug delivery, to show that one of the most challenging medical problems can be solved by using synthetic biology. So we decided to make a system responding to factors specific for cancer cells, but without being too complicated [3] . In our system we want two different trigger factors, in order to lower the risk of releasing toxins in the healthy parts of the body. Our system is triggered by a low oxygen concentration and a high lactate concentration. When the E. coli detects these conditions, our system will activate the lysis genes, and the toxin will be released.
Differentiated cells (“normal” cells) can produce high amount of lactate in an anaerobic environment, but this is not a normal environment for the cells in our body. Under normal circumstances, the differentiated cells will primarily metabolize glucose to carbon dioxide in the citric acid cycle (TCA), and have a very low production of lactate. Cancer cells behave differently. They produce large amounts of lactate regardless of the oxygen concentration in their surroundings [4] , [5] . The reason that we want to use oxygen as a trigger factor is that tumors exists in an environment deprived of oxygen [6] .

Handbook
This year, HKUST human practice group made a handbook about the basic information people should know when starting a human practice team. We decided to make this project in mid-August, mainly due to the fact that we did not truly understand the objectives of human practice. By the time we realized this, we did not have enough time to develop a project that could have a substantial impact. If only we had a clear guidance on taking the first step of starting a human practice project, things would have been much better. Our main objective of making this handbook is to give an insight into future iGEM teams across the globe to create meaningful projects.
Our handbook contains a simplified version of the definition and purpose of human practice, also some ideas on how the human practice teams can deliver their main project. Beside those, there are examples of some of the best teams which won the best human practice award along with tips and tricks from these awardees as well as the judges.
We sincerely hope that our handbook can help the future human practice groups in helping to create their unique pathway in promoting synthetic biology to the public, which is the essence of human practice.       You can download the handbook in PDF format here .

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Elaboration and Peer Learning. Based on the result, we interpreted what these three scales mentioned above contributed to being a successful iGEM leader.
Firstly, we cleared the definition of these tree scales according to the MSLQ manual(Paul R.,1991).
""Critical thinking refers to the degree to which students report applying previous knowledge to new situations in order to solve problems, reach decisions, or make critical evaluations with respect to standards of excellence.
Elaboration reflects how often students attempt to summarize or paraphrase (put into your own words) the material they read in their textbooks, and how often they try to relate the material to what they already know or have learned.
Collaborating with one's peers has been found to have positive effects on achievement. Dialogue with peers can help a leader clarify course material and reach insights one may not have attained on one's own, which will significantly enhance the efficiency.""
Then, to better interpret our findings, we did more interviews online with iGEMers participated in our survey. We find out some reasons for the differences in the above scales. These abilities are required for leaders from the very beginning of the project. Whereas to some extent, other team members may be left out from the designing process and/or problem shooting process, and only do experiments and tasks assigned to them. This would greatly deprive their opportunities to practice these skills.
After reaching this results, we believed that we should adapt our training process for our next team to help future team members to develop a sense of active participation right from the beginning. For example, we set up performance assessment system emphasizing on participation degree, and we required detailed document on attribution. This should push the team members to better involve themselves throughout the project.
2. Girls appear to be weaker in critical thinking.
Comparison between female and male respondents
From the gender comparison, we found that girls' critical thinking ability is distinctly poorer. Previous researches have shown that there's significant gender difference in thinking structure. Girls does better in memorizing and initiating, but worse in logical thinking, abstract thinking and innovation, which are fundamental elements of critical thinking. Sadly, sociological studies have shown that our society still holds the view that girls are born to be more unsuitable than boys to study science, which brings down their self-assessment unconsciously. Even worse, the existing education system can't spur girls' enthusiasm for science and cultivate their critical thinking efficiently, which has made things even worse.
Based on the above survey results combined with our analysis and discussion, We believe that Chinese girls need more opportunities and platforms to improve the ability of independent critical thinking. And i"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.

ShanghaiTech,2018,Team:ShanghaiTech#Project NFBL_-_-_TEXT.html," Consequently, the upregulation of part A caused by the input signal will indirectly activate part C with the help of the buffer - STAR. In this case, the whole system is ready to response change of the input signal.
After the input is introduced into the system, we want the following parts response fast to the signal. Since STAR shows fast response due to the lack of translation step and rapid RNA degradation, it is the appropriate choice for the part B.
In the absence of input signal, the system is expected to be shut down. However, the leak is inevitable in all the control systems. But it seems to be harmless as the STAR shows activation about 100-fold. It will also be reduced by the pT181 attenuator, which will be mentioned in the part C.
When the input signal is introduced into the system by the part A, STAR will send it to both the regulator- the part C - and the output downstream it due to the fast response mentioned before. In this case, the high efficiency of the activation of STAR, the signal attenuation will be reduced at utmost.
In brief, the STAR can help our system respond to the input with high-fidelity in a fast way.
Experimental design
The experiments on STAR can be generalized into two parts. Almost all the experience about STAR are operated under 20-25 degrees Celsius. Streptomycin medium has been used to cultivate bacteria in need. We mainly use plate reader and fluorescence microscope to get results of how STAR has been working. Massive data about corresponding bacterial density and fluorescence intensity have been detected every experience and have been compared(FL/ABS) in order to analyze the variation of fluorescence intensity of a single bacterium.
We really appreciate the precious gift from SJTU, which is the STAR plasmid conduct by Imperial College in 2016 from SJTU. The plasmid consists of a STAR target upstream of a superfolderGFP with a RBS(BBa_B0034) and a terminator(t500) under control of a constitutive promoter (J23119). We transformed it into DH5-α E.coli cells.

Firstly, two different types of cells that contain different GFP (SFGFP as enhanced group and generic GFP as control group) were cultivated and examined using plate reader and fluorescence microscope, from this part of the experiment we wanted to verify the effectiveness of GFP in part B in order to make sure that it could express well"

NCKU_Tainan,2018,Team:NCKU Tainan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," interview
Meeting with experts and stakeholders is important in shaping our project to fulfill the needs of our target user.                                          China Steel Corporation is the largest integrated steel manufacturer in Taiwan. Also, they have been adopting the algae bio-sequestration by cooperating with the research group from our university, NCKU Tainan.
Process
We met with the senior executive of China Steel Corporation                                          to gain invaluable insight for our research. The interview started with our project presentation, including the introduction of bioreactor design and the industrial model.                                          By listing out all the aspects we had considered, we would like to obtain advice                                          on the practical and social considerations involved in the application of our project in industry.
Suggestion and Question
Will the high concentration of CO2 retard growth of engineered bacteria?
Microalgae is reported resistant to SOx and NOx. Does E. coli survive under such conditions?
The two questions above were the main concern of CSC. Basically, the best condition for engineered E. coli to capture CO2 have to be lower, without too much SOx and NOx particles.                                          However, we won’t be able to provide an ideal culture condition in industrial application.                                          After researching the tolerance of E. coli, we concluded that E. coli is possible to survive in factory condition while the concentration of SOx and NOx were much lower than CO2. Besides, we will dilute the concentration with gas that the small fraction of SOx NOx can only effect the expression of E. coli.                                          In other words, it may not capture as much CO2 as culture in the lab.
It is important to define a specific commercial product that can be truly produced                                          since our user may consider its economic viability.                                          They stated that a product that can be widely used is better.                                          At the same time, we should consider current GMO legislation if we want to commercialize those products.                                         The actual condition is not as ideal as in the laboratory,                                          we should optimize the condition to maximize the carbon fixation ability of the microbes.
Interview record
The record can be separated into two parts.                                          One is the feedback documentation during the interview, another one is customer investigate questions.                                          We use CSC represent China Steel Corporation.

Part A: Interviews
We interviewed 5 experts: 4 from NASA Ames Research Center and 1 from Brown University.  From NASA Ames, we had the honor to interview Dr. Lynn Rothschild (expert in synthetic biology and the supervisor of S-B-S iGEM team), Vince Ambrosia (Earth Scientist), Matthew Fladeland and Randy Berthold. From Brown University, we had a pleasure of interview Prof. Jim Head who is an expert on planetary sciences and Satellite missions.
All of the interviewees were asked the same questions ranging from how they use UAVs in their specific jobs, their opinion on synthetic biology and the future of UAVs. The links of the videos have been posted on our wiki. Before giving the detailed responses of the interviews, we have compiled the answers of each question so as to get a list of uses of UAVS.

● Interview with Jim Head, Brown U. Planetary Scientist
Summary of Answers to Interview Questions
Below is a short summary of the major responses for 3 main questions: the uses of UAVs, the value of Synthetic Biology in general and in creating UAVs and how to address the stigma of using UAVs:
1. Uses of UAVs
a. Looking for life elsewhere:  UAVs are excellent tools for searching for life in areas where it might be too dangerous for humans to reach. Dr. Lynn Rothschild sees the potential in using UAVs for searching for new life forms on planet earth and other planets. She also sees the potential of linking synthetic biology in creating cheaper, safer-for-the environment and biodegradable UAVs
b. Disaster analysis and Wildfire Control: Would you send a human being in the middle of a natural disaster, or would you rather send a machine?  Vince Ambrosia and Matthew Fladeland see the potential in using UAVs for wildfire control, natural disaster analysis and recording of real-time sensory data in order to have a better control of disaster management.

Summary
We were invited to the Synenergene event organised by Rathenau Institute. This event was to make iGEM teams realise the importance of performing a responsible research in their project. During the event we came into contact with several stakeholders and experts.
Antibiotic resistance shield
The overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its threat is one that can no longer be ignored. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that annually over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States are caused by antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it is approximated that by 2050, 10 million people will die annually due to antibiotic resistance. The ‘antibiotic apocalypse’ needs to be prevented, so action should be taken now!
Antibiotic resistance detection with Cas13a
Up until now, we had been focussing on a plan with the protein Cas9. Nevertheless, this was not the optimal protein for what we wanted to achieve. Participating in iGEM, we caught up with the most recent achievements in the synthetic biology field, amongst which a very interesting paper about Cas13a by Gootenberg et al. Their paper indicated attomolar sensitivity in combination with rapid DNA or RNA detection, which would be perfect for detecting antibiotic resistance genes!
Tardigrade proteins
Simultaneously, team members came up with a completely different idea, based on practical limitations in the lab instead of a societal problem: western blotting. In order to improve on this method, we would require proteins from tardigrades (also known as water bears). Tardigrades can survive under very extreme conditions, such as outer space. Their robustness is (partly) derived from the so-called tardigrade proteins, that protect cell(-structures) and proteins from dehydration and preserve protein activity after drying and rehydration. The western blotting idea was discarded because of practical limitations. Nevertheless, we saw the tardigrade proteins as a perfect opportunity to combine an antibiotic resistance detection system with microfluidics on paper, for which the drying of proteins would be necessary!

The advantage of that is we can come up with any questionnaire and use it for data collection. So we are always looking for collaborators who can have ideas. And if they are good, we can then get funding. [...] I wish you good luck so that you can excel. If you [are successful], you can produce a few devices and try them in the field.
Daniel C.:
That would be really cool.
Prof. Kalua:
So who is funding you?
Daniel C., Samira:
We have different sponsors. Not your usual eye care sponsors. A lot from the funding comes from our university, from different funding programs, and then also a few sponsors from companies. We are talking like 200 or 500 $. And then also from the MIT, the associated institutes. And the funding for this Africa Interviews, is a special program from the european commission.
Prof. Kalua:
What program is that?
Samira, Kai:
It’s Synenergene, for synthetic biology.
Prof. Kalua:
We have Dr. Bagrey Ngwira, she is a molecular biologist. From London School [...] but she is based here and she is the one that works with me in the lab. We are doing another study with qPCR [...] with the guys from Seattle. Always looking at the statistic diagnostic, to have a more specific test. [...] We don’t have any protocol for it, but the idea is there. So you have time to look at other areas in Malawi?
Daniel C.:
Yeah, so we will also be interviewing Georg. But we thought it would be great to go to a community.
Prof. Kalua:
I think they are going to the community. Did you talk to David already? [...] He’s going to the field for trachoma. He’s going to the community to tell them of the drugs and the tests. Salomie will organize with you.

UCC_Ireland,2014,Team:UCC Ireland#Projects SeeDNA.html_-_-_TEXT.html," amplified exponentially.  Also avoiding contamination of samples with the product of a previous PCR reaction is a concern.
To quantify a target DNA molecule, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)-is often used.  Diagnostic qPCR is applied to detect nucleic acids that are diagnostic of, for example, infectious diseases, cancer and genetic abnormalities and has greatly improved the diagnosis of infectious diseases such as new strains of flu, Sails AD (2009).  However, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)-based systems are often too expensive for resource-limited environments (Niemz et al, 2011).
Digital PCR
The latest procedure to emerge in the field is Digital PCR. In digital PCR, a single copy of the target sequence enters a compartment.  Each compartment is then allowed to amplify the target, if present, by end point PCR.  The compartments are then screened for the presence of the target. Digital PCR in essence counts the number of copies of target template DNA are present in a sample providing accurate quantification.   Digital PCR machines can cost on average $100,000, not including the specialist reagents required.  Digital PCR has yet to become a mainstream diagnostic tool in clinical labs.
Our SeeDNA technology may also act as a quantifying system bestowing many of the benefits of digital PCR. The number of discrete fluorescent cells or colonies on the plate would be indicative of the number of copies of the target sequence in the original sample giving a cheap, simple and informative readout.
