Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html," the pathogen. We dropped the idea because we though it would be too ambitious to complete within 10 weeks.
Carbon sequestration and bioplastics - We considered various possible approaches, including photosynthesis using cyanobacteria, and producing bioplastics from carbon dioxide, but all had either already been attempted industrially with much greater success (with time and funding!) than we could ever achieve, or were infeasible to work with in the lab (cyanobacteria).
Exploit iron chelating siderophores - we were really keen on exploiting the iron chelating and transport mechanisms in E. coli, which we found to be extremely extensive. However, we simply couldn’t think of a useful and interesting application, so we dropped the idea.
Scent production - we thought of using this as a reporter system for a biosensor, and even came up with a couple of synthesis pathways that looked feasible, but we just couldn’t find a good application area in which the use of a scent would be a better reporter than light or colour output (or electronic alarms).
Magnetic bacteria - although we found this highly interesting, and of undoubtable utility, we believed that there was very little we could do beyond making magnetic nanoparticles within the bacteria, which has already been done by other research teams, and trying to make the nanoparticles equally sized. unfortunately, we would need to perform a large amount of research using electron microscopy in order to investigate the nanoparticle sizes in detail, which we couldn’t afford under our research budget.
Production of quantum dots - we were really interested in developing this technology for biological tagging, which has extensive medical applications. However, all quantum dots that we found that we thought could be plausibly produced in E. coli required heavy metals that are highly toxic, and so health and safety prevented us from going further.
Ice-nucleating biosensor - in literature, it has been claimed that ice nucleating bacteria can be used as an assay for chemicals/pathogens with a sensitivity 10 times better than GFP. We thought that this was a technology that had a lot of scope, but ultimately we thought that reflectins were simply more interesting to work with.
The final cut - reflectin
In the end, we finally chose to try to produce structural colour and iridescence by expressing reflectin proteins in E. coli. The main attraction of pursuing this project lay in both its novelty and its potential impact, particularly since reflectin has only recently been identified no one has ever tried to explore its potential in the context of synthetic biology  before. Although this makes the project very challenging, in the sense that"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"Experimental evidence had a variety of implication in the design of our software. For one, experiments showed at an early stage that the assumptions of modularity that are essential for the NRPSDesigner’s do indeed hold. Also, they allowed us to further refine the scoring function in regards to the importance of linkers between different domains. The Indigoidine project showed that the linker between T-TE domains is more important than the one between A-T, a result not previously published (to the best of our knowledge). In addition, the exact definition of domain boundaries and the use of appropriate HMMs was guided by the actual experimental results (e.g. C-A domain boundary based on Tyrocidine results). Finally, the Indigoidine tag was included in the software only, once its functionality had been proven in the wet lab.
But also in opposite direction, the NRPSDesigner could easily influence experimentalists: The most obvious way is the cloning and expression of novel NRPS constructs in vivo, as suggested by the Designer. But even the prediction pipeline which is part of the Designer can have valuable implications for the experiments: Domain shuffling, could be facilitated using the domain boundaries currently predicted by the pipeline. Especially, for the recognition of totally unknown NRPS pathways our tool offers the optimal framework.
Connecting with the NRPSDesigner
One of they key issues of the NRPSDesigner is its ability to combine scientific rigorousness with a user-friendly interface making both NRPS and synthetic biology more approachable to the broader community. This principal is implemented with the help of several features and interfaces facilitating the process of NRP in silico design and experimental validation. For example, in order to help developing a cloning strategy of the desired construct we added a tool for automated primer design. Although J5 [16] is a very rigorous software tool with complex primer design algorithms using Primer3
we decided on Gibthon, well known to the iGEM community. It has a very user-friendly interface with direct connection to the Parts Registry. In contrast to J5, Gibthon uses mFold [26] and throws warnings in case of misprimings or self-primings. But even if J5 proves to be more long lasting or yet an entirely different tool, due to its modular implementation within the Django framework another primer design software could be incorporated. However, so far we focused on the improvement of the Gibthon software solely by including a GeneBank output, which saves primer positions and the description of the assembled fragments. With this version the Gibthon construct can be exported in SBOL, which is also used internally in the NRPSDesigner"

Week 1
This week we finally started the most important part of our project: the lab work. So of course we had first of all to setup the lab for our needs. Providing schottbottels, flasks, test glasses, ...
This week also the first batch of primers arrived so we started the first PCRs.
The PCR for pnikA was done using the Phusion polymerase, the primers pnikA-E,N,X-for and pnikA-S-rev. The annealing temperature was set for 50°C. The template came from the gDNA of the Escherichia coli strain MG1655. ( For more information about the pnikA-system click here ). The expected length of the fragment was 280 bp.
The PCR for prcnA was done using the Phusion polymerase, the primers prcnA-E,N,X-for and prcnA-S-rev. Conditions for the a nnealing temperatur were at 50°C. The template was again the gDNA of the E.coli strain MG1655. ( For more information about the prcnA-system click here ). The expected length of the fragment was 230 bp.
The PCR for for the iron-dependant detector are more complex. There are two systems that need to get combined in the same organism to work. ( For more information about the fur-norB-system click here ).
For the one system there is a fur-box needed. In cause of inapropriate restriction sites there had to be done two mutagenesis PCRs. Both were done via the Phusion polymerase and with an annealing temperatur of 50°C. The 5'-end PCR was done with the primers Fur_Emut_fwd and Fur_RNS_rev (length of the fragment: 350 bp), the 3'-end PCR with the primers Fur_XR_fwd and Fur_Emut_rev (length of the fragment: 170 bp). The template was gDNA from Neisseria meningitidis.

Measurable Expression of Cellobiose Phosphorylase
Figure 21-Right shows that E. coli containing cep94A produces a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 90kDa, which is not produced by a negative control that only contains a PenI regulated promoter. This is in accordance with the expected weight of the protein expressed by the BioBrick containing the cep94A at 92.7 kDA. The protein can be found in the cell lysate regardless of whether the plasmid has a medium or high copy backbone, which is shown in Figure 21-Left.
Figure 21. Left: Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE showing cell lysate and media from E. coli containing the cellobiose phosphorylase (cep94A) , with Lacl promoter on the medium copy  plasmid pSB3K3 and the high copy plasmid pSB1C3.The LacI promoter was induced with IPTG. Right: Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates of E.coli transformed with cep94A with a Lacl promoter compared to a negative control containing LacI + RBS. Approximate reference molecular weights are indicated to the left.
Secretion of the cellulases, endoglucanase and exoglucanase, was examined on a SDS-PAGE, with samples taken from the media isolated from an overnight culture. From the SDS-PAGE at Figure 22 it was not possible to identify any proteins at the expected mass of endoglucanase and exoglucanase (47 kDa and 51 kDA, respectively), that were differentially expressed compared to control strains. However, a positive control should have been included for more conclusive results.

Wednesday 5/8
Today we raised sample’s concentration to run the gel electrophoresis in the final step. Joy mingling with surprise, we found that both PDE5A and GUCY1B3 were expressed in the cells. DNA strips stained by GV could be seen clearly.
Friday 7/8
Today we tested two methods of extract cGMP. The two methods were repetitive freeze-thawing and lysate.  From the test result, we found that repetitive freeze-thawing extracting cGMP was more effective. And we also used sodium nitroprusside to treat cells but it cannot enhance the cGMP concentration.
Saturday 8/8
Today we invited SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX teams to sharing academic experience. And we began a two-day cultivation today. We have the following arrangement today: extracting the plasmid, enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis’s learning includes that how to make up the gel and how to recycle the gel. It’s our pleasure to share our experiment experience to members of high school team. We spent a beautiful day together.
Sunday 9/8
We taught SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX teams that transformation and coating plates. At last we exchanged our ideas about projects and gave some guidance to high school students. The two-day cultivation ended in a satisfactory way.
Monday 10/8
We redesigned the αsubunit primers. We did the experiment again to find out the optimal primer. We successfully found out the best primer by summing up the experience of previous mistakes. Everything goes smoothly today.
Thursday 13/8
We learned to use RT-PCR instrument from professor Ye Yanrui. The professor taught us seriously. We were grateful for him. At last, We put knowledge to practical usage. We set the PT-PCR condition first. And then put the solution into the instrument and start to run. After two hours waiting, the expression of gene had been detected. According to the diagram from the computer, we found that the results of three sample which were silenced gene PDE5A were satisfactory.
On the other side, we did the experiment of cell transfection, and we decided to evaluate the efficiency for eukaryotic cell transfection by using GFP as a report gene in common transfection ways.

Sumbawagen,2014,Team:Sumbawagen#project#econey_-_-_TEXT.html,"04450
We found plasmid BBa_J04450 in iGEM Parts Registry that works based on catabolite repression theory. This plasmid consists of lactose promoter, ribosome binding site, mutant red fluorescent protein gene or mRFP gene and terminator. The LacI promoter works in the presence of lactose, resulting red color in bacteria from mRFP gene expression. Unfortunately, the expression of mRFP gene decreases in the prescence of glucose, resulting yellow color in the bacteria. We use this plasmid to measure glucose concentration.
Constructing Econey
We faced a problem that in high glucose concentration, the red color from mRFP gene expression goes dimer, while we want the device to express brighter red color in high glucose concentration. Thus, we modified the system by changing sensitivity of catabolite repression in order to make the system has ability to express red color in high glucose concentration.
We add 2 new circuits behind plasmid BBa_J04450. The first circuit consists of constitutive promoter, RBS, adenylate cyclase (AC) gene, and a terminator. The second circuit consists of constitutive promoter, RBS, IIA(Glc) gene, and a terminator.
ECONEY CIRCUITS
Our ECONEY consists of 2 circuits.
Circuit #1
Circuit #1 consists of plasmid BBa_J04450 followed by a new circuit that consist of constitutive promoter, RBS, CyaA gene, and a terminator. CyaA gene is controlled by constitutive promoter and located downstream of ECONEY Basic Circuit. Adenylate cyclase synthesize cAMP. Thus in high concentration of glucose, lac promoter may still active.
Circuit #2
Circuit #2 consists of plasmid BBa_J04450 followed by a new circuit that consist of constitutive promoter, RBS, crr gene, and a terminator. Crr gene is also controlled by constitutive promoter and located downstream of ECONEY Basic Circuit. EIIA or IIAGlc in the PTS pathway helps glucose enter the cell. Thus in LOW concentration of glucose, lac promoter may already be repressed.

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#fabAmodeltest_-_-_TEXT.html," The pressure fluctuations are consistent with the applied isothermal-isobaric ensemble and is suggestive of compatible molecular dynamics conditions for simulations of βHACdH.
Figure 4. Graphs of the Energy Minimisation, Temperature, Pressure and Density equilibration of the βHACdH simulation system prior to simulation.
To His-tag or not to His-tag
Now that βHACdH is ready to undergo simulations, we ran a simulation for 1 ns under the notion that we would be able to visualize motions around the N- and C-Terminals during the course of the simulation and therefore determine, which terminal would be more appropriate to add His-tags to. The conclusion for our simulation was that the N-Terminal is ideal for the addition of His-tags for several reasons. Firstly, the C-terminal is localized in close vicinity to the interaction domain of the βHACdH homodimer, therefore the addition of His-tags could possibly interfere with the dimer interaction[6]. Our model also shows that the C-terminal is more dynamic compared to the N-terminal and there are several times in the simulation that the C-terminal interacts with the dimerization domain and may interfere with the folding and function of the protein[4][5][6]. Therefore we concluded that the N-terminal would be ideal to add the His-tags to, as the N-terminal is less dynamic and will be less likely to interfere with folding and the protein function. With this in mind, our experimental team began to design the His-tagged FabA BioBrick ( BBa_K1027003 ) to express a N-Terminal His-tagged βHACdH to use in the characterisation of βHACdH overexpression.

SYNBIO101: Exploring the intersection between synthetic biology and gender equity
Gender inequity is an issue that has plagued STEM fields and society as a whole for many centuries.  The effects of gender bias and inequity have the potential to be extremely harmful, yet much too often go unrealized until it is too late.  For example, between 1997 and 2000, 8 of the 10 drugs that were taken off the market in the United States were recalled because they had effects on women that were not investigated in previous studies (Bernheim, 2013).  In the world of academia, a large underrepresentation of women has been observed when analyzing the gender ratio of students seeking advanced education in STEM fields, as well as when analyzing the gender ratio of PIs (Principal Investigators).

In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using a pHisx6 vector. Then, we determined secreted CALB in the culture medium by Western blot. Compared with the fusion protein expression level in the medium, CALB fused to our improved PelB showed much higher expression than that fused with the peptide in the registry. See more details in the basic part BBa_K2302005 .   The use of the PelB signal sequence for secretory expression is one major improvement for the successful production of our recombinant CALB protein. The PelB signal enabled the translocation of the CALB into the periplasm, where the protein could be correctly folded  with detectable enzyme activity.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Modeling#pqs_-_-_TEXT.html,"1µM.  Below this, expression was effectively zero, and above it, expression was uniformly high.
These results suggest that the levels of synthetic PQS investigated in our engineered pathway were too low and that the ten fold increases used in the experiments would yield no measurable change in mCherry expression, provided the signal level was below the threshold predicted by the model. To investigate this further we went on to carry out stochastic simulations of the system.
Stochastic Simulations Elucidates the “Switch” Behaviour
The lab experiments resulted in no measurable mCherry expression in the PQS system. However, our ODE model predicts that even for very low levels of PQS some mCherry is expressed. These levels could represent below-measurable output, thus are essentially zero. We investigated this further at the “single cell” level.
We constructed a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA)7,8 in order to visualise signal-response at the single cell level. Using the SSA we were able to simulate  mCherry expression of 1000 cells to varying PQS signals over a period of one cell cycle.
At first sight, the stochastic mean in A appeared too low in comparison to the example realisations. However, further analysis revealed that this low mean is caused by many realisations  in which the expression of mCherry was zero (i.e. the promoter never fired).  As shown in Fig 4, in 77% of the realisations for 0.02μM PQS, no mCherry was produced. Increasing the PQS concentration through the previously predicted threshold increased the expression rate  to 90%. For PQS concentrations greater than 2μM, all realisations  produced mCherry in the given time frame.
What is interesting to note is that once expression started,  mCherry was produced at essentially the same rate, as shown by the parallel trajectories in Fig 3.  We can conclude that a major rate limiting step in the system is the probability of the initiation of mCherry expression.
These stochastic simulations enhanced the deterministic results. The switch behaviour between low and high levels mCherry expression resulted in predicted corresponding molecule numbers shown in Table 2.
Increasing Promoter Numbers Increases mCherry Expression
We concluded from the SSA that firing of the mCherry promoter was a major rate limiting step, but wanted to provide the wet team with greater understanding of how to increase mCherry production. Subsequently,  after testing several model hypotheses, it was found that increasing the number of promoters had the greatest impact on the expression of mCherry (vary"

iGEM: beyond the bench
Meetings, Jamborees & Festivals
When contacting professionals in the sponsoring phase or talked around us about our project, we went across different reactions when we had to explain how we wanted to make a drone fly bacteria that would detect pollution. What we mostly observed was the incomprehension of how we could make bacteria react to pollution. We took this observation as the opportunity to use the means at our disposal to implement integrated human practices to our project through different side projects mainly based on the presentation and interaction with the scientific community but also with the average person that would not have any specific skills in biology. We thus tried to develop several events in which we could explain how our project works, and thus popularise synthetic biology and its mechanics and how its spreading to other areas can benefit technology innovation and breakthrough, and transform our way of thinking on the long term.
We firstly organised an iGEM week on one of the campus of the team in order to partially fund our project by selling meals and crêpes, but we also used this opportunity to interact with on-campus students that were really curious about our project. We organised small conferences in which we would present the iGEM competition and explain more in details our project Quantifly, and it allowed us to spread the interest for pollution prevention, and sensibilize students to the iGEM competition.
In addition to this iGEM week,"

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project#Programming Spider Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," Assembly (ICA) as a technique for cloning recombinant spider silks in a time-efficient and specific manner that is unparalleled by existing methods. Our experience shows that ICA can be used as a method for the quick assembly of spider silk genes.
Methodology
Iterative capped assembly is similar to Golden Gate assembly, which uses unique sticky ends to assemble gene fragments in a specific order. Whereas Golden Gate is a one-pot reaction with all the pieces ligated simultaneously, ICA is a more “controlled” variation where pieces are assembled one at a time. ICA relies on using 3 different versions of the monomer to be assembled, each of which has different sticky ends such that the monomers must be assembled in an A-B-C fashion. This prevents monomers from self-ligating. Type IIS restriction enzymes (such as BsaI), which cleave outside of the recognition site are used to generate these.
A basic biobrick for ICA consists of a gene monomer flanked by BsaI recognition and cleavage sites. While each of the core monomer is identical, the restriction sites are oriented such that digestion with BsaI yields distinct sticky ends for each of the three types of units. These pieces must be digested to reveal the sticky ends before assembly.
Fig 1:Schematic of the three types of sticky ends we designed for ICA. Sticky end A is 5’-AGTT-3’. Sticky end B is 5’-TGTC-3’. Sticky end C is 5’-CGTG-3’. An assembled 3-mer construct AB+BC+CA is shown as an example of how these biobricks would be used. Image from Cloning Guide by 2015 TU Eindhoven iGEM team.
Accessory pieces required in ICA include the initiator, streptavidin coated beads, the terminator, and the capping oligos.
The initiator is a dsDNA fragment made by annealing two ssDNA oligos together. The initiator is designed such that one end is biotinylated, for conjugation to streptavidin coated beads. The other end has a sticky overhang and is designed to anneal to the forward sticky end of the ‘A-type’ monomer unit. This end is 5’-phosphorylated to enable ligation. The initiator also contains a primer binding site that can be used for PCR amplification, as well as other accessory sequences such as affinity tags and the biobrick prefix.
Streptavidin coated beads serve as a solid support for the elongating"
Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Project#Promoter study_-_-_TEXT.html,"FBP1 resulted in it being dropped from the study due to time limitations. pTEF1 is generally regarded as a strong constitutive promoter [2], pPYK2 is repressed by glucose and thus derepressed in glucose free media [3], and pPCK1 is induced by acetate [4]. Even though pTEF1 is regarded as constitutive, we were able to find little or no work where its activity on acetate was investigated. More importantly, when data regarding acetate induced promoters was found, it was data regarding how much a promoter was induced compared to itself and comparisons between different promoters were not available.
The choice to look into both constitutive, inducible and derepressed promoters had a few reasons. Firstly, constitutive promoters are convenient since they provide robust regulation and expression of the genes of interest. On the other hand, since many of the constitutive promoters are quite strong, we were worried that their expression levels would cause depletion of other amino acids. That could happen since the Gln1 protein coded by GLN1 gene synthesizes glutamine from glutamate, which is also involved in the synthesis of other amino acids [5]. Inducible promoters might be a remedy for this, since their activities could be lower, especially at low levels of acetate. Further, a production and excretion of glutamine that is proportional to the acetate availability could be an efficient way to regulate the co-culture system, since high acetate availability in the case of this project indicates high growth and metabolism of the cyanobacteria, possibly meaning that they will require more glutamine.
Method
The strain used for the promoter study was IMX581. It has Cas9 integrated into the genome and its parent strain is CEN.PK113-5D [6]. Just like its parent strain, it is auxotroph for uracil. It was chosen for the promoter study since the plan was to use it for the co-culture with the cyanobacteria.
The plasmids used in the study was p416-TEF1-GFP and p416-TEF1 [7]. They are the same plasmid except that the p416-TEF1-GFP has GFP inserted after the TEF1 promoter while the p416-TEF1 does not have anything inserted after the TEF1 promoter, it’s “empty”. Both plasmids have ampicillin resistance and a gene for synthesizing uracil. They were supplied to us by the systems biology institution at Chalmers (SYSBIO). The p416-TEF"

OTHER: Colony PCR
Please tell us about any challenges or problems you encountered during the cloning process.
We had difficulties performing standard BioBricks assembly of the final device constructs, namely in the initial transformation of the GFP reporter     construct BBa_I13504. We attempted to transform both the pSB1A2 and pSB1C3 variants, using both chemically competent and electrocompetent transformation     line protocols. We observed no colony growth from the DNA products derived from the Registry we were given, so we had to resort to ordering each device     sequence using IDT gBlocks gene synthesis.
Additionally, we have difficult with false positive clones in Devices 2 and 3, where the resulting overnighted cultures from selected colonies did not     grow. More colonies were picked and overgrown to alleviate this situation, but it did result in general delays throughout the process. Sequencing of the     derived plasmid constructs revealed proper Device sequence, so we verified cloning success.
Protocol – Growing Cells for Measurement
Step 1: Streak out an agar plate with your organism containing the device and any control organisms you used.
a. Streak out 1 plate per device and control.
b. Incubate plates overnight (18-20 hours or until individual colonies are clearly visible)"

AQA_Unesp,2017,Team:AQA Unesp#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to Kamei et al. (2013) [3] and PenShuff, a synthetic CPP designed by Kristensen et al., 2015 [4]. In order to evaluate the influence of CPP-insulin associated position at the protein absorption, we designed N-terminal and C-terminal CPP-insulin combinations, as shown at image 3. Furthermore, we added His-tag gene sequence at one construct for further purifications.
Figure 2. Insulin penetrating the enterocyte plasma membrane, by the action of the CPP/PTD.
Summarizing the expression scheme, the single chain insulin analog will be expressed by the bacteria (Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus subtilis) adhered at the gut mucus and exported outside of the cell by the action of signal peptides, reaching the gut. After that, the expressed insulin will penetrate the enterocytes’ plasma membrane by the help of associated CPPs to finally reach the bloodstream.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Labwork#OurProtocols#Making Agar Plates_-_-_TEXT.html," sink to cool it down - only once it is cool enough to transfer. 'This means that the water flask should cool down more rapidly than the LB+agar flask.
Once the LB+agar flask has got to the temperature where it is still very warm but not unbearable (you should be able to put your hand on the base without burning yourself), pour the distilled water from the other flask into it. Make sure that the bunsen flame is used - this step must be aseptic
Swirl a few times and then, using aseptic technique, pour all the contents from the LB flask back into the currently empty 'distilled water' flask. Seal with foil.
By placing all of the content into the LB flask and then pouring it all back into the distilled water flask, you are sufficiently mixing the solutions. And because the distilled water flask has been cooling more rapidly than the LB flask, the solution will be stored in the cooler flask before being poured into plates - this is an optimum condition.
If necessary, add the antibiotics to LB solution flask.
You are now ready to pour the plates - make sure that you do this immediately otherwise the LB+agar will cool and solidify in the flask
Pouring the plates
Pour the plates using roughly 25ml of the solution for each Petri dish using the aseptic technique
Leave the dishes for 30 minutes in room temperature
Put them into 42C incubator with their lids off to dry them off
If you are not using the dishes straight away leave them on the bench for a day before placing them to the fridge
Making up starch plates
Starch plates are useful for determining whether bacteria have become transformed by DNA if that plasmid happens to render amyE (a gene encoding the enzyme Amylase which breaks down starch) inactive. For example, the GFP-rrnb vector plasmid causes amyE knock-out in Bacillus subtilis.
To make up LB + agar + starch plates, you need to follow the normal protocol for making 1 litre of LB+agar solution (see above) except you will need to add 10g of starch powder to the 500ml LB+agar solution flask before autoclaving. 1 gram of starch powder to 100ml of LB is the correct ratio.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," could think of much more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering with a final goal of a “minimal peroxisome” by redirecting metabolic pathways through changing the protein-localization-signal in the yeast genome. Additionally, endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment for establishing a customized metabolism specifically tailored for the user's application.
Introduction
In order to achieve a fully controllable artificial compartment, the first step was to design a completely orthogonal import system. Next was the knockout of endogenous import systems. However, a few proteins are imported neither by the Pex5 nor the Pex7 import machinery. Therefore, specific genome engineering designs, such as knockouts, deleting or redirecting the protein localization could be utilized for the ultimate goal of creating a synthetic organelle.
Additionally, knockouts or genome integrations enable customization of the peroxisomal properties, such as membrane permeability, size/number, decoupling of peroxisomes from cytoskeleton and the peroxisomal metabolism.
All these strategies allow a rational design of an artificial compartment, which is fully engineerable regarding  the proteome, metabolome and the entire peroxisomal environment.
Design of yeast multi -knockout strains
The Crispr Cas9 System
The demands on yeast engineering have significantly increased with the design of more complex systems and extensive metabolic pathways. Genetic techniques that have historically relied on marker recycling are unable to keep up with the ambitions of synthetic biologists. In recent years the Crispr Cas9 system has been used for several strain-engineering purposes, including:
Markerless integration of multiple genetic cassettes into selected genomic loci
Multiplexed and iterative gene knockouts without the need to recycle a marker
Precise genome editing – nucleotide substitutions, etc.
We utilized the Cas9 system as a tool for peroxisomal engineering and have adopted the existing toolbox from (Lee et al. 2015) and the complete cloning system which also provides the possibilities for genome integration and gene editing by Cas9. For this, two oligonucleotides have to be designed for targeting the Cas protein to the gene of interest.
Figure 1: Plasmid construction for the gRNA expression plasmid
Two oligos, containing the targeting sequence of the gRNA, have to be annealed and can then be integrated in the gRNA entry Vector by a Golden Gate reaction. Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
Several gRNA vectors can subsequently be assembled into one vector with a Cas9 expression cassette and then be transformed into yeast."

OVERVIEW
Synthetic biology can be controversial, and we know that. As scientists, we wanted to make sure that we explored the societal and humanitarian consequences of OxyPonics. We tasked ourselves with deeply analyzing food legislation laws, farming costs, environmental impact, and risk. Through industry interviews, research articles, consultations with legal experts, and intense analysis, we developed a 360 degree view of our project. From the ground up, society to scientist.
WHY OXYPONICS?
Hydroponics is the future. Because it is space and water efficient, as well as an easy to locally source, hydroponics is a rapidly growing industry projected to be worth nearly $400 million by 2020 [1]. However, despite its promise, many hydroponic growers struggle to break even. Overhead is high and profit margins are low due to disease and a lack of experienced labor.
OxyPonics addresses this issue. By optimizing growth using oxidative stress, a novel but reliable method of measuring health and the chemical balance, hydroponic growers can improve crop yield and thus their margins. OxyPonics provides comprehensive, remote, real-time monitoring that existing systems cannot provide. Furthermore, the optogenetic feedback loop we developed enables OxyPonics to respond in real-time, while remaining significantly cheaper than more limited existing solutions.
THE LAW
Before putting OxyPonics out to market, the product must abide by federal and state regulations for water quality, agriculture, and food safety. Despite the extensive legislation on the regulation of genetically modified organisms, there is no existing body of legislation regarding synthetic biology-assisted food production. Since our crops are not genetically modified themselves, we had to look past existing legislation for answers.

The TrgEnvZ-OmpR pathway. From Fig. 3 of Looger, et al., ""Computational design of receptor and  sensor proteins with novel functions"", Nature (2003).
In normal E. coli cells, ribose binding to RBP forms a ribose-RBP complex that interacts with the periplasmic domain of Trg, which in turn activates an intracellular cascade that induces chemotaxis.  To link activation of Trg to induction of gene expression, we created a fusion between Trg periplasmic receptor domain and the EnvZ intracellular kinase domain by stitching the two intracellular domains at a shared NdeI restriction site. (as done in Baumgartner JW, et al. “Transmembrane signalling by a hybrid protein: communication from the domain of chemoreceptor Trg that recognizes sugar-binding proteins to the kinase/phosphatase domain of osmosensor EnvZ” (1994)). EnvZ phosphorylates the transcription factor OmpR, which causes transcription of DNA regulated by OmpC promoter.

These knock-in mutations were selected for our strain library as they have both been demonstrated to destabilise the outer membrane of numerous gram negative strains and induce increased production of OMVs.
Attachment protein g3p has been shown to interact with TolA, a protein which confers outer membrane stability. Interaction between TolA and g3p destabilises the outer membrane, promoting OMV production. Interaction is mediated by both the N1 and N2 domains of g3p [2]. To date, however, only N1 has been assessed for its OMV-inducing capacity; thus, this is the terminus we also worked with.
TolR, meanwhile is part of the Tol-Pal complex which tethers the outer membrane to the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 1). Overexpression of tolR has been linked to loss of outer membrane integrity, and increased OMV production [3].
Figure 1: Composition of the Gram-negative cell envelope, showing the Tol-Pal complex. From Schwechheimer & Kuehn, 2015 [4]
TolA is also part of the Tol-Pal complex. Knock-out mutations of tolA have been attributed to loss of function of the Tol-Pal complex, and increased OMV production [5].
Knock-out mutations of degP have also been linked to hypervesiculation. DegP is an envelope stress-inducible periplasmic chaperone-protease, and previous studies have shown that ΔdegP mutants produce higher levels of OMVs [6].
We also hoped to produce the knock-out mutations of tolA and degP ourselves using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, however, due to setbacks and time limitations this was not possible for our team. Instead, the ΔtolA and ΔdegP E. coli strains were obtained from the Yale CSGC (Coli Genetic Stock Centre). Strains possessing both a knock-in and knock-out mutations were also created, in order to test the cumulative effects of these mutations.
The relative effect of these various mutations E. coli have not yet been established prior to our project. Thus, each of our E. coli genetic variants were assessed on ability to hypervesiculate, taking into account both size and amount of OMVs produced. To achieve these analyses, we harvested OMVs from our cell cultures utilised NanoSight technology.

Plasmid construction
In our project, these plasmids are required.
Receptor plasmid
Coding sequencing of Human histamine receptor (HRH4) was got from plasmid pH4R-mCherry-N1. Separately, HRH4 CDS and HRH4-mCherry fusion sequencing were obtained by PCR. We chose pGADT7-AD (Leu2 marker) and use HindIII to remove SV40-NLS sequencing, GAL4 activation domain and HA tag. Then insert HRH4 or HRH4-mCherry between ADH1 promoter and ADH1 terminator.
Fig.2 The insertion of HRH4 or HRH4-mCherry into pGADT7-AD plasmid
pGADT7-HRH4-mCherry was used to express HRH4-mCherry fusion protein to show the expression and localization of HRH4 in yeast. pGADT7-HRH4 was used to express functional HRH4.
Reporter
We used part: BBa_K775004 as our reporter, because it was not released, so we used PCR to get Fus1 promoter from yeast genome, EGFP and ADH1 terminator from other plasmids, then used Gibson assembly it with EGFP and inserted into plasmid pYSE2.0 digested with SpeI and EcoRI (Ura3 marker).

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Further Explanation
We calculated based on the assumption that our product will be mass produced by OEM company and sold to the primacy schools directly. This process will be out-sourced, so product suppliers have to cover a part of production costs. In this process we have to ensure the energy supply, we also have inventory to ensure that if the product is defective or damaged it can be replaced in a timely manner, however, this will not be profit, but self-absorption. To reduce the cost of waste due to overproduction, we will take pre-orders and sign contracts with the schools for a period of one month to confirm that the amount of each production is in line with the market. By determining of the amounts of devices and consumables beforehand, we can sell the product in better condition. Besides, we hope that we could attract government subsidy of the costs of production in the future via cooperation.

Computer-Aided Design
Computer-aided design in biology helps increasing the efficiency of biological manipulation and experimentation while easing the process of design and optimization. For our project we have used Serial Cloner, a free software. This software offers all the tools to manipulate and analyze DNA sequences (identification of restriction sites in a DNA sequence, simulation of DNA transcription to RNA and translation to protein, generating the inverse and/or complementary sequence, comparing two sequences together, etc.).
For each plasmid ordered, the following steps are followed:
Identification of parts of interest
Assembly of units and construction of the final plasmid on Serial Cloner
Check that the EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI PstI restriction sites are not present in the final sequence and if they are, remove them by silent mutation
Check that the spacing between the regulatory regions of the transcript and the TATAA box or between ribosome binding site and the initiation codon ATG are well respected

The use of these three solvents in parallel allows us to test the difference in fluorescence between an isotonic medium (NaCl, PBS) or a non-isotonic one (distilled water). In a 96 well plate, 25 µL of whole blood or serum were added to 25 µL of fluorescein in solution. Four calibration ranges assays were set:

HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
We established mentorship with team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou at the very beginning. Since they are all new to igem, having little experience and very basic knowledge of the correct procedures and protocols they would require to complete their lab work, we gave advices on their team building, project design and experimental skills. Also, we helped them construct and standardize a gene that express a fusion protein of three different enzymes linked with EAAAK and GGGGS protein linker.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," Ferritin file created in Maya 2014. So I switched to Maya 2014 and now everything worked fine.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
The modelling is finished for now; until data from our experiments start to coming in, there is nothing to model. To help prepare the experiments I was spending time studying experimental design and analysis techniques, with focus on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and factorial design. The book I had chosen to study from was Montgomery's Design and Analysis of Experiments textbook.
Week 10: July 1 - July 5
After talking to Taylor it has been determined that we shall do a factorial design to investigate the effects of concentration and PH on the magneto-ferritin we will prepare in our lab. The goal is to quickly find better operating conditions to move on to next stages of the experiment. But not until the raw materials has arrived and prepared, so far I can only try to learn more about factorial design.
It has been decided that for the modelling in Autodesk Maya, we shall use the plug-in ePMV, which is only available for 2013 as the latest version. So installing both Maya 2013 and ePMV. Our vision is to simulate the bonding between parts, so I was studying dynamics and other related techniques in Maya as well.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
This week's focus has been on Maya. Mostly figuring out how to import protein data base files (.pdb) and how to install and use various extensions in ePMV. I found out that the ePMV website doesn't help much but YouTube has wonderful video tutorials on ePMV.
Cesar complained about he can't import ferritin sphere into Maya. I tried and it took me about 4 minutes to load the protein database file. To change the color scheme takes further 40 seconds at least. The resulting Maya file can be as large as 50 MB, sometimes 100 MB more.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
Kept working on Maya. Now all parts of the assembly have been loaded to Maya and ribbon, coarse surface, surface and atom models have been constructed. We were trying to print the modelled scenes from Maya, by rendering the scenes to images. But so far we have no success; all rendering methods in Maya resulted in poor images that we can't visualize the 3D structure. Sometimes the colors were lost resulted in a region of red surface. This problem occurred on all computers with Maya installed, under many different settings, even in Autodesk Max, but not"

The simplest example with only E.coli cell
introduction
As the simplest example, a model of a flask with only E.coli cells inside will be shown. Only one reaction will be considered: the replication of E.coli. However, it is not trivial. MoDeL enables users to add such an auto-catalytic replication reaction easily and conveniently. The minimal database used for this model could be download here.
database construction
We only provide key points regarded with construction of this minimal database. To add the auto-catalytic reaction in the Reaction container, a species with only part E.coli is required. It has the simplest Chain-Node model format: only one chain with one part and no trees. The auto-catalytic reaction has one modifier and one product and they are both referred to E.coli defined in Species container. Since they are compartment-type species (species representing a compartment), attribute itself of compartmentLabel node in modifiers and products definitions should be set the same with label of the compartment they represent in the compartments definition. It ensures that the product and the modifier are the same, avoiding wrong mismatch of the product which is different with the modifier. Since number of E.coli cells will reach a stable level in a long time course, we use <math>k_{g}(1-C_{E.coli}/C_{max})C_{E.coli}V_{Flask}</math> as the reaction rate, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the growth rate of E.coli, <math>V_{Flask}</math> represents the size of E.coli, and <math>C_{E.coli}</math> and <math> C_{max}</math> are concentration of E.coli and its max concentration in the flask, respectively.

Communication
Being Online
Communication is really important to exchange our ideas while doing our project, thus we attached much attention to talking with many teams in China.
With Nanjing-China
The communication with Nanjing-China was held on April 3th to 5th during the Tomb-sweeping-day vacation in China. The contents contained both projects and some experience about experiments and modeling. And we sincerely appreciated Nanjing-China for their assistance of providing of some key parts for our project. Hope we can develop synthetic biology together with our true friendship.
With XMU
We participated the publication of newsletter firstly held by XMU. The newsletter, published every week as planned, will involve many teams from all over the world to introduce the project of their own and provide some key information and complicated problems of doing experiments. The first newsletter of our team was mainly about the brief introduction of our project and the history of our team. The second one contains the latest breakthrough of our work and puzzles required to be solved. The third letter talked about the organization of our team and the development of our team.
The 2nd International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference in Taiwan
The 2nd International genetically engineering machine conference was held in Hsinchu, Taiwan by National Chiao Tong University (NCTU) and NCTU_Formosa in August 3 to 8.More than 20 teams from Taiwan and Mainland joined the conference for understanding each other and meeting many friends. The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session.During the meeting, we introduced our project to all, received much valuable advice and gave much advice about other teams' work, especially the new team NEAU_China. And the host guided us to visit Chi Hu in which Chiang Kai-Shek, the president of ROC, were buried and the National Palace Museum where many treasures and collections sit. We sincerely acknowledge NCTU for their warm serve and we gained a lot through the conference.

The meet-up in our school is held up by USTC_Software in August 15-17. 6 teams in China joined the meet-up. We introduced our development and breakthrough of our project so did them. Because this meet-up was mainly built for"
ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," of the utilization of the solar energy for the sun was the ultimate way that we human beings could get sustainable source of energy. As he further stated, thanks to the development of the modern technologies, for now lots of simi-conductive materials people had discovered showed a relative high efficiency to collect sun light. However the central problems laid on how to efficiently utilize that solar energy we collected. Similar to what we applied in our project, Pro. Mi considered hydrogen gas as a good choice for the solar energy conversion. With its high molecular energy density as well as the simple chemical constituents, hydrogen demonstrated ideal characteristics to be an energy source. Also, without the participation of the carbon, the only product of the combustion of hydrogen was only water which had no side effect to the environment. This made hydrogen the complete clean energy source.
Then, in response to public concerns towards hydrogen application that we found in the previous questionnaire, Pro. Mi also gave some words to dispel the misgivings. For the very top concern, the safety problem, Pro.Mi said, actually for each of the efficient energy source, there would be a hidden danger. Since the matter could provide huge amount of energy supply, dangerous disaster happened when the source was out of control and huge amount of energy was released in an extreme shout period of time. However, this would never be the reason preventing people from using this high-density energy source. Academically speaking, hydrogen gas was similar to nature gas or coal gas that was widely used in every family; as long as people followed the safety instructions and properly used them, and then the usage of hydrogen was very safe. Due to its low density, hydrogen gas was more likely to self-flow away to higher space; therefore it was less like to reach its explosion limits. Moreover, since people could deal with the carbon monoxide which was even toxic besides its possible explosion, why could not people handle hydrogen gas? With regards of the transport and storage of hydrogen, modern technologies were pretty mature in the field. So people could just benefit from those advanced technologies, and there was no need to worry about this as well.
Finally, we discussed our project with Pro Mi in detail. Pro. Mi was very excited and showed a positive attitude about our project. As he commented, a good solar energy platform that could be put into mass production should meet all of the three criteria which were 1.high efficiency, 2.low cost, and 3.sustainable. Usually, most of the research results could only meet two of the requirements at most, which greatly limited the industrialization and further development of the research results. However, in"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#Ethics#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," for example providing the solution against food scarcity in the world.
The consumer also has to see the advantage from introducing this technology into the field. This might be accomplished if we look at the fact that people are willing to pay extra money for bio-products. And introducing E. coligy might reduce the use of pesticides and increase crop yield thus fulfilling the demand for ecological agriculture by the consumer and meanwhile reducing the price. This effect should easily be felt by consumers mentioned Anneleen Vandeplas, for example when we look at the use of genetically engineered crops in America, one can see that the profit from using this crops is equally divided between farmer, consumer and the biotech company.
Dr. ir. Anneleen Vandeplas.
Unrestricted Research
There is always risk involved with the introduction of new technologies. A risk analysis is required, in which we have to look at the risk and multiply it with the damage done. Another factor is the timeframe in which this damage will last. The Cartagena protocol is a protocol for genetically engineered organisms that defines that the risk has to be almost zero, making it hard for new technologies to be introduced in Europe. This also makes it difficult for small companies to invest in these technologies leaving only big multinationals to get past this testing phase. Part of the synthetic biology will fall under the regulation of genetically modified organisms (GMO’s). René Custer said that on the other hand when new parts are made that do not currently exist in nature performing a risk analysis will be a lot harder. For instance when making proteins consisting of amino acids not residing in nature or creating new organisms that replicate themselves.
We can also look at the methods used in agriculture and cattle-breeding in the past where such a debate was never held before the technology was introduced. Some examples are the ‘Belgian blue’ , irradiation of crops and the selection of ‘meat chickens’ . Also in chemical industry thousands of non-natural compounds are produced and the increased prevalence of certain cancers is associated with these chemicals. At this instant a total restriction of synthetic biology is not necessary. We should be vigilant however when new applications are developed that history does not repeat itself.
Anneleen Vandeplas also mentioned that the opinion of the consumer also seems to be just one reason against the introduction on the market of GMO’s. Much more important is the fact that this technology is better developed in America and that Europe protects its own market by prohibiting import of these cheaper modified crops.

DESIGN
Modifying a DNA Message
Recent work with serine integrases (see Appendix on Serine Integrases) has demonstrated their utility in implementing digital memory [1] and Boolean logic [2,3] in DNA through inversion of DNA sequences. We sought to incorporate an invertible promoter switch into a DNA message, consisting of a promoter whose orientation can be flipped and restored through action of a serine integrase and a corresponding recombination directionality factor (RDF). The switch would allow different gene expression based on its state, could function in digital memory storage, and could be flipped in sender cells before transmission or in receiver cells after receipt of the message.
As part of this goal, we designed four invertible promoter switches, corresponding to combinations of two different integrase systems, Bxb1 and Phi C31, with two different promoters, J23119 and J23118 (see the BioBricks page). Our design is directly inspired by and closely mimics the recombinase addressable data (RAD) module designed by Bonnet et al [1], which uses the Bxb1 integrase system.  The invertible promoter switch consists of a promoter flanked by att sites, with a transcription terminator upstream of the promoter. Expression of integrase alone or in concert with RDF inverts the switch through recombination of the att sites. The terminator guards against transcription of genes upstream of the promoter that should only be transcribed when the switch is in its opposite state (Figure 1). See the Experiment and Results pages for information on our implementation of invertible promoter switches and the integrase/RDF BioBricks we produced for working with the switches.
When the switch is in “PB” state, the promoter is flanked by attP and attB sites, and in “RL” state the promoter is flanked by attR and attL sites. Flipping from PB to RL is catalyzed by integrase and is irreversible in the presence of integrase alone. Flipping from RL to PB is catalyzed by integrase in conjunction with RDF, and is irreversible in the presence of these proteins together. For more on the"

Biocontainment
In all living organisms each amino acid is encoded by a three nucleotide codon. Changing which codon corresponds to which amino acid has been of scientific interest for many years but has proved difficult as changing one would require changing them throughout the genome, a non-trivial task. As such, the implications of large-scale genetic recoding has never been a concern of biosecurity.
Our cell-free system is quite amenable to recoding as the tRNA anticodon can be altered prior to expression changing what amino acid is coded by each codon (see Biocontainment section in Design ). As such we hoped to use this feature to make our Next vivo safe for use outside of laboratories. Changing the tRNA anticodons results in a modified codon table that can be used for encoding  DNA or RNA message as an input. By altering our system to only read a modified code, it prevents environmental sequences from contaminating our system modified inputs from being transferred to living organisms and/or modified inputs from being transferred to living organisms [42]. This prevents accidental environmental contamination being introduced by our system. From the research we conducted within environmental regulations, our system becomes more in-line with current regulations and their aim to ensure that synthetic biology produced products do not have a detrimental effect on the environment.
This season we explored the possibilities of how to generate modified sequences. We developed a codon reassignment tool that allows further research into creating safe orthogonal systems. However, this lead us to consider the dual-use implications of this kind of technology for society, particularly DNA synthesis companies. These companies rely on BLAST to detect any harmful sequences sent in DNA synthesis orders. If modified codon tables were used instead of the standard codon table, the companies would not be able to identify harmful sequences. This gap within the current bioinformatic workflow is an issue with no solution being actively pursued by concerned parties. We have come up with a software suite as a solution to this problem and have been in contact with multiple companies for them to test if they could detect a harmful sequence. It was suggested to us in our biosecurity interviews that this may not have been an issue that DNA Synthesis Companies have had to deal with before. We felt it was in the best interest of the synthesis companies to"

He is not just an expert regarding chemical synthetical biology (xenobiology), but also on genetic code engineering, making him an excellent adviser for our project. Ned talked about “the potentials of non-canonical amino acids in synthetic biology  and possible alternative life”. His talk gave a broad overview about the field. He put emphasis on the fact that the genetic code is degenerated and for incorporating non-canonical amino acids, an extension of the genetic code is needed. This extension could be achieved by evolution and selection of tRNA/amino acyl-tRNA synthetase pairs. This pair needs to be chosen depending on the chemical properties and conformation of the given non-canonical amino acids to ensure maximal substrate enzyme binding and incorporation efficiency. Through the following discussions regarding our project, Ned’s insight into our project was very important. Given that we want to incorporate non-canonical amino acids into proteins and peptides, he made us aware that we need to look into the formation and capacity of the binding pocket of the synthetases we want to evolve and select for the non-canonical amino acids. He also indicated possible problems for in vivo incorporation of non-canonical amino acids, mainly the elongation factor EF-Tu and the ribosomes. On the topic of unnatural base pairs and incorporation of non-canonical amino acids, Ned gave us the advice to consider using the synthetase for pyrrolysin. This specific synthetase does not recognize the anticodon loop on its corresponding tRNA. Thus, the changing of the codon and anticodon would possibly not interfere with ribosomal incorporation of a given amino acid using unnatural base pairs. We are very happy that Ned invited us to his laboratory in Berlin. Our team member Olga went to Berlin to work with experts on this research field and to use a sophisticated selection library for the generation of a novel tRNA synthetase.

Just by base-pairing the beads will be stopped. They are put in excess for the detection, so even if there is the target in the sample to be analyzed, some beads are going to migrate to the control band.
How to fix aptamers on the paper strip? We got inspired by another iGEM project, from the 2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman team . They developed a Streptavidin linked to a Cellulose binding domain, fusion protein. We took this idea and pushed it a little further, characterizing their part and building new and more efficient ones. Basically, aptamers are biotinylated, they bind to the Streptavidin part, which is fixed onto cellulose thanks to the cellulose binding domains.
Another important aspect of the project was the design of a real device. If one wants to sell a detection platform, it must not only be the biological part, but also a real device to pack it. So we designed and 3D printed a device. A first model was designed as a prototype to test our paper strips. A second one was designed to be specifically used in real life. It’s a cornerstone for our project, because that’s what people are going to see and use.
Summary of the project advancement. The fluorescent detection system was functional. But it was not easy to use at home so we oriented toward the latex beads based system. It works in vitro but we still have some difficulties to make it work on paper.
Sources of Inspiration and motivations
Aptamers were not used at all in the labs of our school, but we learned they existed by reading literature. We immediately found out it was a promising technology. We looked further in literature to get some ideas about signal transduction with aptamers. That brought us to the idea of using fluorescence. After some tests, we were a little disappointed, so we went to an international congress about Aptamers in Bordeaux (France). Some researchers, and particularly Dr. Ciara O’Sullivan, brought us to the idea of using nanoparticles covalently linked to the aptamers. This idea seduced us and we immediately started working on it. But instead of using gold nanoparticles like most of the labs we chose to use latex beads. That’s a much more eco-friendly option, plus on a large scale it’s less expensive.
Our major motivation was to provide the world with a good solution to detect STIs. But we soon realized that what we achieved is actually a"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#demoOverview_-_-_TEXT.html," MoDeL. It is never a easy problem to calculate degradation rates of proteins since different parts in a fused protein may have different degradation rates and the overall rate is still unknown. What's more, a protein in MoDeL may have different protein chains and it is more complex to determine the overall rate. In the demo database, we assume all proteins with no parts in bound state have a uniform degradation rate. Proteins with more than one chains are considered stable and non-degradable. This idea could be applied easily by writing reaction templates in MoDeL format. The reactant is a general species template with only one substituent-type part (ANYUB) of type ForwardProtein (no reverse reactions happened here). It is similar for degradation of mRNA molecules. Only mRNAs with single chain degrades at the same rate.
For reactions of dilution due to reproduction of cells, quantities of species decrease in a similar way to degradation. The rate of dilution is also similar to the reproduction rate of E.coli:
<math>k_{g}(1-C_{E.coli}/C_{max})C_{species}V_{Flask}</math>
where we only replace the second <math>C_{E.coli}</math> with concentration of species in dilution. To apply this idea, we only need to construct a species with only one substituent-type part (ANY) of no specific type and it will be matched to all species. Among them, only species bound in compartment E.coli will be diluted.
Replication of plasmid DNAs is not as easy as reproduction of living cells in two aspects: first, plasmid backbone with the same replication origin could be found in many species in the system because the original transformed plasmid backbone may bind with other compounds or proteins to form complex; second, the replication of original transformed plasmid DNA molecule tends to be repressed by all species including the same replication origin. However, E.coli cells do not have any effects on the reproduction of other E.coli cells. MoDeL language perfectly support this idea by separating the template reaction into replications and repressions. The first part describes the exponential amplification of plasmids with reaction rate <math>k_{g}C_{plasmid}V_{E.coli}</math>, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the replication rate of a certain plasmid, <math>C_{plasmid}</math> is the concentration of this plasmid, and <math>V_{E.coli}</math> is the volume of E.coli cell."

The size of exosomes attained ranged around 270nm. Basing the particle size and relative intensity, we also created a 3D plot for a visual explanation. Under measurement condition listed, the exosomes secreted by HEK293 cells were assayed for 2.95 E8 particles each milliliter. Then the relationship between particle number and protein was determined that exosomes in 1 ng protein were equivalent to 6277.95 particles, according to the dilution multiple (24) and protein concentration (1127.756 ng/ul) we have tested. All the data collected helped us decide the transfection dosage of siRNA and dosing of treatment prepared for animal experiment.

1.4 The iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA suppressed KRAS expression in A549 cells in vitro
We next evaluate the effect of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA on KRAS expression in vitro. The KRAS expression level was assayed in A549 cells after co-cultured with exosomal KRAS siRNA. Non-loaded iRGD-exosomes were used as control to ascertain that any RNAi response observed did not derive from the exosomes per se. The western electrophoresis and knockdown data obtained from qPCR analysis of KRAS gene expression indicated that KRAS protein and mRNA levels both dramatically decreased in the cells incubating with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA compared with cells treating with nude exosomes or without any treatment. This result suggests that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can deliver siRNA into target cells and finally reduce the KRAS expression.
Figure 6. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of KRAS mRNA levels in A549 cells without any treatment (NC), transfected with non-loaded exosomes (exosome) and transfected with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA (siRNA-exosome) shows that exosomal KRAS siRNA can down-regulate KRAS expression in transcription level.

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html,".   The  documentary allowed us to continuously speak to those who would be affected by our project, and learn about them. It  was also important because it would shine light on a community that is largely ignored. Many in Alberta, and by extension the world, do not know how important beekeeping is in Alberta . By completing the documentary, putting it online, and by giving it to the Alberta Beekeepers Association we have allowed many people to become aware of  Alberta beekeepers, hear their opinions, and learn of the issues that were affecting them. Beekeepers and the organization  chose  to support our documentary because they were excited by and saw the importance of these conversations,. They saw the platform we could provide them with to showcase their community and what they do.
We are also going to continue to give back to the community by presenting at the 85th Annual Conference and Trade Show for the Alberta Beekeepers association, on November 5th. Though this is happening after the Jamboree, it is a commitment that we have made because we value the community. We believe that our contributions should stretch outside of what may benefit us through the iGEM  competition.
Finally, we provided testing for Nosema of the beekeepers that we interacted with. This was a thank you to the beekeepers allowing us to interview them, and a way to assess how much the beekeepers we spoke with were affected by Nosema.
This affected our project because it solidified our involvement with stakeholders and forced us to learn about their communities.
Ethics
When considering ethics we wanted to make sure our research was premised on what we should do, not simply what we could do. The first major ethical consideration was what precautions we should take into account when designing our project, through the frame that it could actually be introduced into the environment. The second consideration was how to work with bees in a lab setting, as they are living creatures. We speak to many of our ethical considerations on the safety page.
Our ultimate goal was that our project could be used to improve the health and survival of bees. Achieving this goal requires introducing our creation into the environment, and therefore necessitates the consideration of what the wider impacts of our project on living animals and ecosystems might be. In addition to conducting experiments to ensure that neither porphyrin nor E. coli would be harmful to bees, we also had to think about the impact of E. coli and porphyrin beyond the bees we are trying to treat. Our construct was made in Bl21 DE3 E. coli. This is a lab strain, and therefore survives poorly in the"

But Vitamin C is less effective and had no obvious antioxidant effect in this assay. We thought                         this result may had two reasons. First, the Vitamin C shows a low direct-antioxidant activity,                         especially at low concentration (10 µM) compared to another two. Or the Vitamin C main                         principle of anti-oxidation is its indirect-antioxidant activity, like activation of cell's                         natural anti-oxidative enzymes, which is hard to reflect in fluorescence ratio level just in 30                         mins.
In a word, our system gave a similar result to CAA assay in three selected antioxidant tests.                         This proves our system can detect the antioxidant in living cell. But we need more antioxidant                         test to verify our system's function and limitation, especially indirect-antioxidative                         antioxidant, for finding ""Who can get an A?""

For various experiments the E-/K-coil combination IAAL E3 and IAAL K3 reported by Litowksi et al. in 2002 was used.
α-helical coiled-coils represent a widely abundant but simple oligomerization motif in proteins. They have an enormous diversity of functions in nature ranging from motor proteins to transcription factors and chaperones [1]. Coiled-coils are comprised of one single secondary protein structure: the α-helix. Their quaternary structure is stable and does not unfold in aqueous solution at a neutral pH unlike other peptide α-helices. One of the striking structural features of the coiled coils is their build-up of two to five α-helices. These helices contain a heptad repeat of mainly apolar amino acids which is denoted as (abcdefg)^n in literature. The letters a and d are usually amino acids with a highly hydrophobic side chain. The side chains are packed against each other forming a hydrophobic core which allows the formation of a supercoil. Whereas the letter n is representing the number of helices in the final coil. The helices can be identical or even different in sequence and may be aligned in a parallel/antiparallel way. The amino acids of the letters e and g have typically charged residues to allow electrostatic interactions with other peptides (most importantly other coils)[2]. The process of dimerization is largely dependent on the peptide sequence and can be  homodimeric (Figure 2.) or heterodimeric (e.g. E- and K-coil). In our project we are utilizing heterodimeric coiled-coils to noncovalently attach proteins. This system is advantageous because of the high stability and specificity. The use of heterodimeric coils additionally prevents the self-dimerization of either the virus capsid monomer or the protein (or ligand) of choice.
Figure 3: cross-section view of a E-/ K-coil heterodimer
In figure 3 the chemical interactions of a E- and K-coil pair are shown, unfortunately not the pair we have used in the case of our experiments. The wide white arrows depict the interhelical hydrophobic interactions (hydrophobic core)[2]. The thin arrows display the electrostatic attractions of the two coils on each other. As mentioned before these electrostatic interactions are caused by the amino acids present on position e and g. In this case glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K). All these interactions greatly contribute to the stability and"

Antibiotic discovery may continue to wane in the coming decades because antibiotics aimed for the easiest bacterial targets have already been developed. Considering that bacteria are unlikely to similarly slow in the development of resistance, decreased discovery could be disastrous, resulting in significantly more deaths caused by infectious disease.
NU iGEM 2016 took a significant stride toward an alternative solution to this crisis; however, our experiences this summer testify to the time-consuming nature of genetic research. In order to provide scientists enough time to develop novel antibiotics, physicians and patients must use existing antibiotics appropriately. With that in mind, our Human Practices work focused on educating the public on the proper use of antibiotics and encouraging young students to cultivate an interest in synthetic biology.
Educating the Public
After compiling a wealth of information via research and interviews, we decided to use it to produce a pamphlet which could be distributed at events or placed in waiting rooms. The pamphlet illuminates the problem of antibiotic resistance, persuasively coercing the reader to use antibiotics correctly. Furthermore, one section dissuades the consumption of meat produced from animals raised with prophylactic antibiotics, while another explains why the prescription of antibiotics to prevent infections after wisdom tooth surgery is inappropriate. Future iGEM teams and other organizations are encouraged to use this pamphlet however they see fit. It can be downloaded here .
Instructions for printing and cutting:

On the first afternoon, we took them to our Friday Bar and tried to beat them in a drinking game known as Kævle, but of course we lost. After all, they’re Germans. In the evening we had pizza, beer and some great laughs, and they even brought us some really cool gifts from Bielefeld! We played MarioKart against them on our old Nintendo 64 but sadly, we lost again.
The next day was a bit more serious, at least in the beginning. We had a meeting where each team presented their project to the other and was praised and criticized. Of course both teams had room for improvement, so we all benefited from this.
Afterwards, we took them on a phallus walk in Odense, showing them some of the abundant references to the male sex that can be found scattered about the city!
We are very happy that they took the time to come and visit us, and we hope to visit them sometime in the future.

A team of bioengineer students from the University of Southern Denmark is getting ready for the annual iGEM competition to be held at MIT in Cambridge, USA, on November 5th-8th. They have created an artificial E. coli bacterium with a photo sensor which causes the bacterium to move away when you shine blue light on it.
There are still a few things missing, says instructor Mike Barnkob, but he is confident that they have a good project: ""E. coli bacteria have some flagella they can flap. We found out that you can control them by combining genes from other bacteria and then expose them to light. Blue light causes them to turn about and if it is dark in a different direction, they move there.""
The team from the University of Southern Denmark have just got the first proof that the system works and they are"

Safety in the lab
All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/permits/inspection/index-eng.php)
Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire meaning long pants and closed toed shoes and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge are equipped with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eyewash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment , management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services.  (http://www.uleth.ca/risk-and-safety-services/)
The Risk and Safety committee is aware of Lethbridge High School iGEM and of our project. They support our work as long as we follow the Laboratory Safety Guidelines outlined by Health Canada: Public Health Agency of Canada.  (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/index-eng.php)
