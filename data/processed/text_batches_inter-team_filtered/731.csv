The benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (xylB) enzyme homologue was found from the organism Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The most effective substrate for the xylB homologue was benzyl alcohol [14]. Also, para-substituted substrates were more effective substrates for the enzyme [14]. Thus, this enzyme homologue was directed towards increasing the conversion of benzyl alcohol (and other related aromatic alcohols used in last year’s project) into their respective products.
The constructs designed for the enzymatic homologues project are shown below. A “mix and match” strategy was used and new enzyme homologues were going to be incorporated with the genes from last year and vice versa to observe which combination of genes yielded the largest amount of product.
Figure 16: Intended constructs for enzyme homologues
Many challenges were encountered with cloning of these genes into the pSB1C3 backbone. All enzyme homologues were synthesized by IDT. The touABCDEF cluster had to be broken down into two segments because of the ~4.5 kb length. During synthesis, the touABC gBlock failed IDT quality control standards, and thus created troubles with cloning the gene. The xylB gene was cloned multiple times with positive results with colony PCR, but negative results when the gene was sequenced each time. Thus, due to the cloning challenges, and the large amount of time spent troubleshooting with no success, the enzymatic homologues project was unsuccessful.

Cellulase experiment
In order to realize our idea of changing agricultural waste into biofuel, we figured that we could try to obtain glucose from cellulose by cellulase. This simple idea could be carried out by several procedures. First, we did a pre-experiment by using quantitative filter paper (Advantec) as cellulose source which was made with highest quality alpha cotton cellulose, and was ashless(<0.1%). We cut the filter paper into the size of 0.5 cm square. Next, we weighed and put 3 grams of the filter paper chips in a 50ml centrifuge tube filled up to 50ml with 0.1M Na-citrate (ph5.3). We then added 375mg cellulase, which came from Trichoderma reesei (Sigma-Aldrich) and put it in 40℃ incubation(200rpm) for 96 hours. After that, we could get milk-like filter paper mash. Finally, 3.6% of glucose was measured by doing DNS assay!
The next challenge would be use E. coli we modified to yield isobutanol with the glucose medium made by cellulose. We filtered and transferred the glucose medium to another flask, and added our M9T9 formula except of adding glucose into it. Then we inoculated E. coli in it for 24 to 42 hours, 42℃, 200rpm. The GC result of the isobutanol yield was 25ppm. Though it wasn’t prominent, it proved that the whole procedures (from"

In-fusion biobrick assembly
Introduction: This method describes an alternative assembly method that allows for BioBricks to be assembled via fusion of PCR products. One PCR-amplified BioBrick has homology on each end with the second PCR-amplified BioBrick (vector amplified with the BioBrick) to allow for the fragments to be fused together in the In-Fusion reaction. This method can be adapted to fuse more than two BioBricks together and four fragments have been successfully fused. The advantages of In-Fusion BioBrick assembly over standard assembly are that it is faster, does not require restriction digestions or ligations or DNA extraction from a gel.
Step one: Select a base vector and identify the insertion site. Linearize the vector by restriction enzyme digestion
Step two: Design PCR primers for your gene of interest with 15 bp extensions (5’) that are complementary to the ends of the linearized vector.
Step three: Amplify your gene of interest through PCR
Step four: Purify your PCR product

Abstract
     Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor or the Chernobyl reactor. Penn State’s team project will focus on using a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to develop a robust and reliable biosensor which utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch coupled with a fast-acting reporter capable of producing an easily visible effect. We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.
     Our hope is that the basis of our biological dosimeter system will prove to be an effective genetic system capable of detecting harmful levels of radiation and relaying it to those working in the field or affected area. We envision our system not only being useful in such applications, but also being capable of further expansion and evolution through the expanding field of synthetic biology.
Overall project: Bacterial Dosimeter
Radiation of one form or another is a constant presence throughout our every day lives. Radiation, or the transmission and absorption of energy over a given distance, has proven an invaluable technology useful in applications for everything from heating our food to diagnosing and treating diseases. Some forms of radiation, however, can be detrimental to the human body, as they are a common cause of such diseases as radiation poisoning and cancer.
All types of radiation can be divided into two categories: non-ionizing and ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation (consisting of radio, micro, infrared, and visible electromagnetic waves) contains less energy and has a relatively small effect on living organisms that has only recently been studied. Ionizing radiation, however, contains a much greater amount of energy capable of ionizing atoms which can lead to harmful effects on living tissue. This category of radiation encompasses alpha and beta decay as well as neutron, X-ray, and gamma radiation.
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team.

Cambridge,2008,Team:Cambridge#Improved GFP_-_-_TEXT.html," The GFP variants chosen were superfolder GFP, developed and described by Pédelacq et al (2006) [5], which was engineered for improved fluorescence in fusion proteins and P7 GFP (“superfast GFP”) which was engineered by Fisher et al (2008) [4] and selected on the basis of its property of very rapid folding.
Methods
Cloning of GFP variants
mut3 GFP was obtained from the 2007 parts distribution of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts [1] as part number E0400. P7 GFP [4] plasmid DNA was a kind gift by Dr Adam C. Fisher from Cornell University, New York. Superfolder GFP [5] was created by de novo DNA synthesis (Geneart) and its codon bias was changed as a compromise for optimum expression in E. coli and B. subtilis. The full sequence is listed in the Registry of Standard Biological parts: part number <a href="" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I746916 "">I746916</a>.
For in vivo and in vitro studies, all three GFP variants (superfolder, P7 and mut3) were cloned into 2 basic constructs residing in the same standard vector (pSB1A2):
</html>
And
Additionally, all GFP variants were 6-his tagged by PCR and again assembled to comply with the above schemes. The resulting new BioBricks were added to the registry of standard biological parts.
The table below depicts the BioBrick numbers in the parts registry for all three variants of GFP in their 6-his tagged and non tagged format driven by the pBAD and T7 promoters:

UNSW_Australia,2016,Team:UNSW Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," and this time performed a Western Blot, with the primary antibody targeting g3p's and tolR's His-tag. Unfortunately, while the positive control sample worked, we couldn't detect either g3p or tolR, implying that they weren't being expressed.
And, to cap off a busy week, we transformed J04450 (RFP), J23119 (a promoter), B0034 (RBS), and B0017 (double terminator) into our cloning strain, for later BioBrick assembly.
Week 13: August 22 - August 28
CRISPR Team
While still figuring out how to accelerate our cells' growth (or, at least, return it to a normal rate for E. coli), we remade the sgRNA-tolA plasmid (see Week 6), and transformed it into our cloning strain. We miniprepped a few of the transformants, and verified them by running on a gel and submitting for sequencing. By Friday, though, our cells started growing at a normal rate, the result of much retransforming, restreaking, and reculturing, and so we activated the Cas9 plasmid to knockout DegS and DegP.
Overexpression Team
From the overnight cultures of last week, we made minipreps. Each of the J04450s were digested with EcoRI and PstI, to give us an empty backbone into which we could pop our inserts, as if it were to self-ligate the transformants would grow as red.
Then, on Wednesday, taking our 3 recently-synthesised GBLOCKs (for alMGS and g3p) from IDT, we PCR amplified, digested, ligated into a the J04450-derived backbone, and transformed into the cloning strain.
On Thursday we then re-extracted separate total and soluble protein fractions from our cloning and expressions strains purportedly expressing g3p and tolR. Coming in on Sunday, these were run on an SDS-PAGE, but the negative control lane we ran wound up as a smear, making it tough to see if we had an extra band present. We also ran a separate SDS-PAGE to transfer to a Western Blot, but again we were unable to detect our proteins.
Week 14: August 29 - September 4
CRIPSR Team
On Tuesday we redid our activation of Cas9 in all three cell lines, for knocking out degS or degP (i.e., six knockouts in total). Unfortunately, when we plated these out, no serial"

Fundraising & Donation
We held multiple fundraising sales, selling small ice cream dots (resembling NPs!) and Oreo fudge during our lunch periods in school, and making “glitter slime” at our school’s annual spring fair (see Spring Fair in the Outreach section above). (Team activity)
In total, we raised over 500 USD, and donated the money to two organizations:
WaterisLife is an organization that provides clean drinking water, as well as sanitation and hygiene education programs to schools and communities in need. We donated to this organization in hopes that more people will have access to clean water. Click to donate to WaterisLife .
Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) is a local organization founded in 1987 to promote public awareness and participation to prevent pollution and damage to public resources. Visit TEPU here .
Public Outreach -- A Tour of Taipei
Some members of the iGEM team went to several popular sites in Taipei to pass out fliers and conduct surveys. We visited National Taiwan University, Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall, and Taipei 101. This helped us collect feedback from people of different age groups and backgrounds. This was a great and fun way to spread awareness of NP pollution! See our video below! (Team members: Ashley L., Emily C., Florence L., Candice L., Yvonne W., Justin Y., Avery W., Christine C., Jesse K., and Laurent H.)

Survey Results
We created a survey that helped us identify public knowledge and misconceptions about synthetic biology and NP usage. Our survey results confirmed that the public should be informed more thoroughly on the usage of NPs since many were not aware that there is a potential negative impact associated with NPs. Over 240 people completed the survey. (Survey created by Abby H., Christine C. and Emily C.)
Here are some results from our survey:
General Questions
The majority of people think that gene modification is acceptable if the goal is to save or improve quality of life; however, it is not acceptable for non-medical related reasons, such as changing hair or eye color. In addition, most people do not have a preference between chemical or biological drug synthesis. These results suggest that people are accepting of genetic engineering when it is related to health and medicine.
Environmentally, people are generally concerned with the wastewater that enters the ocean and the river"

Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total.

We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.
Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS)"
USTC-Software,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Medal_-_-_TEXT.html,": Here are our demo page and validation page demonstrating several realistic examples on our wiki. We also have automated unit testing , documentation of test coverage, bug tracking facilities and documentation of releases and changes between releases on our GitHub.
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, our team have achieved the following 2 goals:
R1: iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We  refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
E1: We had done the Human Practices in outreach. More information and pictures are on our Human Practices page .
R2: Address a problem that you would like to co-develop with a wetlab team. This should be a collaboration where the wetlab team posts a problem they are having and your team addresses the  issue by creating an online software solution.
E2: Yes. We address an issue for USTC team about fringe detection in their project, and we created an online software , where you can use to compute the interference series.
R3: Re-use and further develop a previous iGEM software project (or parts thereof) and demonstrate how future teams can continue this trend through good code documentation, use of open source materials and creation of great instructional materials.
E3: Yes, we inherit and develop the idea of 2007 team of USTC, they developed many Boolean gates and planned to employ knowledge from digital circuit to create cascade of Boolean gates. And our software reuses the framework of last year's USTC-Software team and the separation of front-end and back-end completely and REST API as the interface between them. Moreover, developers could easily develop their own software based on our project. More specifically, we could provide developers an easy-of-use API for further development. Here are the two examples below.
* Graph API. Software engineers could easily use our python code to build a gene circuit based on a truth with just a few lines.  More specifically, developers just use the code `import biocircuit` to import our package and then use the following code to  converting a truth table(a string) to some gene circuits with score.         expr_from_back = biocircuit.string2expr(expr)         circuit_from_back = biocircuit.create_circuit(expr_from_back)         scores_from_back = biocircuit.circuit_score(circuit_from_back, biogate.d"

* Roughly speaking, a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process's full history, hence independently from such history.
Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," capsid is an icosahedron with proteins Gp23, 24, and 31 contributing to its assembly. The highly antigenic and small outer capsid proteins serve as accessory proteins on the outer shell. Capsid proteins from this bacteriophage will be used as a proof of concept for further usage in the finalized construct.
Figure 2: Proteins and their respective functions in capsid assembly as well as the HOC/SOC accessory proteins used for fusion with the construct.
PHAGE SELECTION
In future design application, we have looked at phages that have a host range corresponding to our potential hosts: E. coli as the proof of concept and the methanotrophic bacteria as the real-life bacteria application.
Through the utilization of phage display technology, we will attempt to express ELPs fused to metal binding proteins on the surfaces of the T4 phage capsid for E. coli and in later experimentation, the M4 phage for the methanotrophic bacteria.
The T4 bacteriophage belongs to the phage family Myoviridae and interacts with E. coli[1]. The capsid of this phage has been successfully modified to display peptides and protein domains on the surface[1]. In past experiments, biologically active, full-length foreign proteins were displayed by fusion to SOC (small outer capsid protein) and HOC (highly antigenic outer capsid protein) accessory protein genes found on the T4 capsid surface. In fact, a bipartite T4 SOC–HOC protein display system allowed two different proteins to be displayed on one T4 particle simultaneously[2]. The high abundance of these proteins (960 SOC and 160 HOC molecules per phage capsid) increases the efficiency with which potential metal-binding proteins may function, once attached to this phage[2].
The M4 bacteriophage will be used in the real-life application of our system in the mining and oil tailing ponds as it is a natural occurring phage that can survive in the environment of the tailings pond.
As a proof of principle, we will be using the capsid protein taken from the T4 phage: gp23, 24 and 31. The proteins gp23 and gp24 are coat proteins making up the phage capsid, and gp31 acts as a chaperone in the gp23 folding process[3]. These proteins will produce an empty viral capsid to test the parts individually with the bacteria. This will allow for further experimentation with the full bacteriophage construct including the other parts.

For PotD, it is clear from the gel that it is being successfully overexpressed since there is an intense band present at the 37 kDa marker which corresponds to the expected size of PotD in the induced culture sample. For SBP, there is no band present which suggests SBP is being overexpressed.

Figure 3: Characterisation of PotD. Single colonies of MC1061 E.coli containing pQE80-L encoding PotD were used to inoculate 5ml of fresh LB growth medium supplemented with ampicillin. Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, one was induced with 1 mM IPTG and one was left uninduced as a control. They were left to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1ml sample was taken and the cells pelleted. The cells were resuspended in 100µl of Laemmli buffer, 20µl of which was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-His antibody.

On the Y-axis the percentages of degraded estradiol (light green) and ethinyl estradiol (dark green) are indicated. The X-axis displays the different tested laccases. The degradation was measured at t0 and after five hours of incubation at 30 °C. The negative control was the substrate in Britton Robinson buffer and showed no degradation of the substrates. The bought laccase TVEL0 which is used as positive control is able to degrade 94.7 % estradiol and 92.7 %  ethinyl estradiol. The laccase BPUL (from Bacillus pumilus) degraded 35.9 % of used estradiol after five hours. ECOL  was able to degrade 16.8 % estradiol. BHAL degraded 30.2 % estradiol. The best results were determined with TTHL (laccase from Thermus thermophilus). Here the percentage of degradation amounted 55.4 %.
Figure 15: Degradation of estradiol (blue) and ethinyl estradiol (red) with the different laccases after 10 minutes hours with ABTS added. The commercial laccase TVEL0 which was used as positive control is able to degrade all of the used substrates. The bacterial laccase BPUL degraded 100 % of ethinyl estradiol and estradiol. ECOL the laccase from E. coli degraded 6.7 % estradiol and none of the used ethinyl estradiol. BHAL degraded 46.9 % of estradiol but no ethinyl estradiol.

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#oil sands_-_-_TEXT.html," frequently over time and space. Specifically, water monitoring is focused on assessing the nature and extent of contamination from oil sands waste in the Athabasca watershed. Currently, water is sampled on a monthly basis to test quality at multiple sites, with a few automated sondes beginning to be installed.
While this new plan seeks to address many of the concerns raised by the WMDRC, it can still be significantly improved by efforts like our own. Specifically, our sensing platform is continuous, long-term, and can be implemented relatively cheaply, allowing for more deployment sites. In addition, biosensing in general is highly specific relative to chemical methods, and biological systems can be refined to be highly sensitive and have very low limits of detection (this flexibility is not necessarily afforded by chemical methods). Our device also can submit data wirelessly to a remote server, allowing for automated collection of data. Our vision for this device is to create a sensor network that collects continuous data, with identical, well-calibrated sensors whose data can easily be compiled into one consistent database for subsequent analysis. This network would account for short- and long-term trends and allow for any necessary adjustments to spatial distribution.

PARIS BETTENCOURT
OUR TEAM
Paris-Bettencourt iGEM team is part of the Center for Research      and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) in Paris.
It was the first French iGEM team, and has long history of success      in the competition. The team won the World Jamboree Grand      Prize Award last year with the Fight Tuberculosis with Modern      Weapons project. When deciding on a theme, above all else, we      value creativity and the potential of our project to benefit society.
OUR PROJECT
Treating strong body odor using     probiotics, producing a low cost     perfume produced by bacteria     and setting up a database of     microbiome correlated to body     odor
Questions it raises : What kind of regulation would you like to     see for GMO food/products?     (Ex: mandatory labeling)
Would you buy a perfume that is produced     by E. coli? If not, why?
What would you like to know about body     odor?     (Ex: does your body odor affect who is     sexual attracted to you?)
This year, the Paris-Bettencourt team has decided to explore a     topic that has rarely been approached by synthetic biologists in     this competition: odor.
We are currently working on several projects related to odor:     Engineering bacteria to produce an odor library     Designing probiotics and cosmetic products aimed to help people     with strong body odor. Treating genetic diseases leading certain persons to have strong     malodor. Launching a citizen science project aiming to correlate armpit     microbiome data with malodor.
As for human practice, we are focusing this year on open-source     biology and hope to get contribution from not only team members,     but also the public, through collecting samples, crowdsourcing     and updating of project development. At the same time, we are     building a MOOC course for high school students. As popular as     iGEM is above undergraduates and graduates, it is still quite new     in high school. This course will include an introduction of Synthetic     Biology, the social concern with it and work students through the     important steps to form an iGEM team. In addition to the scientific contribution to iGEM, we are aiming     at improving scientific communication and opening the project to     the general public. To facilitate open science the team is building     an online collaborative platform to involve citizen scientists in the     process."

""Lange Nacht der Forschung""
On April 29 we were able to present the iGEM-competition, synthetic biology, as well as, the general idea of our project at “Lange Nacht der Forschung”. This is an event organized by the Austrian broadcast to show the general public what we are doing in research including chances and visions.  Together with the institute of molecular biotechnology and ACIB we facilitated the visitors to get a first glance at microbiology, enzymes, and the field of genetic engineering, as well as, synthetic biology. For example we did an isolation of DNA from strawberries with ordinary consumables. Especially the DNA isolation was our task, together with the Austrian part of the last year’s iGEM Team “Manchester-Graz”. All over the event we extracted DNA together with hundreds of visitors, while a few of us gave an introduction to DNA and the general construction of a cell. Furthermore, we created a poster about our project and answered different questions about it and about the topic in general. The range of asked questions was enormous. There were some easy ones like:
Q: What is the difference between DNA and DNS?
A: DNS is the German expression for DNA. The A stands for acid. In German it would is S for “Säure”. In the course of time DNS was replaced by DNA also here in Austria.
Q: Why do we need genetic engineering? We did not need it for decades! Why now?
A: Our modern world would not work without genetic engineering anymore. Many things in our daily life are made by microorganisms; E.g. citric acid and insulin, just to name 2 very popular examples.  The next thing is that it is true that we had no need for genetic engineering in the past. But what we can see is that the mankind wants to spend less and less money for food and other commodities. Without plants and genetic engineering it would not be possible to provide 1kg of pork meat for less than €2,-  Even our forefathers did kind of genetic engineering. For sure they did not use our methods, but they always cultivated the best and biggest"

Lysis device for R. opacus. Lysis construct based on the one presented by Berkeley's 2008 team BBa_K112022. It is based on the inducible expression of a lysozyme and lambda phage's holin in order to liberate internal products of the bacterial cell in an efficient way. The induction is achieved by the addition of nitrile or a similar agent since both genes are regulated by nitA promoter. Constitutive expression of nitR and a low constitutive expression of an antiholin are required to avoid undesired lysis.

O-acyltransferase WSD from Acinetobacter sp. This biobrick codifies for the protein DGAT (Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase) which have dual activity, it can act as a wax ester synthase or as a diacylglycerol acyltransferase. In the latter case, its function consists in mediate the final step in TGAs synthesis using a fatty acyl-CoA and a DGA. This enzyme is vital in the storage and synthesis of lipids. Two transcriptional terminators (two biobricks BBa_B1006) were set at the end of the coding sequence.
Source: The amino sequence of this part was taken from Uniprot (wax-dgaT accesion Q8GGG1; http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8GGG1 ) and then codon optimization for R. opacus (avoiding restriction sites for the standard assembly method)

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2011,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Human practice 2_-_-_TEXT.html," we introduce tRNA and aaRS pair? A: The mischarging can be avoided by the aaRS’s ability to recognize the other parts of the tRNA than anticodon . (We put it in a plain way so that they can understand it with ease)  Q: What is the application of the project? A: For example, sometimes changing amino-acid on active center of an enzyme would have a great effect on enzyme activity. Our project provides an easy way to introduce point mutation at the active center.
The teacher had also joined the discussion and asked the questions.? Q：Is the project done by the experiment or just a theoretical research? A：What we have shown is our experiment result. We have spent a lot of time in the lab on our project. iGEM is not only a competition of ideas, but of fulfilling them as well.  Q: What is the significance of this competition to the senior school students? A: Taking part in iGEM is a good chance for the students to learn about academic thinking ways and helps them make decision about their future career. By showing the usefulness of synthetic biology, iGEM raises students’ confidence to further study biology.  Q: It makes the living creature as the toys of the human-beings, doesn’t it? A: No, living creature could never be the toy of the human-being, no matter how much we can manipulate living creatures by the method of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. We pay as much attention to bio- safety and ethics as to the experiment and technology.
Questionnaire Result
File:11SJTU HP C1.jpg
From the column above, we can discover that in the students with good background of biology, almost half of the students have knew the synthetic biology before. And after the presentation, all of them can understand well and gain great interests on the future development of the synthetic biology. That inferred that those students can be the members of the iGEM high school division. What they need is just the opportunity and the foundation.
They have also listed several difficulties in participating the iGEM competition, such as limi-tation of professional knowledge and experiment training, lack of funding and professional ad-visors and most of all the pressure of examination.

To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"
AQA_Unesp,2017,Team:AQA Unesp#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"control
Since we are working with insulin and diabetes, we wanted our bacteria to produce insulin in response to the glucose concentration in the media. To do that, we designed a control system using the carbon catabolite repression of Lactococcus lactis and a sRNA regulation.
Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a regulatory mechanism by which bacteria regulate the expression of functions for the use of secondary carbon sources in the presence of a preferred carbon source. Whereas the transcription factor cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is responsible for CCR in gram-negative bacteria, in gram-positive bacteria the CCR is mediated by the carbon catabolite control protein A (CcpA). In L. lactis, a transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ccpa regulates genes of carbon metabolism and also its own expression [1].
To cause CCR, CcpA must bind to a specific palindromic sequence in the promoters regions of catabolic operons, called catabolite responsive elements (cre sites) [2]. Figure 1 shows the general CCR in gram-positive bacteria.
Figure 1. Phosphorylation of HPr occurs when intracellular concentrations of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and ATP are high, which reflects the presence of preferred carbon sources. The phosphorylated HPr(His-P) binds to the CcpA protein and this complex binds to cre site on the DNA and then represses the transcription of catabolic genes [2].
The CCR mechanism in L. lactis works as an inverter (NOT gate): when there is glucose, the gene expression is repressed, and when there is no glucose, the gene expression is activated. In order to regulate the expression of insulin in our genetically engineered machine by glucose we needed to invert this system, so we designed a circuit using the CCR mechanism regulating the expression of a small RNA (sRNA) that blocks the translation of insulin. That way, when there is glucose, the sRNA will not be expressed and the insulin will be expressed. When there is no glucose, the sRNA will be expressed and it will repress the expression of insulin. Figure 2 shows the logic of our circuit.
Figure 2. (A) The truth table of our circuit. (B) Our circuit works as a double inverter: the first inverter gate is the CCR mechanism and the second is the sRNA regulation. The input is glucose and the output is the insulin.

Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                         events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                         cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                         complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                         3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                         Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                         membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                         transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                         transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                         In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,                         and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                         cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                         contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                         underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                         thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.

To this end, we performed carotene extraction with acetone using protocol described in literature and took absorbance measurement using Omega Microplate Readers (BMG-Labtech).
As a pilot project to test out the carotene measurement protocol, we prepared overnight cultures for pPCB15 in original MG1655, pPCB15 in MG1655 PT5-dxs,idi,ispBDF, pPCB15 in TOP10, K152005 in TOP10 and R0011 in TOP10 (as negative control). Absorbance spectrum measurements were taken, first on intact cells, and then on carotene extract in acetone. The results indicated that absorbance measurements on intact cells were unable to demonstrate the characteristic absorbance peak of beta-carotene at 450 nm. In contrast, absorbance measurement on carotene extract in acetone showed clear peak at 450nm, which was a much better indicator of beta-carotene production. Furthermore, the visually identified ""yellow pigment"" in K152005 was probably not beta-carotene. This could not have been distinguished using visual inspection along. Given these results, we decided to use carotene extraction in acetone and absorbance at 450 nm for future quantification of amount of carotene.
The colours of the acetone extracts were shown below:

Human Practice
At the beginning of choosing the project, we hoped to benefit more ordinary people and to make some contribution to the community through synthetic biology. Therefore, we searched for the projects which had strong applications. With several discussions with the professors in our college, we finally chose the enhanced oil recovery as our major concern.
We mainly performed and enhanced our project from the following two aspects:
EDUCATION:
To make more people know about our project and get their concern about the oil recovery problem, we have given several lectures about our project. What’s more, we found their most concerns about the project through the questionnaire survey.
COMMUNICATION:
We have communicated with iGEMers from various schools and regions to get further understanding of iGEMers’ common concern about the competition such as technical difficulties. Also, we had deep conversations with oil practitioners. They came up with many good suggestions in a professional point of view, which showed great space for our project to enhance.
In the course of communication, we found that professionals paid more attention to the controllability and induced cost of the Fim system, while the common peoples would prefer to strengthen the biosafety aspect. Therefore, we did the modeling to illustrate the switch efficiency and introduced another plasmid carrying lyase gene to avoid the diffusion of our bacterium after being used.

Santa_Clara,2015,Team:Santa Clara#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in entrepreneurship as more young people are given the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to create useful technology. Student entrepreneurs are being forged on late summer nights in empty lab facilities around the world. At these locations, you will find no demi-gods, no headlines describing million dollar investment deals, no flashy founders wearing Apple Watches or driving Teslas, no feng shui office space, and no sparkling mineral water. Instead, only the essence of entrepreneurship remains: an inventor and an idea.
As Conary Meyer, a junior bioengineering student at Santa Clara University, shuffles a batch of glassware into an autoclave it becomes clear why he's here every night toiling into the wee hours of the morning. He loves research, has a passion for the technical solutions it can create, and possesses an uncommon belief that his technology will one day have the power to make life better. Conary embodies the best of iGEM and its students like Conary that ensure iGEM remains a world leader in synthetic biology.
Keen to encourage the sense of purpose beyond the bench present in student entrepreneurs like Conary, iGEM introduced an entrepreneurship track to its global synthetic biology competition in 2012. That year thirty six teams of student entrepreneurs showcased their technology at the iGEM e competition. Since then, some, like MIT's Benchling , have come to fame for courting multimillion dollar investments from venture capital firms. Others driven by less academic prestige like, UC Davis's Ambercycle (which relies on a mixture of government, academic and corporate partnerships for support) are on progressing on a more deliberate track.
The majority of projects, however, were ahead of their time, passed over for better ideas, or simply shelved for no good reason. Many of the students who developed the technology behind the projects at iGEM e viewed continuing to work on their idea as impractical or too time consuming. Instead of the becoming entrepreneurs they opted to go to dental school, medical school, graduate school or took jobs in industry. In Europe, where student entrepreneurship is less established, even student ventures with award winning technology, like Morph Bio , struggle to break through with investors absent PH.D scientists, engineers with industry experience, or an executive with prior startup success. These ventures, however, can be just as valuable because of the personal growth, problem solving expertise, and technology development experience that accompanies iGEM participation. Talented individuals like Cindy Wu and David Brown exemplify the value working in a hands on research collaboration. Each has used the student driven collaborative research experience iGEM provides as a stepping stone to founding successful technology startups (Experiment"

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#JanooNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," some sample code within a test file that I placed within the App directory.  My thoughts for future development involves saving the written code to a temp file and executing the code when the user chooses the run command.
Update: The App can now fully parse text written within the custom-JEditorPane and interpret it using the native Python 3.2 installation.  I have currently abandoned any interest in incorporating Jython and will focus more on GUI design and simple file-manipulation.
[6/10/2011]
PS GUI as of 6/10/2011
The cloning process is complete.  The PS Scripter can now fully open files, save them, save them as a new file, and run the script.  I will continue to play around with more GUI options but I will be leaving this App/Module alone so I don't brick anything just yet.  The next step involves creating some new App with a more streamlines GUI that has some kind of status window.
Update: GUI now has a neat status window.  I am currently implementing this by appending Strings to the TextArea, but there might be a better setup for future development.  Right now it only spits out the basic text that I relied on for debugging.  Eventually, it would either incorporate the python output/error stream (if possible).  It also has a non-functional progress bar that I threw in for fun; if I can't get it to work with compile/run-time progress I will replace it with a status text.
[6/13/2011]
PS GUI as of 6/13/2011
The GUI has been re-designed to contain a re-sizable bar to vary the height of the visible JEditorPane and JTextArea; these are the python-scripting area and status window area, respectively.  The status window itself now features descriptive text (need to fix some alignment issues) and the direct output and error streams from the python-script-execution.  The image to the right shows the new GUI as well as some example code and the resultant status window text.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Journal#MeS#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," and pchBA were all succesful. To check whether the genes were actually inserted into the plasmids, we did a colony PCR on all three (in five-fold, five colonies of each gene).
Unfortunately, only the aroG band had the right length. For the other two genes, only very small fragments were visible. We inoculated the aroG containing cells.
For the mutagenesis of aroG, we performed a mutagenesis PCR with primers with a point mutation in them. After this, we did a KLD treatment (kinase, ligase, DpnI) + transformation.
29/07 – 02/08
Week 5: Everything fails!
Mutagenesis didn’t work since there was no PCR product to be seen on a gel. We performed the mutagenesis with a high fidelity polymerase in a gradient PCR with different annealing temperatures (53-55-58-61-64°C) in parallel.
On a gel, we put:
lane 2: the original plasmid containing aroG
lane 3: the original plasmid containing aroG cut with EcoRI to make it linear
lanes 4-8: the PCR products of the gradient PCR, one for each annealing temperature
After visualisation, there were PCR products visible with lengths corresponding to the length of the cut plasmid, as expected.
After ligation and transformation, there were no colonies to be seen, so we repeated this with an extra DpnI treatment to make sure that all the original plasmid was cut into smaller fragments that wouldn’t be able to be transformed. Unfortunately, also this transformation was unsuccesful.
05/08 – 09/08
Week 6: Mutations
We decided to do something different to try and mutate aroG, by making us of a megaprimer. This megaprimer was made with a regular primer, starting from the biobrick suffix, and a primer containing a point mutation.
In order to get rid of the primers that were used in the PCR reaction of this megaprimer, we put the product on a gel containing crystal violet. The purified megaprimer was used in a PCR reaction with the aroG containing plasmid, in order to mutate it.

Queens_Canada,2015,Team:Queens Canada#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," spatial evaluation using PyMOL suggested these were not ideal for linking the termini of our protein of interest. For the purpose of progression, we adapted the second sequence and opted for running simulations on our own linker designs.
Approach 2:Using the extein sequence tested by Heidelberg 2014, linkers were built within PyMOL and Coot to effectively joined the N- and C- termini. Flexible linkers were chosen to enable the termini to arrange such that the protein remains in its functional conformation.
Linker 1:RGKCWEAA
Linker 2:RGKCWEGAA
Linker 3:RGKCWEGGAA
Modeling Methods & Stability Analysis
Selected linkers, from Approach 2, were then run through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using the GROMACS package . Following energy minimization, the stability of the protein under physiological conditions was determined. Protein files were edited to circularize the backbone and solvated in water at 298 K to mimic those functional conditions (Figure 2).
Figure 2:Circularized anti-freeze protein structure after MD simulations (left). These images represent the final configuration of the energy minimized and dynamic simulation tests; A showing just the protein backbone and B showing the amino acid side chains.The upper loop shows the AFP's termini linked by the extein sequence and GAA linker (Linker 2). The linked termini are found opposite to the ice-binding surface of the AFP, which is found at the lower region of the images.
Statistical analysis was used to compare the stability of each circularized protein with our 3 linkers found in Approach 2. Root mean square (RMS) deviation fluctuation plots are shown in Figures 3 and 4 below.
Figure 3:RMS Deviation plot of the protein core. RMSD data was gathered over time for residued 3-63 of the antifreeze protein. Stability of our AFP+linker can analyzed and compared relative to the stability of the wild-type AFP.
Figure 4:RMS Fluctuation of AFP Fluctuations of individual atons were compared between the wild type and each linker tested to determine their stability. Of greatest interset was the fluctuation of atoms at the ice binding sites of the protein(identified in blue)2, 3.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to induce high salt stress in the culture media with NaCl. Although sucrose production would be less effective we could prevent the negative effects of salt stress regarding our heterotrophic bacteria and fungi.
In one of Dr. Ducat’s publications (A synthetic, light-driven consortium of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria enables stable polyhydroxybutyrate production, 2017) , he used barium alginate beads to encapsulate cyanobacteria to enhance sucrose export. We were interested in using these beads as another option for co-culturing methods besides solid and liquid culture. Dr. Ducat provided us with a protocol for creating these beads and suggested to encapsulate all of our “trinity” organisms.  Most importantly, he suggested M2 as a co-culture medium to us, which is derived from the cyanobacterium medium BG11. He also provided us with the protocols which were then frequently used in our project .
In summary, Dr. Ducat helped us significantly in several ways that changed our project. At first, by providing us with the Synechococcus cscB strain which enabled us to conduct experiments with sucrose production and export in salt stress media.  Second, by introducing a co-culture medium to us which we ended up using for all of our co-culturing experiments.
We are glad to be given the opportunity to speak with a co-culture specialist and value his advice that changed our project significantly.
Integrated Human Practices with Dr. Spencer Scott
Our work with the quorum sensing system is based on research done by Dr. Spencer Scott and colleagues, who published the paper “A stabilized microbial ecosystem of self-limiting bacteria using synthetic quorum-regulated lysis” in the well known “Nature microbiology” journal in 2017. Since we knew we would encounter some difficulties and had questions regarding this harsh project, the best choice for us was to reach out to Dr. Scott in order to improve our project.
At first we presented him our current progress and he showed himself very delighted that his PhD project was further studied by us. He also assured us his support.
Our idea was to use the same microfluidics system that the researchers used in the paper mentioned above. Since the paper does not precisely state which kind of system they used, we asked if their system was easily reproducible in our lab. Unfortunately, Dr. Scott informed us, that their lab was endowed with very sophisticated and costly microfluidics system and advised us against this setup. Instead he suggested us to use a simple chemostat.
Moreover, he suggested to try to apply"

""There is a whole area of science called risk analysis; we made a guide that falls within the international parameters to assess risks internationally.""
The guide her team has developed is a guide they expect servers biotechnology students like us, making it able for them to start a business or sell a product. Dr. Mercedes invited us to collaborate with her team in this guide by helping in its translation to Spanish, making able for their work to reach Spanish speaking people. We are pleased we worked for hand in hand with Saúl Pizarro in this translation.
AHTEG United Nation's guide was introduced in the thirteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity last year in Mexico but wasn't approved by the Parties, this year Dr. Mercedes will present her team’s alternative guide at the Fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14)  in Egypt.  Acquiring this guide won't have any type cost; it is an effort of a group of academics that want to give to the regulators of the countries, developers, and students an environmental risk assessment they can rely on.
Dr. Mercedes invited us to join Saúl Pizarro and her at the COP 14 as members of Youth Biotech, an international group of young leaders who are interested in the development of science communication, policy making, and biotechnology regulation. It was born on December 2016 after a group of biotech students attended the UN Biodiversity Conferences as a part of the Public Research and Regulation Initiative (PRRI).
We are truly honored for the invitation and for the opportunity to join Youth Biotech, 10 of our members are now part of this group and excited to participate and represent the community of young biotechnologists internationally.
Dr. Mercedes recommended us to base our Integrated Human Practices in the United Nations’ three dimensions for a sustainable development: Economic, Environmental and Social. On the social aspect, she recommended us to include our projects’ ethical and legal aspects. Formerly, we were planning on managing 4 dimensions, ethical, legal, social and economic.
She suggested us to talk about a complex; there is not a complete understanding nor a single reason why bees are disappearing, it might be due to various diseases, malnutrition, insecticides, is a complex of reasons. Our project won't solve the problem, but it will contribute to managing the Colony Collapse Disorder.

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
Researcher Safety?
The WashU team is working primarily with very common, safe chemicals. However, several chemicals are known to be carcinogenic (Ethidium Bromide), corrosive (Acetone), or volatile (Hexane). For each of these types of chemicals, we have established safety protocols meant to protect the researcher above all else. For carcinogens and corrosive chemicals, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as nitrile gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles are used. Additionally, all work with volatile chemicals is carried out in a fume hood.
Public Safety?
Whenever working with transformants (bacterial or otherwise) one must be conscious of the ability of organisms to mutate and become resistant to antibiotics or other selection markers. In order to slow this process, all bacteria that is to be discarded is thoroughly bleached and then disposed of in marked ""Biohazard"" bins which will later be sterilized. In this way, we hope to prevent any lab-produced organisms from interacting and transforming wild organisms which could result in a stronger or more dangerous organism.
Environmental Safety?
Although we work with few harmful chemicals, those that we do work with are disposed of in compliance with local and federal Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) standards. All organic solvents as well as used gels are stored in separate vessels that are then handed off to our local EHS department. The EHS disposes of these harmful chemicals in a way that is least deleterious to the environment.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our new BioBrick parts raise any significant safety issues given that they are genes found commonly in the eukaryote Xanthophyllomyces dendrorohous. One safety concern regarding genetically modified (GMO) yeast that produces B-Carotene could be overproduction of the carotenoid. If the enzymatic pathway responsible for B-Carotene production is extremely efficient in yeast and this yeast is then used in baking bread or brewing beer, these products could potentially overdose the consumer"

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Subsequently we proceeded to observe the samples in an epifluorescence microscope. In the following figure you can se one micrograph of each sample at 100x.
Additionally, we analyzed 4 micrographs of each sample (n=4) with the software ImageJ
All the different treatments presented significant differences, except (B2+ & protease K) and (B2+). Remarkable is the difference between (B2+ / SN B3+) and (B2+ / NS B3-). Also, the direct application of protease K over the samples decreased even more the fluorescence. However, the low fluorescence of B2+ is very weird. We will have to repeat this experiment, but at least the major part of the results makes is what we expected.
June 18 – 24, 2012
We repeated the experiment to investigate the interactions between our bacteria B2+ and B3+ with a serious protocol and recording the data for later analysis. This time we added the control B2-. In the following figure you can se one micrograph of each sample at 100x.
In the figure each row represents one sample. The first row contains the micragraphs with UV filter. The second row  contains the micrographs seen with light. The third row contains the previous micragraphs overlayed (the light image is in grayscale, and the UV image has its black background removed). The forth image is an amplification of the third image (1:4 ratio). Click over the image to open it in a higher resolution.
Additionally, we analyzed 4 micrographs of each sample (n=4) with the software ImageJ
The results were quite different compared to the ones of our previous experiment. Remarkable is that, as expected, B2- and B2+ present the lowest and highest fluorescence intensity. Additionally, (B2+ & B3+) and (B2+ & Protease K) present very similar fluorescence. However, for second time we obtained a weird result: (B2+ & B3+) and (B2+ & B3-) present the same amount of fluorescence.
In conclusion, we know that sfGFP expresses in our e. coli. But we don’t know if it is attached to the external side of the membrane, or if the HIV-1 protease works"

Oblique structure of S-layer lattices.
SgsE monomers are naturally assembled in a lattice with oblique symmetry (p2) (compare figure on the right) exhibiting a well-defined periodicity and distances of 9.4 – 11.6 nm between the proteinaceous subunits. The S-layer protein SgsE of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a consists of 903 amino acids, including a 30 amino acid signal peptide (SLH-domain) at the amino-terminus.  The carboxy-terminal part of SgsE is the larger part of the protein, encoding the self-assembly information. The protein is formed by the sgsE gene,"

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Blog#14-06-02-01_-_-_TEXT.html," background of this experiment: The electrons in some molecules change into energy states when irradiated with electromagnetic waves. When returning to the normal state, the electrons dissipate excess energy, also in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This process is called fluorescence. Vanilla pudding contains the molecule riboflavin (vitamin B2). When riboflavin is irradiated with blue light, the molecule fluoresces green. The intensity of the green light is visually recorded by our device. Special software processes the data and the measured value is displayed on the cellphone connected to the device via Bluetooth. We will discuss the results of the experiment next class.

Why Caenorhabditis elegans?
Caenorhabditis elegans, a widely used model organism, is the objective in our project, because its whole genome has been sequenced, and it is also the only organism to have its connectome(neuronal ‘wiring diagram’) completed by 2012 [1][2]. Adault C.elegans is about 1mm in length, 45μm in wideth and it is easily observed and manipulated under stereomicroscope[3][4].What more, C.elegans has a phenomenon known as eutely, which means it has fixed ‘genetically determined number of cells’[5].These all are of great help when we doing neural operation.
Compared with other model organism like Mus musculus, which needs approximately two to three months to get matured, C.elegans possesses shorter lifespan. It is a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite lives for two to three weeks[6]. Lifespan-regulating genes in C.elegans,2,16010.Whithin this cycle the genetics is immutable. At the same time, it can also propagate sexually, which means that the genetic phenotype of it is easy to control.
Fig1. The Connectome of C.elegans.
Why AWA AWB neuron?
Normally, the formation of a new ability is corresponding with the specific environment signal induc-ing, so in our project we need the specific stimulation to train worms and let them obtain new abilities. In C.elegans, we hope that the stimulation can be localized to the target neurons for the accuracy and efficiency. Different behaviors of the worms are controlled by different neurons, and due to their sensitivity to odors, many behaviors, such as attraction, avoidance, feeding, or mating, can be induced by different chemicals. In our project, we choose the olfactory neurons ( AWA &AWB) to accomplish our design. The attrac-tive odorant diacetyl is detected by the receptor protein ODR- 10, which is normally expressed in the AWA"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Caltech,2008,Team:Caltech#Project#Phage Pathogen Defense_-_-_TEXT.html," and effective agent for eliminating pathogenic bacteria. Two important factors contribute to a bacteriophage’s effectiveness: bacteriophages are highly infectious and thus highly efficient at destroying targeted populations, and bacteriophages are specific to their hosts. The latter factor is readily illustrated by the coliphage λ, which possesses a mode of infection dependent on an E. coli specific surface protein, LamB [5]. Benign, non-E. coli intestinal bacteria lack this surface receptor and therefore are immune to destruction.
System Design
The engineered probiotic acts as a delivery vehicle for phage into the large intestine.  There are four important design goals for such as system: (1) the system releases phage into the large intestine, (2) the production of phage is regulated with a high dynamic range between a distinct on and off state, (3) the system can target a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, and (4) the system integrates well within the existing iGEM probiotic.
An obvious delivery mechanism would be the adaptation of natural lysogens, a phase of the phage life cycle in which the phage integrates its DNA into the genome of the host organism. Lysogens lie dormant until disturbed by some external stimuli, but can be stimulated to enter the lytic cycle and release phage. There is one major limitation to this method: phage released will be specific to the lysogenic hosts, E. coli. We can avoid this limitation by incorporating as a lysogen a phage that is not normally infectious to E. coli, such as the P22 phage from Salmonella. This phage could potentially target pathogenic bacteria besides E. coli.
To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, a simple model system was developed using λ phage and JW3996-1, a strain of E. coli immune to λ infection due to a lamB deletion [5]. In this model, the host is immune to infection unless LamB is expressed from a plasmid. After infection and selection for lysogens, the lamB plasmid is counterselected against to regain immunity. Extending this model to a more realistic situation, we envision using a phage that targets a pathogenic bacterial species, constitutively expressing the phage receptor within E. coli to create lysogens, and inducing the lysogens to infect non-E. coli pathogenic bacteria.
We require one other plasmid which controls the induction of the lysogens to release phage into the environment. Control of this aspect of the system is vital for integration with the overall iGEM project. The induction of λ ph"

Model your project – Convince the judges your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modelling.
For our project, we built three types of models. The first was an agent-based model which simulated our multicellular biosensor framework. This model gave insight into the optimal ratio of cell-types to have in the system. This information was used during experimental characterisation to optimise our system. Our second model was a statistical, multifactorial Design of Experiments (DoE) approach towards optimising Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) systems. This statistical model was used to generate an experimental design to gather data on the importance of certain supplements in CFPS systems, and then use the experimental data to optimise CFPS systems. Find out more about our models here .

Introduction
Palm oil is a huge business. From food products such as margarine and chocolate, to cosmetics and even applications in biodiesel, palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the world, and its demand is only increasing. But what most of the manufacturers of these products fail to publicly address is the massive devastation caused by ripping up rainforests in order to make room for oil palm plantations. Not only does this mass deforestation damage the planet by increasing carbon emissions and decreasing the amount of CO2 taken up from the atmosphere, it also destroys the homes and habitats of thousands of endangered animals, including orangutans and tigers. Additionally, many rainforests are found growing atop peatlands, and so it follows that when they are ripped up or burned, colossal amounts of CO2 are released. CO2 is of course a greenhouse gas and so obviously this has a big impact on the extent and rate of global warming. We discuss the devastation associated with the palm oil industry extensively over on our Ethics pages.
Palm oil is made up of four major components: palmitic acid (44%), stearic acid (4.5%), oleic acid (39.2%), and linoleic acid (10.1%). These four fatty acids are fractionated from crude palm oil and used in various different applications according to their degree of saturation- stearic acid is used primarily in cosmetics, where oleic acid is an important oil used in cooking, for example. The biosynthesis of fatty acids has been studied extensively in E. coli, which makes this the ideal chassis for our project.
Our aim is to overexpress the pathway of naturally occurring saturated fatty acids (palmitic (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0)) to result in a net increase in their production, and then insert"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Precaution Studies_-_-_TEXT.html," accept a technology or new substance which leads to undesired consequences than to accept a false hypothesis into a scientific theory.
The Precautionary Principle
This is called “The Precautionary Principle”, which has many different definitions but in essence it means: if an activity has potential harms by a certain degree, precautionary measures should be taken even if the likelihood of the harms occurring have not been scientifically confirmed. Other definitions could be: “Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation” Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development or “When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically” Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle . One study shows that one bacteria, which produces the bacteriocin leugudin, outcouncours the MRSA in vitro, which are great results, but from these results we do not just treat MRSA patients with the outcouncouring bacteria because we do not know the possible consequences of that action. It could potentially lead to even greater infection or problems for the patient or society.
This leads to the conclusion that even though the essence of the Precautionary Principle is intuitive for most, the precise definition and the influence of the principle is still debated.
The Precautionary Principle can be defined by three parts: The Meta-Precautionary Principle, the “Tripod” and Proportionality STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . The combination of these is what makes the Precautionary Principle a good tool for decision-making. The Meta-Precautionary Principle places restrictions on which types of decision-rules should be applied. The decision-rules in question are not to allow inaction because of scientific uncertainty - one should never be paralyzed by a lack of knowledge when facing serious threats STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . The “Tripod” part is actually three parts in itself: The epistemological condition, the damage condition and the remedy or action that are recommended CARTER, J. A. & PETERSON, M. 2015. On the Epistemology of the Precautionary Principle. Erkenntnis, 80, 1-13. . The epistemological condition is a proposition that stands in reference"
TokyoTech,2017,Team:TokyoTech#Experiment#TraI Assay_-_-_TEXT.html,"Temperature dependence of AHL production.
During the trial-and-error process for increasing the productivity of AHL in the Sender, we found that the amount of C8 was higher when the Sender was grown at a lower temperature; the RFU value was 14-fold higher.
E. coli introduced an empty vector was used as Negative Control.
C8 concentrations were calculated from the RFU values using calibration curve, 34 nM of C8 was produced in the 37℃ culture, whereas C8 concentration exceeded the detection limit in the 25℃ culture.
Fig. 6 Temperature dependency of C8 production
Discussion
We confirmed that E. coli cells produces over 200 nM of C8. However, as shown in other wiki pages (Read Project Description page and Read Chimeric Transcription Factor Assay page), the final objective of our project is inducing gene expression with C8 in human cells. From the Simulation , more C8 was required to do so. Therefore, we need to improve the production amount of C8 further.
The result in Fig. 5 shows that temperature dependency of C8 production. This result may reflect that the traI gene is derived from a soil bacterium A. tumefaciens; in nature, the temperature of soil hardly reaches  37 ℃, and the TraI protein may be unstable at 37℃. Indeed, growth of A. tumefaciens occurs optimally at 28°C, and at above 30°C, A. tumefaciens becomes heat-shock state (5).

Model
There're two outstanding models supporting our project:
Natural language processing (NLP)
Object-relational mapping (ORM)
WebSocket
Natural language processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence that is                 concerned with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language.
The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand language as well as we do.
For example, we can use these keywords to search:
molecular biology
But NLP give us the power to get closer to what we actually want to search:
molecular biology by Someone this year with #immunity
NLP can extract all the information and construct a query action:
keyword: molecular biology                 author: Someone                 time: this year                 label: #immunity
In our project, we use an open-source software named Stanford CoreNLP (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) to parse the search string.
CoreNLP provides many underlying models so that we can get analysis information to construct more                 expressive and more human-friendly query.
Object-relational mapping (ORM)
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) allows us to work with objects and have them saved to the database                 automatically. It can greatly simplify create-read-update-delete (CRUD) operations and make our code                 more comprehensive.
ORM makes our user,report,notice and more models easy to query, to                 list and to link to each other.
In our project, we use Django ORM with MySQL backend as the underlying models to provide                 fast and flexible queries.
WebSocket
WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a                 single TCP connection. The HTML5 WebSockets specification defines an API that enables web pages to use                 the WebSockets protocol for two-way communication with a remote host. It introduces the WebSocket                 interface and defines a full-duplex communication channel that operates through a single socket over the                 Web. HTML5 WebSockets provide an enormous reduction in unnecessary network traffic and latency compared                 to the unscalable polling and long-polling solutions that"

Prototyping a Biosensor Device
In order to put our toxin-detecting bacteria to use, we developed the hardware and software needed to work with FRED.  After assembling many prototypes and designs, we have developed a portable and affordable open source hardware-software package that uses FRED's reporter genes for electrochemical detection. This field-ready system can be used for quick and quantitative analysis of samples and can measure the concentrations of multiple compounds simultaneously.
Last year, the Calgary iGEM team developed a potentiostat circuit whose function was quite limited. In essence, the device could run only half of the desired voltage sweep, and was inconsistent and lacking in sensitivity. Rather than give a quantitative measurement of a given compound, the primitive prototype could only produce a voltammogram with peaks that had to be interpreted by the user.
This year, we significantly improved the design and function of the potentiostat. We also designed and developed hardware"
Austin_Texas,2012,Team:Austin Texas#Spinach reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," mRNA binds to DFHBI, it exhibits green fluorescence, which we utilized as a method to measure promoter strength. Based on the curve of 400uM DFHBI, it appears that cell growth is hindered at higher concentrations of this synthetic fluorophore, leading us to utilize 200uM DFHBI as the optimal concentration for maximizing OD600 and RFU of the Spinach aptamer.
Since this project utilized one promoter, monitoring Spinach aptamer fluorescence over time is shown to be a reliable way to characterize promoters. Future directions for this project include creating a library of constitutive T7 promoters, as well as looking into secondary structure strength by inserting degenerate bases into the Spinach aptamer structure and monitoring fluorescence.

Collaborations with other iGEM teams
 
1. Team Tianjin
 
At the beginning of the summer vocation, team Tianjin contacted us for help and support. They wanted a kind of bacteria called Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. We eagerly contacted Prof. Aijun Liao in our university asking for this species, cultivating it and then mailed Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 timely. After that, when they encountered some difficulties cultivating this species, we assisted them to get technical support about the conditions for culturing this kind of bacteria.
 
Later, in CCiC conference, we are pleased to know that team Tianjin managed to use Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 successfully and achieved crucial experiment results based on this species. Therefore, we took a picture with each other’s posters together to witness this collaborations. Besides, some of the team members in team Tianjin or team Nanjing-China made great friends and team Tianjin gave special gifts to us during CCiC to express their thanks.
 
 
2. Team NEFU-China
 
We got in touch with NEFU-CHINA during the CCiC conference by asking questions after their presentations. Most of our team members were really interested in their project so we meet them after the Q&A time of the presentation. In this meeting, our team members came up with some great ideas to improve their project. What’s more, when advisors in team NEFU-China put forward their difficulties of proceeding experiments, we offered to share some equipment with them and invited them to our lab. All of the teachers and students in team NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their lab for a visit. Team members of our team gave presentations in their lab and both of the teams had a great team communication about iGEM and experiments. However, because of the long distance and the big expenses, they cancelled the plan to come to our lab proceed experiments. Nevertheless, we are communicating through emails and we have supported them with experiment materials as well as suggestions on their experimental design.

We formed collaborations with team UCAS during CCiC’s poster time. We are impressed about their hard work and great courage because they are the youngest team and the oldest students of their school (UCAS has been established three years ago).

Induction of chaplins on agar plates
Constructs with chaplin E and H where present in Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus subtilis ΔTasA. 100uL of subtilin solution 0%, 0.1%, 1%, 10% and 100% where plated on LB agar plates and let dry for 10min. Each strain was spread out with an inoculation loop on each concentration. As a control Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus subtilis ΔTasA without chaplins were spread out on all concentrations as well. The next morning the plates where visually analyzed. No difference between different subtilin concentrations were visible, furthermore, there were no differences between the strains with chaplins and the ones without. Adding a drop of water on the colonies did not show any difference in repellence between any of the samples. The only recognizable difference was the colonies morphologies between strains with or without TasA. The ΔTasA colonies where smaller and shinier since TasA is involved in biofilm formation.

Serial split plate was destroyed, none of the cells adhered/recovered from trypsinization. 1:24 plate has low populations, but looks OK. Did a media change, will check again on either Thursday afternoon or Friday.
May 25th, 2012
Media color is normal, but not changing at all. Cells are alive,  but they are not spreading out on the plate. More or less forming ""colonies."" Today, they were trypsinized to break up the colonies, spun down at 260g (according to this Penn iGEM protocol ) for 5 minutes and then resuspended in fresh media. The entire solution was placed into the dish. Will check tomorrow afternoon their confluency. At this point, if these cant come back it would be wise to get a fresh stock of 293Ts. We also should make frozen DMSO stocks so that when mistakes occur, we can at least work from the same passage.
May 26th, 2012
Cells in culture look good! Growing more as a monolayer and not colonies. Looking about 70%-75% confluent. Will split 1:6 today (out of 12 ml) and check again on Monday. Hopefully we can get them back on the MWF schedule. Also as an extra precaution, cells were centrifuged out of the trypsin/media mixture and resuspended in 12 mL fresh media prior to seeding two tissue culture dishes.
May 28th, 2012
Cells look good. Both dishes were split 1:6 (out of 12 mL). Followed the normal protocol (no centrifuging). During the protocol, there was a problem with the pipette aid. It would aspirtate, but not dispel fluid. Had to grab a pipette aid from the hood next to the microscope (washed with EtOH when transferring to and from hoods). Emailed Patrick about it.
May 30th, 2012
Patrick emailed over info about what was going on with the pipettor in the hood.  Cells are growing, but a bit underconfluent (50%-60%). Since I can not come into lab tomorrow, going to split 1:6 anyways, check on Friday. If still underconfluent a bit on Friday, will let go to Saturday. I would rather have the cells be underconfluent and in log phase than overconfluent and in a lag phase.

Figure 6 Verifying the nanobody concentration experiment again
The experimental results showed that the antibody concentration was responsive at 1000 ng/mL                             and                             1500 ng/mL, and the results were obvious. Among them, the method of dropping antigen is more                             stable.
The Influence of GA and APTES
Time:
19 Sept: The influence with or without APTES and GA.
Since the previous results were more pronounced, we then explored the impact of GA and APTES                             on                             the results. We skipped the steps of immobilizing the antigen and dropping the antibody,                             directly performing the GA addition step after self-assembly of the slide, and exploring the                             effect of GA (shown in Figure (7)a). The impact of APTES is to observe the observations made                             after self-assembly (Figure (7)b).
a. APTES inquiry results
b. GA inquiry results
Figure 7 The impact of APTES and GA
It can be seen from the results that APTES and GA are negligible for liquid crystal                             disturbance.
Hydrophilic Experiment of Slide
In order to investigate how hydrophilic the slides were before and after antigen addition, we                             conducted a measurement of the contact angle experiment. Among them, we will self-assemble                             the                             upper and lower slides, and the upper and lower slides will be dried at 110℃ for 1 h,                             changed to                             be dried at 80℃ for 1 h. The method of immobilizing the antigen is to adopt a soaking                             method.
No antigen was added, and the contact angle of 50 ng/mL antigen with 500 ng/mL antigen was                             shown                             (Fig. 8 (8) a, b, c).
a. Unfixed antigen
b. Antigen concentration 50ng/mL

Figure 8 Results of the hydrophilicity test of the lower slide
It can be concluded that as the concentration of the immobilized antigen increases, the slide                             changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic.
