Results
In C-terminus
The first observation we can make is that two main conformations of the tags came out of the simulations : they could either fold along the side of CsgA ending with its extremity towards the N-terminus side of the protein or, on the contrary, remain ""floating"" away from the protein like a flag. For His2-tag, we were worried that when the first motif folded against CsgA the second motif might end up blocking the side of the protein supposedly involved in CsgA polymerization described in the literature. However, in none of the simulations did it happen: the second motif always ended up folding in another direction.
Folded conformation
Floating conformation
However, aside from this there was no way to discriminate which conformation was more likely to occur than the other. To validate one model or the other, we could only rely on two hypotheses:
since its end gets near the polymerization site, the folded conformation may hinder a little the curli formation, hence a comparison of curli production between tagged and wildtype-producing E.coli may give a hint to the right conformation;
according to literature, a His-tag chelates nickel by folding around it so that two Histidines may form a bond with one nickel. If the tag is folded against CsgA, not only would it have less ""reach"" than a floating one, but also it would be less able to fold over nickel ions. Hence, if the folded state is the preferred one, nickel chelation shouldn't be too high.
The results of the wet lab however, showed no particular decrease in curli formation between tagged and wildtype-producing E.coli. Though we do not know the extent to which the folded conformation may hinder polymerisation, we may conclude that the floating conformation seems more likely to happen in vivo than the folded one.
Inbetween beta-sheets
The simulations with a tag on a loop between two beta strands showed a tendency to slightly modify the structure of the beta sheets around the tag, but we cannot say whether it would be enough to influence any of the curli properties. Moreover, it seems like modeling the behavior of beta-sheets is a really complex task that many molecular simulation programs do not guarantee to achieve perfectly. Thus the effects of the tag on the general structure of the protein are still questionable.
In-loop insertion seems to slightly alter the protein's structure
What can be said however is that the tag doesn't seem to have any conformation other than a floating loop between the original amino acids of"

Methods
The cloning was started with a preparative digestion of the DNA-Plasmids. To clone fusion parts the vector constructs were digested with AgeI and PstI to open the Biobrick suffix. The inserts were digested with NgoMIV and PstI. For cloning into the transfection-vector the enzymes SpeI and PstI were used for vector and XbaI, PstI for insert to keep up the ATG-start codon in the XbaI restriction site of the biobrick suffix.

NKU_CHINA,2018,Team:NKU CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"C combines with glutamate to form GltC-Glu complex. And it 's suggested that in the case of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RNAP, glutamate inhibits GltC-dependent transcription of gltAB mostly by GltC-Glu complex 's additional non-specific inhibitory effect on RNAP for binding on gltAB promoter[1]. gltAB operon encodes glutamate synthase[2], so there forms a feedback suppression network by GltC-Glu complex. Meanwhile, GltC-Glu complex also has an inhibitory effect on gltC promoter, which forms a self-negative feedback network. These feedback suppression networks work together to keep intracellular glutamate pool stable. See Figure 2:
Figure 2: Feedback suppression networks based on GltC-Glu complex.[2]
We use ordinary differential equations (Table 1) to describe this process in a cell cycle, the fitting result is shown as Figure 3:
Table 1: Ordinary differential equations that describes feedback suppression networks based on GltC-Glu complex. We have estimated the parameters and the result are: k1=0.81, k2=2.15×104, k3=49, k4=0.96, k5=0.84, k6=1.6×10-4, k7=5.0×106, k8=0.47, k9=1.7×106,k10=9.7×104. β represents gene leakage rate, const=1.

(b) Simulation result of GltC concentration changing over time in a cell cycle. The fitting result is obtained by using ODEs to simulate GltC's self-negative feedback network.
Accroding to Figure 3, it can be seen that the time evolutions are smooth and that no oscillations are present, and eventually the concentration of glutamate and GltC are stable, which is necessary for bacteria. We have also found that even small changes in mRNA degradation rates or mRNA copy numbers may result in large differences in intracellular glutamate concentrations. This result demonstrates why the concentration of glutamate can vary in a wide range and stay stable, which provides a theoretical basis for our experiment.
However, we find that the intracellular GltC concentration is basically equivalent in different cells because of its self-negative feedback network. So"

I. SpyTag-SpyCatcher System Verification
Make sure both preparation 1 and 2 are completed at the same time before the measurement.
Preparation 1:
Transfer Ptac Promoter - csgA – SpyTag in cell ΔMG1655 (Experiment Group)
Transfer Ptac Promoter – csgA in cell ΔMG1655 (Control Group)
incubate overnight
Dilute as 1:100 using LB media (both groups)
Incubate for 3 hours till OD≈0.6 (both groups)
Take 1.5ml of OD≈0.6 and add to 96 well plate (both groups)
Add IPTG, final concentration 0.1mM/L (both groups)
Induct in plate at 25℃ for 48h (both groups)
Centrifuge after induction and remove the supernatant (both groups)
Weigh the cells (both groups)
ΔMG1655 is MG1655 wild type with gene csgA knock out from its genome.
Preparation 2:
Transfer Ptac promoter - SpyCatcher – GFP (BBa_K2684004) into cell incubate overnight
Dilute as 1:100 with LB media
Incubate for 3 hours till OD≈0.6
Add IPTG, final concentration 0.1mM/L
Induct at 25 ℃ 220 rpm for 20 hours
Centrifuge and weigh cells
Add 5ml TBS buffer and ultrasonic to create reaction stock
Measurement:
Dilute reaction stock as 1:100 with PBS buffer
Measure florescence of the reaction stock after dilution
Add 1ml reaction stock after dilution to centrifuged cells from preparation 1 (to both group)
React for 1 hour
Centrifuge
Measure florescence of the supernatant
How much florescence the reaction stock lost could indicate how much the palette gains. In that logic, how much sfGFP-SpyCatcher protein the palette gains could be indicated by the difference between the reaction stock after dilution (step2) and the supernatant after reaction (step6).

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," amoxicillin, is caused by the β-lactamase (blaZ) gene (see unfoldable) in SAU and coagulase-Negative Staphilococci (CNS) ( GD Diergezondheid, 2017 ). Therefore, detection of this gene in SAU can directly lead to a more responsible antibiotics treatment plan.
BlaZ
BlaZ produces small-spectrum penicillinases. This means that penicillin based antibiotics, the most common first choice antibiotics that are empirically used by the farmer to treat mastitis, can not be used. Rapid detection of this gene could prevent the misuse of penicillins by the farmer and gives reason to directly prescribe other treatments.
Design Requirements
Besides finding a relevant gene to detect, we developed a number of design requirements (also see our Design and Demonstrate pages) for our device that came out of stakeholder interactions (see our Integrated Human Practices page) and discussions with experts.
Values
Design Requirements
Fast
There is a demand for a detection to not take longer than 8 hours and preferably less than 3 hours, according to stakeholders and according to research less than 8 hours ( Griffioen et al. 2016 )
Simple and user-friendly
Reduce the amount of steps and make them simple. It should be clear for the farmer what the next steps are after finishing the experiment
On-site
Current detection is done in the lab, new detection is only relevant if it can be done in the field. Sample preparation should not be a limiting factor for the on-site detection
Sensitivity
The sample preparation should give a suitable amount of RNA with minimal contamination. For this we would like to refer to our Sample Preparation and Cas13a pages
Limiting costs
The detection method should be cheaper than current detection methods. A test in the lab (antibiogram and cultivation for sensitivity) is around 25 euros
Biosafety
The pretreatment should be safe for the user and the environment after disposal
Storability
The ease of use on-site increases when the method can be stored without freeze-drying. For this we would like to refer to our TDP Design page
Accuracy
It is important that our detection method does not give false positives. To see how we researched this, we would like to refer to our Modeling page
Clear readout
To be able to obtain a readout visible by the naked eye, we developed a modular detection method which can be revised on the Coacervation Design page
Our solution
We incorporated all these design requirements in our end-product:"
Cambridge-JIC,2014,Team:Cambridge-JIC#ExecSummary_-_-_TEXT.html," for synthetic biology in the lab and at home.  We think of mösbi as one of the first instances of consumer biotechnology.
Having established our input-processing-output framework, we structured our lab work to develop each plugin type in parallel.  We sought to assay in Marchantia each module as standalone consruct - constitutively active, or with simple fluorescent reporters, and as components of a mösbi circuit.
As outputs, we considered chromoproteins, which would make both extremely easy sensing readouts and useful reporters for plant synthetic biology research, as well as the synthesis of raspberry ketone from p-coumaroyl coenzyme A, which would be proof of concept that more complicated metabolic circuits can be integrated as outputs for mösbi.  We gained evidence that some of the chromoproteins, which we received from the Uppsala team 2013, were succesfully transformed, but not expressed, and that asPink was expressed, but not visible to the naked eye in the background of marchantia's vibrant colours.  We quantitatively characterised a three enzyme raspberry ketone pathway, components of which we received from Ikuro Abe, Jules Beekwilder and Esmer Jongedijk, in an odorless strain of E. coli from D. Summers lab, and transformed Marchantia with our two enzyme construct, but from our quantitative work in E. coli, we did not expect to observe any noticeable odors. We built a limonene synthesising construct, which we unfortunately did not receive the opportunity to transform into Marchantia.  We designed an enhancer trap, which will enable us to identify Marchantia lines with expression patterns that would enable multiple outputs from different regions of the plant. We transformed Marchantia with the enhancer trap construct, and are waiting for them to reach a stage where they can be screened. These lines will be able to have mösbi output modules directly crossed in, and will be of great value to the developmental study of Marchantia.
Needing inputs for mösbi and a collection of promoters for our new chassis, we performed an extensive phylogenetic hunt for endogenous promoters from Marchantia genome/transcriptome data. We isolated these from the Marchantia genome, and assembled them into standalone and mösbi-compatible constructs. During our bioinformatic analysis, we produced for the first time a Marchantia codon table for optimizing expression.  We also built a heat-shock promoter mösbi-module, from the DNA provided by Christian Boehm, which would enable smart environmental sensing"

Light Control
    We have successfully constructed plasmid used in the light-induced system and achieved co-transformation in E.coli JT2. After then, we have tested the light sensitivity and the response time.
    Construction of Plasmid
        (1) The construction of Part
        (2) The green light system
        (3) The red light system
        (4) The result of co-transformation
     We can conclude that under ultraviolet, bacteria would emit green fluorescence.
    About response
    We measured our system’s ability to produce fluorescence signal under different conditions of light. Due to time limit, we measured the green light system and the red light system without the NOT gate. It can be observed that these two systems had obvious leak. But after a series of experiments, we could observe stable differences both after irradiated by light and in the dark. Also, the green light system is more stable than the other one. However, compared with our reference, we did not test the obvious constraint on the red light.
    Delay
     We observed that the sharp increase of fluorescence mainly happens after 3 hours. And this sharp increase is really a helpful index for us to test the system. Thus, we think the response time of TCS is between 3 to 4 hours.     In general, we have verified that these two systems are feasible. However, they did not match up to our expectations, and the results seemed far different from our references. Following are the possible reasons:     1、The results can be affected by the copy number of plasmid and the replicon’s intensity, especially for the red light TCS.    "

Biofilms: Growing New Biofilms and Control Testing with Different Antibiotics
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Ronja Kothe, Jonathan Kwan, Anileen Pageni, Aum Patel, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: New biofilms were created so that testing of various sorts could be continued. To make sure the RFP biofilms that have been recultured in the past are actually from the plates, different antibiotics were used to reculture the biofilms. If RFP persisted in the different types of antibiotic we can ensure that the recultures are not our cultures –and therefore no contamination.
Procedure: New Biofilms
In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL of LB media, 210 µL of RFP, and 21 µL of KAN was pipetted into it. 3 mL of the solution was then pipetted into 7 35x10 mm Petri dishes.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

Building Engineered Cells in the Synthetic Kingdom
Construction of a GFP activity has been completed in Second Life. Clicking a jellyfish will dispense GFP, which the person can then put in their inventory. Then they can open the inventory of a bacteria in the area and place the GFP inside. As a result, the bacteria will glow green for a period of time after which the script will reset until the next person places the protein inside. This activity will also serve as a tutorial for inventory management for people new to Second Life. A note card will be added later on explaining the protein so others will understand how it can be expressed in the bacteria even though it has been extracted from a jellyfish.

Technical report writing
This didn’t happen the way it was supposed to. I have been building a repository of papers that either focus on quorum sensing (so lots of Bassler and other papers that reference her heavily) or on synthetic biology/biobricking so that I could get a sense of how to structure this. I ended up on a paper by Endy and what looks like 2 of his students that describes their characterisation of the BBa_F2620 part. And once I saw this, that part of modelling took over my life. I sent the paper out to the crew and cc’d the two of you – an explanation of my plan is in my email, but I want to look through it and see what we can easily implement in our work. Because the closer we can mirror this in our circuit characterisation, the better! They seemed to use FACS a lot in their analyses for determining genetic stability. Will we have access to the same technology? Or is there a sneaky way to circumvent it – say, by making a few overnight plates and taking a ratio by sampling the cultures that grow? Anyhow, I shall look at this more tomorrow – I have the paper and the supplement printed, and it would be a good idea to have our experimental procedures ready for this step so that we can hit the ground running when we start.
Modelling effort coordination
This wasn’t a huge deal – we just had Chinee update the reaction rule chart that we made on Friday, so that the reaction constants that we’re looking up are laid out in front of us on one convenient table. It’s so easy to lose sight of why you’re reading a paper, so this will be useful in helping us keep our goals in mind and in working efficiently.
Plate reader
I didn’t get around to this and I didn’t want to just start messing around with it without you guys there. If we do end up doing data-based modelling, we will need to have a sense of our delay (time between input and output measurement corresponding to that input). We want this delay to be as low as possible, especially if we’re worrying about protein degradation and time-dependent data (such as response time) – so it would be very prudent to plan our experiments around making that happen. Of course, if the plate takes a long time to read but the reactions are very slow, it won’t be an issue – you just don’t want to lose too much useful information while waiting for the plate measurements to occur.

In this interview, we realised that our final product of our project should be a device you can use on-site. Additionally, Mark mentioned several companies where they are developing techniques for the detection of antibiotic resistance. He also suggested to look what the farmers are doing now as a protocol when discovering that one of their cows got an infection. With this we could really state where the added values of our project lies. So, the detection device that we are making should be accurate of which antibiotics the farmer then needs to use.

Summary
Relevance
Korienke Smit and Cécile van der Vlugt gave insights on the political agenda concerning antibiotic resistance. This way, we were able to make an overview of the most important European and Dutch institutes and agencies. Besides new vaccines and new prevention strategies to tackle the infectious diseases, and besides the need for new antibiotics and new therapeutics, the increased use (including overuse and misuse) of the available antibiotics (ref. The Netherlands Center for One Health (NCOH)) should be stopped. The detection method could be used as frontline diagnostics and could be the key for new treatment strategies.
Safety and public acceptance
Besides designing in a relevant for the field, the acceptance of our detection method was considered. We aimed to design a detection method that could be broadly implemented to detect resistance on the spot. The public should be comfortable to use our method. Our idea was based on detection with GMOs with a kill-switch on a paper-chip. However, considering safety and public acceptance, we have chosen not to use GMOs in the environment, but only the products of the GMO. Taking into account the public opinion on GMOs and bacterial resistance, we aimed to design a product that looks as safe"

This debate was filmed and is posted and summarized on our wiki for the benefit of the public. The extensive experience of the debaters brings an expertise about policy issues not commonly seen among science and engineering students. The diverse background of the debaters allows a wide range of opinions to be reflected that could not have been imagined by an iGEM team alone. The format of debate allows both sides of an issue equal opportunity, and requires the use of well-reasoned arguments and evidence.  Moreover, debates are fast-paced and engaging, capturing an audience’s attention.  The debate is a valuable resource for educating synthetic biologists about public reactions, assessing public knowledge about genetic engineering, helping policy-makers make well-reasoned decisions, and helping the public form their own opinion of synthetic biology.
See U of A Debate
Moreover, we reached out to high schools, summer camps, libraries and colleges, doing demonstration debates about ethics and presentations on the science of synthetic biology. We’ve reached over 230 students already and are scheduled to reach over 400 students by January. We’ve developed and posted resources for teaching synthetic biology to a wide range of age groups. From the feedback we’ve collected and analyzed, students almost unanimously feel learning about synthetic biology is valuable.

Best Model:
We’ve developed a novel system for comprehensively analyzing the entirety of the known metabolic network of E. coli. Through this system, one can assess the net biomass production of an E. coli in which any combination of metabolic gene are present, and thus assess which combination of pathways are necessary for cell survival. We used this model to predict the minimal set of metabolic genes required for E.coli survival, towards the goal of producing a minimal E. coli genome. This minimal gene list included 117 essential genes never previously identified as essential for a minimal genome. Moreover, a graphical user interface has been developed for exploring the results of our minimal metabolism modeling.

Transformation and expression
We used the transformation method of Xiaoling Wang to transform Metarhizium anisopliae 128, and obtained stable transformant through the screening of G418 sulfate, and then verified the successful transformation through extracting genome, primer PCR and nucleic acid electrophoresis.
HsbA
To verify the existence and function of HsbA protein, the following treatment is done.
The transformed strain Metarhizium anisopliae 128 was grown in 1/4 SDAY liquid medium, and obtain total protein by smashing cells with FastPrep and ultrasonic crushing. And then we detected the native molecular mass by SDS-PAGE and coomassie blue staining. Besides, we spread the spores of Metarhizium anisopliae 128 and Metarhizium anisopliae HsbA transformant onto the cockroaches’ legs. After 16h germination, we took out and placed the cockroaches’ legs on the scanning electron microscope for observation. Then we rinsed the observed area on the cockroaches’ legs with 200ul ddH2O and observed them on the microscope again. Finally, we can compare whether is there any change in the position and number of spores in the observing area.
Bbchit
In order to verify the function of the transferred chitinase, the following experiments were performed.
The wild-type Metarhizium anisopliae 128 and Bbchit transformant were cultured in 1/4 SDAY liquid medium, and obtained the crude enzyme solution by smashing cells with FastPrep and ultrasonic crushing. Then, the native molecular mass of protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. In addition, to verify the enzyme activity, we used Czapek culture medium to culture the wild type and the modified type and took bacteria medium of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 days to filter and obtain the crude enzyme solution. We optimized the method of Kan Zhuo‘s and Xiaozhen Shi’s to chart the chitinase activity curve through DNS colorimetry.

To the General Public
Even if any biological materials escaped the lab, the risks are very small. As mentioned previously, the E.coli strain is debilitated.  We are not using any other whole organism.   The plasmids we are using could get into other strains of bacteria by natural transformations.  These strains of bacteria could potentially survive outside the lab.  However, none of the genes we are using would make them more pathogenic, though they could make them resistant to some antibiotics.
To the Environment
The K-12 strain does not survive well outside a controlled environment,  The plasmids we are are non-conjugative and non-mobilzable so that DNA cannot be easily transferred to other micro-organisms.
To security through malicious misuse
The organism and parts are non-pathogenic,, and so are unlikely to be used maliciously in this way.
What are we doing to negate/reduce these risks?
Use the E.coli strain K-12, which has a history of safe use in synthetic biology. The strain we used for many of our experiments is a derivative of AB1157 which is auxotrophic for 6 amino acids.
We also follow the safe lab practices outlined previously, and in our institution's guidelines.  All waste is disposed of safely and/or autoclaved. Good microbiological practices are followed when handling organisms at all times.  The lab is also equipped with magnetically sealed doors, which sound an alarm if left open too long.

And about twenty district hospitals, but then we also have central hospitals, where we need more of those because of the referral system. So because of that most of them are [...] disenfranchised they have been dissuaded. They can not really say “letˋs go and get our eyes checked”, because they know that when they go, perhaps they may find nobody who can attend to them and that has been a problem. But there is a remarkably progress. [...] I think some few years ago, that was not the case. Now, because of that, some of them, who are old they may have developed trichiasis but they feel that it is time for them to be blind, because they are old. So those are some of the beliefs that are there. Even right now when we have the program where we are correcting (?) trichiasis the challenge is to persuade them to access this antibiotic service.

3) Spot Test to Confirm Phage Viability (7.12)
- Add 0.75mL of BL21 overnight into 8 test tubes
- Add 7mL of x6 top agar to each tube and plate it on top of LB plates
- Divide the plates into 6 quadrants with a sharpie. 4 plates are for the new dilution (next step) and 4 plates are for the old dilution series (step 2), each labeled with their respective mutagen concentration series.
- Using the mutagenized phage stock from step 1 above, create a 1:10 dilution series of each mutagen concentration (0ul, 100ul, 200ul, and 500ul) from 0 to -4 using 90ul LB and 10ul phage in eppendorf tubes.
- Spot 5ul of each eppendorf tube (from both new and old dilution) onto the plates. Also spot 5ul of 5.3 phage stock on each plate as a control.
V) Results
2) Titer to Determine Phage Concentration 1
- Only the 0 plates from the 100ul, 200ul, and 500ul series showed plaques. All other plates had no plaques. The 0 200ul plate had the most plaques.
3) Spot Test to Confirm Phage Viability
- The old dilution series plates showed plaques at 0 and 5.3.
- The new dilution series plates showed the following plaques:

Our results don't point to any concrete conclusion. The results try to tell us that as we add mutagen up to 200ug, phage viability increases. At 500ug, phage viability drops. We know this can't be right, especially because our control (0ug) showed an abnormal decrease in phage. This points to a possible error in our experiment.

This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 28 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. Interestingly, we were lucky to have dinner with two former iGEMers Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements.
TMMU-China Meet-up:After several attendances of meet-ups, we hold a meeting one month before the opening ceremony. Although small in scale, this meet-up aimed at further promoting projects and better preparing for the whole competition. It is worth mentioning that with only one month from the competition, many teams felt they were under great pressure. Professor Rao Xiancai from TMMU-China shared with us his story. He told us that with the advent of the information age, acquiring knowledge and exchanging information had become much easier than decades ago, with iGEM as a good example of integration of network information and international communication. The whole world is enjoying a golden age of information exchange and multilateral communication. He hoped that given the chance, all the young adults could seize the moment to learn more, not for medals or awards, but to stand on the frontier of the age, and by working together, we would make a difference. Professor Rao’s speech inspired us all and we therefore deepened our understandings of scientific research. At last, the exciting hot pot dinner lighted up the happy atmosphere for every team member to enjoy the meeting and refresh for future challenges.

The anti-cancer project was previously the favoured idea, but after extensive review ,the Alzheimers project gained favour due to being relatively new (and hence exciting) to iGEM compared to a cancer project, which has been done several times already at iGEM. No final decision has been made however, work has continued on researching both projects. The wiki is also still being worked on.
The team also had a social gathering: pizza for lunch.
19th June
The group continued work on all three projects in order to send improved proposals to Darren Nesbeth by the end of the day. Many professors and experts were also emailed to seek guidance, in particular for the Alzheimer's project which seems to be particularly difficult.
20th June
Tom - Prepared a presentation to be given next week about iGEM to prospective UCL students to raise interest in the engineering faculty and also the iGEM competition. After this was complete, joined the rest of the group in research. Also performed wiki coding for the team page and notebook page.
The group continued what was started yesterday: Rectifying the proposals, with both sent off at the end of the day once they were complete. A group meeting was held at the end of the day to gauge interest and vote for the most popular idea, followed by a social gathering.
21st June
Tom - Continued wiki design, coding and content uploads. Alex - Continued to redraft the proposal for Alzheimer's StJohn - Continued to redraft the proposal for Cancer
KC - Researched into other iGEM teams to colloborate with and initiated correspondence via email
The team then discusses which project was favoured. It was fairly even but Alzheimer's was slightly more popular.

We ran phusion PCR samples on regular agarose gel, but the PCR was unsuccessful. We need to re-setup the PCR products as there was no visible band for either the AmyA or Savinase proteins on our gel.
5/16/13
We reran phusion PCR for AmyA and Savinase. In addition, we also re-boiled the DNA template for Subtilisin savinase. In the PCR master mix we used a GC base thermobuffer in place of the normal 5X Phusion buffer. We hope this will help the PCR reaction for our enzymes.

The AmyA products worked. There was no visible band for the Savinase products. It seems like we are not getting adequate DNA from our lysed Bacillus Subtilis cells. We need to determine a new boiling method to better isolate the Savinase DNA in preparation for the PCR.

Cloning Guide with TU Eindhoven
First, we were very motivated to discuss the potential for iterative capped assembly to open the doors for other iGEM teams to explore new features of protein synthesis. To achieve this, we collaborated with the great members of the TU Eindhoven iGEM Team, for whom we developed a cloning guide for ICA.  Our entry in their guide discussing the background, process, workflow, and troubleshooting tips necessary to utilize this system.  Our collaboration has not only benefited iGEM teams who wish to learn the technique, but also helped us gain a better sense of the implications of our research toward advanced synthetic biology. We envision ICA as a cloning technique that can be widely adapted not only to those using our parts collection generate novel silk genes, but for any team who wishes to rapidly and controllably assembly long repetitive genetic structures for functional use.
Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.
First Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup
The UCLA iGEM was honored to hold the first ever Southern California iGEM Meetup on Thursday, August 6th.  Team members from the University of California, San Diego ( UCSD ), University of La Verne and La Cañada High School , and the LA Biohackers Community Lab attend our meetup at the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA.  Here is a link to the powerpoint we delivered at the meet up, and below are pictures from our event.  Teams discussed their ongoing projects and offered advice to members struggling with certain aspects of their experimental design, and discussed the pertinent issues for all iGEM teams in terms of logistics, team organization and project design.  Additionally, we discussed the state of iGEM and synthetic biology as a rapidly emerging biotechnology field in the United States, especially in the context of developing scientific communications to combat rising negative publicity and misinformation toward the use and safety of genetically modified organisms. Through our meet up, we hope to spur not only a collaborative experience"

Collaborations
As a community, cooperation and collaboration are inevitable in order to achieve better results. ITB_Indonesia took this chance to broaden our network and scope of works by collaborating with the following universities and institution.
Oxford
On the June, 13th, our team contacted Henry, member of the Oxford iGEM team. We had a brief  discussion and shared our project each other through skype video call. As the result, we agreed to exchange questionnaire as a form of human practice collaboration. The Oxford team questionnaires were distributed by ITB_Indonesia team at the Seminar and Meetup event on June, 27th. This was a great opportunity to distribute the questionnaire since the audiences came from many universities and backgrounds. The results of the questionnaire were summarized and sent to the Oxford team. On the other occassion, the Oxford team also distributed ITB team questionnaire and gave us the results. Oxford .
Universitas Indonesia and Universitas Brawijaya
On June, 27th, ITB_Indonesia hosted the first meetup where all of the Indonesia iGEM teams gathered together. We collaborated with UI_Indonesia and UB_Indonesia to conduct a seminar about synthetic biology and shared each of our team project to the public. Through this seminar, we promoted synthetic biology and iGEM to the audiences. We were very happy because we had a chance to have a skype video call with one of the iGEM HQ representative, Ana Sifuentes.
UB_Indonesia
We provided UB_Indonesia 2015 team with E. coli DH5a competent cells. We also helped them by cloning their G-Blocks to pJET, and transformed it to E. coli DH5a. We also transform promoter T7 (BBa_K525998) from iGEM 2015 disribution parts  to E. coli DH"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". Copies were sent to The Judd School and Colyton Grammar school, as a thank you for helping us develop BioMech throughout the progress however copies were sent to St Peter’s school in Bournemouth and Bishop Wand C of E school. The teachers of these schools are going to give us feedback on how the game works and what improvements we can make to make it more accessible and engaging for students. It is our hope that we continue to improve and adapt BioMech so that it can be implemented in as many schools as possible and become an essential teaching resource for high schools wanting to learn more about synthetic biology.
Mrs Hayley Andrews of The Judd School recommended we get in touch with The Institute of Research in Schools as well as the National Science Learning Centre to give BioMech the best possible chance of becoming implemented in schools. As a ‘future use of the game’, Hayley Andrews suggested that we could use BioMech as starter educational tool for students at schools wanting to take part in iGEM. As it introduces students to the fundamental principles of synthetic biology: plasmid design, biobricks as well as essential, more complex principles of biology like mutation - it would act as an engaging resource for high schools. Consequently, after the iGEM jamboree, we hope to continue to work on BioMech in order to distribute it to as many schools that need it, and try to encourage more schools to take part in the iGEM competition. The Judd School are planning on taking part next year and we have already established good rapport and potential for collaboration in the future.
On 13th October 2016 we received some images of Year 12 students at The Judd School playing BioMech and explaining the gameplay to other students. Ms Hayley Andrews exhibited BioMech as  an educational tool that would help Judd’s iGEM bid in 2017. Alongside DNAvigate and the Rolls Royce Science Prize, iGEM is explained as how The Judd School are trying to integrate authentic, practical and real-world biology into their teaching to give students the best possible education of science. Our board game will be used to introduce students to synthetic biology teaching them about plasmid construction, BioBricks and mutations, as well as individual parts from previous iGEM projects. We hope to have this kind of impact on more schools across the country, encouraging involvement of British schools in the iGEM competition.

Specifically, The promoters were added into the pXP218 plasmid between the restriction enzymes SphI and SalI, which are near the multiple cloning site in the plasmid.The criteria required for the plasmid were the following: there are no T7 promoter regions near the promoter insertion site, so that T7 does not give a false positive by increasing expression of the promoter being tested, it had to be able to replicate in yeast, be able to be constructed in Escherichia coli,  have a CEN/ARS or a 2 micron origin of replication, and have a bacterial origin of replication. Having a selective marker in the plasmid was also important an important factor so that we were able to select for transformants into yeast; some markers include LEU2, URA3, HIS3.
Pxp218 yeast expression vector showing the main features which include: the backbone of pUC18, a vector size of 6226, URA3 selectable marker, ampicillin bacterial resistance, temperature growth at 37 °C, with growth stains DH5alpha and a high copy number.
Why we chose our restriction enzymes
When selecting the section of the plasmid to insert the Gal1 promoter and GFP, it needed to be ensured that the restriction enzymes chosen for the plasmid were not located within the Gal1/GFP sequence. This process for ensuring that the selected enzyme was not in our insert was repeated for each promoter with the fused GFP. Furthermore, restriction enzymes that would be used to digest our vector backbone would need to be found at the ends of the insert. This could be done through PCR.The order for each construct was the promoter itself to initiate transcription, the kozak sequence to start translation, the stop codon to stop translation, GFP, ORF - a terminator to stop transcription, and two restriction enzyme sites to allow the vector to be cloned.To design the promoters, research was conducted regarding how much space would be required between the kozak sequence and each promoter as well as how much space is needed between all the elements. Our team used other plasmids with the same promoters we are testing and GFP as a template when designing the sequence between the promoter and GFP in our promoter to ensure the correct sequences were used. Each promoter insert that has been through PCR was ligated into the pSB1C3 and pXP218 plasmids. To ligate into the pSB1C3 plasmid specifically, we cut with E"

My name is Simon, I am currently studying in the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master´s programme at the University of Göttingen. Last year, I finished my Bachelor with an emphasis on Molecular Biology at the University of Göttingen. Next to the university courses I really enjoy to play tablesoccer in my freetime. I am a member of a club which competes with other teams in a German wide national league. This year, I joined the iGEM team to participate in an interesting competition as well as to improve my lab skills. I am eager to organize and develop a project together with other students and just like to have a fun time with them. Hopefully, we are able to get to the international jamboree in Boston and meet lots of other students with worthwhile ideas and projects.

Flash Coli
Hey everybody! My name is Flash Coli and I am known as the fastest gut bacterium on earth. There are many rumors on how I was born but I can assure you some of them are hughely exaggerated and not very pleasant! This summer I supported the Team Göttingen during their work for iGEM. As a big fancier of cloning, growing cultures and BioBrick design I am the perfect addition to this team. Also, my speed is a huge help since the lab is located on the ""Faßberg"" aka the little brother of Mount Everest, and the students are only equipped with bikes. Therefore, I can easily take all kinds of equipment from the university buildings to our lab at the MPI.
I am looking forward to meet all the other European teams in Amsterdam. Stay Coli!
Focus Group: Can work in all groups simultaneously.
Additional jobs: Being faster than a flash.

Dear Students,
I am very pleased that you joined up this year to participate in the iGEM 2012 competition of the MIT. I am well aware how much extra dedication such a project costs way beyond the requirements of the Biology studies. I wish you already now good luck and I am gladly available as your advisor for the project. Best regards

Tsinghua-A,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Logo_-_-_TEXT.html," changed sequence with the original one and count the Hamming distance between them. When a restriction enzyme site sequence occurs on the mutated TALE sequence, there will be a penalty.
2.Codon Usage
When the sequence contains too many rare codons, which means the number of the homologous tRNA is extremely low in E.coli, the whole sequence can hardly express. In order to avoid the appearance of rare codons, each occurrence of rare codons will lead to penalty.
Selection
In each generation we sort the 200 sequences according to the scores of each single sequence. And we terminate the half of lower scores, the rest of them will have better fitness. Repeat the process of mutation and crossover, the average score of each generation will increase. (See Results.)
We repeat the process for 600 generations.
Simulated Annealing(SA)
-Introduction of Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing is a simple and general algorithm for finding global minima. It operates by simulating the cooling of a (usually fictitious) physical system whose possible energies correspond to the values of the objective function being minimized. The analogy works because physical systems occupy only the states with lowest energy as the temperature is lowered to absolute zero.
-Our Strategy
Mutation
We randomly choose 5 points on the sequence to mutate. To each single point, the process is the same with our computational mutation in genetic algorithm.
Scoring
The same as fitness scoring in genetic algorithm.
Parameters
The initial temperature T is 10000.0, after each generation, the temperature reduces to 99% of the former temperature. If the new generation has higher score, it will be accepted. Otherwise it will be accepted at a probability P(A)

Few side effects
Some can result in side effects that exaggerate initial symptoms
Inexpensive
Can cause severe allergic reactions
Catheter coated with silver nanoparticles
Bacteria cannot develop resistance
There can be serious side effects
Noninvasive in those who would otherwise be having a catheter fitted anyway
Catheters support biofilm formation which can lead to recurring infections
Botox
Increases comfort by lessening symptoms of incontinence
Does not treat underlying infection
May need to have a catheter fitted which increases incidence of infection
Long term effect unknown
Invasive
Methenamine hippurate
Bacteria can’t develop resistance
Have to take doses every day to prevent infection
Requires additional supplements for effective treatment (Vitamin C, Cranberry supplements)
Relatively new treatment which hasn’t been tested in children, the elderly, or breastfeeding women, so this limits the number of cases it can be prescribed in

By gathering FabG, FabI, FabZ and TesA on the membrane, the production of fatty acid was enhanced significantly by 9 fold compared with E.coli overexpressing the same amount of corresponding cytoplasmic enzymes. The statistical data strongly support the superiority of Membrane Accelerator.
To demonstrate the priority to exportation and the refinement of interaction, two sets of controlled experiments have been set as following:
WT stands for E.coli transformed with corresponding plasmid(s) without exogenous gene.
F- stands for E.coli overexpressing corresponding free cytoplasmic enzyme(s). F-TesA means free TesA. F-AGZI means free TesA, FabG, FabZ and FabI.
M- stands for E.coli expressing corresponding enzyme(s) linked to membrane anchor(s). M-TesA means membrane anchored TesA. M-AGZI means aggregating membrane anchored TesA, FabG, FabZ and FabI.
Statistical data are shown as below and GC-MS data are attached to https://2012.igem.org/Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai/Parts
Assay of the Priority to Exportation
The construction detail of experimental group is shown in Fig.4. Control group is E.coli expressing the same amount of diffusing cytoplasmic TesA.
TesA is responsible for the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-ACP, with special affinity to C16- and C18- precursor. As Fig.9 A indicates, 20 hours after induction, E.coli with membrane anchored TesA experienced a 50% increase in C-16, C-18 fatty acids content and total fatty acids (Fig.9 B) in supernatant, compared with E.coli with free TesA.
Fig.9 shows fatty acid content in supernatant of three groups to evaluate the advantages of membrane anchored TesA. A indicates C16/C18 fatty acids content among three groups. B stands for the total amount of fatty acids among three groups.
Fatty acids yielded in supernatant went up to 0.71mg/(L·OD). The result supports that membrane anchored TesA could efficiently transfer fatty acyl-ACP into desirable fatty acids right beneath inner membrane, thus making it much easier for the final products to diffuse into periplasmic space.
Fig.10 shows fatty acid content in the sediment of three groups to evaluate the advantages of membrane anchored TesA. A indicates C16/C18 fatty acids content among three groups. B stands for the total"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," the dilutions is visible on the graph, as the distances betwen the points and the lines of best fit are similar both with the green filter and with no filter. The no filter readings are higher as fluorescence is provided in arbitrary units, as they are the light intensity readings without being calibrated against a blank. Without the filter less light is blocked and thus there is increased levels.
We were surprised results without the filter. We expected greater errors caused by variations in ambient light and the input blue light. The input source light must therefore be very consistent and also quite directional so as not to significantly affect the readings. For reference, we used a Nichia Superflux LEDs, product code NSPBR70BSS. However, we don't think there's anything particularly special about this LED - it may be an idea for future projects to test LEDs to see if there is a benefit to using a specific type or brand.
Conclusions
The results follow the trends we expected them to, demonstrating that our combined fluorometer and densitometer has high linearity and thus is an effective measurement tool. It could therefore be developed commercially to be used in diagnostics, especially in developing countries. This is further explored on our silver human practices page .
We characterized the linearity of our light sensor (TSL235R) with optical density readings of LUDOX, and found it performed very well.
Aachen 2014 characterized the linearity of the same light sensor (TSL235R) to detect fluoroescence of purified iLOV, [1] and our results with fluorescein are concordant. Using the same light sensor also means our work further characterizes their fluorometer.
Unfortunately we don’t have a plate reader at our school so we were unable to test the same samples with commercial equipment to compare the performance. However, the linearity graphs and Aachen’s previous work characterizing the light sensor (TSL235R) demonstrate that our hardware has real potential to reduce the costs and increase the accessibility of a screening programme.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," the current situation is made even more fitting by the common use of the term ‘chassis’ to describe the minimal genome.
The origin of much of the current issues facing biotechnology as a whole is the outcome of the Diamond v. Chakrabarty case, where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 verdict “A live, human-made micro-organism is patentable subject matter under 101. Respondent's micro-organism constitutes a ""manufacture"" or ""composition of matter"" within that statute’ (U.S. Supreme Court, 1980) This allows for patenting of genetically altered organisms as they were deemed to be not products of nature.  There is left some ambiguity over the patenting of individual genes and use in research and newly assembled genomes.  ‘Current patenting practises may already be restricting development of and access to clinical applications of genomics, as well as academic and industry researchers’ access to genetic information and reagents.  Large-scale gene identification efforts such as that involved in minimal genome research, as well as other technologies that require use of large numbers of genes simultaneously (such as gene arrays have great potential to exacerbate these problems.’ (Cho et al, 1999).  They go on to suggest that new legislation will have to be passed, explicit to genes and organisms to help protect everyone’s interests.  The problems with Intellectual Property Rights are by no means restricted to synthetic biology, an example is of criticism of their role in the production (or lack thereof) of generic drugs for HIV treatment.  Where synthetic biology is distinct is that its part in intellectual property is ‘at the confluence of biotechnology and computing’ (Rai and Boyle, 2007).  They point out the problems that the development of computer software caused in fitting the remit of neither patents nor copyrights in intellectual property terms was ‘hardly resolved by forcing it under both.  Rai and Boyle suggest the difficulty with the way in which the law handles software and biotechnology individually could come together to form ‘a perfect storm’’ (Balmer, 2008).
There are critics of synthetic biology in this area such as the already mentioned Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC) who have been particularly critical of one of the early “success stories” of the field, namely the development of  artemisinin for anti-malarial drugs.  This work, being conducted by OneWorld, UC Berkeley and Amyris, has been largely funded by donations of $42.6m from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"

Introduction
Our optogenetic toolbox enhancements can be divided into three subgroups: controllable protein import via Pex5, controllable protein import via Pex7 and controllable gene expression. Each of these sub-projects are of different design which will be illustrated in the following.
Pex5 import with LOV2
LOV2 is an optogenetic protein derived from Avena Sativa’s Phototrophin 1. In its dark state the J$_{\alpha}$-helix located at the C-terminus is bound to the core of the protein. Upon irradiation with blue light (~460 nm), a covalent bond between a cysteine residue on the LOV2 protein and a flavin mononucleotide chromophore causes the J$_{\alpha}$-helix to unfold, which in turn exposes the C-terminus (Spiltoir et al, 2016) . This property is very useful, as short amino acid sequences can be attached to this end of the LOV-protein, for example a peroxisomal targeting sequence! The idea for this project was to attach PTS1 to the C-terminus and the protein of interest to the N-terminus. Upon irradiation with blue light, the fusion protein would be imported into our compartment. We used a mutated version of LOV2 whose C-terminus has an increased dark-state binding affinity. This is caused by the substitutions and T406A and T407A. These mutations greatly reduce the possibility of the J$_{\alpha}$-helix being exposed in the dark state. Our PTS1 sequence consists of the amino acids LQSKL. As a proof of concept for this construct we fused sfGFP to its N-terminus:
Lv1 -plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-LOV2-PTS1 fusion protein
This was done in order to visualize our experiment’s results during microscopy: upon successful import of the fusion protein, one would observe GFP fluorescence localized to our compartment. Otherwise, the whole cell would be illuminated.
Pex7 import
The idea behind this project is to initially block the protein of interest’s PTS2 with a fluorescent protein which can be removed by an optogenetically activated TEV-protease. For this project we use the protein Phytochrome-B from Arabidopsis thaliana and its interaction partner PIF6. These two proteins, also derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, bind together upon irradiation by red"

Timeline - Implementation
[September - October]
PROGRESS: After receiving feedback in the Ideation Phase, we modified our sketches and incorporated suggested changes. For the milking shell, we got rid of the flow sensor module and added an option for a blank module if a farmer did not want to purchase all of the modules. We changed the iodine spray module to a sponge applicator, since a spray could potentially contaminate the milk. We finished more of our app and updated the designs based on the feedback. We got rid of CowMD since farmers did not find it useful. We also modified cow data to show overall trends of the farm rather than focus individual cows, as DairyOne suggested. Finally, we polished our somatic cell counter designs to present a more user-friendly interface. We continued working on cloning bacteriocins in wet lab, in response to positive feedback. We went back for our final farm visits with a physical prototype of the customizable shell, along with a running app.
QUESTION: Would you buy this product? Why or why not?
FINDINGS: Though our product may be more expensive than the cheapest shells available, farmers would still purchase our product for the long term investment.

Blane Murray looked at our prototype and was interested in the product, but noted a few design changes. He noted that the temperature sensor could be an obstruction if the teats are too close together. He suggested that we remove extraneous components on the outside of the shell that could be damaged if the cow kicked. He also mentioned that we should try to get the modules inside the shell in a way that would not alter the liner.

Scipio Springs Dairy
Union Springs, NY
Bill Morgan of Scipio Farm gave us a thorough analysis of the various aspects of our project. He supported iodine application through sponges and UV exposure between milkings, because they would prevent growth and transfer of bacteria. Bill told us that he and other farmers would invest in a new device that would decrease the incidence of mastitis. Usually, shells are a one-time purchase and are only replaced when there is a better product in the market. Currently, shells cost about $40-$50, but Morgan said he would spend $100-$200 for what we were offering, which would still be less than some other products on the market. Each case of bovine mastitis can cost up to $300,"

To solve these two problems simultaneously, we aim to convert the degraded plastics into electricity by feeding them as an energy source for an electricity-producing strain of bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Plastic degradation and electricity generation will be merged together in a Microbial Fuel Cell as described in our MFC design .
4. How Talking to Prof. Bookhart, an Environment and Sustainability Expert, Changed our Project Design
To better mold our project into addressing genuine environmental concerns, we consulted Professor Davis Bookhart, the head of the HKUST Environment and Sustainability Department, who is currently working on different projects to reduce the University’s environmental impacts while addressing and managing risks that arise from climate change and resource scarcities. We thought that he would be able to give us more insights on real/current environmental challenges which we could help solve and how we could ensure the sustainability of our production system.
We first presented our system to Professor Bookhart in July. A few concerns he had was that, from the perspective of sustainability, our project was actually converting PE, a carbon-containing pollutant, into CO2 through the respiration of Shewanella, which in itself ıs a greenhouse gas. This actually exacerbates the problem of global warming despite removing a terrestrial and marine pollutant. Instead, Prof. Bookhart suggested that we find a way to reuse the carbon in any way or to feed back into the system for more electricity generation. We can also sequester the CO2 in a way that the CO2 is converted to a solid or a liquid to be stored.
Prof. Bookhart had also asked about the threshold of electricity we expected to generate and how that electricity could be used. To really transform our project into an impactful product, we should implement an application for the electricity generated. We should as well focus on designing a device that could encourage the public to put their plastic waste to good use by generating electricity for daily use.
5.  More Insights – Meetup with iGEM teams in the environmental track
During our meetups with other iGEM teams for collaboration, we exchanged ideas with team HKJS_S and realized that their project mechanism could be implemented into our system to tackle the concern of CO2 by-product waste raised by Prof. Bookhart.
One of their parts encodes a nitrogenase, which has the ability to transform CO2 into methane. Both substrates were intimately linked with our project: the CO2 was the sustainability problem we had to tackle, while methane was"

Team Activity Tests:
On our schedule today was testing our bought laccases (from now on called TVEL0 ) and improving our protocol in case it won't work. We got familiar with the flat bottom microplates and got a briefing into using the Tecan correctly. We started with the following setup: 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5), 5 mM ABTS, 8 U TVEL0 laccase, ad 200 µL with deionized water. Then we measured the absorption at 420 nm every 15 seconds over a time period of 2 minutes. Immediately our samples turned dark blue but unfortunately the changeover was out of range to be detected by Tecan. With this information we needed to reduce the laccase concentration to get measurable results. We have chosen to try another measurement with 0.1 U TVEL0 laccase and it worked! The result was a nice saturation curve but it reached a too high, because not good measurable, optimum within 1 minute (Fig. 1). To avoid the loss of important data in the beginning of the reaction and to reduce the saturation OD we decided to slow everything down by using less ABTS.

Under these circumstances E. cowli will be justifiable due to the positive impact on the minimisation of climate change coming along with it. Additionally, construction of a kill switch is planned in order to avoid any possible risk in case E. cowli escapes into the environment. Furthermore, the application of E. cowli as a part of a barn filter system prevents every risk of its integration into the cow's rumen.
Working with Methane
Many laboratory operations require the use of compressed gases, so did the activity analysis of our enzyme sMMO. Compressed gases represent a universal and unique hazard. Besides the potential exposure to chemical and mechanical hazards dependent on the type of gas, the storage in heavy, highly pressurized metal containers represent another high risk-factor. The large amount of potential energy resulting from compression of the gas makes the cylinder a potential rocket or fragmentation bomb.
Due to the fact that we had to use methane during the experiments with Methylococcus capsulatus and our transformed E. cowli various security aspects had to be considered. Since methane is a flammable gas which, when mixed with air in a certain ratio, is also explosive we took the following safety precautions:
The setup was exclusively handled with the correct ratio of methane, air and carbon dioxide under a hood without power sockets or other potential sources of electrical sparks or fire. All experiments were conducted at methane-air-ratios under 5 % (Lower Explosive or Flammable Limit LEL/LFL) and over 15 % (Upper Explosive or Flammable Limit UEL/UFL) to eliminate the risk of a combustible atmosphere. Hence, we accepted suboptimal conditions for the purpose of safety concerns. Gas cylinders were stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions and closed completely when no experiment was running. Before using the respective gas for creating the needed ratio the system pressure of each cylinder was set to 1 bar.  All equipment, including flow controllers, tubes and valves were screened for leak tightness regularly and their suitability for the used gas pressures.

The iGEM competition, a synthetic biology competition, is based on the use of BioBricks. BioBricks are biological fragments or parts, comparable to building blocks. Just as building blocks they allow individual use as well as assembly into bigger devices. In iGEM these BioBricks are created, documented and shared between all iGEM teams throughout the competition. Furthermore the number of these parts is steadily increased year by year. All BioBricks are recorded in one single giant catalog: the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
This year we contributed to the registry by submitting new parts, improving existing ones and, of course, using  parts already known to be reliable due to the experiences of teams from past years. All used BioBricks are listed on this page.
Our Favourite New Part - The Climate Change Killer
Part: BBa_K1390019 - complete sMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus This device consists of the six subunits of the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) of Methlyococcus capsulatus (Bath). The expression is controlled by a lacI-regulated promotor BBa_R0011 . The sMMO is able to convert methane to methanol using oxygen and NAD(P)H.
Apart from the promoter, the BioBrick contains an RBS upstream of each subunit-encoding gene and a double terminator. The construct is therefore ready for expression in E. coli.

Each of our team members played an integral role in helping to develop a strong iGEM project, which included designing constructs, developing a model, running experiments in the lab, and coordinating outreach. We were also supported by our host lab instructors and advisors, and we would like to acknowledge all those who helped make iGEM possible and fun this year!
Team training and Project start
Our iGEM team came together in January of 2017. We began to research interesting topics and brainstorm ideas and continued to refine our focus until we selected our project during the spring semester. We started learning protocols and techniques in the Weiss lab during the spring semester. Our advisors and other members of the 2016 MIT iGEM, as well as one of our instructors, Brian Teague, led these training sessions. We wanted to be able to start the summer with some experience using these techniques. We solidified our project design in the early weeks of the summer and started consistently working in the lab shortly thereafter.
Design & Experimentation
Members of our team designed the primers and most other constructs that we used. Our guide sequences and primers were synthesized by IDT. We ordered the L. shahii construct from Addgene, and we received the U6 promoter, MS2, and fluorescent proteins from the Weiss Lab. Members of our team also performed the lab work that was required for our project, such as PCR, cloning reactions, minipreps, midipreps, and transfections. Our advisors or instructor, Brian Teague, would help us troubleshoot if reactions were not going as planned. Sequencing reactions were sent to Genewiz or Quintara Biosciences.
Model
Members of our team reached out to MIT Burge Lab and Harvard Schier Lab to discuss and learn from their model, ChopChop. We eventually developed our own model, SpliceMIT, to predict gRNA sequences and antisense oligonucleotides. MIT Burge Lab and our supervisor, Brian Teague, both provided feedbacks to"

BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," More importantly, all of these methods which heavily rely on electrical technology will increase factories' costs and energy consumption, but none of them considered the function of microorganisms themselves.
So, can we regulate environmental pH in a simpler way and meanwhile maintain the effectiveness?
Is there any possibility to regulate environmental pH by microorganisms themselves?
Based on these questions, we come up with our idea. Here is the bacteria, now it faces this serious problem: how to survive in acidic and alkaline environment, and regulate environment to a suitable pH, to protect the fermentation world?
At that moment, pH Controller appears. When the bacteria get this weapon, it can balance the pH to a suitable level. To achieve these goals, we firstly constructed PC in E.coli, and designed two subsystems in gene circuits. First system is resistance system to ensure survival of bacterium and regulate intracellular pH, while the second system--regulation system, focuses on regulating environmental pH to a suitable range.
Precise artificial pH control raises worldwide concern because fluctuation of pH level can tremendously influence the performance of cell. This year BIT-CHINA designed a micro-machine, pH Controller, which can make bacteria survive in both acidic and alkaline environment, and adjust the extracellular pH to an optimal level.
Our project consists of two components, basic circuits and fine-regulation circuits. Basic circuits contain the resistance system and the regulation system. The resistance system makes bacteria survive in an expanded range of pH. The regulation system adjusts the environmental pH by synthesis of acid and alkali. Fine-regulation circuits are proposed for different regulation requirements.
We established three libraries in fine-regulation circuits, one for the pH-responsive promoters generated by error-prone PCR, another for various inversion effectiveness recombinases and the one left is for functional genes producing acid or alkali. All these factors decide the regulation range of pH. Therefore, we can meet different regulation needs.
Our pH Controller allows for lower artificial pH regulation costs in industrial fermentation. The hosts with our pH Controller can not only maintain high fermentation efficiency but also fine regulate the microenvironmental pH.

Even Fluid Dispension-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf
Integrated conversion of a set volume to dispense over time for dispensers in Neptune’s microfluidic devices are integrated into Neptune’s Software. A table of PWM and uL values at even intervals of fluid dispensing are generated and stored for each servo-syringe combination within Neptune to be used by the front end of the system to send dispense commands to the arduino. This can be done by the user through the Control page in an intuitive, pictorial way.
Neptune Packaging | Priya Kapadia
After creating Neptune as a web-application, the hardware team thought of packaging the entire application into a desktop application that the biologist could download onto his local computer. This would enable the user to use Neptune offline, making it more convenient. To do so, a packaging tool called Electron was introduced to host Neptune. This is under development, and moving forward, Neptune may become a desktop application that biologists can use anywhere and anytime.
Microfluidic Chip Prototyping | Shane McCormack
In order to ensure our design, build, and control workflow was functioning properly, we took designs through the Neptune workflow and tested them with mock experiments using colored water, or by collaborating with other iGEM teams to test biology inside our accessible microfluidic platform (checkout our collaborations page for more details on biology inside our systems!)
We stand on the shoulders of giants.
Our work would not have been possible without the foundations laid by our mentors. Neptune’s microfluidic design and fabrication tool leverages projects such as Fluigi Place and Route, Mint description language, MakerFluidics, and 3DuF in order to provide the most intuitive and cohesive experience for users. These projects have been built and expanded on by our graduate student mentors. We would like to thank our mentors for all of the work they have done to allow us to bring Neptune to life.
Fluigi | Radhakrishna Sanka
A place and route tool for microfluidic devices. Fluigi takes a MINT file as input and strategically routes the features specified in the MINT into an optimized microfluidic design. Fluigi outputs the design in a series of visual formats: SVG files (which can be used to mill out the different layers of the microfluidic chip using a CNC mill), a JSON file (which can be used to visualize the microfluidic design with 3DuF),"

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," companies. In the Netherlands, 70% of the total solar panels are in possession of households, while 30% of the solar panels are used for commercial purposes. This results in almost 260.000 households that have solar panels. Together, all these solar panels have produced 1485 MW in 2015. This is less than 1% of the total power supply. The government aspires to increase this number to at least 5% in 2020. This means that the number of solar panels has to be increased enormously or the efficiency of the solar panels has to be improved (Wezel, 2015) .
Germany is the world's leader of photovoltaic capacity since 2005. With a total capacity of more than 35 GW, the photovoltaics contribute almost 6% to the national electricity demands. The government is planning to increase this percentage even more (Statistiek, 2015) .
Worldwide growth of the use of solar panels varies strongly by country. By the end of 2014, cumulative photovoltaic capacity increased by more than 40 GW and reached at least 178 GW. Currently, the total worldwide consumption of energy is equal to 18,400 TWh. This means that the total photovoltaic capacity is sufficient to supply 1% of the world's total electricity consumption (IEA, 2016) .
In conclusion, the solar energy market is a dynamic and growing market. There is an increasing demand for environmental friendly and renewable energy sources. It is expected that the total demand for solar panels will increase even further in coming years therefore.
Unique selling point
The unique selling point of the microlens array encapsulation layer is to offer the solar panel industry a whole new and unique method to increase the efficiency of their solar panels with at least 20%. The microlens array can be produced in an environmentally friendly way and is furthermore also expected to be cheaper than regular microlenses. Next, by using bacteria to produce microlenses, very small microlenses can be produced, which will make the arrays even more efficient.
Competitors and Substitutes
Currently the use of microlens arrays for solar panels is still in the research phase and in the solar panel industry, microlens arrays will be new and revolutionary. This means that there are no companies operating in this industry that already sell microlens arrays. However, there are still multiple possible competitors and substitutes. We distingue 3 different types of competitors, respectively the use of regular fossil fuels, solar panels with regular encapsulation layers and chemically"

Heat shocked for 60 sec at 2:35 PM, then put cells on ice for 2 min.
200 uL of LB added to each culture, and cultures placed in incubator at 2:45 PM
Should plate cells at 4:45 PM.  Indeed, took them out at 4:45 pm.  Plated using the 20-80 volume technique.
All transformations plated onto older plates except ligation #2 at 80%, which went on one of new plates with bubbles
All controls were plated with 100% of volume rather than splitting into 80% and 20%
Plates went into incubator around 10:45 pm.  Should come out again around 12:45 pm tomorrow.
Also re-attempted transformations with the LexA DNA, which corresponds to parts Z0279 and Z0842.  These parts were the only two to not have successful transformations during the first round of limiter part transformations on 6/16/08.  Spun down tubes with remaining plasmid DNA in centrifuge in an attempt to get enough plasmid for the transformation.  Took only 1 uL for each part and mixed with 50 uL competent cells.  Also included negative control and two positve controls.  Both positive controls were 3x flag, but one was subjected to 1 min of mircowave at the lowest setting immediately following the 40-60 second heat shock.  Note that the positive control that went through the microwave started with less than 50 uL of competent cells, though the actual starting volume was not determined.  Transformations were in the incubator for 2 hr and 1 min.  The cells for each part were plated on two"

Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

Product Design
By utilizing effectively extensive feedback from experts and after numerous iterative circles, our team developed a versatile, innovative solution to detoxify wastewater from active pharmaceutical substances, Biotic Blue. Aquatic pharmaceutical pollution is a looming problem which accelerates antibiotic resistance and causes adverse ecotoxic effects on marine ecosystems. The main source of pharmaceuticals ending up in the water is human consumption, an inescapable activity for our well-being. The key to limit or even prevent pharmaceutical pollution is to detoxify wastewater from pharmaceuticals before released to rivers or the sea. Solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals exist, but their adoption is either still posing threats to the environment or it’s too costly. To come over these barriers, we developed Biotic Blue, an enzyme-based solution for degrading pharmaceuticals. What makes Biotic Blue unique, is the fact that it can be implemented before the biological treatment stage in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Implementing it at this treatment point prevents the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, inhabiting the activated sludge. Sulfamethoxazole-free water leaves the WWTPs and does not pose an ecotoxic threat to the aquatic environment when released. The immobilization of our mutant enzyme on magnetic beads and the smart employment of a magnet makes Biotic Blue energy efficient and cost-effective. However, the greatest potential of Biotic Blue to be broadly adopted by WWTPs lies in its capability to embed a combination of immobilized enzymes, enabling it to purify wastewater from a mixture of pharmaceuticals.
Problem Description
Over the past years, global consumption of pharmaceuticals has been on the rise. This will continue to increase as lifespan increases, boosting chronic and age-related diseases [1]. The majority of these pharmaceuticals end up in the aquatic environment after their usage, either in their initial biological active form or as metabolites. Indicatively, between 30 and 90% of orally consumed pharmaceuticals are excreted in the urine as active substances and end up in the water reservoirs after they pass through the sewage system [2].
Pharmaceutical usage in veterinary activities, such as factory farms, aquacultures and pet treatment, contributes to aquatic pharmaceutical pollution. However, this usage is not considered to be the primary source route. Neither is the improper disposal of unused or expired pharmaceuticals, which are flashed down or poured in the drain, or residues leaking from pharmaceutical manufacturing [3],[4]. Excretion of active pharmaceutical substances after human usage is documented to be the primary source of pharmaceuticals in"

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," desired end composition of PHBV co-polymer (Horng et al., 2013). In addition, we also used the model to theoretically survey the effects that can be achieved towards this end through the engineering of enzymes (that is, changing the binding affinity and catalytic activity). From this, we may also be able to speculate on the effect of change in gene arrangement in the operon (Hiroe et al., 2012). The resulting differences in transcriptional levels of the encoded enzymes can be represented in the system as different amounts of enzymes.
The Model 
To make a cursory exploration into how we may approach the production of PHBV with tailor-made composition and properties, we deemed that the dynamic model may even be sufficient if we were to limit the scope to only the PHA biosynthetic pathway while we would effectively ""black box"" the peripheral metabolic network. That is, we will define the pathway of three subsequent reactions, condensing acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA into polymers of PHBV.
For the model, we must assume a number of aspects. First, we have to assume that the parallel pathways contributing to the PHB and PHV components in the co-polymer do not interact. While it is most likely not the case, representation of a pathway where there is competition between substrates for a common enzyme may difficult to do so via a Michaelis-Menten derivation without more data. On a first pass, we assume that this distinction is condonable as long as the differences in the parameters we are testing are significant. Second, we must provide an influx of material into the biosynthetic pathway. Because we are not intensively modeling the pathways for glycolysis, TCA and fatty acid assimilation (a problem for another day after iGEM!), we assume the introduction of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA precursors can be represented via a heuristic means. The third assumption builds upon this in that, the amount of starting precursors that we test for simulations of the dynamic models are assumed to be within physiological ranges and would not be detrimental to the cell. Fourth, we assume that the system is homogeneous (no spatial element or compartments). Finally, we assume that the levels of enzymes are conserved throughout the experiment (note that the concentration of available enzyme does not fluctuate as would be the case in a mass-action representation that involves the formation of enzyme-intermediate complexes).
The biosynthetic pathway towards producing PHBV co-polymer
Based on these assumptions, a model was developed expanding on the work done by the Stanford-B"

Assistant Professor Xiangwei Wu from the University of Texas MD gave a lecture about early-disseminated tumor cells as a biomarker for colorectal cancer early detection. A specific feature of the apoptin used in our project is that it only enters into nucleus of solid tumors but stay in cytoplasm of normal cells. We consulted him whether the apoptin could be used as a biomarker as well. He said that we should first use nude mice to figure out whether MCF-7 cells can multiply in vivo by subcutaneous injection. Next, we should use CTC cellular immunostaining to figure whether the apoptin could work well.

III Methods
    1. Transform MG1655ΔlacI ΔsdiA with 27 kinds of combinations of plasmids mentioned above, which will be used in the orthogonality test.
    2. Pick bacterial clones from the petri plate,then shake it overnight in the LB medium (3ml) with 50μg/ml Ampicilin and 30μg/ml Kanamycin at 37℃. For each combination, 4 clones are picked.
    3. Dilute the overnight culture to 1/50 in fresh LB medium (5ml) containing 50μg/ml Ampicilin and 30μg/ml Kanamycin.
    4. Incubate the fresh cultures at 37℃ until OD600 reaches 0.2.
    5. Add 1ml culture obtained from Procedure 4 to 2ml fresh LB medium containing 50μg/ml Ampicilin and 30μg/ml Kanamycin. Incubate the fresh cultures at 37℃.
    6. Take out 200μl cultures obtained from Procedure 5 and measure the fluorescent intensity and OD600 after 17, 20, 24, 34, 38, 44h. (The cultures will not be put back again.) The excitation wavelength is 584nm, emission wavelength is 607nm.

V Analysis
    From the results above, how could we design our two warriors? Let's see!
    First, we need to choose two kinds of AHLs secreted by each warrior, right? Let’s try to make warrior I secrete C4HSL and warrior II secrete 3OC6HSL. Then which receptor-promoter should we put into the two warriors to make them just killed by the other warrior? Let’s first try to determine warrior I. Can we find a receptor-promoter combination that just responds to 3OC6HSL but not to C4HSL? Unfortunately, we can’t. Therefore, we cannot choose C4HSL and 3OC6HSL to construct the two warriors that we want.
    Similar results of other 2 AHL pairs can be obtained by similar analysis.

So itˋs very important to have a point of testing and itˋs also important to have a point of treatment, because if the test is positive these patients must be treated immediately. So itˋs a really good way to address the problem in countries that don ́t have the laboratory structure and equipment like, for example in Europe.
Daniel C.:
Do you see difficulties in our project? What difficulties do you think could arise?
Dr. Meyer:
Yes of course, one should not be so naive to think, this is a very good idea, this is an interesting technical concept that will work, there may be a lot of problems that may become apparent. First of all, it is important to verify if the test is really specific for chlamydia, because if you have crossway activity with other bacteria even if you are analysing ocular samples this may appear, this will not be OK for using it as a point of care test. This is something that has to be checked first of all.
Daniel C.:
Do you think the usage of GMOs will be met with refusal?
Dr. Meyer:
This is not a problem, you can use GMOs for diagnostics. There is a certain prejudice in Germany towards GMOs but that belongs mainly to the organisms in the usage for food production but not the ones used in diagnostic test. You are intending to use your device mainly in countries outside of Germany, in those countries it will definitely not be a problem, because there is a great demand for this test and it will not have a negative impact.
Daniel C.:
Please tell us about your career.
Dr. Meyer:
Studied biology, a long time ago, in the 80ˋs in Germany in Bochum and then went to Hamburg to the University Hospital, this Hospital, and started my thesis on E.coli bacteria and finished it in the University of Würzburg and then I started a job in a private laboratory again in Hamburg and I have been working there for almost 20 years and that was very interesting because at that time in 1990 it was just beginning to introduce molecular tests in diagnostic of infectious diseases and then in 2008 I went back here to the University Hospital just because in the private laboratory there was only diagnostic testing and I was interested in other things, like developing new tests and also teaching students. And therefore I went back to the University Hospital and have been here in the University hospital for 8 years.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Methylmercury Poisoning_-_-_TEXT.html," like fishing in the locality was unrestrained at the time, entire families on this coast were being exposed to contaminated food and slowly were intoxicating themselves, giving rise to chronic poisoning by 20 years after the wasting begun.
Epidemiology
In conjunction with the local population in the Amazon region, we have the main route of contamination it is the excessive ingestion of fish in the area, these often highly contaminated with high concentrations of mercury due to the phenomenon of bioaccumulation, however, ingestion of fish marine or other seafood are also able to intoxicate, and the presence of MeHg in some pesticides and fungicides. For study purposes, the calculation of the concentration of MeHg in hair of patients is guide for estimating patient exposure to sources of MeHg. A study in the city of Manaus, Amazonas, UFAM_Brazil headquarters staff, by Farias et al. (2012), assesses the levels of Hg and MeHg found in the hair of children in the city. This study showed that the concentration of these metals in the hair of children in Manaus is a higher than average in other regions of the country, and in the riverines this concentration is even higher. In addition, the study was able to confirm the thesis that MeHg levels in hair are directly related to the diet of the population, which is based on fish, great source of MeHg.
Figure 3 - Indigenous Child.
Figure 4 - Typical meal based on fish from the river.
Pharmaco-toxicokinetics
After ingestion of contaminated food, about 95% of the levels found MeHg are absorbed quite rapidly in gastro-intestinal tract through alternative forms linked to amino acids such as MeHg-cysteine and MeHg-glycine. Once adsorbed onto and into the bloodstream just over 90% of MeHg is inside the red blood cells in a ratio of approximately 10-20:1.
The circulation to the liver, where it can spread to all tissues of the body. Acquiring a form of thiol conjugate that possesses similar to the amino acid methionine way MeHg can overcome the blood-brain barrier, so they are easily accumulated in nervous tissue, since its biotransformation into Hg2+ is slow explaining levels higher MeHg in the CNS (Central Nervous System) in the rest of the body. The MeHg can also cause damage to the kidney tissue quite rapidly, reaching stable levels within 3 hours after intoxication.

To design criteria for a lateral flow assay, we developed an outline of important design specifications determined via a simple market analysis.
With these design criteria in mind, we developed the following lateral flow assay.
Solution: Lateral Flow Assay
In order to achieve this lateral flow assay our team focused on engineering a thermostable variant of griffithsin which would be needed to create the assay and allow the diagnostic to have a longer shelf life. If this part were to be produced, then the rest of the assay would only require an assembly of the required parts. The major focus of our wet lab was focused on developing this thermostable variant of griffithsin.

We will optimize the whole strategy to enhance the adsorption efficiency by changing pH, temperature, reaction time of crosslinking and clearance. (The efficiency is only about 60% without further optimization)
3.
According to the results for the adsorption of 13nM uranyl, the polymer network exhibited a good ability in a simulated seawater environment. We could thus also look into other usage scenarios of Uranium Reaper, such as bio-mining and uranium enrichment.
4.
Exchange of the SUP module for other functional proteins. For example, we could integrate proteins which could bind other heavy metals such as mercury so that the polymer network could be used to treat other kinds of pollution as well.
5.
We could assemble enzyme systems behind the SpyTag backbone to create a production plant in vitro. In the protein polymeric network, the concentration of enzymes could be increased and the efficiency of biocatalysis may consequently also be enhanced.
6.
If we optimize the number of SpyTag or SpyCatcher modules per protein monomer, as well as the working concentrations of proteins, we may make protein-3D printing using the Spy Crosslinking Network come true.

Queens_Canada,2015,Team:Queens Canada#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,": 1AME) is a moderately active antifreeze protein from the ocean pout, with a small (7Kb), globular structure. The E-coil refers to the coiled-coil with glutamic acid residues in the 'e' and 'g' positions of the helical wheel first used by Team Calgary 2013 ( BBa_K1189011 ). There is a His-tag at the C-terminus of the E-coil which provides an alternative purification method to ice-affinity.
Why: The fusion of the E-coil to the Type III AFP will enable non-covalent, yet high affinity, specific attachment of AFPs to our protein scaffold and K-coil BioBrick (BBa_K1831002, see below). The interaction between the E- and K-coils involved oppositely charged residues, promoting the heterodimeric interaction of the coils that links AFPs to our scaffold. The addition of a His-tag to the C-terminus of the coil will allow for simple purification of the protein even for teams without access to an ice-affinity purification apparatus.
BBa_K1831002
T3-10 Scaffold with K-coiled-coil + His tag
What: A single subunit of the T3-10 self-assembling protein scaffold (Baker 2008) is fused in-frame to the K-coil from Team Calgary 2013’s parallel coiled-coil proteins ( BBa_K1189010 ). The 'K' denotes the charged lysine residues in the ‘e’ and ‘g’ positions of the helical wheel representation of the coils. A His-tag fused to the C-terminus of the coils allows quick purification. A flexible linker Gly-Ser between the K-coil and the His-tag prevents potential electrostatic interference between the two domains.
Why: This fusion of the K-coil to each individual subunit means that once assembled into a multimer, multiple proteins with a complimentary E-coil domain (such as our Type III AFPs: BBa_K1831001, BBa_K1831003) can be non-covalently attached to the scaffold. By adding a flexible linker of Gly-Ser we incorporated a unique BamHI restriction site. This acts as a diagnostic marker for simplified cloning of our BioBrick into the expression vector of your choosing.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#Phage Purification#Winterexp#Period1#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html,", DNAse I and RNAse A (Roche, Germany) were added to degrade released bacterial nucleic acids. T7 phage nanoparticles were precipitated from the culture supernatant by addition of 1 M NaCl and 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000, Merck) followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. The T7 phage pellet was resuspended in Tris-NaCl buffer (PH 8) and PEG and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. To remove residual PEG and debris, an equal volume of chloroform was added, gently inverted and the top aqueous phase was harvested after low-speed centrifugation at 4°C. The purified T7 nanoparticles were sterilized using a pyrogen-free 0.2 µm pore-size cellulose acetate filter (Millipore) and stored at 4°C until further analysis.
Removal of Bacterial Endotoxin from T7 Phage Nanoparticles
The bacterial endotoxin (LPS) concentration in all T7 nanoparticle preparations was determined in triplicate using a sensitive colorimetric Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) QCL-1000® kit (Lonza, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LPS was removed from T7 phage nanoparticles based on a method for removal of endotoxin from protein solutions by phase separation using Triton X-114 as described by Aida et al. [22] and modified by Hashemi et al. (manuscript submitted for publication).
Genes of T7: http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism%3a10760+keyword%3a1185&offset=25 Thus phage T7 has an icosahedral shape with an edge of 37.7±0.5nm, a volume  of (120±10)x103nm3, and a small tail that is 6-7% of  the head volume.

Persoonlijk denk ik dat opdelen per projectfunctie het handigst is - per deel kan je dan nog aangeven wie wat heeft gedaan. Het opmaken van een dagplanning lijkt me meer iets dat je per subteam op papier doet. Verloop van de experimenten, evaluatie van de experimenten en opmerkingen zoals jullie hierboven aangeven wordt dan per projectfuntie weergegeven. Ik vermoed dat jullie bij projectfunctie ook bedoelen per subproject? Een opdeling per team heeft inderdaad veel kans een warboel te worden.

None of the sterilized plates showed any growth, while the non sterilized plate did yield colonies.
Now it was shown that the E. coli cells are not viable after UV sterilization, we also wanted to see the influence of UV sterilization on the physical properties of the polysilicate layer. Since the polysilicate layer already ensured unviability of the cells, UV sterilization could be seen as an extra safety precaution to compline to current synthetic biology safety regulations. For this, we have UV sterilized E coli cells transformed with OmpA-silicatein, using 120000 µJ for 3 minutes and these were subsequently imaged with SEM (figure 2).
Figure 2:E. coli BL21 cells transformed with OmpA-silicatein, provided with silicic acid and were UV sterilized and subsequently imaged by with SEM.
As shown in figure 2, the with silicate capturing of the cells remain undamaged after UV sterilization and could be used as biolenses now.
Discussion
In this experiment, different methods to sterilize our biolenses were tested, as we wanted to be able to put our biological microlenses in real-world conditions. For this, we have both autoclaved and UV sterilized our cells. From the growth study, it can be concluded that the biolenses were successfully sterilized by UV sterilization. Besides that, the shape of the biolenses was not affected by UV sterilization as opposed to autoclaving.

Absorbance spectroscopy of our biolenses
Introduction
One of the most common and useful methods of characterization of optical materials is done by spectroscopy. Using spectroscopy we can measure how much light can be transmitted through materials. The device used for those measurements is called spectrometer because it scans the electromagnetic spectrum and detects how much of the initial radiation passes through the materials, which are in our case our samples. For those measurements samples are loaded on glass plates and dried overnight, forming a solid material, then a beam of light is shined through it.                                              The machine measures which percentage of the light is absorbed by the sample. If we want to use our polysilicate-covered cells in an optical device or on a solar cell it is important to know whether the bacteria absorb light. If they do, they will significantly decrease the efficiency of the solar cells or optical device. Since our goal is to capture more light, we need to make sure that the cells do not block any light.
