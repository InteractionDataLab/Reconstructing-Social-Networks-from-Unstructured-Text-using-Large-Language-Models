 INTERLAB
Overview
This is the third edition of iGEM for Université catholique de Louvain team and for the second time in a row we decided to take part in the InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.           The InterLab is an essential part of the iGEM competition and is an interesting challenge for our team. We estimate that this experience will allow us to increase our awareness about scientific reproducibility. The reproducibility allows           to           determine the trustworthiness of the results of the same experience carried out in different conditions (different laboratories, equipment, operators). Therefore, iGEM is the perfect opportunity to test the reproducibility of a protocol.           Since           we are more than 300 teams from all over the world, we namely represent this concept of “different conditions” in terms of places, equipment and operators.
Moreover, we used this experience to “train” the members of our team which had little experience of laboratory work. Even if they were well supervised, this resulted in some manipulation mistakes. Thanks to this experience we became more           familiar with the laboratory activities before focusing completely on our own project. In spite of not being directly related to our project, the InterLab allowed us to further develop our skills and to acquire a precise and reliable working
The Team
Those are the team members which took care of the interlab. As you can see, we could all be top-models. Fun fact: Antoine (in the middle) cut his hair for the occasion.
All three boys (Luca -left-, Antoine -you already know him- and Mathieu -right-) took care of the cell measurement protocol.           Meanwhile, Nina (left) and Fiona (right) took care of all the rest.

Quorum­sensing  signaling molecules  can be detected from  cell free  supernatants, extracts of   food samples, and spent culture supernatants of bacteria isolated from food products (Ammor   and others 2008).The use of bacterial biosensors has made the detection and quantification of   different  types  of  these  signals  like AHLs  easier,  economical,  and  faster. An AHL  biosensors   contain  a  functional  LuxR  family  protein  cloned  with  a  cognate  target  promoter  (usually  the   promoter of the cognate luxI synthase), which up regulates the expression of a reporter gene   encoding for a phenotypic response only in the presence of exogenous AHLs, as they do not   produce the signaling molecules but only possess their cognate receptors. Affirmative  action  using  quorum  sensing  inhibitors  can  be  taken  in  food  preservation  also.   Quorum­sensing  inhibitors  are  typically  analogues  of  the  AHLs,  or  compounds  that  degrade   AHLs. A promising group of quorum­sensing inhibitors is the halogenated furanones produced  by the Australian red alga, Delisea pulchra (Givskov and others 1996). The initial  cytotoxicity   and  chemically  unstable  nature  of  these  inhibitors  has  prompted  the  screening  of  nontoxic   quorum­sensing inhibitors from natural sources. Plants used in traditional medicine are one of   the most promising areas in the  search for new biologically active  compounds. In a  study by   Vattem  and  others  (2007),  dietary  phytochemicals  from  plants  known  to  have  several  health   benefits  and  antimicrobial  activity,  exhibited  quorum­sensing  inhibitory  activity  at  sub  lethal   concentrations. Vanilla,  a  widely used  spice  and  flavor,  can  inhibit  bacterial  quorum  sensing.   Quorum­sensing  inhibitors  may  prevent  colonization  of  food  surfaces,  toxin  formation,  and   proliferation of food­related bacteria. The natural occurrence of quorum­sensing inhibitors is an   important consideration for the"

Outreach Summary
Alyssa had a productive meeting with Kristin Cosby, a teacher from Jamestown High School. We will be working with a group of science teachers on August 31st. We had the first event for our Bioengineering Speaker Series. Professor Schniepp gave his talk and people seemed to enjoy the interdisciplinary nature of it. On Friday, we spoke with students from Plus S and answered questions about majors, iGEM, and research.
Week 8 (July 17 - July 23)
Wetlab Summary
Callan did Gibsons for WM17_386 (pLac0-1 mfLon + J23107 LacI). Christine miniprepped sfGFP pdt + pBad mf-Lon parts. Looking at analysis from the flow cytometry (FACS) run for J23100 sfGFP pdt parts, we are indeed seeing growth effect problems, and that's having an impact on fluorescence. We have working pTet pdts. We're geneblocking pLac mf-Lon.
Outreach Summary
We held the second event for our Bioengineering Speaker Series. About 30 people attended. We also have a potential collaboration going with Senator Monty Mason. He wants to help us with outreach and invited us to a meeting. On Wednesday, we had a great time with two groups of rising 8th graders (16 students in each group). We did 2.5 hour lessons that incorporated strawberry DNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, and RFP streak. On Saturday, we did a presentation for Focusing on the Future, which was a career fair of sorts for the campers.
Week 9 (July 24 - July 30)
Wetlab Summary
This week, we ran induction curves on J23100 pBad parts with pdts to try to get confirmation of functionality as well as to determine optimal concentrations. We also ran induction curves on working pTet combo parts but found fluorescence values to differ largely among constructs (could be attributed to bad luck with inoculating things.) We tried to run another time course to see if the time to steady state changes when a pdt + mf-Lon is added, but having weird issues with the FACS clogging--hopefully this can be solved by next week.
Outreach Summary
We held the third event for our Bioengineering Speaker Series. Dr. Puzey gave a fascinating presentation on how plants can have applications to bioengineering. Dr. Saha prepared delicious ""plant-based, mind-altering"""

HAFS MINI FORUM
Our project aimed to find a solution in environmental issues, particularly focusing on plastic wastes. The solution we were able to find was “mealworms”. By figuring out a mechanism that enables mealworms to degrade not only Styrofoam but also PET, we progressed our project, focusing on environmental issues with different public engagements. Through different means of approaching the public, such as campaigns, fundings, lectures and et cetera, we stressed the importance of acknowledging such problems and our project itself.
NEWSPAPER
“La Sociedad Espanola de Honor de HAFS' article”
On Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies’ official Spanish News website, one of our members posted an article about the mealworms’ digestion mechanism and the potential effect on Earth. The news website is highly accessible which allowed people from other parts of the world, including the Hispanics, could also get informed about the bio-degradability of mealworms. Also, the newspaper is printed and distributed to Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies making the information more accessible to the students in our school.
HARBINGER INTERVIEW
HAFS (HANKUK ACADEMY OF FOREIGN STUDIES) English newspaper club, Harbinger, interviewed Koreasonyeodul on October 3, 2016. They asked general questions about the competition and asked about any difficulties we encountered. The newspaper with the interview will be printed and distributed in October 15, 2016 with our team’s picture in it. Following is the link to the online website of Harbinger.
EDUCATION
Children are becoming the leading members of the society in the future, thus our team felt the necessity of alarming the students about the negative impact of plastic on environment and the solution to the problem: mealworms. Our team requested an educational institute for the gifted in Hankuk University of Foreign Studies to give a lecture to the students about the deleteriousness of plastic and the bacteria. As a result, about twenty students participated in the lecture in September 3rd. Two of our team members made the lecture, mainly introducing the mechanism of mealworm decomposing plastic. We showed and explained"

Alberta,2009,Team:Alberta#MedalRequirements_-_-_TEXT.html," grouping common pathway components and components with similar levels of expression. This degree of organism control would be a milestone marking synthetic biology as a mature field. The Biobytes method of gene assembly allows us to efficiently test, optimize and correct genome scale design principles.
There are currently two alternatives for gene assembly. The first, BioBricks, is modular but slow. The second, the use of unique long sticky ends for each piece, is fast but non-modular.
BioBytes is the only method that is fast, modular, sequential and in vitro:
Fast: The addition of each DNA segment takes only 20min, a roughly 200-fold increase in speed from traditional cloning. Moreover, we’ve demonstrated that the Biobytes method is automatable and can be performed on microfluidic chips.
Modular: Our method allows standard parts such as the backbone plasmids and USER primers to be reused, greatly reducing expenses for large scale projects. Once parts are in pAB or pBA, they can be rapidly assembled in any order, allowing easy testing of alternative designs.
Sequential: Biobytes allows tight control over the order of gene assembly. New DNA segments can add only to the unanchored end, and in only one orientation. Moreover, using two different sets of complementary ends prevents concatamerization of parts before assembly.
In vitro: Using an organism as an intermediate is time-consuming and limits one’s ability to control and assess the changes being made. For this reason, an in vitro method such as Biobytes is essential. Genome-sized constructs can be transformed into an organism after construction is complete.
Overall, the BioBytes method gives synthetic biology the tools to understand and organize complexity, standardize  robust parts, use modular strategies and rapidly test rational designs and computational models. With BioBytes we can start asking the most fundamental questions: to what extent do the rules of engineering hold true for biology? To what degree does life equal the sum of its parts?

Taking Shi’s suggestions, we justified the rationality of simulation by using Rosetta， and, at the same time, considered the spontaneous rotation problem happened on TC\PC chain of cell membrane. Furthermore, he also advised us to compare the STEP system with current CAR-T therapy in the background in order to highlight our originality.
Haotian Guo Judge PhD student in The Center for Research and Interdisplinarity Leader of 2013 Fudan iGEM Team
How to present the result of our project clearly? We invited Guo, who has led the Chinese and French teams to participate in iGEM several times and has rich experience in the competition. In his opinion, the basic assumptions of our dry experiment could be refined, so we further considered the reaction mechanism of STEP system completely in the model, and improved the integrity and authenticity of the model. In addition, he suggested that we should use more intuitive images as a result when introducing projects to the outside world, so that people without professional knowledge can understand meanings. Therefore, while making statistical explanation of the data, we also directly showed the molecular structure diagram to make intuitive comparison.
4. Ethic and Law
Dr. Jie Yin Associate Professor, School of Philosophy Fudan University
How ethical issues are involved in cellular immunotherapy? In China, no medical institution has received clinical application approval for tumor immunotherapy as there exists major ethical issues. As a result, we are very curious about what ethical issues are involved in our research and how to make our research more ethical. Dr. Yin, who graduated from Shanghai medical university, transfer to philosophy after graduation as a clinical undergraduate. She majored in medical philosophy and Kantian philosophy. Her dual degrees in medicine and ethics, therefore, greatly helped us in the field of research ethics and clinical ethics. She highlighted that unlike the embryonic ethical issue facing stem cell therapy, safety is the major ethical controversies facing our STEP system. Tumor immunotherapy is expensive, it can also have serious side effects and fatality. She stressed that among the four principles of bioethics, the principle of no harm is pivotal. It is crucial for us to consider how the technology and drugs that are still under clinical trials can protect the rights and interests of the subjects. Therefore, we tried to solve the problem of cytokine storm through the cooperation between wet lab and dry lab in subsequent experiments, thereby making our platform more secure. Dr. Yin also introduced the history, composition and approval process of the Chinese Hospital Ethics Committee to us. When we talk about the current ethical situation in China"

AHL modulates the motility of                         both cell types A and B, but in opposite ways. High concentrations of AHL will                         render cell type A unable to swim but will activate cell type B’s motility.                         Conversely, low concentrations of AHL causes swimming of cell type A and                         incessant tumbling (thus immobility) of cell type B. Lastly, cells A express the                         adhesin membrane protein, which causes them to stick to each other. Simply said,                         our system should produce spots of immobile, sticky groups of A type cells,                         surrounded by rings of B type cells. Any cell that finds itself outside of the                         region that it should be in, is able to swim to their correct place and becomes                         immobile there. More details can be found in the research section .
Partial Differential Equations
As discussed in the previous paragraph, our hybrid model incorporates chemical                         species using PDEs. In our system these are AHL and leucine. The diffusion of                         AHL and leucine can be described by the heat equation (1).
$$\frac{\partial C(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}=D \cdot \nabla^2 C(\vec{r},t) \;\;\;       \text{(1)}$$
By using (1)                         we assume that the diffusion speed is isotropic, i.e. the same in all spatial                         directions. This also explains why it is called the heat equation, since heat                         diffuses equally fast in all directions. A detailed explanation of the heat                         equation can be found in box 1. The second factor that needs be taken into                         account is the production of AHL and leucine by type A bacteria. In principle,                         AHL and leucine production is dependent on the dynamically-evolving internal                         states of all cells of type A. However, for our hybrid model we ignored the                         inner life of all bacteria and instead assumed that AHL and leucine production                         is directly proportional to the density of A type cells (2).
$$  \frac{\partial C(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}=\alpha \cdot \rho_A(\vec{r},t)                         \;\;\; \text{(2)}$$
In the last                         paragraph we will reconsider this assumption and assign each cell an internal       model. Finally, AHL and leucine are organic molecules and therefore they will       degrade over time.                          We assume first-order"

FEEDBACK
To further ensure Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells will survive under a                     high level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) automatically, we made a series of                     genetic transformation, which will be shown as follow.
Promoter screening
Overview
Overview                         As it was showed in the project, we needed to find a proper strong promoter to turn on the                         expression of dCas9, so we designed experiments as follow.
Specific Method
As Yap1 protein has over 70 downstream genes, we need to choose some gene                         that has known strength. Reports show that the downstream gene of Yap1 protein's mRNA level                         changes with and without H2O2. [1] Because we have no idea of                         the exact strength of these promoters, we chose both strong promoters and weak ones in this                         result and compared them with promoters that we have already known their strength. We tested                         downstream genes of Yap1 whose names were: ctt1, glr1, trx2, trr1, tsa1, sod2, gsh1, and gsh2, together with strong promoter gal1p and weak promoter msy1p. We                         obtained these promoters through PCR, and we ligated these promoters with GFP gene to                         express GFP protein and test their strength through fluorescence intensity. This is the                         first step to screen the proper promoter.
Construction of dCas9-sgRNA plasmid
Overview
After confirming the proper promoter, we started to construct the plasmid                         contains dCas9 expression cassette and the sgRNA one.
Specific methods
After obtaining the promoter strength, we started to construct the                         dCas9-sgRNA plasmid. To avoid bringing the yeast too much living stress (every plasmid will                         bring living stress to the yeast), we decided to construct the dCas9 and sgRNA gene together"

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Modeling#Population_-_-_TEXT.html," that we ran it on began to slow down dramatically.
Newcastle's School of Computing Science Integrative Bioinformatics Research Group has developed a software system for grid computing applications in the scientific field, called Microbase .  The Microbase project is a grid-based system that uses web-service-based technologies to integrate distributed components and ensure that they interoperate.[3] Funded by the BBSRC and the DTI, Microbase has been used in Microbial Genome Comparison and Analysis.[1] Microbase works by splitting a task into a number of 'Jobs' and managing how these Jobs are run on grid-based systems.[2]
Keith Flanagan, a Researcher at Newcastle University and member of the Microbase Project, suggested that Microbase could aid us in the development of a distributed version of our bacterial population simulation. Using Microbase meant that almost all of the programming concerned with the smooth running of our modelling was simple to carry out, and we were easily able to convert our single machine program to a distributed one.
Using Microbase we are running our simulation on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, a service provided by the e-commerce company Amazon.com, which gives users access to a large number of powerful machines. The development of Microbase for use on Amazon's web services has been a part of the Microbase project to provide further processing capacity.[4] Prior to running our simulations using Amazon's computers, we tested our program using some of the machines in some of the University's computer clusters.
Code
Advice about the code for our population simulation model is available on request. Please the model requires specific libraries, database setup and Microbase setup, etc to build and run correctly. Please email Morgan Taschuk , one of our advisors, and visit the Microbase homepage for more information.
The Java source code for our model is available here:

Results
This is an example graph created using some of the output from a small run of the population model, with a maximum of 27 cells of bacteria.
The results from various runs of our population simulation have been fed back into the development of other parts of our project, namely tuning sporulation. We have used the outputs to more closely determine how much of the population we can allow to become non-germinating metal sequestering spores.
Visualisation
Alongside the actual simulation we are developing an application to visualise the output of our simulation in a three dimensional environment.

Week 22: September 23 - September 27
This week we successfully converted our own recombinant ferritin ( Part:BBa_K1189018 and Part:BBa_K1189021 ) to have the Prussian blue surface modification. This is an important moment as it signals that we can now begin applying what we learned from characterizing commercial Prussian blue ferritin to the constructs that we built during the summer. We are excited to use the data we will gather from this protein to further develop our system. Our homemade Prussian blue ferritin was tested with the substrate TMB to confirm that our own Prussian blue ferritin has catalytic activity (Figure 7).
Figure 8. Measurements of the coloured substrate TMB (10 mg/mL) at 650 nm over a 600 second time period for our own Prussian blue ferritin and unmodified ferritin. Sample volume was 242 µL. Controls for this experiment include bovine serum albumin (1 mg/mL)and the substrate solution by itself.  Due to limitations on the protein available only one replicate was performed. Zero time points do not have low absorbance as colour change was rapid and began before measurements started.

In order to demonstrate that we can successfully capture target DNA with two TALEs we did a capture TALE assay. TALE B was incubated with DNA containing target sites for TALE A and TALE B and blotted on nitrocellulose. After blocking and washing, TALE A β-lactamase fusion ( BBa_K1189031 ) was added to the nitrocellulose strips. The strips were transferred into a 96 well plate to which a benzylpenicillin substrate solution with phenol red was added. If the TALE A β-lactamase fusion bound to the target site for TALE A then the solution will change colour from pink to clear. If TALE A β-lactamase fusion   was not present, the solution will remain pink.  We can show that the first four samples which have TALE B with DNA for TALE A and TALE B show a colour change indicating that we are successfully capturing the target DNA and reporting it. Furthermore we can also show that when we add non-specific DNA we do not see a colour change demonstrating that we can successfully capture only specific DNA"

From 3D printer to a Biological System
Overview
The Biolinker - a DIY biofilm printer
We built a functional prototype of a 3D printer, our Biolinker,  from cheap DIY open source parts, which is capable of bioprinting bacteria in shapes based on lines and circles. The bioink is made out of our engineered bacterial cells, which we successfully immobilized into an alginate hydrogel. With this bioink we can print lines with a resolution (thickness) of down to 1 mm. We were able to successfully print and image of up to 4 layers"

The filter was then changed to a different flask, and chloroform was added to the filter to bring the plastic through. The contents of the flask were poured into a glass petri dish and the chloroform was allowed to evaporate, leaving a plastic sheet at the bottom of the petri dish.
Using Nile Red to Quantify Plastic Production. We stained cultures that had been growing for three days with Nile red to measure fluorescence. The final data is from three devices, and five cultures of each device. The devices were the panK plus phaCAB operon, just the phaCAB operon, and a negative control that contained the gene for LuxL (no plastic production). Our staining protocol was adapted from Kelwick et al. [10]. An 80 ug/mL Nile red stock solution was prepared in DMSO. 1mL samples of cell culture were centrifuged at 8,000RPM at room temperature for five minutes and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were re-suspended in 1mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and then centrifuged again at 8,000RPM for five minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were re-suspended in .5mL 35% (v/v) ethanol and rocked at room temperature for 15 minutes to fix the cells. These cultures were then centrifuged at 8,000RPM for five minutes at room temperature once more, and the supernatant was poured out and the remaining ethanol was pipetted out. 930mL of PBS and 70uL of the Nile red stock solution were added to the tubes, and the pellets were re-suspended and then rocked on ice for one hour. Once Nile red is added, exposure to light should be minimized. For the flow cytometry experiment, the samples were diluted 1:100 in PBS. For the plate reader experiments, the samples were diluted 1:10 in PBS. The OD600 was measured first, and then the fluorescence was measured. The cells were excited at 535nm and the emission was measured at 605nm, with a cut-off at 590nm. The relative fluorescent units (RFU) of each well were divided by the OD600, to standardize the final data.

Nonetheless everything in the scope of the iGEM competition falls under the Creative Commons (CC) attribution license 4.0, which is the most permissive license. Consequently, when we’ll have evolved enough to create a startup, we will add another protection to our logo: a trademark. This last attribute would be considered as our best achievement. In fact, it is the one that represents best the entrepreneurial aspect of our project. It will be a way to recognize aether through communication and to emphasize the value of our work. This trademark will become a distinctive sign for our future customers. Thus, it's truly important when developing our product and to enter the market.
The third iGEM Parisian Meetup
We decided to host an event where French teams could have the opportunity to present their projects in front of a public and jury, just like at the giant jamboree! The goal of this meeting was to: 1) place the teams in competition-like conditions; 2) socialize with the French teams and have a great time and 3) work together and consider the post-iGEM life from an entrepreneurship point of view. Indeed, the theme of our meetup was: what can I do after iGEM? With this perspective in mind, we organized round tables on entrepreneurship in biotech, open science and organized a pitch contest with experts, such as Lorenzo Croati of the Pitch School. Almost all the French teams took part in the meetup. We thank Bordeaux, Evry_Paris-Saclay, INSA-UPS_France, IONIS-Paris, Paris_Bettencourt and UPMC_Paris, for taking part in this event.
Conclusion
To conclude, we want to go beyond the iGEM competition with aether. To this end, we have taken many steps to assess the need of the public, quantify the demand for our device, and prove the usefulness of the services we would offer. Intellectual property was also one of our main concern during the past ten months. And finally we pushed other French teams to have the same entrepreneurial spirit by organizing the 3rd iGEM Parisian Meetup that was centered on the theme : what can I do after iGEM ?

SZU-China,2017,Team:SZU-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"’t think so. There are more and more outstanding new materials being invented. But none of them can take the place of concrete. Because concrete is common and cheap. And sometimes what we need is the volume. For example, when we are building a dam. We need large amount of concrete to add up to a certain volume. Nothing else is better than concrete in this kind of situation. So I don’t think it can be replaced.
Investigate the longest Bridge in the world
We came to investigate the longest grand bridge - Honkong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and interview the chief engineers there.
Professor XIANFENG WANG:
Main research area: Self-healing concrete material. Durability of civil engineering materials. Etc.
Member of JSCE; RILEM; IALCCE.
The key questions of the interview is presented as following:
Q1: How tough is it to build the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO Bridge?
A1: There is not a specific level to evaluate it. But the difficulty is highly depending on the environment. The construction environment for HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE is pretty harsh. It is in open seas beyond the coast. The ocean environment and geology is pretty complicated. What’s more, the area is our country’s protection zone for White Dolphin. And the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE is consist of different constructions-bridges, subbottom tunnel, man-made island etc. So I’d say it’s one of the hardest.
Q2: What is the critical key to prolong the life of the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE?
A2:  HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE is mainly consisting of steel reinforced concrete. Steel is something that we are familiar with. There are a lot of previous case proved great uses of steel which can last 200 years. But concrete on the other hand, is a new born material compared to steel. It is less than a hundred years not to mention the years it’s being put into use of great constructions. Thus enhancing the life of concrete is the critical key to prolong the life of the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE. The cracks are the biggest threats to concrete. So what we should do is to prevent and fix the cracks.
Q3: After the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE been put into use what measure will be taken to fix the cracks?

The system our countrymen asked us to model was a three element positive feedback loop. They expected us to find an oscillatory  behaviour in time between the concentration of the three substances.

Positive Feedback
Kind of Repressilator system
We proposed a linear model thinking in a first approach to solve the problem. For each of the rate of change of the concentration in time there is a dependance with the substance itself and with one of the other substances. These dependances are cyclic.

Additionally, I am also an undergraduate research associate in the Kosuri Lab at UCLA studying GPCR-ligand interactions and developing a multiplex assay to deorphanize the entirety of the human and mouse olfactory receptor repertoire. I believe synthetic biology holds infinite power and potential to revolutionize science, and is the perfect outlet for innovative scientific minds. Long term, I plan on pursuing a MD and entering the field of gastroenterological surgery. When I'm not stuck working in a TC hood, I'm an avid reader and enjoy working with animals.
Alan Chen | Junior | Neuroscience
​I am a junior undergraduate just joining iGEM this year and am currently majoring in Neuroscience at UCLA. I have always been interested in synthetic biology and find it fascinating to reprogram existing biological systems. Currently I am working with a group to create a bacterial toxin delivery system.
Amy Guo | Sophomore | Bioengineering
I am currently a sophomore bioengineering student. My interests include botany, particularly plant-herbivore interactions and plant-to-plant communication pathways, and diatoms. Synthetic biology I feel is best described as a pair of much-needed, high-prescription glasses-- your perception of the world around you becomes wonderfully magnified and crisp, and suddenly you are able to view the mechanics of living organisms as an infinite library of blueprints at your disposal.
Omar Ebrahim | Sophomore | Biochemistry
Innovation has never been the product of book smarts alone. For an idea to bear fruit, I believe one has to tinker with it. Unfortunately, much of a biologist's education consists of almost exclusively memorization and recitation of facts. However, synthetic biology is somewhat of an anomaly because it embodies the practice of picking something apart and manipulating it's core components as its standard methodology. I guess that's why I am here.
Andrew Liu | Junior | Biochemistry
I am a 3rd year biochemistry major here at UCLA, and it is my first year on the iGEM team. I love everything science and so the interdisciplinary and undergraduate guided research in iGEM is an incredibly enjoyable experience"

CHAN Horace Ho Laam (BSc III),
two years of undergraduate studies in Biotechnology has made Horace fairly adapt at rote learning and memorisation. Not satisfied and looking to appreciate the biosciences to a greater extent, he sees iGEM as a great opportunity to apply what he learnt, to acquire some lab and teamwork skills, to develop a 'scientific mind', to gain insight into synthetic biology, to have some fun and to skip classes so he can (hopefully) pay a visit to MIT and meet some great people across the globe.

In addition, we have added an AntiMicrobial peptide to insure that all bacteria and infection that is potentially in the wound is sterilized. We have deployed the AMP LL-37 which punctures the outer membrane of bacterial cells causing their organelles to become exposed, ending in the cells dying. We have paired the AMP with a thrombin cleavage site that when introduced to the venom serine protease Cerastotin from our original construct, will cut the AMP that is bound to Factor XIIIa at the thrombin site, and at that moment become a functional protein that sterilizes the wound."

The parts that are associated with the project this year are at the same level of risk as the any of the regular parts that already exist. All parts are constructed in an antibiotic containing backbone so that accidental release of will pose minimal risk to contaminating other bacterial populations.
2.Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
a.Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they? The University of Waterloo had a Bio-Safety plan in place to ensure the proper use to bio-hazardous materials in teaching and research at the university. A more detailed overview of their plans is outlined at the Bio-Safety Website
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? The laboratories operating at the University of Waterloo have obtained permits from the Bio-Safety Committee in order to perform intended research. Since the Waterloo iGEM team performs all laboratory work in a parent lab under the guidance of the Masters and PhD students of that lab, the projects carried out in the lab are covered by the permits obtained by the parent lab.
c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training. All lab volunteers are required to take an online training to familiarize themselves with the Biosafety practices of the University of Waterloo. The training is followed up by a quiz ensuring proper understanding of the material. Upon completion of the training and quiz a hands- on lab training is provided under supervision of the parent lab’s PhD student. The hands-on training involves instruction of use of the appropriate equipment that is used in the lab, as well as how to maintain and discard materials in a safe manner.
d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, provide a link to them online if possible. Canada operates under the guidelines set up by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Agency is the national authority on matters concerning biosafety and biosecurity. Risks to the public are reduced by standardizing controls over activities that involve human pathogenic agents, domestic or imported. While these guidelines are in place the current iGEM project does not involve work with any agents or materials that may pose a risk to humans. The link to the Public Health Agency of Canada is provided below: Public Health Agency of Canada

NTU_SINGAPORE,2017,Team:NTU SINGAPORE#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," NUS, we noted their experience with well characterized bacterial plasmids. Thus, it was suggested that we leverage on their plasmid assets to test the CRISPRi potential of our truncated dCas9 in bacteria.
In bacterial CRISPRi, dCas9 is targeted to -35 or -10 of promoter to block RNA polymerase binding, or to the non-template strand of the gene to block RNA polymerase transcription from proceeding. Transcription is blocked, resulting in expression interference. Once again, dCas9 affinity is studied, since strong affinity is required for effective binding and blocking. We hypothesize that truncated dCas9 would have decreased binding, and hence poorer interference of gene expression. In both NUS and our CRISPRi constructs, the target is GFP reporter gene.
NUS provided 2 plasmids, a gRNA expressing plasmid (NUS-gRNA) and a low copy plasmid expressing dCas9 and GFP to be interfered with (NUS-dCas9-GFP). The gRNA targets -10 of the GFP promoter. These plasmids has previously been shown to work by the NUS lab’s pHD student. dCas9 expression is inducible with tetracycline. We performed Gibson assembly to move our truncated dCas9-VPR onto the NUS-dCas9-GFP plasmid, and subsequently carried out the CRISPRi experiments.
The results in this experiment is different from that of our CRISPRi against endogenous genes – here, interference data more closely correlate to our gene activation data. WT and ∆HNH provides robust downregulation of genes, ∆REC3 provides intermediate while ∆3ple provide poor downregulation. Once again, similar to our mammalian model results, ∆3ple ∆R1-1 ∆R1-3 exhibits no downregulation.
Such a result is to be expected: in this experiment, only the gRNA was induced. The dCas9 is under a strict tetracycline inducible promoter, and without tetracycline, expression level is likely to be very low. The low amount of dCas9 available for CRISPRi would mean strong binding affinity is especially more important. Indeed, preliminary tests performed with tetracycline induction alone appears to results in better CRISPRi activity for poor performers, likely due to abundance of dCas9 for CRISPRi.
Not only that: the GFP gene in this case is on a p15A origin plasmid. Literature suggests that there"

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Tianjin University. He told us that the study of heavy   metal removal from groundwater was a very important subject that still needed to be   studied. It was of great value to use micro-organisms in heavy metal removal. So we   decided to focus our project on heavy metal treatments and on treatments of cadmium   and copper due severity of pollution. Then, we learned that recently the heavy   metal deposition research center in Hunan had made a great breakthrough. So we held   a telephone conference to communicate with their technical teacher. During the   conference, we asked the current situation about heavy metal pollution, and consulted   their approach to chromium ions sedimentation. That was turning high-valent chromium   into low-valent chromium to reduce toxicity. This inspired us to think about if   there was any better way to completely settle the chrome ions from the water.
Searching the source of pollution: Zhongtiao Mountain Heavy Mental Factory, electric drill   factory
Because our experiment needed to base on the actual problem in our life, in the beginning, we left school for Zhongtiao Mountain Heavy Mental Factory  factory in Shanxi Province and   electric drill factory in Henan Province.
Before we went to the drill factory, we turned to the EPA of Shanxi province for help. We had a teleconference at first, they showed their interests in us and gave us a chance to talk face to face. With excitement, we went to the EPA of Shanxi province and after they talked to us, they offered to send a director to accompany us. It's actually a really amazing reponse of EPA.
The Zhongtiao Mountain Heavy Mental Factory mainly produced waste water that contained copper and cadmium ions while the   electric drill factory mainly produced cadmium and nickel ions. The staff there told us, the reason why factories and EPA usually didn't use yeasts for water treatment was mainly about treatment efficiency. Pollution sources usually contained more than one kind of heavy metal ions, a single species couldn't absorb a variety of metal ions, mixed yeasts needed stricter conditions. It also cost too much.If they were going to use yeasts, then it must create high economic benefit, and it would be better to recycle heavy metal ions. They also pointed out that nowadays nearly 90% of the treatment was through  chemical methods. And most of the time, in order to   deal with that two kinds of heavy metals, some factories tended to use simple and   quick ways which could be harmful to the environment.

Figure 1: Production of multiprotein complexes with Peptidosomes. Depicted are two different strains of B. subtilis each producing a distinct protein of interest, that is either fused with SpyTag or mini. SpyCatcher. After diffusion into the medium outside of the Peptidosomes, a covalent bonding of the proteins is mediated.
To ensure the assembly of proteins outside of the Peptidosomes we further characterized the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. Theses functional units can be attached to any protein of interest and upon secretion will result in a covalent isopeptide bond between the SpyTag/SpyCatcher partners. [2] The system originates from Streptococcus pyogenes and still remains under constant developments. [4]
To demonstrate the applicability of both tags we fused them to a green (sfGFP) and a red (mCherry) fluorescent protein, enabling an easy detectable output. (For more details please check our Design section) Since a core part of this project involves secretion, we included a signal peptide in front of all our constructs. (click here to learn more about our Signal Peptide Toolbox).
To evaluate the efficiency of the secretion process we monitored the fluorescence in supernatants harvested from B. subtilis strains carrying our constructs and compared them to supernatants obtained from the wild type. In order to prove the functionality of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system we co-incubated supernatants derived from different strains and performed a SDS-Page where we could demonstrate the formation of a fusion protein.
Design
All of the composite parts necessary for the genetic constructs were equipped with the RFC 25 standard, cloned into pSB1C3 backbone and submitted to the registry. All cloning was done according to standard protocols and the plasmids were stored in Escherichia coli DH10β. All constructs were verified by sequencing.
The gene encoding the mini. SpyCatcher ( BBa_K2273015 ) was chemically synthesized. The codon optimized SpyTag ( BBa_K2273014 ) was generated via overlapping primers iG17P049 and G17P050 and amplified using the primers TM4487 and iG17P039. We used a sfGFP ( BBa_K2273033 ) that was codon optimized for Streptococcus pneumoniae, which has been demonstrated to work best in Bac"

In order to improve on this method, we would require proteins from tardigrades (also known as water bears). Tardigrades can survive under very extreme conditions, such as outer space. Their robustness is (partly) derived from the so-called tardigrade proteins, that protect cell(-structures) and proteins from dehydration and preserve protein activity after drying and rehydration. The western blotting idea was discarded because of practical limitations. Nevertheless, we saw the tardigrade proteins as a perfect opportunity to combine an antibiotic resistance detection system with microfluidics on paper, for which the drying of proteins would be necessary!
Cas13a in vesicles
Now that we were thinking about using Cas13a in combination with paper microfluidics, we wanted a method to make it easier for us to dry the protein on the paper. Additionally, we wanted to do this in such a way that the final product would be cell-free. Inspiration for the solution came from other iGEM teams, who had previously tried to produce vesicles and transport green fluorescent protein in these vesicles. Vesiculation would indeed be a solution to our problem, so it was added as an integral part of our project.

Validating project with stakeholders
Towards a value sensitive design
Summary
We started this course by mapping all factors relevant for our design. We included every possible factor that could in some way be influenced by our technology. The next step was to identify the most important stakeholders and their values. We came up with many values, some were colliding. During this course we had to analyse potential stakeholders and we came up with a value sensitive design. However, we found out that we still had a broad range of stakeholders, leading to many values that had to be integrated. After this course, we really started steering our project towards a more relevant application. We decided that we needed to narrow our scope in order to integrate values into our design. We interacted with many more stakeholders and set up a new value sensitive design. This course was good practice and a good starting point after which the real stakeholder interactions began.

Frequently Asked Question:
5.Do you seriously planning to let patients to take E.Coli into their bodies? Wouldn't it cause safety issues?
Yes, we plan to make our engineered  cells oral-taking. But don't worry, we have designed a safety way. We decide to encapsulate them in a microencapsulation. The material of the microencapsulation is a semipermeable membrane, allowing small molecules such as propionate to get out of the encapsulation while not allowing the bacteria to get out of it due to its bigger size. In the end, the bacteria will be excreted in the stool along with the microencapsulation. Now we can keep propionate coming out periodically and bacteria from contacting human intestine. Problem solved!

Market analysis
To the best of our knowledge, no method for gene doping detection is currently implemented by the world anti-doping agency for testing on real athlete samples. This does not mean the problem is new: the World anti-doping agency (WADA) banned gene doping already in 2003, and rumors, accusations and initial tests have been dotting the gene doping timeline (figure 1) since then.

2006: German Coach (Thomas Springstein) Suspected of Genetic Doping.
Thomas Springstein was a one-time coach of the German Athletics Association (DLV). He was convicted partly based on e-mail conversations, which were aquired by the police during a raid on his home. These e-mails brought up references to Repoxygen, a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia. Repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin (EPO), a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells, thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles. It was under preclinical development by Oxford Biomedica as a possible treatment for anaemia but was abandoned in 2003. ( Michael Reinsch, 28 January 2006 ).

In this documentary produced by ARD television, a Chinese doctor offers stem cell therapy to a reporter posing as an American swimming coach in return for $24,000, according to a translation provided by the ARD television. The documentary broadcast does not offer evidence that the hospital has provided gene doping to other athletes, but it does provide a shocking insight into the doping development scene ( NBC News 2008 ).

Linearized cloning vector: 0.02×5000 = 100 ng
0.5 kb insertion: 0.02×500 = 10 ng
1 kb insertion: 0.02×1000 = 20 ng
2 kb insertion: 0.02×2000 = 40 ng
Notice:
The mass of linearized cloning vector used should be between 50∼200 ng. Use 50 or 200 ng if the calculated mass is out of range.
The mass of insertions should be over 10 ng. Use 10 ng if the calculated mass is less.
When applied to recombination reaction without gel recovery, the total volume of unpurified DNA used should be less than 1/5 of that of recombination reaction, which is 4 μl.
After finishing setting up, gently pipette up and down several times with a pipettor to mix thoroughly and try to avoid the formation of bubbles. Incubate the reaction at 37oC for 30 min and immediately place it on ice for 5 min. Recombination product is now ready for transformation, or otherwise it can be stored at -20oC before transformation.
5. Transformation and plating
Add the entire recombination products to 200 μl of competent cells; flip the tube several times to mix it thoroughly and place the tube on ice for 30 min. Heat-shock the tube for 45∼90 sec at 42oC and then place the tube on ice for 2 min. Add 900 μl of SOC or LB medium to competent cells and leave the tube in 37oC water bath for 10 min to let the competent cells fully recovered. Then, shake the tube at 37oC for 45 min to culture the bacteria. Take 100 μl of culture and plate evenly on agar plate which contains appropriate selection antibiotic. Place the plate at 37oC overnight to culture.
6. Selection of positive colony
Colony PCR is the most convenient selection method. Pick a single colony with tips to 20∼50 μl of LB medium, mix thoroughly and take 1 μl as PCR template. To avoid false positive PCR, we recommend at least one sequencing primer of the cloning vector should be used. Inoculate the remaining medium of positive clones into fresh LB medium and culture overnight. Then, extract the plasmids for subsequent authentication.

COMMUNICATION
Introduction Analysis Audiences Goals Key messages Tactics and Inputs Planning Budget and evaluation Recommendations
Budget
There are only two items's for which a budget is needed, the others will be costless.
Second meeting with Groningen iGEM 2009 team. During their visit to Delft we will serve lunch and drinks. Estimated costs are € 100.
To promote iGEM 2010 competitions and participation of Life Science&Technology students in the TU Delft 2010 team, posters and flyers are needed. Also the lunch meeting for Life Science & Technology students will have some costs. Estimated budget is € 75.
Total costs will be € 200, this includes € 25 for contingent expenses.
Evaluation
Unfortunately it is not possible for us to evaluate the effects of our communication strategy for every single audience. In order to evaluate the effects to every single audience much more time, people and resources are needed than are available to us during this project.
We are able to evaluate the effects on two different audiences.
Scientists
We do not have enough time and resources to evaluate this audience. We will only be able to evaluate this audience inside our faculty TNW. Since some groups in this audience are also sponsors it is more efficient to evaluate as sponsors.
In science interested public
This audience is too big and complex for us to evaluate. Evaluating this audience needs much more financial resources than are available to us.
Sponsors and potential sponsors
This audience is easy to approach and to evaluate. After the Jamboree we will present them with a survey about the cooperation and sponsoring of our team. We also would like to know if we came up to their expectations as sponsors.
Furthermore we would like to ask them if they are interested in sponsoring future TU Delft iGEM teams.
Students
This audience is also easy to approach and to evaluate. After promoting iGEM we are able to see how many Life Science & Technology students are familiar with the iGEM competition. Furthermore we are able to evaluate this audience by comparing the number of applications and the teams"
Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," A and B: Periplasmic domain of EnvZ from amino acid 42 to 158. Regions replaced with Affibody colored red, where A corresponds to BAR 1 and BAR 2 and B corresponds to BAR 3. C: Affibody ZHER2:342. 3D-structures were generated with PyMol.
Choosing the host
EnvZ is expressed in the inner membrane and activates OmpR in the cytosol. This presented a problem since the HER2 biomarker is too large to permeate the outer membrane of E.coli. Early in the project we believed that we could use only the epitope which the ZHER2:342 binds to. We later realized that this would not be possible since Affibody molecules do not bind denatured proteins.
Working with the osmolarity sensor EnvZ requires a distinct and detailed study of the activation of the downstream signaling cascade upon changes in osmolarity. Fortunately, we could work in close connection with our advisor Roger Draheim, an EnvZ expert, who could send us a specific EnvZ reporter strain.
His EBP30 E.coli strain is an EnvZ- derivate from K-12 MG1655, which contains the transcriptional fusion proteins OmpC-CFP and OmpF-YFP (Figure 4A; see schematic). In normal osmolarity conditions, the fusion protein OmpF-YFP is constitutively expressed whereas OmpC-CFP stays silent. However, changing the osmolarity conditions will lead to increase expression of OmpC-CFP and a decrease in OmpF-YFP (Figure 4B; Nørholm, von Heijne & Draheim (2015) S1). Due to this reporter system we can observe the activation of the EnvZ-OmpR signaling cascade. The knockout of EnvZ has been introduced by homologues recombination and insertion of a Kanamycin selection marker.
In conclusion, the ΔEnvZ EBP30 strain with its genomically encoded fusion protein reporter system represents the perfect model to study the activation and the signal behavior of our chimeric receptors.
We then chose between two alternatives. One was to express the system in a gram positive host. This would circumvent the problem since gram positive bacteria lack an outer membrane. This solution would be preferable and should be the aim for future applications of the system. However, since all previous work on EnvZ had been done in E.coli, getting the entire EnvZ-OmpR pathway to work in another host could well be a project of its own"

So why did we choose Phytoremediation over the approach of classical Bioremediation using bacteria like so many iGEM-teams do?
First of all, because the overall applicability of plants is much higher than that of bacteria. Provided with a sufficient safety mechanism, transgenic plants can be deployed almost everywhere and only need water and light to sustain themselves. In comparison, bacteria are much harder and to contain and generate more maintenance costs. And secondly, thanks to all the fantastic work of other iGEM-teams in previous years, we had the possibility to choose from a wide variety of existing BioDegradation bricks!
Our aim was to use the excellent existing bricks and build upon the work of previous teams while improving their applicability by establishing a completely new chassis.
Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
As we established our idea we investigated several remediation projects done by previous teams to look for ways to improve them or even come up with a totally new approach. Looking through interesting projects like those of Bielefeld 2012 , Imperial College London 2010 and of course the algae project of Bilkent UNAM Turkey , we noticed that there have only been a few phytoremediation projects in the iGEM competition. We thought there could be a more suitable chassis for remediation and stumbled upon the well established model organism Physcomitrella patens. As nobody in our team had ever worked with moss (or with plants for that matter) we had a lot of research to do. As there was nobody working with this organism at our whole university we had to look for other universities to find some experts we could win as an advisor for our team. Thankfully Prof. Reski´s homepage provided the necessary papers, methods and details and he was also willing to support our project. Having looked into it, we were conviced that this plant is what we have been looking for and that it would be great to introduce it to the iGEM community.

Gene doping is a real problem. As the science improves the usage will expand. Testing is going to have an impact, in lots of diverse ways. This group have expertise and are willing to engage in transparent, open debate. I think @wada_ama and many others should talk to them. https://t.co/zrO6GQFSVz

In the timeline in figure 1 some of the most prominent events in gene doping development are sorted in time and as it appears gene doping might already be happening.
Figure 1. Timeline of gene doping use and development in society.
Timeline
2003: Genedoping
The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) puts gene doping on the list of prohibited substances.
2004: Marathon mice
Geneticists at Howard Highes Medical Institute engineered so-called marathon mice that could run twice as far as normal mice by changing only a single gene, PPARdelta. ( Wang et al. 2004 )
2006: German Coach (Thomas Springstein) Suspected of Genetic Doping.
Thomas Springstein was a one-time coach of the German Athletics Association (DLV). He was convicted partly based on e-mail conversations, which were aquired by the police during a raid on his home. These e-mails brought up references to Repoxygen, a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia. Repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin (EPO), a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells, thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles. It was under preclinical development by Oxford Biomedica as a possible treatment for anaemia but was abandoned in 2003. ( Michael Reinsch, 28 January 2006 ).

The patent system that has served to protect software for decades was adopted to protect intellectual properties in synthetic biology. This worked in protecting ideas like the genetic toggle switch, or the kill gene in Gateway Assembly, both of which were patented.
Unfortunately, the patent system in synthetic biology and software does not work in all cases. Namely, the system fails when 1) a patent is so broad that other researchers can’t approach the patented technology with a ten-foot-pole without fear of infringement or 2) there is a cluster of narrower patents in a certain aspect of synthetic biology (e.g. digital genetic logic circuits) that prevents researchers from working on downstream applications due to possibility of infringement on one of the narrower patents.  These issues of ambiguity in patent law in software, and now in synthetic biology, are described as the anti-commons problem. Anti-commons is a state in which new research or development is deterred because of ambiguity or overuse of patents in property rights. It is here that software developers and synthetic biologists encounter the same problem: how can the integrity of intellectual property be protected while still facilitating a dispersion of information to the greater scientific community? How can software developers protect and profit from their ideas, while still allowing the rest of the community to use those tools to build their own software? This translates to synthetic biology as: how can synthetic biologists working in foundational research develop biological parts that are protected, but are still available to the greater scientific community for further development into real-life applications?
The answer to all of our problems is always 47!  It’s the answer to the Universe!
Just kidding. The answer came in the form of the Open Source Initiative, which was launched in 1998 as an “general education and advocacy organization… focused specifically on explaining and protecting the ‘open source’ label”. This idea of open source software fostered a community in which software developers share their creations in the public domain, and in return they can use the source code of all other people in the community. Now for our second to last definition (we promise!), the definition of open source; for a work to be considered open source, a developer must allow:
Open access to source code
Meaning, when the software is released, users must be able to obtain the code that the software was written with.
In the context of synthetic biology, that means that the genetic code and biological parts that went into making a new system must be released to the synthetic biology community.

Overview
Coordinated action is required to minimize emergence and spread of antibacterial resistance (ABR). The World Health Organisation have recently (May 2015) endorsed a global action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance .
The plan sets out 5 objectives:
Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance
Strengthen surveillance and research
Reduce the incidence of infection
Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines
Ensure sustainable investment in countering antimicrobial resistance
Our work is focused on the first two WHO objectives. In our project , we are developing the use of bacteria as living therapeutics to provide an alternative to administering antibiotics, thereby addressing objective number two. However, ABR cannot be overcome with research alone in view of the fact that misinformed antibiotic use contributes a large part to the increasing worldwide acquired ABR.
In line with the first objective of the WHO global action plan, to improve awareness and understanding of ABR, our project relies on a three way conversation between the team, the public and experts. This influences every aspect of our project, from our choice of application to the details of our delivery system. The emphasis of our Policy and Practices is to take an iterative approach to developing our idea, continuously taking input from the public and healthcare professionals, so as to ensure that our project could become a realistic method to overcome ABR.
The practices approach of our project has been inspired by the Royal College of General Practitioners TARGET Antibiotics Toolkit. TARGET stands for: Treat Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education, Tools. 1 Our guidance comes from healthcare professionals and the public; in terms of education we have worked on increasing awareness of ABR and synthetic biology; and our tools are based around using engineered bacteria as therapeutic agents. The targeted nature of our solution is achieved by building the project around our practices, constantly feeding back and forth between the two.
We want to make our website as accessible as possible to all readers, regardless of their level"

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Policy#WomanInScience_-_-_TEXT.html," my Master in Biomolecular Physics, I have been studying the vascular effect in therapy and, during my doctorate, I have been analyzing a tumoral model in corialantoic membrane.
Por que escolheu uma carreira científica? Sempre gostei muito de matemática, biologia, física e áreas afins. Então, queria um curso que unisse exatas e biológicas e, ao mesmo tempo, que permitisse fazer pesquisa com aplicação na área de saúde. E, no ano em que prestei o vestibular, abriu o curso de Ciências Físicas e Biomoleculares no IFSC/USP. Why did you choose a scientific career? I have always liked mathematics, biology, physics and similar areas a lot. Therefore, I wanted a course that united natural and biological sciences and, at the same time, allowed me to do a research with applications in the healthcare area. So, at the same year I did the exam to enter university, the Physical and Biological Sciences course at IFSC/USP opened.
Atualmente, a presença das mulheres nos cursos de exatas tem aumentado? O que você vê no seu próprio curso? Esse número tem aumentado muito. É óbvio que no IFSC ainda há mais homens do que mulheres, mas quando recordo a época em que ingressei no Instituto, percebo que hoje a diferença não é tão grande. No meu curso, por exemplo, o número de mulheres e de homens está mais equilibrado. Currently, has the presence of women in exact sciences been increasing? How do you see it in your own course?  This number has increased a lot. It is obvious that at IFSC there are still more men than women, but when I remember about the time I entered the institute, I realize that the difference is not so big today. In my course, for example, the number of women and men is more equal.
Você diria que existe qualquer tipo de segregação ou discriminação de gênero, mesmo que sutis? Se sim, diria que isso pode ocorrer de forma inconsciente? Acredito que sim. Nunca sofri com isso; nunca me vi em uma situação tipo: 'Ah, você é mulher e não pode fazer ciências...'. Mas sei de pessoas mais velhas que sofreram muito pelo fato de ser mulher. Existe um assédio quando dizem que uma mulher só tem êxito por ser bonita."

Penn,2011,Team:Penn State#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.   Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of ''E. coli'' should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the design of our device.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.   Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Codon Optimization
The genetic code is a degenerate one; there are more 3-part combinations of nucleotides than there are amino acids. The topic of codon optimization-that is, the cell's preference for one codon sequence over another in translation-has been heavily researched in an effort to determine the optimal genetic sequences for an organism. This project looks at the effects of repeated amino acid sequences of varying lengths and codons and their effect on the cell.
Codon Optimization
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Background
All of the proteins around us, with few exceptions, are made up of 20 fundamental building blocks of life - amino acids. Different arrangements and combinations of these basic building blocks give us the diversity of proteins that we see. Messenger RiboNucleic Acids (mRNA) is in essence a ""photocopy"" of DNA that codes for a gene. mRNA carry codons, which are groups of three bases that code for a single amino acid. There are 64 possible combinations of codons (4 x 4 x 4 = 64), but these combinations are degenerate, so there can be more than one codon that codes for the same amino acid.
The Problem
We have mentioned how these can be a number of codons that can code for the same Amino Acid, and subsequently, a number of tRNA molecules that can carry a given Amino Acid. In nature, and in many organisms, only a select few of these tRNA and codon combinations are used instead of all sequences that code for the same amino acid. This is called codon bias.
The Objective
Our goal for this project is to see which codons are preferred, or biased. We also want to investigate if this bias can change over time, different circumstances, or stresses.

The second clone of the promoters PlepA and PliaG did not show any luminescence activity. Therefore, additional clones need to be measured.
β-galactosidase assays
The two constitutive promoters PliaG and Pveg were evaluated with the reporter vector pSBBs1C-lacZ, which contains the lacZ reporter gene
(Fig. 2).
Fig. 2: β-galactosidase assay and growth curve of strains carrying the promoters PliaG (black) and Pveg (grey) fused to lacZ. β-galactosidase activity (Miller Units) and the growth curve values are the average of two independent clones with their standard deviation. Experiment shows representative data from three independent experiments.
Promoter activity results in β-galactosidase expression. The β-galactosidase assays of Pveg and PliaG were repeated three times. The graph shows data of one representative experiment. In the beginning of the growth curve, both promoters show only low activity before it increases to a maximum value at three hours. It then decreases steadily until reaching initial level after about seven hours (data not shown). Summing up, the time course of activity is very similar for both promoters. The highest β-galactosidase activity (Pveg= 65 Miller Units, PliaG= 12 Miller Units) can be found during the transition from logarithmic to stationary phase.

Introduction
Protein splicing allows for the introduction of major changes to a proteins sequence and structure even after translation. Although this mechanism alone offers a huge amount of possible applications highlighted in our toolbox, it would be advantageous to have control over the time and location of the splicing reaction especially for in vivo applications. However, the fact that inteins are attached to the protein they splice off from makes induction in whatever way rather difficult.
Controlling Inteins
Different ways exist for controlling the intein splicing reaction. In the literature this is mostly referred to as conditional trans splicing (CTS) or conditional protein splicing (CPS). The oldest method of inducing protein splicing is to chemically control the activity of inteins by changing the pH or redox state of their environment. This has been achieved for a multitude of inteins such as Ssp DnaB [1] or Mtu recA [2] . Yet the major drawback is obvious: These methods are only effectively applicable in vitro and usually depend on complexly purified reagents.
Within the past decades, more advanced systems were designed involving the binding of different ligands or the fusion of inteins to various protein domains. For example Mootz et al. succeeded in inhibiting the splicing reaction of an synthetically engineered version of Ssp DnaE through the addition of rapamycin [3] . Similarly, the S. cerevisiae VMA intein has been conditionally activated by rapamycin induced complementation of FKBP and FRB protein domains. There have previously been attempts to light induce inteins with an analogous system in which the VMA intein halves are fused to the chromoproteins Phytochrome B (PhyB) and Phytochrome Associated Factor 3 (PIF3) [4] . Upon light induction at 660 λ nm PhyB and PIF3 assemble bringing the intein halves together to initiate splicing.

It is frequently found in water sources that are contaminated with human faeces, and is a major cause of illness in developing countries. The symptoms are very similar to those of cholera, and fatalities are caused in much the same way.
Shigellosis infects around 163 million people worldwide and causes 1 million deaths annually.
Surprisingly, both of these bacterial infections are actually fairly easily fought off by the human immune system. The problem for people in developing countries? They can only be successfully fought off if the affected individual is properly hydrated.
We created two modular synthetic devices called S.O.R.D and spiRNA, that work together to target these infections. You can read all about them here

In order to see if our cells were secreting osmY (a protein naturally secreted by E. Coli) and so our sRNA, we needed a way to track it. To do this, we added a HA tag to a pre-existing part in the registry from the Washington 2012 team, BBa_K892008 , to be able to detect in western blot tests whether our cells were secreting osmY."

Interlab study - Aim & Results
The goal of the interlab study is to obtain GFP fluorescence data from the iGEM teams all around the world for about twenty constructions. This will permit to observe the result repeatability across technics, strains and teams.
There were two sub-parts in this study:
The mandatory one: obtain fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices expressing GFP and compare them.
The Extra Credit assignments: we choose to study the entire Anderson library of constitutive prokaryotic promoters (J23100 to J23119) .
This library corresponds to 19 constitutive promoters containing some nucleotide mutations on the -35 and the -10, as shown Used Biobricks and plasmids .  The idea is to compare the expression strength of promoters according to mutations, from the maximum amount of fluorescence data in order to have significant results.
Required Devices
The three required constructions shown various fluorescence intensity at OD 600 nm = 0.5, as"
Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," also some concerns, both personal as well as on how they think the wider public will react on synthetic biology. These can be summarized into three categories:
Safety
By mutations or combinations of different genes, hazardous microorganisms can be created or formed, like bioweapons, superorganisms, antibiotic resistant bacteria etc.
Fear of possible dangers of the end-product made via a GMO-production process. Lot of uncertainties and misunderstandings about safety of GMO-products.
Ethics
Ethical issues on modification of organisms and transferring genetic material of one species to another.
Religion-related ethical issues: interfering with God’s creations.
Hard to set boundaries in genetic modification; are we going to modify people in the future?
GMO-products are considered artificial/unnatural.
Biocontainment
The possible negative effect on an ecosystem and lowering biodiversity when GMOs are introduced in nature.
Next, the students were informed about our project; making a modular diagnostic kit against tropical diseases. They were stimulated to think about possible problems this can bring into a community where it is applied. Their opinions can be summarized into:
Availability of treatments. After diagnosis, sufficient medicines should be available to treat the diagnosed people. If treatment is not available, resources are insufficient, or the people cannot afford treatment, a diagnosis will not improve the quality of life for these people.
Overpopulation in those areas. Lower mortality rate by good diagnostics can result in overpopulation, and possibly more hunger and unemployment problems.
A prerequisite that was proposed by several students was sufficient education about the kit itself, and the consequences for one’s life after diagnosis is confirmed.
Finally, the success rate of this diagnostic kit in third-world countries was compared to western countries (The Netherlands) by asking the opinion of the students. Fifty percent believed that the use would be more accepted in The Netherlands because the Dutch population has a higher education level and would understand the purpose and the action of this kit and are thus more open to it. Here, people can afford health care and are used to novel techniques. About 30% believed that the use of this kit would be less accepted in The Netherlands because people are more aware of the dangers of GMO’s. Moreover, the health care in The Netherlands is satisfactory as it is. The other students were indecisive or thought there would not be a difference in acceptance levels.
When such a diagnostic kit would be available in The Netherlands, the ideal antigens to be detected according to the students are cancer and STDs. Moreover, Mono, HIV and Hepatitis B were mentioned, as well as tropical diseases for travelers.

The Photocontrol Device Mediates Light-Dependent Gene Expression
Plants and several photosynthetic microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria, contain signal transduction systems, which makes them capable of reacting to light Bussell AN, Kehoe DM. Control of a four-color sensing photoreceptor by a two-color sensing photoreceptor reveals complex light regulation in cyanobacteria. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2013;110(31):12834-9. . This ability gives the organisms the opportunity to adapt and optimise the regulation of their metabolic rate in response to sunlight. This property is achieved by photoreceptors incorporated in their plasma membrane, of which phytochromes are the most abundant and well described Vierstra RD, Davis SJ.

The UT Austin iGEM 2004 team applied the light sensing property of phototrophs to an E. coli. By aligning different phytochromes with the intrinsic kinase EnvZ from E. coli they revealed a way to create a two-component system consisting of a photoreceptor with an intracellular indigenous regulator system found in E. coli.

These fragments would be hybridized with enzymes of interest in order to create the desired custom extracellular assembly line. Our team planned to first hybridize these parts with a variety of fluorescent proteins to test the system. See Testing for more information.

Making Our Parts
XXX Figure 5 - Replacement of the native s-layer binding module with the LPP-OmpA part to create our LPP-OmpA/CtCoh2 part
The portion of the sdbA gene that codes for the type 2 cohesin module of the sdbA protien was PCR amplified and given the iGEM suffix and a SacI prefix. The SacI prefix matches the same restriction site on LPP-OmpA's suffix. The two were ligated together after being cut with SacI. This part was entered into the Registry as BBa_K877001 .
Figure 6 - Assembly of our miniA part from portions of the cipA gene
The portion of the cipA gene which codes for the last two type 1 cohesin modules, along with the portion that codes for the first type 1 cohesin module and type 2 dockerin module, where PCR amplified. The fragments were named miniA1 and miniA2 respectively. MiniA1 was given the iGEM prefix and a SacI suffix while miniA2 was given a SacI prefix and the iGEM suffix. These two fragments were ligated together at the blunt restriction sites, inserted into the iGEM chloramphenicol-resistant backbone, and submitted to the Registry as BBa_K877000 .
Testing
In the future the team could test the system via the following methods:
To determine whether or not the type 2 cohesin module is successfully anchored to the surface of the cells, the team must first create a fluorescent protein/type 2 dockerin module combination. Cells will be made to express both the LPP-OmpA-CtcohII part as well as the fluorescent dockerin module. If the cells fluoresce, they will be washed to ensure that any secreted fluorescent protein is not responsible. If the cells still fluoresce, the membranes will be isolated and tested alone for fluorescence. If the part works, the membrane will fluoresce indicating that"

A second issue arising during web development, is the safety of a user's confidential data. Again Django provides an in-built authentication system which encrypts the password of all registered users using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2). Beyond the Django security features, we also used a password protected storage server for the MySQL NRPSDesigner database.
In regards to the biological background of the NRPSDesigner software, we were particularly troubled about not leading a user astray with the organisms suggested for the cloning, especially in case they were not of the S1 safety level. This is particular important in the case of NRPS, because many interesting NRPS such as Pyoverdine, a fluorescent siderophore, are produced by pathogenic microorganisms (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa). As of the European wiki freeze, the NRPSDesigner database includes only S1 organisms. Nevertheless, as in the future the database may be expanded with S2 organisms, we intend to handle such cases by issuing appropriate alert messages to the end-user and also allowing him to filter the domains available to his constructs based on the safety level.
A second consideration arises from the extensibility of the NRPSDesigner database, which means that any user can enter new NRPS domain sequences. These in turn are fed into the algorithm for the design of synthetic NRPS constructs. Thus it is important to ensure that no malicious sequence can be entered, which could then be returned as the output of the NRPSDesigner to an unsuspecting user. This is achieved by ensuring the correct domains have been entered by use of the automated domain prediction pipeline using Hidden Markov Models. Additionally, a user that wants to be particularly safe, can filter the domains available to the NRPSDesigner algorithm according to curation status. (Curated domains have been entered or validated by an iGEM Heidelberg or Edinburgh 2013 team member or by another NRPS specialist in contrast to domains that have been entered by other end-users.) The other non-NRPS sequences, such as backbones, promoters etc., which can be added to the constructs after the domains have been determined by the software, are specific to the user that entered them (e.g. by the automated interface to the API of the Parts Registry) and hence pose no danger to other users.
Another important safety issue arising from the theoretical underpinnings of the NRPSDesigner is its use for the malicious synthesis of toxic peptides. Thus in a future version we want to integrate information from databases on toxins in order disable the design of NRPS domains for toxic"

I've just finished the first year of my Systems Biology MSc at DTU.  In a nutshell, this means I write code to study biologically relevant patterns in genomic information, and I make predictions that can be tested experimentally.   I joined the iGEM team because my concept of 'fun' includes dedicating my summer to work on a big project with other committed people.  Synthetic biology can be used to build a more sustainable future for us and our planet, and I'm excited to be a part of a team that is making that happen. Also, I am quite fond of chocolate cake.

If result from FER/Hyd A and B sequencing is unsuccessful then a new ligation of Fer/Hyd should be attempted. Look at what might need tweaking.
Instead of making up new competent cells, we used commercial competent cells which proved successful as we were able to grow HydEFG transformants.
Plasmids from these were extracted via miniprep.
They were digested and  run on a gel.
The gel results were not as expected. Because of this, new colonies should be screened.
The sequencing came back for Fer/Hyd A and B. Both were as confirmed.
The glycerol stocks were then used to prep overnight cultures which were induced and tested for their ability to produce hydrogen.
The Clark electrode was used to measure the H2 gas production and recordings went off the scale. This was great news. We are looking into the best ways to present this data.
Unfortunately we still have not had any success with PCR amplification of backbones.
HydEFG were sent to be sequenced and other cultures were grown as well as their glycerol stock.

Peking,2012,Team:Peking#Project#Communication#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," measurement of repression effects of bio-luminescence on the expression of GFP in receiver cells.
Detailed characterization
Since we had confirmed that our sensing cell (cells expressing the Luminesensor and the reporter gene) could respond to bio-luminescence quite well, we were interested in more detailed information regarding our light communication system.
1. Spectrum
Firstly, although the spectrum of the luminescence produced by lux genes was given in scientific literature, there may be some slight variation when the genes are expressed in E.coli grown in LB medium. Cambridge 2010 iGEM team did not provide the spectrum for their luxbrick, therefore, in order for us to confirm that the luminescence from our light emitting cell is able to meet the required wavelength. Also, as a supplementary characterization for Cambridge 2010 iGEM team’s luxbrick part, we measured the spectrum of the luminescence emitted by glowing cell.
In the spectrum diagram (Figure 3),  we can see an emission peak at near 485nm, which matches the maximum absorption wavelength of our Luminesensor.
Figure 3. TOP10 cells harboring the luxbrick were cultured in LB medium and induced with L-arabinose at 10-3M. 10 hours after induction, the glowing cells were measured for spectrum using SHIMADZU RF5301PC Spectrofluorophotometer.
2. Time Courses
Then we wanted to figure out when our light emitting cell induced with L-arabinose would begin to glow. Although 2010 Cambridge iGEM team has provided a graph showing the evolution of luminescence intensity with time during the light emitting process, we wanted to create a more visualized characterization of the luxbrick. Therefore, we make a short movie in order to show the time course of our light emitting cell transformed with luxbrick.
As we can see in the movie, the cells begin to glow 9 hours after induction, and the entire visible glowing process lasts about 10 hours. So in the light communication experiment, we decided to put light sensing cell amid the light emitting cell 9 hours after induction in order to maintain illumination on the light sensing cell, especially in their logarithmic phase.

The FluID Detector
Reports
Overview of the FluID detector
One of the components of our forensic toolkit is the FluID- Body Fluid Detector - an all in one, cell free spray that will be used to detect four common body fluids namely blood, semen, nasal mucus and saliva. We wanted to exploit the fact that in each body fluid there are natural ligands that are either unique to each or highly abundant. The aim was to use specific binding proteins to target such components. We managed to overexpress and purify PotD and haptoglobin, the binding proteins that will target spermidine in semen and haemoglobin in blood, respectively. We are yet to purify the binding proteins for the two other body fluids although significant progress has been made towards achieving this goal. To fully characterise our binding proteins we also needed to overexpress the components that they are targeting, if it is a protein-protein interaction. For this, only haemoglobin B has been successfully purified but its interaction with haptoglobin still needs to be fully tested. However, characterization of the PotD/spermidine interaction has been started via tryptophan fluorescence with positive results. Please visit our project page to read about all the individual components of our FluID detector.

Blood
Introduction
There is a lot of potential information contained in a blood stain, which is why forensic investigators are so keen to seek it out. Most importantly, DNA can be extracted from blood samples and can be linked to a suspect or can eliminate a suspect from suspicion. The blood spatter pattern can reveal information about the type of weapon used and the position of the victim and culprit. Finally, blood typing can be used as an initial test to exclude some suspects however, blood type alone is not enough to identify a suspect because lots of people will also share the same blood"

Since cloning of BLS DM in pSB1C3 pRha-RBS did not work, it was cloned into pRha-RBS-pSB1K3 for test expression.
Agar diffusion test with different concentrations of Clorobiocin with XL-1 blue and TolC E.coli were done. Clorobiocin and wafers were sent to iGEM team Franconia for our collaboration.
Test expression and purification of BLS WT and DM.
First try to close the ring of our chemical synthesis in vitro.

Proteorhodopsin Cytotoxicity Growth Assay
Cultures of BL21 E. coli were heat-shock transformed with the PR+Blh plasmid. 50 ml of LB + Chloramphenicol (25ug/ml) was added to two falcon tubes before inoculating with the transformed bacteria. Liquid cultures were grown overnight at 37C on a shaking plate before being measured for optical density, combined, and normalized to .28 OD 600. Cultures were then divided into 3 replicates containing  8ml aliquots. The cultures were incubated for twelve hours before measuring OD600 . They were then incubated for an additional twelve hours before measuring OD600 a final time. This experiment was performed to characterize what, if any, effect active Proteorhodopsin had on cellular growth.
Proteorhodopsin ATP/ADP Assay
To characterize Proteorhodopsin, we conducted an ATP/ADP ratio assay with the EnzyLight Kit comparing the ATP/ADP ratio of BBa_K2182003 transformed BL21 E. coli.  Successful proton pumping would be seen as an increase of ATP, so the expected outcome was that the bacteria induced with beta-carotene and grown in the light would have the highest ratio. Transformed cells were grown overnight in 50ul of  LB + Chloramphenicol (25ug/ml) and allowed to grow overnight at 37 degrees celsius. Induced groups were given 20uM beta-carotene and light groups were exposed to a 200W equivalent LED bulb. The liquid culture was then divided into 10ml each of the four experimental groups and allowed to grow at 37 degrees celsius 10 µL of cultured cells were transferred into a 96-well plate, with four replicates in each group. The cells were mixed with 90 µL of ATP reagent per well and the luminescence was read on a plate reader. This value is RLU A. After 10 minutes, the luminescence was read again, to get the RLU B value. 5 µL of ADP reagent were added to each well and mixed, and a final reading was done to obtain the RLU C value. The ATP/ADP ratio was calculated using the formula (RLU C - RLU B) / RLU A.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today ampicillin plates will be made in order to have them available for protein expression.  In addition, the PCquad optimized will be designed in order to be expressed using PSB1C3 in E. coli DE3.
A schematic of the construct is the following:
Prefix-T7 promoter-lac operator-RBS-NdeI-gene-XhoI-histag-stop-suffix
The file made on benchling was named “PCquad Optimized for iGEM 3.0.”
The T7 promoter was taken from the pET22b vector file.  A C-terminal histag and stop were created. From the iGEM website, the master RBS sequence was found to be the following.
Master RBS:  TCTAGAG-AAAGANNNGANNN-ACTAG-ATG(start) The sequence from http://parts.igem.org/cgi/partsdb/puttext.cgi was used.
Notes on making agar plates:
LB media Component Amount per liter
Tryptone  10 g Yeast extract   5 g NaCl  10 g
For preparation of 1 liter of LB medium, add 10 g NaCl, 10 g tryptone, and 5 g yeast extract to 950 ml distilled or deionized water, and shake or stir until dissolved. Adjust the pH to 7.0 with 5 M NaOH. Adjust the volume of the solution to 1 liter with distilled or deionized water. Decant into smaller aliquots and sterilize by autoclaving (see Sterilizing media).
Tip: It is advisable to autoclave liquid medium in several small bottles rather than in one large vessel to avoid possible contamination of an entire batch. After autoclaving, do not use medium for 24 hours to ensure that it is properly sterilized and free of contaminating microorganisms.
Tip: Antibiotics should be added to liquid medium immediately prior to use from stock antibiotic solutions that have been"

6. No Discrimination against Fields of Endeavor The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.
7. Distribution of License The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.
8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.
9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.
10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
These definitions are little idealized. In reality, for those license of open source software, some modification is always needed for adaptation concrete situation. Understanding the license of open source line by line is quite impossible without aid. In the interest of time, I focus on the option that experts said and make a summary.
