Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in relief, her dream had been so unpleasant. The machine humming on her desk she had bought for her high school biology project. It was old and loud, almost as big as the vintage toaster her mother kept in the kitchen. Moving over to the desk, she sat down and read the display on the device. It still had 3 more cycles to complete before the genetic constructs she had chosen the night before were complete. The constructs were going to change the “photoplastic” growing in small tubes on the roof of all the buildings in her neighborhood. They would shine in different colors depending on the season. She thought of the small life forms growing on the roof and how they provided the material for the 3D-printers everyone had in their homes.
She wondered how people had made things without them.
The idea she had suggested to her mother, not two weeks ago, played in her mind; if the small lifeforms make everything we need, then they might as well look pretty doing so! She had learned the basics of manipulating DNA in primary school and bought everything she needed online, from the DNA-synthesizer to an old TIRC machine (Transformation Integration Replication and Cultivation). That night, her mother had talked about how genetic modification of the tiny life forms had once been difficult and even forbidden.
Eve could not see how anything could be produced without them. In her world they produced everything from food to energy, even the material of the sheets she had been curling into a moment ago was produced from these tiny things. She remembered how they used the energy of sunlight and the gases in the air, freely available everywhere and to everyone, to replicate themselves. Of course, they need the small bag of minerals every few weeks or so but other than that they were completely self-sustaining.
Her teacher had once talked about how people used to pull ancient black and toxic goo from deep pockets in the ground to make things and burn for fuel. She had described how it had almost made the planet uninhabitable, how the oceans had threatened to swallow the lands and the air becoming toxic. Eve wondered how people could allow such wasteful and destructive use of the scarce resources available on the little world they all shared.
Eve thought about the dream she had, was it real? Was it a memory, no she had never seen the dead landscape before, her world was green and full of life. She returned to her bed and looked up at the early morning sky through the transparent domed ceiling of her bedroom. Some of the stars had not yet yielded to the sunrise. As she drifted back into sleep she thought"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmids are correct. We designed primers to assemble our first pSB1C3 derived plasmid pKH1, which carries both the bpsA and the svp gene with the lacI-Promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 before both the bpsA and the svp gene, respectively..

Week 9
Indigioidine Production – bpsA
This week we assembled our first pSB1C3 derived plasmid pKH1, which carries both the bpsA and the svp gene with the lacI-Promoter BBa_R0010 using a Gibson (Gibson 2009) and a CPEC (Quan 2009) cloning strategy. We replaced the mRFP1 coding sequence with the bpsA and svp coding sequences with the RBS B0034 , respectively. Thus we assemble three fragments in total, which are pSB1C3ΔmRFP1 (Primer NI9/10), bpsA (Primer NI1/6) and svp (NI7/8).
With this plasmid it is possible to produce indigoidine in E. coli TOP10 without IPTG induction, since TOP10 cells lack the lac repressor gene.
As the PCR amplifications of all fragments for the assembly of pKH1 were positive, we could perform both the Gibson and CPEC assembly for pKH1.
After IPTG induction, co-transformation of BAP1 with the originalpMM64 and pMM65 yielded blue liquid cultures. We compared the blue color using four samples induced by different amounts of IPTG. We couldn't detect significant correlation between indigoidine production and varying IPTG concentration.
Since we have had problems with the plasmids received from Zurich and we wanted to use the original gene rather than a codon optimized version, we planned to extract the bpsA indigoidine synthetase gene directly from the organism it originates from, namely Streptomyces lavendulae subsp. lavendulae strain ATCC11924 (Takahashi 2007). As the DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) doesn't provide this specific strain any longer, we used another S. lavendulae subsp. lavendulae strain ( DSM40708 ) expecting the bpsA gene to be present as well. We cultivated S. lavendulae in both YEME medium (Kieser 2000)"

This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to attL and attR at the meantime. This inversion can be reversible by appropriately controlling the conditional expression of integrase and an excisionase in Bxb1 named gp47 at certain ratio. We change start codon ATG to GTG for a appropriate expression quantity.
The second one contains a switch, two reporters, two RBS and terminators. At first, the plasmid expresses GFP, when gp35 is expressed, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.

The second gene circuits we built for BNU.
Map of those two circuits are shown above. And figures below show us circuit 1 and 2 using Agarose Gel Electroporesis.
We performed experiment to see whether our circuits work. From the figure above, we can find out that when only circuit 2 is transformed (A), GFP is expressed, when both of the two circuits are transformed, the switch turns and RFP is expressed.

Fig. 2 Peristaltic pump
Fig. 3 Ministat chambers in heatblock and 1 litre Duran bottle used to collect effluent
Fig. 4 Ministat running a preliminary    experiment to calibrate parameters such as dilution rate and temperature of the heat block. 50 ml burettes used   here to accurately measure effluent levels. 1 litre Duran bottles were used for effluent collection in the main   experiment due to greater volumes of effluent.
Our own growth curve was performed to determine the maximum specific growth rate of E. coli BL21 (DE3) in our lab, but could not be conducted for a sufficient length of time to be accurate. A maximum specific  growth rate value of 1.730 was used (Cox, 2004). The ministat must be run at a dilution rate less  than maximum specific growth rate, this prevents the culture being washed out of the growth chambers. The dilution rate  of the culture was calculated by measuring flow rate at a setting of 7.5 rpm on the peristaltic pump. For practical reasons   the pump could not be run faster than this due to the amount of media needed. The dilution rate was set at 0.2 which   produced cultures that grew at an average optical density (OD) of 3.47 for KillerRed samples, 3.64 for KillerOrange samples and 3.17 for   lysozyme samples. OD was measured daily with a Bug Lab OD scanner. When the same  sample was measured in a tecan infinite 200 pro plate reader the Bug Lab showed readings approximately three times higher.  The difference between the samples was consistent regardless of the method used to measure OD and OD measurements remained stable throughout the experiment.
Method and Results
Metabolic kill switch
KillerRed (Fig. 5) and KillerOrange are homologues of Green fluorescence protein (GFP)  which, when irradiated with green and blue light respectively, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). KillerRed has been  shown to effectively kill cells when exposed to green light (540–580 nm) and is much less effective under blue light  (460–490 nm) (Bulina et al, 2006). KillerOrange effectively kills cells when exposed to 450-495nm (Sarkisyan 2015), the range that KillerRed does not. There is a β-barrel present in both these proteins.

Every time you make new competent cells you should check for possible contaminations. Plate an aliquot of the new cells in LB plates + antibiotic (i.e. ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin). Strains such as DH5a, NEB10b, Novablue, should not grow in the presence of antibiotics.
2. TRANSFORMATION
Thaw home made CaCl2 competent cells on ice.
Add 1µL of DNA to 200µL of competent cells (concentration of DNA stock should be between 50–150 ng/µL).
Incubate on ice for 30 min.
Heat shock at 42 deg C for exactly 2 min.
Incubate on ice 1 min.
Add 800µL of LB (or SOC) and shake at 37 deg C for 1 h.
Plate the cells (use plates with the appropriate antibiotic according to your plasmid).
You can either plate a small amount (200µL) of the cells or more.
You should try a few conditions the first time and then choose the one that gives 30–300 separate colonies.
If few cells are expected: spin down the cells at 2500 rpm, discard supernatant & resuspend in 150–200µL of LB and plate all the cells.
For ligation you should increase the amount of DNA to be transformed (see cloning protocol).
Incubate the plates O/N upside down at 37 deg C.
3. PCR
We have used a number of different Polymerases for amplification of our parts.
In each case we have followed the protocol suggested by the manufacturer.
Here is a list of the Polymerases that we have used.
New England Biolabs:
- Phusion
- One Taq
Kapa Biosystems:
- Kapa Hifi Polymerase
RBC:
- Find link
4. CLONING
Most of our parts were cloned starting from a PCR amplified product, purified and digested, which was subsequently inserted into the destination vector.
Alternatively, we used a 2A assembly strategy, where the source parts and the destination plasmid where digested separately and subsequently purified before the ligation step.
You can find here our working sheet that we used in the lab. We hope you find it helpful!

Preparation of the tubes
We got 3 tubes containing cells from the freezer at 80C and placed them into the ice and waited for 30 minutes
We prepared 6 tubes (3 tubes for controls and 3 tubes for the plasmids) for the bricks
We added 40ul of cells to each of the six tubes
We added 3ul of DNA for the plasmid tubes and 3ul of water for the control tubes
We added 900ul of LB for each of the six tubes
We then placed the tubes in the shaking incubator for an hour.
Plating out

We prepared 9 plates with full strength (undiluted) and 9 plates with diluted tube content.
Plates with undiluted content
The first three plates having LB + Amp were used as the negative control. Hence the cells not having amp. resistance would not grow on these plates.
The next three plates with LB content were used as the positive control. Cells without amp. resistanec would still grow on"

Our Project
In light of the growing energy crisis, much research has been devoted to finding economical means of producing renewable fuels. Traditional methods for obtaining biofuels have relied mainly on the fermentation of agricultural crops. However, there are a number of problems with this approach: the reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. In the past there have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs (Galbe et al., 2007). Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC 6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E. coli. Cyanobacteria and E. coli will be co-cultivated in an apparatus that allows for the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels. Not only will this project provide an efficient means for producing biofuels without the need for a carbon source, but it will also create a novel cooperative system between bacterial species that may have further industrial implications.

Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Aix-Marseille,2018,Team:Aix-Marseille#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," observations of the simulations have shown that the delay between infection and death of bed bugs is critical for ensuring the eradication of the nest. Our modeling thus helps understand critical aspects of the proposed design. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the elimination time is strongly dependant of the number of traps deployed.  Indeed, we can see in our results that the more traps are ""in action"", the shorter the time before elimination is. However, this only holds up to a certain value, in our case 20, after which there is no further impact of the number of traps on the elimination time. These results seem to show it exists a critical value for the traps. Above this number of traps, the efficiency (the elimination time) isn't affected anymore.
Even though our test allows us to conclude about the effect of the number of traps, there is still room for improvement.  For example, we should check that the values we use in the parameters of our program are realistic.  We could device experiments in order to measure them more precisely, and so, make our model more realistic.  The realism could also be improved through the addition of more realistic functions such as the generation of new bed bugs during program execution, or a better modeling of bed bug behaviour.
The last improvement of our model would be to test more parameters.  Indeed, there is not only the number of traps that impact efficiency.  So we should analyse more data about the possible impact of these other parameters on the efficiency of our project."

SAFETY
Every member of our team has been trained about general lab safety and project design safety by our previous members. For example, the former leader and our advisors taught us how to run the experiment correctly and avoid mistakes.
Project design safety
For the safety of our team members, we designed the project to be as safe as possible. The core of our project is to express human sweet receptor T1R2-T1R3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The whole project has no harm to the human body. In the process of implementation of the project we chose the mRFP as a reporter gene which can be detected directly without adding any harmful reagents.
Lab safety
Our team conducted research in a safety level 1/2 laboratory. The organisms we used, E. coli strain DH5α, BL21, Top 10 and S.c strain CEN.PK2-1C are suitable for the S1/2-safety laboratory we are working in. Besides, the plasmids we are using for transformation (pRS42K, pESC-Ura, pESC-Trp, pESC-His, pESC-Leu, pSB1C3) are not harmful for humans.
See more in Notebook / Equipment & Material
Because of the nature of our project, contacting with microorganisms is inevitable. In order to avoid any harmful effects to each member of our team, all laboratory work was in accordance with the safety requirements for the laboratory. This includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:
(1) Eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited in the laboratory.
(2) Don’t deal with the wastes at will.
(3) All experimenters must wear protective equipment such as gloves and Lab coats.
(4) All equipments that come into contact with biological material (such as tips and glass glassware) must be autoclaved.
(5) Store quick-burning, flammable materials in designated locations which are away from ignition sources for fire protection. And there is no accumulated clutter in the hallway, for our safety while accident happening.

Fig. 3. Interview with Assistant Prof.Zhang and learn about biosafety in wet lab. What’s more, we learned basic knowledge of biosafety in synthetic biology during these visits. It is important to use biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies to ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created. Also, conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow are indispensable. Interview with Prof.LI Ping in Tongji University We had an interview with Prof. Li Ping and a discussion with doctoral students in Prof.Li’s  laboratory in May at the beginning development of our project.Prof. LI now conducts scientific research in School of Life Science and Technology of Tongji University. Her research group mainly engaged in the fields of microbial fermentation and synthesis of natural active substances which are very relative to pathway engineering.
Fig. 4. Discussing pathway engineering with Prof.Li.She told us that there are many challenges when conducting a pathway engineering project. One major challenge is in the design of the pathway. She told us that there are many challenges when conducting a pathway engineering project. One major challenge is in the design of the pathway, which may require sorting through thousands of possible enzymes and reactions wherein all the parameters have different substrate preferences and kinetic features. It is not easy for researchers to search information efficiently due to a considerable amount of data available on the Internet. “It will save much time for us if you could provide a computational tool for designing and constructing pathway.” She said. Moreover, we had a discussion with doctoral students about the optimization of the heterologous metabolic pathway. They told us that the most important factor should be considered is the metabolic burden in the pursuit to identify an optimal metabolic pathway. “Minimizing the number of heterologous reactions that need to be added would help reduce the metabolic burden.” They said. After an in-depth discussion with Prof.Li and her doctoral students, we learned that researchers engaged in metabolic engineering have a great demand for a computational tool that help them design and construct pathways. Moreover, they inspire us to consider more about metabolic burden when ranking pathways. iGEM Eurasian meet-up It’s a great pleasure to participate in iGEM Eurasian meetup 2018 in July this summer.

Reaction 6
The value that had been found before for k6 (Pl) = 0.20mM / h is in reality the flow of the reaction (which is why the  units are mM/h). That is, how many mRNA molecules are being produced per  unit of time. The system in which they measured this parameter is a derivative of the plasmid pBR322, pTrc99A. It has the same origin of replication and the  number of copies is estimated at 15-20 but under certain conditions where replication is limited it appears to be between 3-5 copies.
Using the previous information we can calculate the value of k+ of the reaction in our system if we consider that each promoter acts independently and we multiply by the ratio between the number of copies of our plasmid and those of their plasmid.

As a result of their Swarm plate assay and experiments for the determination of flagellar rotational speed, it was found that some random mutations (HSN-T108I and HNS-A18E) resulted in bacteria with a stronger and faster flagella as compared with wild type bacteria. This single amino acid change caused a 50% increase in the binding of HNS to FliG.. It was also shown that this single amino acid change in HNS resulted in an approximately 50% increase in flagellar rotation speed and about a 2-fold increase in the bacteria’s swarm size.
Figure 4: Swarm plate assay. Fresh colonies from strains carrying the indicated alleles were inoculated onto semi-solid agar plates and grown at 30 °C. Growth was measured as the diameter of the bacterial swarm over several time points. Bacteria with swarm diameters under 10 mm at the end of 17 h incubation were considered non-motile. Data representative of three individual experiments. *, vector; f, hns2-tetR; ,,wild-type HNS; l, hnsT108I; l, hnsA18E..
Figure 5: Flagella propel bacteria by rotating motor-driven helical filaments (35, 36) whereby swimming speed is directly related to flagellar rotational speed (39). Gina M. Donato and Thomas H. Kawula1 , in another experiment which they tried to compare rotational speeds of mutant and wild-type bacteria, they concluded that hnsA18E and hnsT108I accelerated flagellar speeds 44–62% over wild-type levels.
In the results from fluorescence anisotropy and chemical cross-linking, Donato and Kawula showed that there is an interaction between HNS and FliG, the protein responsible for flagellar torque; and they show that the mutant form of HNS binds FliG 50% more often than does wild-type HNS: They explain the increase in the bacteria’s swarm rate and swim speed caused by mutant HNS thusly “We position H-NS at the interface between the rotor and stator, directly linked to the C terminus of FliG(Fig. 5 A). Tighter binding of mutant H-NST108I toFliG (Fig.5 B) may cause increases in flagellar speed by altering the conformation of FliG relative to the other rotor proteins and/or the MotA·B complex, thus, compacting the motor complex and allowing fast errotation by creating less friction"

alpha-Pinene
Joe performed a digest on the miniprepped product to see if his ECORI site is still present. He digested with EcoRI alone for both his SDMed product and his original plasmid. He also did another digest with XbaI, PstI (both of which are found on the pET200plasmid containing the alpha-synthase gene) and EcoRI. To visualize, here are the plasmid maps of the pET200 containing the alpha-pinene synthase gene.
‎
(Note: plamid map distance is not to scale. XbaI to PstI is around 3.4kb; the alpha pinene synthase (Ps-TPS-pin) is about 1.8kb with its EcoRI site at 960bp away from the start of the gene.)
Therefore, after gel electrophoresis, the following results should be observed, which were observed in Joe's gel:
The uncut plasmids, should run slower than cut plasmids on the gel. Here, it runs slightly above the 1kb ladder. The EcoRI cut on the original pET200 with Ps-TPS-Pin shows up as a band at around 8kb long. Conversely, the EcoRI cut on the SDM pET 200 with Ps-TPS-Pin, shows a similar band as uncut pET200-Ps-TPS-PinSDM. This shows that the site directed mutagenesis worked and my EcoRI site is removed.
To be entirely sure, I also digested with XbaI, PstI, and EcoRI on both the SDM pET200 Ps-TPS-Pin and original pET200Ps-TPS-Pin. 3 expected bands (4.9kb, 1.8kb, and 0.6kb) showed up from cut original pET 200Ps-TPS-Pin, while only 2 expected bands (4.9kb and 3.4kb) showed up from cut SDM pET200 Ps-TPS-Pin.

To prove that our engineered system has to work under realistic conditions and our system complies with all rules and regulations approved by the iGEM Safety Committee. We made a video to demonstrate how our project works and it can be adapted in realistic conditions. Also, we consulted lawyers for the intellectual property copyrights and we made sure the safety of the projects. At the same time, we gave our project to several iGEMers and synthetic biologists. Some of them used it to find statistics they needed and some tested it and they gave us their feedbacks.

Safety with BioMaster
BioMaster is a biobrick database which focuses on database integration as well as promoter prediction. The data in the BioMaster comes from databases with security certifications and declarations such as Uniprot and EPD, so the data in BioMaster is also secure. Our prediction function is only meant to provide users with a prediction result for their reference. Whether to use it depends on users’ actual situation and their own judges.
Q1: What are the functions of BioMaster?
A1: BioMaster can be used to search for detailed information of biobricks such as its functions, sites, interactions and related references. It can predict if a DNA sequence is a promoter.
Q2: How BioMaster works? A2: BioMaster is run and maintained by UESTC. Users can use it by visit our website.
Q3: Who are the users of BioMaster?
A3: Users are those who want to find information about biobricks or those who want to do some promoter prediction.
Q4: Does it have any risks in laboratory?
A4: BioMaster runs as a web page. It aims to provide more detailed and comprehensive biobrick information and accurate prediction results of promoters to synthetic biologists. We won’t use any plasmid or bacteria. No wet-lab"

We also presented to our Mayor and Town Council for the second year in a row. This presentation allowed us to teach our community leaders about iGEM, to highlight a new avenue to a potential solution, and to celebrate our educational achievements. These community leaders also encouraged us to apply for a Town grant, which we eventually were granted in the amount of $5,000.  Through our various presentations and fundraising efforts this year, we were able to fundraise $40,000 for our team!  This speaks to the interest we garnered, the severity of this local issue, and the desire of our community to partner with us in an attempt to find a real solution utilizing synthetic biology.
This year our teachers worked with Dr. Magda Pop (a Geekstarter Mentor) and pushed for the creation of an Alberta curriculum centered around synthetic biology. This curriculum has been approved (LINK HERE!) providing what we think is the FIRST opportunity for high school students to earn credits towards graduation while studying synthetic biology and competing in iGEM!
Early this year, one of our students, Talia Dixon presented at the Alberta Teachers’ Association Science Council Conference held in Banff, Alberta, along withmentor Dr. Magda Pop and Mr. Arvisais.  This allowed them to share the learning opportunities in iGEM and show many teachers that their students can truly take part in this amazing competition.
Our 2 teacher advisors also presented at the Alberta Teachers’ Association Annual Teachers’ Convention.  The talk was entitled “E. Coli Happens: Synthetic Biology as a Ticket to MIT”, and was open to high school educations across the province.  They even brought innoculation loops and made teachers practice streaking plates.
Our last outreach mission is still in progress.  One of our teachers,  Ms. Puurunen,  will present a Ted Talk at TedX Canmore in October 2015.  Her presentation will spread the word about iGEM, our team, the project, synthetic biology, and elevating science education in general.  Ideally, her talk will reach a global audience!

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Figure 3.
Bactoplast
The final concept presented was similar with the idea Groningen’s iGEM team had two years ago. The printer will be used to print the biofilm required at that moment for healing processes. The so-called bactoplast is placed on the wound and will increase   the healing process. Afterwards the signal molecules of the wound will disappear. This signal activates bacteria’s kill switch. Therefore, there is no danger of bacteria that will escape.
Figure 4.
Since it is difficult to keep the Bactoplast fresh, this group aimed for hospitals and doctors. However, it would be even nicer if people could use the device at home. In that case, the bactoplast can be used in every kind of wound.
Wrap-up
After the hard work of the teams, it was time to relax. We organized a free barbecue with drinks in the company of the Netherlands’ very occasional, sun. We all enjoyed the evening and received constructive feedback from the participants. Students       who at first knew little about the field, found out many interesting things. They left with a good impression about synthetic biology and its future.
Synthetic biology in action
RIVM (Governmental agency for public health and environment) and Rathenau Instituut organized a discussion about the advances in technology that may have a large impact on society and industry.
For the second time, the RIVM (Governmental agency for public health and environment) and Rathenau(The Rathenau Instituut studies developments in science and technology, interprets their potential impact on society and policy, and fosters dialogue and debate in support of decision-making on science and technology) organized a discussion about “Synthetic biology in action”. The need for this discussion is because nowadays the advances in technology are taking big leaps, which the public is not aware about. Therefore the Dutch ministries want to stay up to date with current developments, in order to regulate them correctly. The role of the Dutch iGEM teams was to show what students were actively working with in synthetic biology.
All the Dutch iGEM teams were actively involved in organizing the event. We had two preparation meetings. The first meeting was about what we wanted to achieve and what the iGEM teams could mean for the discussion. In the second meeting, all the Dutch teams practiced their pitch that they wanted to present at the discussion. It was really inspiring and lovely to see what the other teams had accomplished during the previous months.

SAFETY
Safety First!
LAB SAFETY
Safety is a key word when working in a laboratory. Each team member who worked in the lab received a guided tour and an introduction to safety protocols, including waste management, sterilization, clean lab coat, hand washing and so on. Sometimes, your protection equipment can turn into an unique Star Wars costume!
Most of the work made during our project was done in an L2 safety lab. The other part of the technical work concerns the printing of our bio badge 3D model. This work has been done in a chemistry lab that doesn’t require specific biological safety protocols.
SAFE PROJECT DESIGN
The safety aspect of our project has always been in our minds while working on it, since the primary goal of the badge is to be used outside of the lab. We decided to design it in a way that prevents our modified bacteria from escaping into the environment. The badge includes a ring filled with bleach which is mixed with the bacteria contained into the capsule once it has been used. The bleach will rapidly kill the bacteria and ensure that none can escape. The risk of bacteria escaping into the environment is thus greatly reduced.

Freiburg,2013,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractice#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," progress and benefits will guide scientists from all over the world to continue, so regulation by the law of one country is not sufficient if scientists in other countries are able to continue their work …” (Dr. Jochen Holzschuh)
And therefore researchers have to keep in mind that:
„... as a scientist who creates a certain knowledge,  responsibility does not stop at the end of his or her own work - instead, the duty of observing the usage of this knowledge by other scientists arises ...“ (Dr. Jochen Holzschuh)
In contrast to application in human beings, gene engineering of animals is already widely used in research - also in behavioral studies. It has been shown that the behavior of some animal can be influenced by genetical manipulation. If this progress will go on …
“… a maybe possible stable control of complex behavior will raise the question if we are allowed to steer animals …” (Dr. Georgios Pyrowolakis, Fly Development)
So there are many open questions that have to be dealt with. As always in ethics an answer is not easy and can not be found by objective scientific methods. So scientists will have to leave their familiar environment and approach society about their research.
International ethical conference
""Engineering Life:
To the ethical and societal relevance of synthetic biology""
We, the iGEM-Team of Freiburg, participated in an international ethical seminar about synthetic biology at the Department of History and Ethics of Medicine of the University of Freiburg. We wanted to learn more about synthetic biology from a different point of view. From the perspectives of ethics, law, biosafety and biosecurity synthetic biology appeared in an interesting new light. Due to the lectures our understanding of the appearance of synthetic biology in the society, the hopes and fears, grew tremendously.
The seminar was the last session in a variety of meetings during 3 years of an interdisciplinary project work. All meetings were gathered in the project with the topic Engineering Life: An interdisciplinary approach to the ethics of Synthetic Biology . Here, scientists of different institutions investigated in the field of synthetic biology with the aim to clarify
if it is justified to speak about creating life,
how the reproach against science to ""play God"" could theologically be interpreted,
how risks and chances of this field of research shall be analyzed,
if the legal regulations were appropriate,
how a clear definition can be found whether a construct is natural or synthetic,
if there is a divergence in the systematical conditioning and actual research in synthetic biology.
On 26/9/13 it was discussed how a future society based on biotechnology could look like.  Therefore,"

Discussion
Clearly we see some colocalization of the red and yellow fluorescence with the anti-YFP antibody, but as we were short of time, we weren't able to incubate the antibody long enough, we only incubated for 15 minutes. We will also need to sequence verify the construct to support the colony PCR we did, but still results are promising.

Streptavidin Dead: BBa_K1111011
Streptavidin iGEM: BBa_K283010 .
2) PCR reactions products
INP_construct = BBa_K523013 after PCR without EYFP
SA = Streptavidin Alive; SD = Streptavidin Dead
SI = Streptavidin iGEM.
3) Gibson reaction product names:
ISA = INP_Streptavidin Alive gibson product BBa_K1111012
ISD =  INP_Streptavidin Dead gibson product BBa_K1111013

Reconstruction of the KaiABC system
Promoter selection
In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus(PCC 7942), three genes (kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC) are essential components of the circadian clock, whose concentration ratio is also important. According to previous studies,  the concentration ratio of these three core proteins, KaiA, KaiB and KaiC, is  1:1:4 (by weight).
Researchers has incubated KaiC with KaiA and KaiB in vitro at a ratio similar to that measured in vivo in the presence of 1 mM ATP. As a result, KaiC phosphorylation has robustly oscillated for at least three cycles without damping. But the amplitude of this in vitro was smaller than that observed in vivo under continuous light conditions.
More specifically, the change in concentration of these three kind of  proteins could exert a complex impact on the KaiABC circadian clock system, or in other words, the circadian oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation. For example, in cyanobacteria,  KaiC represses its own (kaiBC) expression, whereas KaiA enhances the expression of kaiBC. Therefore, KaiC and KaiA could be, respectively, regarded as negative and positive factors functioning in circadian feedback regulation of kaiBC expression.
Besides, sufficient and appropriate protein concentrations is necessary for Kai protein interactions and KaiC phosphorylation. To take an example, several researchers have already explored the effect of Kai protein concentration on the rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation. In experiment, the standard mixture (×1 solution) was consisted of 1.2 μM KaiA, 3.5 μM KaiB, and 3.5 μM KaiC. When the proteins were at 2.5× or 5× protein concentrations, the KaiC phosphorylation rhythms were nearly the same as those measured under standard conditions. While lowering the protein concentration to 1"

Our growth experiments using CS-Glc liquid medium with increasing amounts of glyphosate also confirmed that the strains iGEM7 and iGEM13 tolerate higher amounts of the herbicide than their progenitor strain iGEM1 (Figure 4; see below). To conclude, B. subtilis rapidly adapts to toxic glyphosate concentrations at the genome level!
Figure 4. Characterization of glyphosate (GS)-resistant B. subtilis mutants. The wild type (WT) strain (A) and its derivatives iGEM1 (B), iGEM7 (C), and iGEM13 (D) were cultivated for 10 h at 37°C in CS-Glc minimal medium supplemented with increasing amounts of GS.
1.3. Identification of mutations by genome and Sanger sequencing
To identify the underlying genomic alterations causing glyphosate resistance the strains iGEM1, iGEM7 and iGEM13, we performed whole-genome sequencing with the help of the Göttingen Genomics Laboratory (Figure 5A). By analysing the genome sequences we found that the bacteria had deleted a 1240 bp-long fragment containing a part of the 5’ ends of the yhfE and gltT genes and the entire yhfF gene  (Figure 5B).
Figure 5. The mutations of the glyphosate-resistant mutants and the link between glutamate and glyphosate transport. (A) The illumina sequencing reads were mapped onto the reference the B. subtilis 168 reference genome NC_000964 from GenBank (3) using the Geneious software package ( Biomatters Ltd. ) (4).  (B) The mutations in the glyphosate (GS)-resistant B. subtilis mutants identified by genome sequencing.

The 1240 bp-long deletion is also present in the strains iGEM7 and iGEM13 because they were derived from the strain iGEM1 (Figure 5B). In addition to the deletion affecting the yhfE, yhfF and gltT genes, the strains iGEM7 and i"

Exchanging knowledge and experiences with other iGEM teams was a fundamental aspect of our project. Being novice iGEM competitors, iGEM UNAH 2015 team started up its project with some doubts and weak knowledge; for such a reason, we acknowledge all help received from our Mexican partners from Tec de Monterrey and UNAM, thanks for sharing with us concepts and skills on biotechnology and synthetic biology. We would like to emphasize the importance of this kind of interactions, especially for new teams coming into competition. Team iGEM UNAH 2015 team would like to set its experience as an example to encourage other Latin American teams in helping each other, in order to achieve higher goals and promote Synthetic Biology throughout every Latin American country and university.
 
IGEM MEETUP MONTERREY
iGEM Tec-Monterrey 2015 team, hosted an iGEM meetup from April 30 to May 3 in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, México. During four days, teams were able to learn about each other´s projects, receive feedback from invited experts on the biotech field, and to discuss the current state of synthetic biology in Latin America (iGEM-Tec-Monterrey, 2015).  iGEM UNAH 2015 team was present on Monterrey for the meet up, along with UNAM-CU, UANL, TecCEM, TecCEM_HS, TecMonterrey_GDL, IPN, and iGEM Zamorano.

In conclusion, we created a PHB promoter/RBS libary, identifying the BioBrick producing the highest level of PHB. We analyzed different purification methods with regards to purity, yield and ease of large scale production and in addition we found the optimal media for high cell density of PHB producing cells. Finally we improved the characterization of a BioBrick previously proven to increase PHB production, quantitatively at a proteomic level.

Summary
PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology in order to replicate target DNA fragments. Through the use of specific primers, polymerases, and temperature cycling, exponential replicas of the target DNA fragment can be made. These fragments can then be ligated into plasmids and transformed into bacteria.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform PCR. A solution containing the required substrates for PCR is flowed into the chip and through a mixer, on top of chip a heating element will be placed. The valves at both ends of the mixer are closed, isolating the mixture, and then the heating element performs temperature cycling. The liquid is then pushed out into an output receptacle for future use in the lab.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.

The plans for the metA BB construct induction were further discussed. Overnight colonies will be made of the construct and a negative control, then they will be diluted in 1 in 100 LB, allowed to grow to 0.4 OD, induced with 0.1 mM new IPTG, and harvested at a certain OD following this, then run on an SDS PAGE. This will test to see if the IPTG really would stimulate the production of the metA The cultures for the MinteinC (As it shall henceforth be known) grew well, but were not miniprepped. Once they are miniprepped, then site directed mutagenesis must be done. The cultures of the potential yddg biobricks grew well, and will be confirmed either by PCR of the plasmid using VR and VF2, or by restriction digest.

iGEM Team Heidelberg 2009: First Runner-Up, Winner of the PoPS Prize, Finalist, Best Wiki, Best New Standard
Mission: Spybricks
The Heidelberg 2009 team attempts to take Synthetic Biology a step further by introducing novel concepts for the work with mammalian cells, defining Synthetic Mammalian Biology (SMB). We are the first-ever team at iGEM trying to systematically develop a BioBrick library for use in mammalian cells. Being the first team of Heidelberg's ""SMB initiative"", we emphasize the central position of gene regulation. Our team's work therefore focused on synthetic mammalian promoters. We provide the foundations of a methodical library of such promoters, together with novel standards for their characterization.  We have developed an avant-garde method for the synthesis of mammalian promoters, and a bioinformatical model predicting such promoters which we test in vivo. Go to Project Abstract

Anti-LPS
Anti-LPS
Lipopolysaccharide  (LPS),  or endotoxin,  is  the major mediator of septic shock, a serious complication of Gram-negative  bacterial  infections in humans. Molecules that bind LPS and neutralize its biological effects or enhance  its clearance could have important clinical applications. Limulus anti-LPS factor  (LALF) binds LPS tightly,  and,  in animal models, reduces mortality when administered before or after LPS challenge or bacterial infection. The  wedge-shaped molecule has a striking charge distribution and amphipathicity that suggest  how it  can insert  into membranes. The binding site for LPS probably involves an extended amphipathic loop, and it has  been proposed that two mammalian LPS-binding proteins will have a similar  loop.  The amphipathic  loop structure  may be used in the  design of molecules  with therapeutic properties against septic shock.
Horseshoe crabs  (Limulus polyphemus and Tachypleus tridentatus) are  ancient arachnids that possess a primitive circulatory  system, the hemolymph, containing only one kind of cell, the hemocyte. Exposure  of hemocytes to bacterial endotoxins [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] results in the  activation of an intracellular coagulation cascade (Iwanaga et al., 1986), a  defense against microbial invasion. The system consists of several proteins,  including one that may inhibit the cascade, called anti-LPS factor(Morita et  al., 1985). Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) is a small (101 amino acids), basic  protein (Aketagawa et al., 1986; Muta et al., 1987), which binds and  neutralizes LPS (Wainwright et al., 1990) and has a strong anti-bacterial effect  on the growth of Gram-negative R-type bacteria (Morita et al., 1985)(22). Our  interest in determining the crystal structure of LALF arose from its potential  in designing molecules that would have therapeutic properties in humans. It"

DESIGNING HOW WE AGE
By using a synthetic biology approach to our gene therapy solutions we set the foundation for enabling modulation of our treatment over time as required. Through our discussions with the general public, Parliament, world leading academics and industrial experts, we have completed a comprehensive analysis of the social, economic and ethical implications of our application. We have incorporated our findings from human practices to design our BioBrick devices to be safer and controlled for human use.

Virginia,2014,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," crystal violet is mobilised with an acetic acid   solution and the absorption is determined. The absorption   values determine the amount of biofilm present in the   culture at the time of staining.
Methodology
Crystal violet trials were conducted with E.coli BL 21 (DE3) cultures grown with both LB and   soybroth media on 96 well plates. The 96 well plates’   columns were divided with different concentrations of IPTG   on the control (circular pSB1C3, and on the nhaR BioBrick with the IPTG inducible promoter. No IPTG was   added to the nhaR BioBrick with the constitutive promoter.   Chloramphenicol was added to all samples.
Experimental constants:
Strain of E. coli used: BL-21.
Amount of culture: 100 µL.
Amount of Chloramphenicol 20: .01 µL per well.
Experimental variables:
nhaR with IPTG inducible promoter vs. nhaR with   constitutive promoter. The IPTG inducible promoter used was   BBa_K215000 while the constitutive promoter used was   BBa_J23100.
Media used: LB vs Soybroth.

The nhaR BioBrick with the constitutive   promoter-NC in Figure 1 showed a 33% increase in   absorbance compared to the  circular pSB1C3. However, we   were not able to replicate the results in further trials.   This failure to replicate results can be attributed to   experimental inconsistencies in later trials.

The iGEM team Wageningen 2014 would like to present BananaGuard, a bacterial platform designed to control the Panama disease threatening banana cultivars all over the world. A combination of strategies will prevent Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense from infecting banana plants. Detection of F.oxysporum presence in the soil, by sensing fusaric acid , forms the first part of the BananaGuard system. Expression of four fungal growth inhibitors coupled to the sensor for fusaric acid forms the second part of the BananaGuard system. Making the expression of the fungal growth inhibitors dependent on fusaric acid sensing will enable BananaGuard to have a low impact on non-target organisms. Resistance to fusaric acid is very important in this context. Even though moderate fusaric acid resistance is endogenous for our host organism Pseudomonas putida [1], fusaric acid resistance is engineered allowing the system to be transferable to different host organisms.
When releasing a genetically modified organism into the soil, horizontal gene transfer as well as the risk that non-target organisms are outcompeted need to be taken into account [2]. Therefore biological containment forms the third part of the BananaGuard system. Horizontal gene transfer will be avoided by a double dependent plasmid system . The loss or gain of one of the two modified plasmids will cause the host to die. Additionally, a self-destruction system called Kill-Switch , that will be automatically activated upon BananaGuard completing its function will protect the natural balance within the soil (Figure 1). Engineering a bacterial platform for biological control of F.oxysporum based on P. putida shows"

Cooperation with Wetlab
The entire summer, the UIUC software team and wetlab, worked in conjunction as we met every week to update each other on our progress and to collaborate on many issues. Collaboration included administrative tasks, recruitment for the next year, and community outreach.
Modeling for UIUC Bioware
The Illinois Bioware team’s project was to develop bacteria able to facilitate the removal of heavy metals, a process known as bioremediation. The metal that was focused on was Arsenic. To test the program as well as to aid the Illinois Software team in their experimental procedure, we utilized the Constraint-based reconstruction analysis software1 through MATLAB to provide a prediction of growth for the Escherichia coli cells with the proteins implemented. In this modeling, we made the assumptions that the primary protein additions are the Arsenite/antimonite transporter (ArsB), DNA-binding transcriptional repressor (ArsR) and maltose outer membrane porin (LamB) proteins are the most influential components of the team’s Escherichia coli strain when in a medium containing the heavy metal, arsenic. The ArsB protein functions as a membrane transporting pump of arsenate, arsenite and antimonite outside of the cell while utilizing ATP4. The ArsR transcriptional repressor functions within a cell by regulating the expression of the arsRBC that is directly involved in creating resistance to arsenic4. Finally, the LamB protein functions as a maltoporin-like protein by transporting maltodextrins across the membrane2.
The uptake rate of arsenic by ArsB was determined by Meng, et al. (2004). The dynamic flux balance analysis result (Figure 1) was determined with a initial concentration of 10-3 micromoles and a initial biomass of 0.1 milligrams of Dry Weight"

The final design of our product looks like this:
This basic design is the first step to tackling the concerns we came across when talking to professionals about our project.
It is a filter designed to target the desired bacteria (for our project we chose Vibrio cholerae and Shigella) and prevent it from causing infection. The small filter with the bacteria inside means the bacteria won’t be ingested, and therefore prevents any problems of the E. coli and RNA not surviving in the body. Also, having the filter come in a bottle would increase the chance of our filter being used in developing countries as well asproviding a container for storing water."
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," (including transposase fragmentation).
After the sequencing run, we followed the workflow defined in Sequencing alignment protocol . The alignment results showed that most of the reads (>99 %) aligned to dxCas9 DNA used as positive control. Analysis of aligned reads to sample treated with our fusion protein showed zero sequences aligned to Tn5 DNA reference (non-target of our fusion) and 89 reads aligned to the target EPO plasmid DNA. These reads indicated that the integration of sequencing adapters preferred the linearized EPO plasmid DNA rather than Tn5 DNA for sequencing. Closer look at the aligned sequences rendered one sequence read presented in figure 23, where we have a clear example of targeted adapter integration next to the gRNA flanking site (figure 23).
Figure 23. A) Alignment of DNA sequence read with target EPO cds in plasmid DNA. (B) Zoom into the sequence alignment to determine sgRNA target. Fusion protein depicted with arrows representing binding of dxCas9 position (red) and the addition of sequencing adapters (blue).
These preliminary results show the function of adapter integration directed by our fusion protein to the sgRNA complementary site. The efficiency of integration was not high and some of the aligned reads showed extended regions summing up to long reads of 2 - 11 kbp. More experimentation should be done to obtain conclusive data on these rare events, but most importantly to define better conditions for the integration assay. The low efficiency of this integration could be explained by different factors explained below:
During the purification of the fusion protein, there could be contamination by DNA attached to some domain of the protein (as they are DNA binding proteins). This contamination could come from the cells used to produce the protein.
Purification of the fusion protein was done with heparin column, and other DNA interacting domain-like proteins could be present in the protein mixture.
Conditions of the integration assay could be suboptimal to favour reaction kinetics of the fusion protein.
Incompatibility of buffers required for transposase and dxCas9 binding reactions, or incompatibility of these buffers with ONT sequencing buffers.
Probable suboptimal compatibility of our designed sequencing adapters with  ONT sequencing platform. The specific adapters’ sequence is not known due to corporate secrets.
We have, however, proven that our fusion protein is able to load sequencing adapters and integrate them at a specific site in their target DNA, allowing this DNA molecule to be sequenced with ONT sequencing platform. Moreover, we were able to identify 89 sequencing events aligned to the DNA target, and even analyse the possible"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm is used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes of leaf nodes could uniquely determine a tree structure. With help of Huffman codes, it is simple to compare the forest structure after and before exchange of both chains.
To go further, we must define the preference of each forest structure due to exchange of chains: compare each node of the first tree by their Huffman codes and weights in the same way as comparison of strings and if equal, compare the next until difference appears or to the end of either forest. If one is less than another, it has higher priority. With this definition, the order of those equal chains in the first-stage sorting is determined by the one which generates the forest strucuture with highest priority among all possibilities. By performing this algorithm for all groups of equal chains obtained from the first-stage sorting, we could find both the unique order of the chains and the groups of equivalent chains (exchange of the order fo several chains in the same equivalent group will not change the forest structure). The figure illustrates this idea graphically.
It is easy to compare two structures with help of chain sorting. We only need to compare first the chain list in order, chain by chain, and if equal, compare both associated forest structures. If two structures are same, the comparison must be equal since chains and trees are all in their unique order. If the comparison is equal, they must be the same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the chains as well as its associated forest structure.
Structural pattern match of template species
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.

Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," for getting the bacteriocin into the target cell; and a cytotoxic domain, responsible for target cell damage. The cytotoxic domain can take many forms, it can be a DNase or RNase, or can have pore forming or peptidoglycan endopeptidase activity to name a few.
Bacteriocins have corresponding immunity proteins which are expressed by their producing cell. This protein serves the function of inhibiting the toxic nature of its cognate toxin. This protein works by taking part in a protein-protein interaction with the previously mentioned toxin and dissociates from this complex when the bacteriocin is released from the cell resulting in the toxin being activated and able to attack target cells.
Bacteriocins and immunities: The producing cell contains an immunity protein which inhibits the bacteriocins that it produces. When the bacteriocins leave this cell, the immunity protein remains in the producing cell, making it immune to the toxin as it leaves the cell and attacks the target cells.
Since bacteria are constantly evolving resistance to antibacterials, we needed to come up with a way to prevent them from becoming resistant to our bacteriocins. We decided to truncate the bacteriocin to remove the cytotoxic domain and incorporate a multiple cloning site onto the receptor binding domain of our bacteriocins, this enables variation of our bacteriocins cytotoxic domain, ensuring that our target bacteria will not be able to recognise the bacteriocin.
Colicins are the name given to the bacteriocins which are secreted by Escherichia coli to target other strains of E. coli and similar bacteria such as Salmonella enterica, which are common causes of infection in livestock, therefore these are the bacteriocins we decided to work with.
First we wanted to test the toxicity of full length, unmodified colicins, so we can compare this to the toxicity of our modified colicins. We started working with colicin Ia, E3 and E9.
Colicin Ia/E3/E9
Colicin Ia is a protein that is used by species of E. coli in order to kill closely related species of E. coli in certain circumstances e.g. competition. The producer cell normally contains a protein which confers immunity to this toxin, which in this case is BBa_K1962001 . And this protein is believed to form a complex with the cytotoxic domain of the bacteriocin rendering it inactive. When this bacteriocin is secreted the immunity protein dissociates from the complex leaving the cytotoxic domain active resulting in the pore forming activity of"

Daily problems and ethical challenges
Synbio implies various ethical issues. Some are shared by all the sciences, others are quite new. One of the challenges of the ethics in Synbio is to bring a legal framework, in order to avoid scientists playing God. We don't have to and we shouldn't make the same mistake as the one done with the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO).
Are we playing God ?
One of the inherent issue with science is terrorism. It evolves, and pretends to use biology and Synbio to make some new weapons as pandemic viruses. For example, some biologists plan to recreate some eradicated virus, like the polio one or Spanish influenza one instead of looking for new vaccines, in case of the emergence of a new like-virus, or the study of antigenic shifts in virus... But the impact of a biological attack is frightful: billions of dead people before the administration of an efficient vaccine. And the problem of Synbio is that there is no need of a real equipment or a real laboratory. Proof is: just by making a phone call and giving some DNA sequences he got on internet, this journalist succeeded to take delivery at his home of the small pox virus. This is the kind of facts that discredit all the efforts made by the scientists to reassure the public.
Furthermore, the biohackers, as they have been called, are people who succeed in making some Synbio in their home. And we can’t keep from thinking to an old story, of a crazy scientist giving life to a new creature, made by assembled pieces… Indeed, the parallel with the Mary Shelley’s creature, Frankenstein, is striking…
And that’s why some rules have to be established, to avoid the creation of real Wookies or Gremlins, because authorities will be incompetent in the control of these new kinds of life.
In our tentative to design a synthetic multifunctionnal enzymes , we've planned to realize an anticipated and oriented evolution. In animals, Fatty-Acid-Synthase (FAS) is a multi-domain enzyme. It"

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Practices#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," very good research but you have to be able to commercialise it. And if you’re taking products to the market then you need the industry input to do that.
J: I believe that our university is recognising it, and trying to liaise with industry.
JE: Yes, I think that the University of Edinburgh is especially good for research. There is for example ground-breaking research in stem cells and regenerative medicine, located at the Bioquarter, and the stem cell medical research centre. They are looking at developing treatments for some of the most debilitating diseases: Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, motor neurone disease, and it’s a bench to bedside approach. What is significant is the level of expertise that is located there, in the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine with 230 researchers, who are working on the stem cells and other regenerative therapies. So you’re getting a critical mass of expertise in one place. Next to that, you’ve got academics and clinicians working together.
J: So what are the plans for the future? If Scotland were to vote ‘yes’ in the next year’s referendum [for Scottish independence], is the Scottish Government going to invest further in the life sciences sector?
JE: Absolutely, this is a priority in the strategic prerogative of government. We ought to build our economy in a sustainable way. The Life sciences has been identified within that as a very important sector. The government is doing a number of things to promote Scotland as a location for inward investment. The government gets this, and as a whole is working together to achieve this ambition for Scotland. One of the ways in which we do that is we bring all of the key industry players round the table, in something called the Scottish Life Sciences Industry Advisory Board (LISAB) which is co-chaired by an industry person called John Brown, and the cabinet secretary for health and wellbeing. So it’s not just a talking shop, there are key objectives and milestones that are agreed within that framework. Having the cabinet secretary around the table makes sure the actions are followed through. One of the actions which came from that is the length of time it takes for commercial clinical trials to be approved being reduced significantly. That’s really important, if a global research company is sitting in the States deciding how to spend this money, how quickly they can get their approval for this research is important, and Scotland is able to offer a very quick turnaround on the approval times for commercial clinical trials. Also, although Scotland is a small country of 5 million people, we have 14 geographical health boards. So if you were doing multi-cent"

1. Introduction
Sequencing the entire genome of an athlete is relatively expensive and time-consuming. If we would sequence the genome of each 918 medal winners at the Olympics Games in the Rio de Janeiro of 2016, it would have taken at total of 1836 hours (2 days per athlete) and 35802 flowcells (39 flowcells per athlete) ( Jain, et al. 2018 ). Minimizing sequencing time and costs is already accomplished by implementing our targeted sequencing approach as it only requires one flowcell per athlete. However, this is not the limit that we aim for as speed can always be increased. Prof. Hagan Bayley from Oxford University, one of the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd., Oxford UK, suggested that multiplexing with additional barcoding would solve both problems: time and costs. Therefore, we implemented the possibility for barcoding in our detection method. In order to do so, we developed an iGEM barcoding tool by improving upon an existing iGEM DNA translation tool developed by iGEM Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 .
2. Multiplexing by Barcoding
Multiplexing is the simultaneous sequencing of multiple samples from different athletes using one sequencing device. In order to be able to assign the output sequences to the corresponding athlete, the output sequence should be labeled with an athlete specific mark. However, the sequence should be marked in such a way that the label does not disturb or interrupt the sequencing. Therefore, we decided to label the DNA sample with an athlete specific sequence: the DNA barcode ( Bayliss et al, 2017 ).
The barcode is a DNA sequence that is placed between the mosaic elements for the transposase and the Oxford Nanopore adapter sequence. This barcoded sequencing adapter is picked up by the Tn5-dxCas9 fusion protein and integrated into the target DNA of a specific athlete. When the DNA is sequenced by pore sequencing, the barcode is readable in the sequencing output and is used to assign the DNA directly to the corresponding athlete (figure 1).

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

After than, each spot (donor, recipîent, control, two conjugative) was resuspended on liquid LB and some dilution was done (from 10-2 to 10-6). Each dilution was put on LB plate with         adequate antibiotics and putted at 37°C O/N, to check the result of conjugation and/or Crispr/Cas9 system.
Classic conjugation assay used for our test
Conjugation in plate test 1 (non quantitative) targeting AmpR (TEM1)
Donor (D) : S17-1 with our killer plasmid (sgRNA targeting AmpR, resistance: KanR)
Control (CTRL) : S17-1 with our conjugative plasmid pK18mob, with Cas9 BUT without the sgRNA (no targeting). KanR
Recipient (R) : TOP10 (with a TEM1 gene in chromosome)
Conjugation time : 3 hours 30 min
D.O. (600 nm) = about 1 (for recipient strain), about 0,5 (for donor/control strain)
Conjugation in plate test 1: On left : Donor and recipient strain after conjugation. On right : control and recipient strain after conjugation.
First result seems to show that conjugation append (at least in control strain) and that donor strain (if have conjugated) seems to kill the AmpR gene as expected. This first test is non quantitative, so we don’t know exactly how             much bacteria we have, and more test are needed.
Efficiency of Crispr/Cas9 system by conjugation.
To verify the effectiveness of our system using Cas9 carried by a mobilizable plasmid, we contacted the number of events or a recipient cell (TOP10 PyrF::TEM-1) lost its red phenotype when losing its plasmid pSB4K5_bbaJ04450 after         conjugation with a donor cell (S17-1) containing the mobilizable plasmid containing Cas9 and an anti-RFP RNA guide. A negative control was performed using a donor strain that did not include guide RNA. Donor cells were counted after         dilution on LB kanamycin and recipients on LB ampicillin. Colony counts are carried out three times for each dilution. The effectiveness of our system using Cas9 carried by a mobilizable plasmid give 27% for a D:R ratio 1:169.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Waste Degradation: SRF_-_-_TEXT.html," waste is used as a carbon source for P(3HB) production. P(3HB) is produced by organisms containing the pha CAB operon, originally found in soil bacteria such as Ralstonia eutropha. The operon contains three genes which are members of the pathway required to make P(3HB). P(3HB) is used as a storage molecule in the organisms which produce it. They do this when nutrients are limiting but when there is a plentiful carbon source.
P(3HB) is produced commercially by several companies. One of the crucial factors in whether production is economical or not is  the efficiency of bioplastic production. We have hugely increased the efficiency of P(3HB) production; an important step in making our system feasible.
To scale up the production of P(3HB), our system would require large amounts of purified sugars. We would, therefore, hydrolyse the long polysaccharide components to release the sugars. This is a current industrial pre-treatment technique to allow the fermentation of ligno-cellulosic biomass.

Visit to INMEGEN
Alongside iGem Team TecCEM_HS and both other high schools and undergraduate classes, we visited Mexico’s National Institute of Genomic Medicine (Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica). For a whole day, we assisted to different workshops, visits to the laboratories of the institute, etc. Where we were able to exchange ideas, opinions and recommendations about both our respective projects and synthetic biology as a whole. On top of that, we were introduced to the principal diseases that affect the Mexican population nowadays and that have been found to have an important genetic factor to their origin.
Meetup Latin-America
As it’s become a custom for Latin-American teams, the iGem Latin-America Meetup took place this year in Guanajuato, Mexico. We were present in all the videoconferences between the main teams who organized the meetup and helped with the overall organization. The Meetup represents and opportunity for a variety of iGem teams from High school to Undergraduate school to exchange ideas and recommendations about each other’s work.
Sponsorship partnering across Tec system
Alongside most of the iGem teams who come from Mexico and from the Tecnológico de Monterrey system of schools and colleges, we cooperated in the searching for sponsorships, especially regarding a sponsorship for flight tickets to Boston.
We are also in the process of discussing a system for delivery of the iGem kits for future competitions from a single Tec school to the rest of us as we believe that would better the efficiency with which every team receives the parts and reduce delays.
Surveys
We cooperated with a wide variety of iGem teams by answering surveys which were sent to us about many different topics. We believe that even every action such as these, small as they are, can help improve the modelling and information available to every team, and thus help to improve everyone’s project!

UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Functionalizing Fibers_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s physical properties.  Therefore, spinning the functionalized proteins with normal silk proteins helps maintain the physical integrity of the resulting fiber.  In order to get the functional peptides to associate with the silk, we attach the peptide to either a short silk repeat or some other sequence with affinity for silk.
For our particular project, the proteins that we plan to co-spin are natural Bombyx mori silkworm silk and a recombinant protein fusion consisting of a silk-GFP hybrid. There are two recombinant fusions that we are testing: the first is a single MaSp2 subunit of Nephila clavipes silk genetically fused to superfolder GFP, and the second is superfolder GFP flanked by the N and C termini of Bombyx mori silk.
The sequence for one of our silk-GFP hybrids. This is based off of a sequence used in vivo in experiments by Iizuka, et al. [1]
sfGFP in these experiments can be swapped out for any other functional protein that is small enough in size so as to not interfere with the silk fiber formation when co-spun with natural silk.
The silk sequences in the protein fusions function somewhat as affinity domains, encouraging the fusions to bind to the native silk proteins at homologous amino acid sequences during the co-spinning process.
This has been previously accomplished in vivo in recombinant silkworms, but we aim to translate the process into an in vitro protocol [1] .
Functionalization Constructs
Functional recombinant silk fibers can be produced through several means. One of the approaches our team took to make such fiber is by fusing GFP to one subunit of MaSp2. In theory, the MaSp2 subunit would facilitate intermolecular interactions between the GFP-MaSp2 protein fusion and the native silk proteins, allowing the GFP to intercalate into the final fiber when extruded via co-spinning. The part was produced using standard iGEM Assembly RFC10, after replacing the stop codon with two nucleotides at the end of GFP to keep everything in frame. The final construct consists of a 6x His Tag fused to the N-terminus of GFP in the GFP-MaSp2 fusion, flanked by the BioBrick prefix and suffix.
What We've Done
This summer we have established protocols for processing Bombyx mori silk for co spinning. (see protocol page and processing silk page).  We have also designed, ordered, and assembled functional silk sequences.  These sequences include the N terminus-sfGFP-C termin"

For more details, read Directive 2000/54/EC.
Currently there are no limits to worker exposure to biological agents. However, employers are required under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 to provide a safe working environment that minimises health risks. This can include providing information, supervision, training and protective equipment (if necessary). A risk assessment must also be performed and the employer must take required measures to reduce these risks.
There are no rules regarding specifically the exposure to biological agents; the employers must monitor the exposure levels under the same rules for other substances (Act 3214/1978).
Ministry of Health by the Public Health Institute (ISP) provides the following services:
1. Generation of protocols for risks and exposure evaluation.
2. Specific actions over biological agents and disinfection.
3. Elaboration of guides for reception, manipulation, transport and biological agents diffusion in the labour place.
4. Generation of new protocols associated with the area as elimination and disposal of dangerous biological residues.
5. Certification of bio-clean areas, biohazards control zones and sampling of viable bioparticules.
General requirements for biological agents manipulation:
1. Use of personal protection equipment (PPE) according to the activity (D.S. N°173/82 by Health Ministry).
2. The PPE must not hinder in the work done. Workers must be informed about the right use of PPE before to start working.
3. There are regulations for every biosafety level:

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," so far the best teaching resource for Maya. It explores the functions through practical step-by-step examples. It also includes a tutorial on Dynamics and a variety of plug-ins such as nParticle which might be relevant for our project. It is a relatively long document so it will take at least a week to go through it, but it is extremely useful for utilization of advanced with Maya functions. This week we also arranged regular meeting with Dr. Nygren which will take place every Thursday morning so we can discuss the progress of the engineering and modelling team and receive his valuable feedback. We also signed up for Matlab workshops which will take place on Wednesday, June 18th.  Next week we are also planning on contacting Cesar from Autodesk to further discuss Maya applications and software, and potential skype meetings in the future.
Week 7: June 16th - June 20th
This week consisted of continuation of looking into Matlab applications and data analysis as well as into what materials we will need to purchase to begin modelling with the Arduino Uno microcontroller.  On the 18th we attended a Matlab workshop and information session that was focused on proper data analysis and representation.  Additionally we have begun weekly engineering meetings focused on quantitative modelling and the state of our prototyping.   We have begun to look into how we can use quantitative analysis for modelling purposes.  We have focused on how to optimize the device and its respective materials, dimensions, and components.  We have also looked into how to use this data and analysis to reevaluate and make changes to our prototype device.  At our meeting with Dr. Nygren we further discussed the potential to use technology such as Bluetooth to add onto the device in which the results could be easily read or documented on a smartphone or computer to compliment the patients file.  Although this aspect of the design would not be designed for rural areas in the developing world, there is potential of the modular device to have a worldwide impact in locations with more resources.
The proposed reporter for our system is a fluorescent protein such as Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) or Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Another option for the reporter is lacZ. Using a light sensor, and potentially a filter to ensure we are not detecting ambient light, we will detect the presence of light and convert it to a voltage that the Arduino Uno can detect and display a result.  This will most likely be designed as a closed environment in order to eliminate other sources of light that could potentially trigger the sensor.  The concept of light dependent resistors was also discussed, however after further research it was discovered that the level of sensitivity"
UNSW_Australia,2016,Team:UNSW Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a PCR on the overlapping PCR's product, hoping to amplify the full product specifically from the mix; this only marginally improved the outcome, so we did another PCR using that as template, only to again see little improvement; so we shelved work on alMGS for now.
We did, however, have more luck with g3p and tolR, as we digested their PCR products with EcoRI and PstI, ligated them into the linearised plasmid backbones from the DNA distribution kit, and transformed them into our cloning strain. We put g3p into the kanamycin backbone, and tolR into the tetracycline backbone, such that down the line we could pop both plasmids into a single cell and see how the two proteins interact
Week 8: July 18 - July 24
CRISPR Team
Primers arrived on Thursday, and so we repeated the process of converting pKD-sgRNA-ack , this time to -degP and to -tolA, which was quite arduous (see Week 6). On a nicer note, sequencing results revealed that -degS plasmid had been taken up by transformants 24, 25, and 26, and so we could continue working with these.
Overexpression Team
We began the process of screening our transformants for g3p- and tolR-bearing plasmids. This involved performing colony PCRs to amplify the insert, running the products on a gel, and observing for the correct size. We ran over 50 reactions; nothing seemed to be running consistently, making it seem like there were no positive hits, but we then ran a gel in which ladders were placed in every lane, revealing that there was an inconsistent, random effect of lane number on migration distance. So we got a new gel tank, reran the colony PCRs, and finally identified a putative positive hits for two of our g3p constructs and one of our tolR constructs; we then miniprepped the plasmids from these. By Friday we were exhausted of repeating the same procedure over and over again, but we managed to PCR amplify the insert (again) from these minipreps, and submit them for sequencing - always good to get more confirmation than just size!
Week 9: July 25 - July 31

We ran a gel of what we thought should be new pKD-sgRNA-tolA and -degP plasmids, but no band appeared. Hence, we retried entire conversion process"

Antibiotic Resistance: integrating Teaching and SMITe
The 4th component of this teaching programme was structured differently; we conducted a preliminary review of the students abilities to weigh up ethical conundrums through the first set of case studies in weeks 1 and 2 (ethics for estrogen). Then, for this final component in September we reversed the teacher-pupil roles by getting students to design their own case study, centered on issues raised by the threat of antimicrobial resistance. We felt it was important to"

SoxR and pSoxS library design and characterisation
When we heard that the Oxford team would be using SoxR/SoxS parts we were excited to form a collaboration with them. While designing our constructs we realised a fairly significant limitation on the use of the SoxR/SoxS system: the lack of a characterised library. We saw an opportunity, and decided to design a library of our own to help us understand and exploit this genetic system further. In collaboration with the Oxford iGEM team, we designed a SoxR protein library and a pSoxS promoter library, which we characterised in our respective systems, the results of which can be found in our results page . Our improved part, submitted for a gold award, was taken from this library. We would like to thank the Oxford team for collaborating with us on this endeavour.
New Scientist Live Science Fair at the Excel Centre, London
New Scientist Live (NSL) was an amazing platform for presenting our project to the general public. The people we met were interested in science, but relatively unaware of the field of synthetic biology. With the Oxford team, we manned a booth at NSL for four days. We spoke to hundreds of guests about synthetic biology and our respective projects. Also, as part of the collaboration with Oxford, we designed a flyer with the aim of introducing synthetic biology and iGEM to the general public, as well as educating people on some basic molecular biology techniques we use in the lab. We would like to extend our warmest thanks to the Oxford team for collaborating with us on communicating our projects and the field of synthetic biology to the public.
Troubleshooting and graphic design workshop
We knew that towards the end of iGEM we could be facing roadblocks in our project and that we would all be quite stressed about trying to complete everything in time for the wiki freeze. We predicted that the pressures at this stage of the competition"

Grenoble,2011,Team:Grenoble#Notebook Rawhide_-_-_TEXT.html," session, we tested our enzymes.
We tried to digest each site individually. We obtained linearized plasmid. So, enzymes are well working.
Cloning session:
-> Biobricks which require an RBS and have the same antibiotic resistance as RBS plasmid, were transfered on pSB1AC3 plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance:
TetR
LuxR
LuxI
LacI
GFP
Lycopen
-> Fha1 was also transfered on pSB1AT3 plasmid to simplify selection of the right constructions.
Digestions: a gel checking of the restriction results were performed.
Spreading over Petri dish
On the Restriction Gel, We obtain the right size for all inserts.
Because pSB1AC3 is a double resistance plasmid (ampicillin and chloramphenicol) and RBS plasmid is on ampicillin, as previously the right constructions won't be selected.
Cloning session:
-> 3rd-step construction:
pLac + MerR-CinR
pConst + MerR-CinR
-> 2nd-step construction:
RBS-CinI
Preculture: To perform this new cloning session, we first selected 5 colonies from the Petri dish of MerR-CinR construction.
Digestions: a gel checking of the restriction results were performed.
Purification: In order to check and extract the wright insert.
Ligations : Standard Protocol was performed. MerR-CinR was inserted into pLac and pConst plasmids.
