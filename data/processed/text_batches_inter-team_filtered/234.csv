To introduce our projects to the visitors, we made a poster for each project. Using figures, we tried our best to make it easy for people from any background to understand. Besides posters for our projects, we also made an introduction to iGEM to let more people know about it.
The five projects that we introduced at the poster session were: solar battery, treatment for pollen allergy, lie detector, Bank E. coli, and fertilizer.
 
 
• Solar  Battery
 
 
Solar energy is one of the alternative sources of energy widely used in the world. In this project, we made a solar battery by using photosynthetic bacteria and current generating bacteria to generate power. Wherever sunlight shines, electricity can be generated by this solar battery. It was invented and improved in several institutes, but the low efficiency and inconvenient hardware still tend to be a problem. Therefore, we tried to improve the efficiency of the existing bacteria-using solar battery to make it practical.

• Treatment for Pollen Allergy
 
 
 
In Japan, it is said that one in five people suffers from pollen allergy. More than twenty million people suffer from symptoms, and the number is increasing every year. In order to cure this, we thought of using E. coli in immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a recently developed treatment that can completely cure the allergy. You introduce allergen into the body in very small amounts, and by gradually increasing it, you can suppress the body′s hyper-allergic reaction. However, there are several defects in this treatment. You have to go to the hospital for treatment many times, and it takes three to five years for a complete recovery. By using E. coli, we tried to invent a faster and easier immunotherapy.

• Lie Detector
 
 
In  this project, we tried to make a lie detector by using E. coli. By putting Na+  channel in the flagellum motor, E. coli responds to the sodium ion contained in a liar′s sweat and starts running. If the E. coli moves, it comes in contact with lysozyme and the outer membrane dissolves. Then, ATP inside the E. coli is released to react with luciferase, producing a glow.

Test of contaminations found in boxes: Contaminated saw dust and PDA plated to ID them. The contaminated PDA might be A. oryzae and the contaminated saw dust might be S. commune. This is interesting because we might have found a way to get spores from S. commune.
Drylab Overview
This week Hannah and Lau were helping Myco-lab in growing “ice cube fungi”. They are being grown on a various substrates and inoculated at different times and temperatures. Mathias was on holiday. Nicolai was “fighting” with DTU skylab, as their technicians bailed on appointments, making the progression of the DIY hydraulic press slow and wasteful. Late friday, the small project was completed, only missing some teflon tape to seal the thread. Over the weekend Nicolai made a short video showing the manufacturing process. Mathies planned the data structures for the experimental setup for DTU byg. The purpose is to minimize the necessary test that have to be done, to save time and resources.

Tumblr Blog
Discussions on Biotechnology are often false biased because of a lack of detailed knowledge in this topic. Besides organising lectures and raising attention with facebook and twitter, we also established a Tumblr blog , where we continuously upload articles about Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology to make science accessible for broad public we are write in understandable language.
Articles entitled basic principles of biology, methods of gene technology like the PCR or modelling of biologic processes. We gave insights into genetics, cell structure and important ceellular processes. Moreover, we wrote about the pros and cons of biotechnology and our personal stories directly from the lab.  We aimed to catch the attention of our followers by providing funny and easy understandable texts that contain reliable and unbiased information to increase the amount of constructive discusssions about synthetic biology.
We were very happy to host guest articles from the iGEM Team Tübingen presenting their great project on blood conversion and iGEM Team Freiburg about the fascinating topic of optogenetics.

We examined our working hypothesis to “Flavorator” that farnesol can show either the antibacterial or bacteriostatic activity in a box like Kozoko.
Confirmation of anti-mold, anti-maggots and antibacterial activities of  farnesol.
E.coli can easily synthesize antimicrobial volatiles farnesol and geraniol. We examined the effects of three antimicrobial volatiles against bacteria which rot food.

Aalto-Helsinki,2017,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," insights and feedback. After accidentally stumbling upon the molecule Dermcidin, while looking into another idea, we also had a meeting with Bayer. The company has expertise in healthcare and at that point we were certain that we would end up going in that direction. We also discussed our ideas with the representatives of our sponsor ThermoFisher Scientic. From these visits, discussions with our suprevisors and scientific literature we came up with the idea to use Dermcidin as a coating for medical devices with the aid of a cellulose binding domain, connected to Dermcidin with a linker.  In the beginning, we also investigated the possibility of 3D printing the Demcidin coating or medical devices themselves with the bound Dermcidin molecules. We consulted several experts from Aalto University to figure out if this approach would be beneficial to our project, but there were several problems like probable activity loss in high temperatures as well as uneven shrinking of dry cellulose, which would make many cellulose based applications like cathedrals basically impossible. Since 3D printing didn't seem to bring any additional value to the project, we decided to focus mostly on wound care and an alternative for silver containing dressings.
Business Thinking in iGEM Project?
From Biodesign Finland we met two medical doctors, Sami Elamo and Katja Ivanitskiy, who are part of Biodesign Finland, which aims to innovate new medical technologies in interdisciplinary teams. We discussed our idea of immobilizing Dermcidin on a cellulose surface and the possible aspects we should take into consideration. They emphasized that we should figure out how to produce things cheaply since that would help our product to compete with current wound dressings. We were also brainstorming on different applications for our peptide and how to improve the stability in the end product. We also got more knowledge about patenting innovations and were introduced to Provisional Patent.   After the meeting we continued investigating the different application possibilities, but we also started to think about our project more from the business angle. This meant that we started to look into scale-up possibilities in order to make the product cheaper and also examined the patenting options in collaboration with a law student from iGEM team Tec-Chihuahua . At the end of the project we even made a full business plan .

Dr. Kaufmann enriched our work with her motto: ""science affects everybody and therefore, everybody should be able to affect science"". Following up this idea, we invited everybody for an open lecture with Kevin Esvelt , presented our project at TEDx , visited a school , and hosted a high school class for some DNA experiments in our iGEM lab. We received diverse encouragements during all these events, which struck new paths for our project. Furthermore, Dr. Kaufmann highlighted the importance of our PACE simplification PREDCEL. According to her statement, that methods should be cheap enough to be used by every scientist, who wants to contribute to the questions in synthetic biology, for which it is is essential to invest time in simplifying processes. Good science should be transparent, method descriptions should be easily accessible, and experiments should be reproducible. With our standardized evolutionary toolbox , the simplified setup PREDCEL and our inter-lab study for mutagenesis plasmid activity evaluation , we would like to contribute to open science for everybody.

Prof. Michael Wink is one of the most experienced professionals we talked to. It was a great pleasure for us to be profiting from his store of knowledge in the field of evolution. Our concerns that directed evolution approaches like PREDCEL and PACE might be too ambitious and too complex for a student project were alleviated by Prof. Wink. He gave us intellectual input and helped us with recommendations about existing literature by which we were able to translate our ideas to the laboratory ""bench"". As he pointed out that silicon besides carbon-based life is a possibility on other planets, we feel encouraged to pursue our research on enzymes that form carbon-silicon bonds.

Hangzhou is widely known by water- related UNESCO World Heritages – West Lake and Grand Canal, however, severe water pollution has been received more and more attention in recent years. Another environmental pollution problem that is as important as water is soil pollution, especially heavy metal pollution. Hence, we want to design a operability device to solve the above environmental problems.
After a series of brainstorming as well as literature research, the project direction was becoming clear. Our topic inspired by a paper published in Science, March 2018 [1]. It mainly talked about the gene expression of methanobactine which is originated from methanotrophy, which triggers us the idea of using this gene to eliminate the heavy metal (copper) pollution in surrounding environment.
In order to confirm the project direction, we launched the human practice research carefully. The research included 3 parts: general background investigation, public survey, field trip and professional interview; the research objective focused on two aspects:
1) Whether the heavy metal pollution problem, especially copper, is very important to environment and public health.
2) Whether synthetic biology method could be accepted.
General Background Investigation
Heavy metal pollution refers to the environmental pollution caused by heavy metals and their compounds. Although some heavy metals are essential trace elements, most of them can be toxic to all forms of life at high concentrations due to formation of complex compounds within the cell. Unlike organic pollutants, heavy metals once introduced into the environment cannot be biodegraded. They persist indefinitely and cause pollution of air, water, and soils. Thus, the main strategies of pollution control are to reduce the bioavailability, mobility, and toxicity of metals. Methods for remediation of heavy metal-contaminated environments include physical removal, detoxification, bioleaching, and phytoremediation[2][3].
Heavy metal pollution is a worldwide challenge, recently, because of industrialization, heavy metal pollution has become a serious problem in China[4]. There were lots of heavy metal pollution accidents have been reported frequently[5]. Moreover, according to Investigation report on nationwide soil pollution 2014, the soil heavy metal pollution points rate has been 16.1%, especially in mining area and populated areas. Copper"

Such an approach, however,does rely on precise parameter definition – and, as a result, we spent considerable time refining these parameters.  In particular, this “tuning” was done by taking a set of observed data (in our case, fish biomass throughout the last 60 years) and changing these parameters until our model’s predictions resembled the data as closely as possible.  Being able to precisely predict past biomass values, ensured that we had some grounding for making future estimates.
Unfortunately the global fish biomass data, the cornerstone of the tuning process, was not something which was readily available.  A “total fish biomass” time series did not, to our knowledge, exist.  We had to create it ourselves.
RAM database
After further investigation, we found that there were many cases in which biomass data was available for specific species in specific regions – this data being produced mostly for the sake of commercial stock assessment. RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database is a “compilation of stock assessment results for commercially exploited marine populations from around the world”. We believe that it is the most complete compilation of Stock Assessment Results to this date. Another advantage of the RAM Database, compared to other databases (NOAA, ICES & etc.), is that it combines data from different regional agencies, thus ensuring good global coverage. Effectively, the RAM Database includes data from all known to us sources; therefore we decided to use it for our further work.

Data manipulation
The data presented in RAM, in some cases, was not entirely homogeneous. For example, the Spawning Stock Biomass (total weight of those fish that have reached the breeding age) – the data figure we were interested in - was often presented in different measures.  These measures ranged from weight in tonnes/kg/pounds to the biomass of the annually produced eggs and non-specified measures. We had to omit the datasets, which were not directly convertible to tonnes.

The next step was to “combine” the individual species-specific time series into one, which would become our biomass data.

We have made a series of tutorial videos explaining how to use some basic lab methods, namely: PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis, heat-shock transformation, isolation/precipitation of plasmid DNA, and restriction. In our videos we demonstrate and explain in detail how to perform these procedures step by step in the real lab setting. Though our videos are initially made in Russian, they have English subtitles so that any person other than speaking Russian could use them as a tutorial. The videos are available at iGEM Tuebingen 2017 YouTube channel and we hope that they would contribute greatly to popularizing iGEM and synthetic biology."

High amount of glycerol might be needed for integration since previous experiment without glycerol did not result in any integration.
Since finally Tn5 has to function together with dxCas9, we will try to do the reaction in lower temperature, since dxCas9 might be denatured at 55°C.Therefore, in this experiment, the adapter loading and integration experiment will be done in one go, at 37°C for "

Supplementation with glucose did not seem to have any substantial effect. In contrast, E. coli did not form colonies on rumen fluid. The lack of a carbon source can be excluded as a reason for this finding as the same result was obtained for plates supplemented with glucose. Furthermore, the pH value in each case was about 6.5. It has been shown that at this pH value the growth of E. coli is inhibited by 69 % owing to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) present in rumen fluid [1]. Such VFAs could also be responsible for the growth inhibition observed here.  Another factor possibly leading to inhibited growth in future application but not tested in our experiments are ciliates feeding on bacteria like E. coli [2].

Due to this result we had to consider possibilities to introduce E. cowli into the rumen without harming the cells. In the past, encapsulation techniques have often been applied in cases when free probiotic cells could not survive to a sufficient degree in the desired environment [3]. One of the most widely used substances for encapsulation is alginate. Alginate beads could represent a low-priced and easy-to-use way to introduce the bacteria into the cow’s rumen without exposing the cow to a health risk while simultaneously protecting E. coli from getting in contact with the harmful surrounding [4]. In the course of our experiments, we produced beads with  a diameter of about 6 mm (Figure 2). To provide sufficient mechanical stability, the alginate concentration was adjusted.
Figure 2: Two exemplary beads coloured with carmine (left) and Patent Blue V (right)
However, the encapsulated bacteria still need to be able to take up methane. To demonstrate that methane could permeate the beads’ alginate structure, we dyed one portion of alginate beads with the food colorant Patent Blue V and another with carmine. The two portions were mixed and, after incubation overnight, had changed their colour mostly to purple, indicating that the two colorant molecules had diff"

Safety
The strains of E. coli that we have generated in the course of this project are not likely to cause disease or other bio-safety problems under standard laboratory conditions. None of the parts that we have generated in our project have a high inherent bio-safety risk, though it is conceivable that these parts could be used to along proteins that themselves have bio-safety issues. Therefore we stress that users of this technology verify that human risks from expressed proteins are minimal.

Secretion System
Our work on Type 3 Secretion System was done without involving live Salmonella bacteria. We used 2 BAC library fragments from Salmonella's DNA which was obtained from Salmonella Genetic Stock Centre (SGSC) following required procedures. These 2 fragments of salmonella genome is inserted in BAC Vector which is contained in E.Coli strain MG1655. Our instructor obtained appropriate permit from our universities safety officer of genetic recombinantion.  These E.Coli were acknowledged as non-pathogenic and permitted to be used under P1 safety level. However due to material transfer agreement between our laboratory and SGSC we can’t submit  Type 3 Secretion Apparatus (Syringe part of Type 3 Secretion System) to BioBrick Registry.

The first experiment was made by putting a circle of cotton into a beaker with wine and then drying it by waiting a few hours.
We had some cells that were in a transparent media composed of M9. This M9 is composed by cells without LB (LB have been removed by centrifugation, cells were re-suspended in PBS).
And we have fabric in M9 without strains and the piece of cotton with the wine stain.
As you can see, the results are not evidential. It seems that our negative control wash the wine stain in an as efficient way as the two other strains!
We redo the experiment but we waited three days until the cotton was enough stained. Then we autoclaved the cotton to make sure there is no others microorganisms. We used the same experimental conditions as before.
We made also an experiment with the platform the assay group designed.
We made three different dilution and we tested once again the ability of Pseudomonas and FS_M75 to degrade wine stain at 30°C.
We used Geneious to generate consensus sequences from each bacteria isolated and sequenced, through de novo alignement between the two chromatogram files (.ab1) provided vy GATC for each sequencing.
Thus, we were able to increase the quality of our sequences, to make them more reliable. We also trimmed them when the quality was too low.
Because of bad quality, or errors in sequencing, some strains of the 187 database were deleted.
Which explain why only 173 bacteria were used to create the phylogenetic tree.
We ran the tree thanks to Geneious software with the following parameters:
The Tree build model chosen was neighbor joining.
Jukes-Cantor was chosen as the genetic distance model
NR_102450 , a cyanobacteria, was chosen as the outgroup
We chose a cost matrix for alignment of 93% similarity (the highest proposed by Geneious)
Pay attention to put every sequences in the same direction (using the Reverse complementary option), as Geneious don't reverse them automatically !
If you forget to do that, tou will have actually 2 similar trees: on assembling the forward sequences, the other one with the reverse ones. Here is the first phylogenetic tree we were able to get. The bold strains with an * are the one that were considered as the most able to degrade quercetin, according to the previous assay. The taxonomy is summed up in the legend.

Samah Hoque
At first, Samah Hoque might seem like your ordinary iGem wet lab minion. But don’t be fooled by her innocent smile and kind demeanor. After graduating from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Samah turned down a job from the Ministry of Magic and came to Cornell University, where the eternal frozen tundra and endless days without sunlight constantly remind her of London. She spends plenty of time down in the basement lab space of Weill because it brings back her fondest childhood memories of living in a cramped cupboard under the stairs. With a single spell, Samah is able to bring bacteria to life by tricking them into thinking LB is delicious butterbeer. In dire lab situations, Samah must conjure her patronus, a rare form of Escherichia coli to ward away all evils from her precious bacterial colonies. When not in lab, Samah can be found dominating Quidditch games on the Arts Quad or reading about the dark arts in the library. 100 points to Samah Hoque for being iGem’s secret weapon.

Elize is looking into a Synthetic Biology Film Festival which previous iGEM teams have entered into with some success. The deadline for entries is in 11 days however, so this might not be feasible. Looks fun though.
Philip and Cesar attended the Oxford iGEM meetup but since they didn’t write up their logs they have been lost to history.
Friday 20th
The famous transformation efficiency kit was a complete failure – our first failed experiment! The first biobrick transformations seemed to have transformed quite well however, so the cells are at least competent.
Not a lot else happened today. Elize continued with the film, some more wiki research was done, and otherwise the day generally consisted of reading and research. The first minipreps will be done on Monday.
Weekend 21st-22nd

Lab work is now a major component of every day – as it should be. Today we performed our first minipreps of the three biobrick plasmids, ran them on a gel, and prepared for our first PCR. With then weeks to go until the end of August, it’s good that . We also have our first lab book!
The sugar project lumbered onward. We had a meeting with a resident expert on the subject who gave us a list of potential sugars we might use. The ongoing quest for potential metabolic pathways seems to be making some headway too, with some good potential operons found. Getting them on the other hand...
The film submission idea seems to be looking more doable – we churned out the first draft of a script and we have a vague idea of what we might do. The deadline is in seven days though...
Tuesday 24th
Some real progress on the theoretical side today. We gave Jon the list of strains we might need for the metabolic wiring – if we can get them it would save a lot of time and money as we wouldn’t need to sequence some pretty large chunks of DNA. Jon will enable ‘superhero mode’ and look for them. Some good putative sugars were also identified – to quote Charlotte, “things are looking up for sugar.”
In the lab things were equally encouraging. While six of the PCR products failed to appear when run on a gel, nine of them did, and we were able to perform our first ligations using these. This is probably a good sign. It will be taken as such"

To measure bio accumulated Hg, we need to quantify the Hg inside and outside of bacterium after the incubation/exposure time. So we collected and measured the amount of Hg in LM medium supernatant recovered and bacterium re-suspended in TN Buffer. For this we used the equipment Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80). As a control to normal Hg bio accumulated in bacteria, we used DH5-alpha transformed with BBa_K1355002 (Hg bio detector device) which does not present the metal binding peptide. We also measured the Optical Density of each sample.
The graph represented on Figure 1 shows the amount of Hg in supernatant (LM medium recovered) and in bacterium (DH5-alpha transformed with BBa_K1355003) at the time 1 (01:30 hours of incubation);
Figure 1: Metal binding peptide activity after 01:30 hours of incubation in five given concentrations of mercury chloride: 50 ppb, 100 ppb, 250 ppb e 500 ppb
It can be observed that the amount of Hg in the Mercury Bacter bioaccumulator increases according to the raise of Hg concentration. The amount of Hg increased 22 times comparing the 50 ppb sample with 500 ppb sample. In the 500 ppb Hg concentration the control bacterium just accumulated 2 per cent of total Hg amount. On the contrary, Mercury Bacter accumulated 40 per cent of total Hg amount in just 01:30 hours of incubation!!!  The data keeps raising on the time 2! Check it out!
The graph represented on Figure 2 shows the amount of Hg in supernatant (LM medium recovered) and in bacterium (DH5-alpha transformed with BBa_K1355003) at the time 2 (03:00 hours of incubation);

Ethics is about trying to give answers to questions about how we have to react to or act in specific situations, what we have to consider to develop a well- founded decision or what is wrong about the way we handle different topics.
As we do not know so many aspects related to ethics and because of our non-objective perspective, we started to contact different experts in Germany. The pdf-file of one of the interviews can be found below.

Perspective of Professors
Interview with Our Supervisor Prof. Schwaneberg
How do You evaluate the iGEM competition in general and the influence which the former iGEM teams from Aachen had?
In general, I see the iGEM competition as a very good opportunity for students to learn how to work and act in a team by proposing ideas, fighting for them, getting exposed to their consequences. In essence, it is a very good training for students to learn how to take over responsibilities and to work in and as a team. I strongly support the participation of students in the iGEM competition and it is great if they have the chance to travel to Boston and present their concept at the Giant Jamboree. There they will be exposed to other brilliant students all over the world which share common interests. Apart from this, the iGEM competition has a very positive role in terms of visibility for the nature science faculty of the RWTH Aachen University and even generated interest from companies.
How do You think: Can iGEM support the education of the students?
I would say that iGEM also has a very positive influence and shapes their personality to become leaders in research. Members of the iGEM team will get a totally different insight of lab work and research by developing own ideas and experience how challenging the realization on the molecular level can be. However, taking and learning from these frustrations enables students to grow by discovering and analyzing challenges as well as finally solving them totally on their own. The letter fosters their believes in own abilities and strengthens their personality and leadership skills to tackle important scientific questions in the future.
What makes iGEM special in comparison to other student programs and practical courses?
I think the most important part of iGEM is the aspect of self-organization in terms of selected topics and fundraising to support iGEM activities. The latter experiences makes iGEM outstanding and much more challenging than other student activities and internships in which research topics are usually provided by the supervisor.
How do You evaluate the complexity of the iGEM competition (financial support, organisation, and public relations)?

Tokyo-NoKoGen,2012,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#Project#lux operon_-_-_TEXT.html," and found out the suitable culturing condition to express, so we next tried to improve the coli express system by changing the color, strengthening the light intensity, and shortening the reaction time.
Change the color
We used LumP, YFP, and GFP proteins to change the color.
What is LumP and YFP ?
Bacterial luciferase derived from Vibrio fischeri, which is a strain of luminous bacteria, shows brue-green light emission (wavelength is 495 nm).
However, Vibrio fischeri strain Y-1 emits longer wavelength light than normal Vibrio fischeri (535 nm, yellow)(3). The yellow shift of light emission wavelength is caused by YFP, which is a secondary emitter protein. YFP does not emit light itself, but it interacts with the luciferase, resulting in a shift of wavelength of light emission. YFP has FMN as a chromophore, and its size is about 28 kDa.
Furthermore, in luminous bacteria, there are strains that emit light with shorter wavelength than normal Vibrio fischeri (475 nm,blue), such as Photobacterium phosphoreum, Photobacterium kishitanii and Photobacterium leiognathi.
It is known that blue shift of these luminous bacterium is caused by lumazine protein (LumP). Similar to YFP, LumP shifts the wavelength by interacting with the luciferase. As a chromophore, it has 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl)lumazine (DMRL), and its size is about 21kDa.
Learning from previous reports, we decided to use these proteins for changing the color.

Emily worked on the presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools; Ashlee and Emily collaborated on the demonstration for the teachers. Ashlee and Emily digested Plasmid 1 in order to insert the dCas9 system. We first digested the backbone for ~4 hours with ClaI restriction enzyme, heat inactivated the enzyme at 65 degrees C for 20 minutes, cleaned the digestion, then digested for ~4 hours with SalI-HF. We have to do this because of the high fidelity binding of SalI and the fact that the two restriction sites are very close together. HF enzymes could remain bound tightly and block ClaI from binding.
Cleaned up PCR from Sunday. Concentration of DNA was very high (>1000 ng/ul. Sent plasmids that displayed correct band on 7/4 for sequencing with Quintara. Prepared cryo stock of cells harboring these plasmids.
Tuesday, July 8, 2014
Ashlee and Emily worked on finalizing the presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools. We also ran the digest of plasmid 1 on a gel and PCR Rescued the dCas9 system. Many dCas9 PCRs were not very successful, and we did more troubleshooting. We increased the elongation time to 3 minutes (~30 seconds per kb of DNA plus an extra 30 seconds - dCas9 is 5.5 kb) and we set the annealing temperature to 58 degrees Celsius. We tested changing the annealing temperature previously, and 58 degrees C had the most success. We ran our 8 PCR reactions on a gel and found that 7 of them worked! We have solved the problem of poor dCas9 PCRs! Ashlee also updated the website logo and several other spots around the website.

The question session highlighted some problems in our idea, helped explore possible offshoots of our idea and also told us about how our idea was perceived by a heterogeneous group of individuals who are biotechnology literate. Some of the issues raised during the meet about our idea are summarized below:
a. (Problem) Is the diauxic media composition required for cellfifuge compatible with the complex media used in industrial scale applications? How will modifying the existing media so as to make cellfifuge applicable affect cost of manufacturing?
< b. (Problem) What level of contamination by Ag43 is expected after downstream processing?
c. (Problem) How does the addition of an extra step in downstream processing, i.e., removing Ag43 by using metal affinity chromatography affect the net cost of protein production using the cellfifuge sysem?

ATOMS-Turkiye,2013,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," like a potential limitless world source to anything that can be imagined by us. If Synthetic Biology is used for the right purposes then it  serves possibilities from treating the untreatable illnesses to erasing the word poverty from our dictionaries via feeding the hungry. Yet, it can also result in mass slaughter or the production of dangerous weapons such as atomic bombs or even worse. Hence, strict rules and regulations of safety is a must in this field and ATOMS-Turkiye decided to take the first step with SynSafe to raise awareness of its importance once again.
Our mail to Grenoble IGEM team
Dear Grenoble İGEM team,
With a great project comes a great responsibility of finding the best solution  to the safety issues we encounter and most oftenly, figuring the main safety areas that needs concentrating on can be pretty difficult. This year iGEM  has introduced strict rules and regulations for safety which is a clear  indication of how much effort and importance they are expecting us to show!
So, why dont we gather and see safety as a way to benefit eachother? Because not only will this open new doors for our future safety plans but will also increase the probability of reaching our aimed destinations. The Lyon jamborees is a great opportunity to form a platform where we can discuss our safety issues, what we have done to overcome them and the main parts that have challenged us the most.
After reading your abstract a few questions on the safety of your projects popped into our minds. If you are interested in forming a discussion platform, we would be delighted  receive your answers as this, on the day of the platform will enable your team to see how much progression was made with safety from today onwards.
We would be really grateful to read your questions on the safety of our project too J
iGEM cares about safety, so do we! Lets take a step together and make a change in how we handle this caseJ
Questions
1-) Does this protein have any effect on human or other living organisms health? Have you thought of it being possibly poisonous to them?

  Dear ATOMS-TÜRKİYE iGEM Team 2013,
I am Stewart Humble, a member of the iGEM Grenoble-EMSE-LSU Team for 2013.  I was asked to give a quick informal overview and comparison with our project and my previous research at LSU to address some of the biosafety issues and questions that may arise for our team.

T_{2000}: End
The results show that the number of encounters during the time sexy plants are switched-on is almost the same, but in most cases lower than when sexy plants are switched-off.
The time at which the insects start to get confused and move randomly is shorter as the population increases. Even for high numbers, males get confused before sexy plants are switched-on. That is because there is such amount of females that they saturate the field. This rarely happens in nature, so when this occurs in our simulation we should think that we are out of real scenarios, and then we should modify the rest of parameter values. In these experiments we see that at a population equal to 12 we start be on this limit (insects gets confused when the sexy plants are going to be switched-on).
An aspect that should also be considered is the time of the insects getting confused among experiments, (when the number of females is the same).  One could think that this “saturation” time would depend on the number of encounters before it happens. Since females wouldn’t be emitting pheromones after mating, males should get confused later if the previous number of meetings is larger. However, results are not decisive in this matter.
Experiment 2
What does it happen when the number of females is equal to the number of males? (F=M)
T_{0} : Start
T_{1000}: Switch-ON
T_{2000}: End
Based on the results of experiment 1, we fixed 10 as the top number of females for the next tests. The number of females is conserved in each test.
It is observed that the number of encounters is higher if the number of males increases (this makes sense).
In all cases it can be deduced that while the number of males increase against the number of females, the time required for them  to get confused is larger. This possibly has its origin in the number of encounters, which is higher according to the first point. When males mate females, they give up emitting pheromones during a certain period of time, so the contribution to the field saturation decreases.
In contrast with the Experiment 1, it is observed that while the number of males increases, the number of encounters is considerably higher when sexy plants are switched-off than when they are switched-on. This is seen with more clarity when the number of males is larger. We believe that with more experiments, this fact can be easily tested.
Comparing Experiments 1 and 2

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Aimtest2_-_-_TEXT.html," others, and we hypothesised that this pathway could be tuned so as to give different ratios of each fatty acid in the fatty acid profile seen. The ability to finely tune the ratios of the fatty acids produced would open doors to specialised oils, such as a high-oleic cooking oil for instance. Moreover, having the system essentially feed itself (after the initial input of glucose) rather than using exogenous stearic and oleic acid to feed the later pathways would hopefully reduce operating costs. This would only be the case if the fatty acids being added to the media worked out more expensive than the glucose needed to maintain the reactions. Whilst an exciting concept, we didn’t feel like we had the time during our project to properly attempt this. Maybe it’s a job for a future iGEM team!
The alternative to having all components produced within one batch of cells is to have each construct expressed in a separate batch of bacteria. This is a much more simple route, as problems such as plasmid conflicts would be eliminated. In essence, different ratios of oils could still be achieved by adding each component to the others at a specified volume after being extracted from the culture. After speaking with a representative of a company who uses palm oil in their products, they expressly said that producing the components of palm oil in separate batches would be the best scenario. This is because crude palm oil, once it has been processed from the fruit, is then fractionated to give separate fatty acids according to their physical properties anyway. Therefore, logic suggests that having separate batches producing each main component of palm oil would reduce the need for further processing down the production line.
Ultimately, the team decided that producing oleic acid and linoleic acid separately would be the best route to take, and so that’s what we did!
Homogenisation vs. exogenous feeding
Because we had chosen to produce our fatty acids in three different production strains, it was necessary to feed our transformed E. coli with fatty acids to produce the product we wanted. Without this exposure, the proteins would be translated but there would be no fatty acid for them to act upon. The ‘Delta 9’ strain had to be exposed to stearic acid to produce oleic acid, and the ‘Delta 12’ strain had to be exposed to oleic acid to produce linoleic acid.
We had two main options: breaking the cells open (homogenisation) or exogenous feeding. Both options had pros and cons associated with them. Homogenisation would allow the fatty acids and the enzymes to come in to direct contact with each other very easily in vitro. Whilst"

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," average light intensity and the minimum light intensity, respectively, within the simulated vessel: \[ I_{ave}  =  \frac{1}{\pi R^2}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{R} r I_0 10^{-\epsilon C (\sqrt{R^2-(r \cos(\theta))^2} - r \sin(\theta))} dr d\theta \\ \] \[ I_{min}  =  I_0 10^{-\epsilon C 2 R} \]Using these three parameters and equations, we developed an algorithm which returns a list of light intensities that correspond to realistic light fluctuations. An outline of this procedure is shown in Algorithm 5.1.
Algorithm 5.1. Psuedocode of the Fluctuation Algorithm
This algorithm was designed such that the average light intensity of all the intensities within I list never changes during the procedure. This constant average is ensured by having uniform separation between intensities and then selecting two intensities (I list [x], I list [y]) in each iteration, and changing each one with the same magnitude but in opposite directions.
Since the average light intensity never changes, this means that the initial intensity with which I list is seeded determines what the average will be. Therefore, as shown in lines 1 & 2, we use the calculated I ave to seed I list , assuring that the fluctuations correspond to the values of the parameters in Table 5.3. Note that line 2 uses python syntax whereby multiplying a list containing a single element by an integer, n, creates a list containing n copies of the original element.
Furthermore, there is no check that I 1 is within the appropriate bounds, unlike how I 2 is checked in line 11, because the value of I 1 is calculated using the formula in equation 1 given a random position within the simulated vessel. Therefore I 1 will always be within the appropriate bounds. One scenario to be aware of is when either x or y is equal to either the first or last index of I list , but the other is not. When this occurs, the intensity associated with y needs to be changed by a value of either −2 Δ I or −0.5 Δ I, depending on whether it is the boundary index or not. However, in practice, it is simpler to not let x or y equal a boundary index as this makes it easier to stitch multiple I list s together throughout an entire experiment.
These two models for lighting conditions were then incorporated into the in-house software"

Summary of Week 8: July 25 - July 31
This week we underwent a momentous drive to create more LRs. A large list of promoter-gene pairs was conceived of and we began to run through LR reactions in somewhat of a factory manner. This occupied much of our time. We also received and prepared DNA parts from Elowitz's group in Caltech. We also got trained on using the FACS machine and began to get quantitative data on our transfections.

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Community#Podcasts#Transcripts_-_-_TEXT.html," adequate food supply in coming decades for a rapidly growing population,""
Alex: Wow Dev that’s pretty profound, did you come up with that?
Dev: No that’s actually a quote from University of Idaho animal scientist Rod Hill in an article in science daily. But it’s a popular opinion that as our population and demand for food rises, we’ll need to find new ways to increase our food production using technologies such as those present within synthetic biology.
Alex: Yeah although synthetic biology is still in its infancy as a science; genetically modified foods have been around on the market for human consumption since 1994. A genetically modified food is any food that comes from an organism that has had genes either inserted into its nucleus, or deleted from its genome. Techniques used in synthetic biology such as gene synthesis have the potential to have a drastic effect on the foods that we consume.
Dev: Yeah, genetically modified food most commonly refers to crops created for human or animal consumption using the latest molecular biology techniques. New methods of farming, as well as manipulating current food sources to be grown more efficiently are both possible approaches that could solve the growing demand for food.
Alex: Genetically modified food can be modified to have an array of advantages of over naturally occurring sources such as herbicide tolerance, pest resistance, disease resistance, drought tolerance, and increased nutrition.
Dev: And these foods are already available on the market. The first commercially available food that was available is the flavr savr tomato. This tomato was modified so that the ripening process was slowed down, and therefore it would have a long shelf life. This was achieved by the introduction of an antisense gene that interfered with an enzyme that accelerated the ripening process.
Alex: One of the most common examples of using genetically modified food is the use of Bacillus thuringiensis, or B.T, genes in corn and other crops. As of 2003, 62 million hectares of B.T gene containing crops were planted worldwide. These genes produce the Cry toxin, which binds to the cell membrane of insect cells within its gut. This causes the cells to lyse, and kills the insect.
Alex: So it’s great that the tomatoes can last longer, and corn can produce it’s own pesticides, but is it safe to eat? I mean can we have unintended effects when modifying the genetic make up of these foods?
Dev: Well the FDA approved the consumption of the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994 stating that it is as safe as tomatoes bred by conventional means, but production ceased in 1997 due to production costs. But there are a lot of concerns about the"

Future scenarios
“Planning is bringing the future into the present so that    you can do something about it” - Alan Lakein
What would be the potential applications of CryptoGErM in the near    and far future?
In this part of Human Practices, we explore the future scenarios of    the introduction of the CryptoGErM system to the world.
With all these fictional scenarios we give a deep insight on the    repercussions, applications and consequences that CryptoGErM would have    if introduced as a daily life system.
The scenarios are presented as fictional digital news and articles    from a futuristic and unreal city called New    Groningen in The Netherlands in the near and far    future, where the CryptoGErM system has been introduced,    followed by an explanation of the current reasons behind its    conceptualization.
We present them as digital news in a mobile device, based on the    prediction that the UN Intellectual property agency’s chief made in an    interview to La Tribune de Geneve, stating that newspapers will be    replaced by digital versions by 2040.
""In a few years, there will no longer be printed    newspapers as we know it today” “It’s an evolution. There’s no good or    bad about it. There are studies showing that they will disappear by    2040” - Francis Curry
The last existing Public Library has disappeared!
First fictional scenario
What if in the far future we start to run out of space to    accommodate the growing world population? Would we be able to find    suitable places to inhabit without damaging natural areas? What if we    use existent spaces to accommodate the growing population without the    necessity of building new human settlements protecting the green areas?    Have we thought about it?
According to the UN DESA report; “World Population Prospects: The      2015 Revision”, by 2050 the world population is expected to reach to      9.7 billion; the available living space could not be sustainable to      accommodate the rapidly-growing amount of people. Such raising in the      population, probably, will see humanity looking for more      space to make sustainable the living of new generations, without using      the green areas.

Effluent water monitoring for sewage treatment and other industrial processes.
Quality control monitoring in manufacturing processes
Water quality monitoring for drinking water contaminants
Pipeline monitoring for oil spills
Conclusions
From our marketing plan we have demonstrated a customer base that has shown interest in our product. We will target oil and gas service companies which are involved in monitoring toxins in this field.  Additionally, we aim to market our product to private companies and major analytical laboratories in this industry.  While competing technologies exist in our market, our product provides clear advantages in terms of our potential efficiency, reliability, portability, and cost.  This technology fits a potential $50 million marketing opprotunity with the ability to translate easily into other markets and provide a dynamic product line.

Most of the patients desire to try the new drugs, but the amount of patients who meet genetic testing standards and requirements of targeted therapy are still limited. Therefore it needs the joint effort of various communities to promote the development of therapeutic targeting drugs and enlarge its covering. At the same time, efforts should be made to diminish the cost of molecular targeted therapy as much as possible, becoming affordable for more patients and families and permitting continuation of more lives.
Interview with patients
Ms. Chen (60-year-old)      Gastric adenocarcinoma sufferer
Ms. Chen primarily realized her disease due to sudden hemafecia. After a thorough check, she was told that she has got poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. She had surgery on Dec. 22nd, 2013, removed the 2/3 of the stomach. In May this year, she suffered a plummet of her weight, from more than 140 pounds to less than 90. Her gastric cancer recurred. She ate less, and one examination showed that cancer cells could be found in 13 different pieces of tissues in her.
Ms. Chen’s treatment now mainly depends on chemotherapy, while cooperates with oral drugs simultaneously. Chemotherapy treatment period is 21 days of hospitalization, followed by 3 days infusion (Oxaliplatin) for about 7-8 hours per day. Her medication cycle is to take oral medications (made in Japanese) for 15 continuous days, then withdraw for 1 week, then circulate.
She chose imported drugs for chemotherapy (import drugs are at her own expense, while domestic drugs can be partly covered by medical compensation). Although imported drugs have relatively limited side effects, as it can prevent hair loss, there are still some adverse reactions like nausea and vomiting, and she felt numb hands and feet. Monthly cost is around 8-10k RMB (around 1300$).
She has adapted gene detect to find pathological cause, and she has more in-depth knowledge of molecular targeted drugs. Yet because the examination results showed that her gene type does not match targeting drugs, thus she gave up targeted drug therapy. When told that targeted treatment costs about 30k RMB (around 4500$) per month, she considered it as acceptable and affordable.

The two 2-part and two 3-part CBA's were amplified using PCR Rescue and gel purified. The original 4-part CBA was transformed into E. coli electrocompetent cells using electroporation and plated on kanamycin antibiotic agar plates. The 4-part CBA was repeated to ensure accuracy. Because the CBA parts contained no plasmid DNA, the 4-part CBA could be digested by restriction enzyme Dpn1. Dpn1 binds and cuts methylated DNA sites, thus destroying any plasmid DNA remaining as a contaminant.
More issues with RBS library design, as it seems very difficult to find sequences with sufficiently high TIR. Decided to use an initial condition for the calculator, which should speed it up and also ensure higher TIR is reached. More calculations ran.

The original 4-part CBA worked! Many colonies appeared on the plate after incubation at 37 degrees C for 18 hours, and 12 colonies were selected for plasmid preparation. These were digested with AatII and XbaI, two restriction sites that are only both contained in the final assembled 4-part plasmid. 6/12 colonies showed the correct bands on the gel. We also prepared more 1 kb ladder from concentrate.

In order to insert the dCas9 system into plasmid 1, dCas9 was digested with XhoI and ClaI. 4 successful colonies were digested with ClaI for 3 hours, heat inactivated at 65 degrees C, and then digested with SalI-HF restriction enzyme. SalI and XhoI are compatible sites. These digestions were gel purified, resulting in low concentrations of plasmid DNA. Only two colonies were used to continue further.

Jacob Made LB plates that contained Nile Red and with them, he confirmed the presence of PHB granules in the cells transformed in Weeks 13 and 14 with PhaCAB biobricks from both the Imperial College and the Tokyo Tech teams. After overnight incubation in LB media with 3% glucose, he also successfully extracted the PHB granules from these cells with sodium hypochlorite (bleach)(Figure 4). Our protocols can be seen on this page.

E.coli DH5ɑ transformed with an empty pSB1C3 backbone was used as a control (Tube 3). The transformed cells were incubated overnight in LB media + 3% glucose, then the plastic was extracted from the cells with sodium hypochlorite and washed with 70% ethanol. The PHB pellets are shown before the ethanol wash on the left and after the ethanol wash on the right.
Week 16 (August 14 - August 18, 2017)
Kaitlin and Sam re-digested pET29B-RFP sequentially with NotI-HF and HindIII-HF, as was done in weeks 13-15. The digests were run on a 1% low melting-point agarose gel, then the backbones were excised from the gel. 10 replicates of the backbone were excised so that it could be used by our group and the Synthesis group. This backbone was ligated to our SP2 gBlock digested with HindIII-HF and NotI-HF. We also began a new approach of ligating SP2 directly into pET29B with SP1 insert (originally obtained in Week 12). To do this, both pET29B-SP1 and SP2 were digested with XhoI and HindIII-HF then ligated together to create pET29B-SP1-SP2. Both ligation products were transformed into chemically"
Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," $0.025 per dollar of fish [4]. However, Terramycin is already becoming obsolete as a treatment protocol due to the rapid formation of resistant strains [5]. While the antibiotic may appear cost effective, it cannot be relied upon as a long-term solution due to the rise of antibiotic resistance. Bacterial tolerance of chemotherapeutic agents could obligate fish farmers to use more potent antibiotics, which could have undesirable side effects on their stock. Furthermore, the evolutionary capability of Flavobacterium to overcome antibiotics suggests that reliance on such agents in the future is a questionable proposition.
Our tag consists of three core components: an on/off clamp, medical-grade tubing and 3-D printing material. Given that the clamps are $.23 each, the requisite tubing is $.21 a tag and the printing material is $1.40/tag, the total material cost per tag is $1.83 [6]. This translates to about $.13 per dollar of fish. While this may seem like a nontrivial amount, fishPHARM guarantees users a peace of mind that Terramycin simply cannot match. fishPHARM’S EcnB peptide is biodegradable as well as, and thus does not pose the same environmental and health risks that antibiotics do.
It is clear that the negative consequences of Flavobacterium psychrophilum infection are acute. As reported by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, an epizootic of BCWD once infected 25% of lake trout raised in New York State hatchery raceways [7]. Given the inedibility of infected salmonids, the organism has the potential to reduce the financial yield of a salmon population from $7/lb to $4.90/lb in this scenario. Since roughly 2.4 million tons of salmon are produced by aquaculturists each year, even a small incidence of BCWD would have dire economic ramifications.
Environmental Impact
Given the relatively benign nature of Entericidin B and its Escherichia coli chassis, the environmental consequences of fishPHARM are negligible compared to those of current mainstream BCWD treatment methods - namely antibiotics. While there is a slight risk of the Entercidin B disrupting the ecological microbiome present at its point of dissemination, the specificity of the toxin makes this unlikely.
EcnB is naturally found in the human gut genome and thus not a hazard to human health. The benign nature of the treatment protocol we have devised provides distinct advantages over oxytetracycline, an antibiotic used to treat BCWD, because abuse of such chemotherapeutic agents fosters resistance among targeted pathogens ["

Besides, he chewed and smoked, and the combination of the         aroma of his favorite luxuries with the articles of his merchandise must         have been most uncongenial to the curve of such lips and such nostrils as         Mrs. Mackerel's.
""I was received by Mr. Mackerel in a manner that increased observation has         since taught me is sufficiently indicative of the hysterical _finale_ of a         domestic dialogue. He was not so obtuse as to let me directly into the         true cause of his wife's nervous attack and his own collectedness, and yet         he felt it would not answer to make too light of it before me.
""Mr. and Mrs. M. had just returned from a party. (The party must be the         'scape-goat'!) He assured me that as the lady was in the full enjoyment of         health previously, he felt obliged to attribute the cause of her attack         and speechless condition--for she spoke not one word, or gave a sign--to         the dancing, heated room, and the supper.

Most of our team members have never or seldom heard of synthetic biology and iGEM before joining the team. Therefore, all the members have to participate in the safety courses held by our team instructor, Dr. Pei-Hong Chen, before all of us have permission to use the lab. The courses include Autoclave safety, Biological Material Safety, and Chemical Safety.
Bacterial strains: Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21
Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21 are recognized as non-pathogenic and disabled, and may be considered to be equivalent as the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (A CDP) hazard group 1. They are not considered pathogenic to humans or animals. They are expected to have limited survivability in the environment and often have auxotrophic requirements, which are unlikely to be satisfied outside of laboratory culture.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines in Taiwan, these materials can be handled at Biological Safety Level One (BSL-1) containment. Biological Safety Level One (BSL-1) containment, using standard microbiological practices, is suitable for work involving well-characterized microbiological organisms not known to consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans, and present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.

Summary
This summer, our team benefitted a lot from the collaboration with Prof. YANG Yi and other iGEM teams. By paying reciprocal visits with Prof. Yang, we establish collaboration with his lab. By helping some other teams with their contests, we built lifelong friendship with team members across the world.
Collaboration with Prof. YANG Yi's Lab
As a burgeoning interface of biology, chemistry, physics and many other disciplines of research, the study of synthetic biology highly values and is critically depended on the collaboration of different specialities and different groups. Aiming at the optimization and further application of an ultra-sensitive light sensor, our team decided to collaborate with Prof. YANG Yi’s group from ECUST (East China University of Science and Technology) and research under the instruction of Prof. YANG.
Upon his visit to Peking University this May, Prof. YANG presented his design and preliminary results on the Light-OFF system and we shared our opinions on its further applications. And in this very meeting, both sides decided to combine each component of their works and present this project in the iGEM competition.
Professor YANG Yi
Based on the original work of YANG’s group, team members in Peking University endeavored in the possible extension of this light sensitive and functional Light-OFF biobrick.

Clara Park
is a rising sophomore pursuing a degree in Biological Engineering. Clara became  interested in iGEM because she enjoys the way in which synthetic biology is a dynamic, interactive field  with infinite potential to be able to solve global issues. She was also excited to join iGEM because she  felt it was one of the very rare opportunities that she would get to build something out of her  imagination with minimal restrictions. Clara hopes to use iGEM to gain  skills to build a foundation for her future career in synthetic biology.  Outside of iGEM, Clara’s research experience includes being a research  assistant in OLED Research at Hongik University in Korea where she  developed a theoretical model for view angle dependent emission  pattern of OLEDs and was a second author of a thesis published in  Journal of Korean Institute of Electrical and Electronic Materials  Engineers (KIEEME). Clara also has a patent under examination in Korea  for a travel carrier that resembles a drawer to facilitate the process of  packing. Clara won the Kyungki State government Global Leadership  Award and the Taiwan Ministry of Education International Intelligent  Creativity Contest, both in 2009.

Week 1
A joint collaboration between the UCL, Biohackspace & Birkbeck iGEM teams were held in order to train team members in certain roles within each team. The organised boot camp took place over a week. Teams all met in mornings to carry out basic lab training. In afternoons, 3 specific training routes were followed; DIYbio, Software/Automation & extra lab. Members from each formed afternoon groups.
Monday 15th June
Morning Lab
Monday morning consisted of a Lab safety induction & a discussion on the standardised cloning strategy to be applied throughout the iGEM competition. The common major feature of each plasmid backbone has a prefix (to the 5' end of the biobrick) & suffix (3' end of the biobrick). The prefix and suffix restriction sites are highlighted in Figure 1. The standardised engineering procedure works by cutting the vector backbone in the suffix region while inserts (if already cloned into a vector) are cut in the prefix and suffix (cartoon representation of reactions are displayed in Figure 2). The ligation of insert and vector backbone will yield a recombinant plasmid with a scar as the XbaI & SpeI sites anneal.
Figure 1: Prefix & Suffix Restriction Sites.
Figure 2: Cloning Strategy.
On the first day of the lab, each of the iGEM teams were split into 3 groups. Each sub team was investigating different promoters used in expressing mrfp;
Group 1 used pSB1C3 - BBa_J23101 as a vector.

This interlab study aims at using the same protocol in expression of rfp in E. coli cells. With reference to Figure 3, the 2006 Berkeley iGEM team characterised each of the promoters. iGEM teams across the globe will quantitatively measure the fluorescence of RFP & GFP with respect to each promoter listed. This will generate a large data set and therefore a statistically more reliable conclusion of the original experiments"

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrates different behavior when the bacteria are exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial or harmful to their metabolism and reproduction.
The chemotaxis mechanism in E. coli can be illustrated as following:
When absence of chemical, there is no molecules bind to the chemoreceptors, cheW, an intracellular protein, is associated with cheA and cheA will autophosphorylate itself and capture phosphate group from ATP. Later, phosphate will be transferred to cheY and the phosphorylated cheY associates with the flagella motors making flagellum rotates clockwise. In general, bacteria tumble in the absence of chemical.
When presence of chemicals, cheA is free from cheW interaction, and cheZ will efficiently remove phosphate group from cheY. Those dephosphorylated cheY cannot bind with flagella motors, and consequently, flagella rotate counter-clock which can be observed as bacteria swim smoothly. In some special situations, cheR will methylate chemoreceptors to remain the disassociation between cheA and cheW. Then, bacteria will still swim but not tumble.
Genetically Engineered Chemotaxis Bacteria
Because of lack of natural chemoreceptors for antibiotics, we need to construct a genetic circuit specifically to sense antibiotics, and according to the mechanism of chemotaxis, we need to overexpress cheZ to improve its phosphorylation capability on cheY. The model is illustrated as following:
Integrative Modification on Bacterial Permeability
Our CACCI construction is systematically not only including chemotaxis modification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin. Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the center of the beta barrel to interact with the aqueous channel.
Porin: OprF from Pseudomonus aeruginosa
Porins are beta barrel proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able to diffuse.
In E. coli different porins, for example OmpF and OmpC is expressed endogenously in different situations for different molecules. But these natural occurring porines are only permeable for molecules like sugars smaller than 600 Da. And more importantly, implement of micF, an antisense ncRNA may inhibits the material diffusion through OmpF. Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from Pseudomon"

Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the active site iron molecule during it’s functional cycle rendering the enzyme inactive8. It was demonstrated by the Lethbridge 2010 iGEM team that xylE only exhibits single turnover kinetics, and therefore, each protein molecule is capable of hydrolyzing only one molecule of catechol7. In natural systems, the xylT gene is located upstream of xylE. XylT codes for a ferredoxin protein (xylT) that stabilizes xylE by reducing the iron molecule back to its previous active state, allowing xylE to continue degrading catechol9. Creating a multiple turnover system would allow one protein to degrade multiple catechol molecules thereby increasing the efficiency of the system while increasing potential real-world applications. We have performed a computational metabolic flux analysis to determine possible bottlenecks and choke points in the feeding of 2-HMS into the citric acid cycle. The results indicated that the bottleneck in the pathway is not located in the citric acid cycle but in the breakdown of 2-HMS by the native E. coli enzyme xylF, indicating another step that can be used to optimize the catechol degradation system (Figure 1)10.
Figure 1.  Schematic of the tailings pond toxic organic molecule degradation pathways and their entry into E. coli’s natural metabolic pathways. Fluorene, anthracene and naphthalene can be degraded into catechol using a series of enzymatic steps (orange). Catechol can be degraded to 2-HMS by xylE, which can enter the citric acid cycle (green). Alternatively, catechol-1,2-dioxygenase can degrade catechol into cis,cis-muconate that can enter the citric acid cycle following a series of 5 enzymatic steps (red). The bottleneck as demonstrated by computational metabolic flux analysis is located in the three-step breakdown of 2-HMS to acetaldehyde and pyruvate and is the xylF enzyme. The blue box outlines the location we will optimize for catechol degradation, the entry point of toxic organic compound degradation into the cells’ natural metabolic pathways. Orange outlines the pathways we are investigating for breakdown of the more toxic organic molecules found in the tailings ponds.3,4,5,6,10,24

Projekt 2014 - Tuebingen Erythrocyte Converter to O
Die moderne Medizin hat einen stetig wachsenden Bedarf nach Bluttransfusionen und daher Spenderblut. Ohne eine forschrittliche Transfusionsmedizin wäre beispielsweise die heutige intensiv- und notfallmedizinische Versorgung kaum möglich - besonders diese Fachgebiete sind stark von einer ständigen Verfügbarkeit von Spenderblut abhängig, um Leben retten zu können.
Ungünstigerweise ist es nicht möglich, einem Patienten eine beliebige Blutkonserve zu transfusionieren, da die roten Blutkörperchen (Erythrocyten) eine ganze Reihe von Antigenen präsentieren. Diese Antigene können vom Immunsystem des Transfusionsempfängers erkannt werden und im schlimmsten Fall eine Immunreaktion auslösen, die bei einem ohnehin geschwächten (Unfall-) Patienten zu schweren Komplikationen führen kann. Aus diesem Grund muss für jeden Patienten eine Blutkonserve mit passenden Antigenen gefunden werden, die keine Reaktion des Immunsystems des Transfusionsempfängers auslöst. Aufgrund der Wichtigkeit von Bluttransfusionen wurden die Erythrocyten-Antigene im Detail erforscht und in Blutgruppensystemen zusammengefasst. Eines der einfachsten und am weitesten bekannten Blutgruppensysteme ist das ABO-System, das zusammen mit dem Rhesusfaktor (Rh) die wichtigsten Antigene für eine Bluttransfusion gruppiert. Beachtet man nur das ABO-System und den Rhesusfaktor gibt es die Blutgruppen A, B, AB und O - jeweils mit und ohne Rhesusfaktor (Rh+ bzw. Rh-).
Die ABO-Antigene bestehen aus glycosilierten Proteinen auf der Außenseite der Erythrozytenmembran. Es gibt dabei jeweils ein Antigen für die Blutgruppe A und ein Antigen"

Figure 3 : effet de l’AdCMV.p53 sur la survie cellulaire. Les cellules témoins et celles infectées à l’AdCMV.p53 ont été incubé dans du milieu serum-free après 1h d’infection.
En l’absence de sérum, les cellules non-infectées et ßgal infectées continuent de proliférer. En revanche, pour les cellules p53 infectées, la prolifération est stoppée et suivie d’une importante chute de la population. Après 72h, la quasi-totalité des cellules p53 infectées sont mortes (figure 3).
Selon cette étude, il apparait clairement que le fait d’amener une version wild-type de la p53 au sein d’une population cellulaire p53 mutée induit le phénomène d’apoptose et réduit de manière significative la population tumorale.

Astaxanthin is becoming a more and more popular health care product, and our project focus on producing and accumulating astaxanthin in rice endosperm bioreactor, and, finally, getting the astaxanthin products. During our experiments, we have collected some data and used educated guesses that are biologically feasible, trying to figure out: 1. which foreign gene is more important in the pathway; 2. the interaction between four foreign genes and other endogenous genes on expression level. Through these analyses, we wonder a better optimizing strategy to increase the production of astaxanthin in rice endosperm bioreactor.
1. Genes and astaxanthin production
We have transferred four foreign genes, PSY, CrtI, BKT and BHY, into rice endosperm bioreactor. The enzymes encoded by these genes catalyze the following reactions:
Figure 10   The biosynthesis pathway of astaxanthin formation in transgenic rice endosperm. The dotted arrows indicate pathway limitations in rice endosperm. The solid arrows indicate the existence of carotenogenic reactions. The red arrows indicate the reactions catalaysed by four exogenous genes PSY, CrtI, BHY and BKT.
Figure 11   Correlation analysis between expression level of four genes involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis and astaxanthin content.
The figure 11 showed us the correlations between astaxanthin concentration and expression of astaxanthin biosynthetic genes in rice endosperm bioreactor. OsActin1 gene was used to normalize expression. The encoded enzyme CrtI catalyzes the phytoene into lycopene, while enzyme BHY catalyzes the β-carotene into zeaxanthin. The expression of CrtI and BHY was significantly positively correlated with astaxanthin concentration in the rice endosperm bioreactor. The result suggests that the expression of CrtI and BHY are the rate-limiting factors to astaxanthin biosynthesis in rice endosperm bioreactor. Learning about this, in the future, we might increase the production of"

UNIPV-Pavia,2010,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Project#IntColi_-_-_TEXT.html," the Flp recombinase mediated the recombination of all the FRT sites of the multiple integrants until only a single FRT site was present in the Phi80 locus. The marker excision is a powerful tool to engineer microbial strains for industrial protein manufacturing because the engineered organism should not carry unsafe antibiotic resistances that may be diffused in the environment.
The fluorescence phenotype confirmed the correct integration into the E. coli chromosome. As expected, in general multiple integrants showed a higher fluorescence than the single integrants.
The BioBrick compatibility and the vector modularity give the possibility to the scientific community to stably engineer novel biological functions in E. coli with a very easy and user friendly methodology. A user’s handbook about the vector usage is shared in the Registry, as well as the users experiences and the compatibility information.

SYSU-Software,2015,Team:SYSU-Software#Scientific_-_-_TEXT.html,"in Xu
In early September, Prof. Rong, Yikang gave a lecture talking about his research interests, and at the beginning of his lectures he spent an hour talking about the importance of transparency and reproducibility in scientific research. He gave many ideas on how to improve transparency and reproducibility in designing experiment. His lectures helped us identify the important aspects when we considered how to promote reproducibility in iGEM: a well-documented experiment design, well-designed biological as well as technical replicates, as well as caution about statistics.
Inspirations on project
The fact that information only stored in wiki of previous teams brings about two problems disturbing the reproducibility as well as the transparency in iGEM:
1. All the information concerning the projects of previous iGEM teams is scattered about in the wiki. Finding out information about previous projects is like “looking for a needle in a haystack”
2. Representation of their designs did not conform to a well-established standard; these may lead to confusion and misunderstanding of the work they did.
So we aimed at designing a standard platform for information parsing and sharing. This platform should standardize the way every team store the information of their projects, and also should allow other iGEMers and scientists to give feedbacks.
3. Safety and Security
Motivation
Development of Genetic Design Automation poses great challenges to biosafety in synthetic biology. Genetic design is made easier with the help of software, but software itself does not think for itself the consequence of users’ genetic circuits. Some designs might be quite dangerous if misused. We looked for ways to utilize computational effort to tackle problems in safety and security.
Practices
Weekly meetings discussing how computational effort can protect wet-lab practices
Weilin Xu and other team members
In late June Weilin Xu gave us a talk on how to be safe in iGEM. We were alerted the safe practices in wet-lab team. We also learned the Risk Group of microbes.
In the discussion, we discussed about the safety problems in project design. Team leader Xiao Feng talked about aspects in biosafety in project design, say:
Weilin introduced biosafety in iGEM to us
1. How can we use algorithms to determine the danger of a circuit?
2. If the genetic circuit contains any unknown parts, what should we do?
We reached an agreement that it is the responsible conduct in synthetic biology that matters. Software can help in some way, but it can do little when it comes to parts with unknown origins or unknown functions.
Also, to determine whether the genetic design is danger, one"
Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html,"teams. The Human Practices team designed an exercise to identify ethical and social issues and to trigger debate on those issues. We made a short movie. One of the issues that informs the movie is the possibility of cheater mutant bacteria. Complementarily, we carefully modelled the risk of mutant cheaters and finally end up by discovering that mutant cheaters were in fact among our cultures! We characterized such mutants, performed experimental evolution tests and found them to behave as expected/modeled/feared: mutants actually display an evolutionary advantage on “honest”, heterologous protein-expressing clones. The consequences of all this were already anticipated in the script of our movie, one of the first things we attempted in this challenging project, and maybe the best way to close it:

Queens_Canada,2015,Team:Queens Canada#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," BioBrick is a fusion protein consisting of the E-coil domain of our coiled-coil system fused in-frame to the C-terminus of a Type III AFP. Type III AFP (PDB fIle: 1AME) is a moderately active antifreeze protein from the ocean pout, with a small (7Kb), globular structure. The E-coil refers to the coiled-coil with glutamic acid residues in the ‘e’ and ‘g’ positions of the helical wheel first used by Team Calgary 2013 ( BBa_K1189011 ). This protein has been shown to be purified effectively by ice-affinity. If a His-tag is required for your purposes, see BBa_K1831001.
Why: The fusion of the E-coil to the Type III AFP will enable non-covalent, yet high affinity, specific attachment of AFPs to our protein scaffold and K-coil BioBrick (BBa_K1831002). The interaction between the E- and K-coils involved oppositely charged residues, promoting the heterodimeric interaction of the coils that links AFPs to our scaffold. There is no His-tag, but ice-affinity purification can be used. By including a His-tag on our K-coil fusion protein (our scaffold: BBa_K1831002), and not the AFP with E-coil, we have enabled simple separation of any non-interacting coiled-coil domains."

WeChat Platform
To spread the knowledge of synthetic biology and our project, we used the new media, Wechat Subscription, to provide an interactive platform for readers and us to communicate with each other. Actually, we wrote an article about basic knowledge of microRNA last year, and this year we promoted to establish our own Wechat Subscription – NUDTiGEM. We have updated essays about iGEM and our project including special events such as cooperation among teams and CCiC. The essays were written in a humorous style in narrating and in a rigorous style in propagating scientific knowledge, which could make it easy for people to read and get involved. By scanning the QR code and following us, people can look through our essays without limitations of time and space. Up to now, hundreds of people have clicked like on our essays and many of them offered tips on publicity of our project.
As was shown in the survey in street speech, many people were still confused with the mechanism of specific protein degradation, we posted a questionnaire in Wechat platform to achieve greater publicity. The questions included varied from basic knowledge of proteins in human cells to some challenging questions related to our project, which could educate people step by step.
E-game in Buildbox
Realizing that phone game is now becoming the most popular way to entertain and relax, we created the game ""PR PREDATOR"" available in Apple Store in order to spread the significance of Trim in our project. It was hard to design an intricate process into a single game and promote it to people who have no background information. To solve this, we chose the process about Trim finding Nanobody and ubiquitin as the main game. Before starting the game, players have access to the context. They can click the icon of the character and then the information will be showed. The origins of Trim, Nanobody and ubiquitin were explained by several pictures and simple illustration: transcription and translation were simplified into the transforming of single RNA and DNA strands, and amino acid. ""Oligomerization"", one function of Trim, was explained as ""converting a mixture of small protein into big protein"". The game is about Trim, the runner, which avoids touching enzyme and finds Nanobody, while picking up ubiquitin, the coin. When Trim finds Nanobody, the game screen will shift to another one demonstrating the"
