COMMERCIAL GENE EXPRESSION SYSTEM
In addition to cloning and gene expression using pSB1C3 vector and a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23101 ), we also tested the gene expression and function of AOX genes on a commercial vector, pET-29b. The genes on pET-29b are driven by T7 promoter with lac operator. To express the gene, we transformed E. coli BL21 strain and performed IPTG induction. The gene expression level is slightly better than genes on pSB1C3 under a constitutive promoter. However, the enzyme activity and electrochemical properties are similar regardless of which vector was used.

BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," we had done and what we expected to do in the future, which thoroughly pleased almost all of managers shown up and made them create the idea to cooperate with us afterwards as they appreciated our bio machine and figured that it is likely be a successful innovation in the future market.
JOINN
In mid-october, our experiment has been basically completed. And we have completed the goals which we want to achieve before. We went to JOINN Laboratories, Inc. (one of the most famous biotech company in China) to communicate with our project. We had a clearer picture of the value of our project. They were interested in our project very much, and they gave us much advice about targeting the market.
Among these proposals from JOINN Laboratories, Inc., the followings are the more important ones:
(1) With the improvement of the life quality, people’s pursuit of health is getting higher and higher. People's appetite for food is mainly concerned with the followings:
① low calorie
② good taste
③ high sweetness
④ a sense of happiness
So on the basis of detecting the sweetness of sweet substances，we should think about taste and calorie of sweetness, which is important for our product to enter the market.
(2) Our biometric method involves the growth of the fungus, which may cause people to think about safety and health, so we should pack our items and ensure that the strain are safe and harmless.
(3) Before entering the market, we need to consider our project cost. Compared to the existing physical detection technology, our project cost shoule be an advantage.
ITCCC
In October, 2017, BIT-China was invited to take part in the the CGEM conference held by INTERNATIONAL TEENAGER COMPETITION AND COMMUNICATION CENTER. About 8 teams participated in the conference. All of them made splendid speeches to present their own projects and discuss with each other. During the special journey we got to know plenty of exciting ideas and got many useful help.
Conclusion
In our human practice, we got the idea of the project. Through this idea, we attached this idea to synthetic biology step by step. Finally, we completed it. In this process, we first understood the importance of sweetness for food through the form of social surveys. And we realized that people prefer natural sweeteners. Later, in order to target market, we went to one of China's most famous food companies, COFCO, learned that if we want to enter our project idea to the market in the future, we still faced with many problems. Such as cost, function and the value"

Marcus Podewski
Marcus was smuggled into the Heidelberg iGEM team by a fundamentalist animal protection and anti-genetic engineering movement to destroy the system from within, to burn it to the ground and to leave all participants with angst (Hegels 'Weltgeist' is descending and it will confuse all of you!) ... Besides such community services, he's studying History and Philosophy at the Universitiy of Heidelberg within the old system for a Magister (graduate degree) and a teaching degree. In order to pay his rent, Marcus works as a museum education officer in the UNESCO-World Heritage Monastery Lorsch and previously in the concentration camp memorial Mittelbau-Dora. He joined iGEM to elevate his philosophical studies to a more practical level and to apply his knowledge in bio- and technology ethics.
Philipp Bayer
Philipp was part of the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2008 and since then knows the obvious reason to join the competition again: iGEM simply is the most beautiful competition existing in biology and its mix of constructive creativity and team work guarantees a uniquely inspiring science experience. Philipp's beyond-iGEM scientific interests are in neuroscience and after finishing his bachelor thesis at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Neuroscience at University of Heidelberg, he will start his master studies in Neuroscience. Since Philipp has been mentoring science projects for high school kids for years, he also enjoys the interdisciplinary atmosphere of the Human Practice Projects in science communication in which he's involved.
Rebecca Berrens
Rebecca is a first year master's student in the Molecular Biotechnology program at the University of Heidelberg. She recently finished her bachelor thesis on drosophila microRNA binding site identification at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Joining the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2010, Rebecca seeks to link her strong background on microRNAs to bioengineering and discover a completely new area in synthetic biology within a creative research team.

Researching the Sequence of kerA
Planning subteams continued to order reagents and compile protocols.
The plasmid design team decided on gibson assembly to produce the kerA biobrick with geneblocks ordered from IDT.
kerA sequence was obtained from “Nucleotide Sequence and Expression of kerA, the Gene Encoding a Keratinolytic Protease of Bacillus licheniformis PWD-1” (Lin et al. 1995).
Two putative promoters (red), a possible ribosomal binding site (green), and a transcriptional terminator sequence (light blue, single underline) are indicated. The putative starting residues of the preprotein (pre = blue), proprotein (pro = pink), and mature protein (mature = purple) are indicated.
EcoRI (orange) and PstI (blue) sites within the gene are indicated and must be removed to produce the kerA biobrick.

Even though small molecules are less target specific compared to mAbs their characteristics can be beneficial; they can attack multiple targets, they most possibly have the ability to cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and thereby function as therapy against malignant brain tumors and other intercerebral and neurological diseases.
Despite these challenges and possibly other obstacles, the use of peptide aptamers in the future seems promising.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Project#SyntheticPeptides_-_-_TEXT.html," part is mediated by the aspartic acid at position 7, which forms an iso-peptide-bond with a corresponding lysine residue in the SpyCatcher.
The immobilization-region is designed for the binding to the solid support and detection of the peptides. It is located at the C-terminus of the tag-specific region and consists of aminocaproic acid (ε-AHX or Ahx), lysine and cysteine. The ε-amino group of the lysine is coupled to a carboxyfluorescein to enable easy detection the peptide. In this way also the detection of our fusion proteins by fluorescence labeling is achievable with low effort. The ε-AHX functions as spacer between the variable region and the fluorescein to ensure that the reactivity is not decreased due to steric hinderance by the carboxyfluorescein. The cysteine at the C-terminus is used for immobilization on commercial available SulfoLink-Resins or other thio-reactive matrices. The sequence of the immobilization-region of our peptides is therefore AhxK*C, for K* as the labelled lysine.
In essence, the following sequences result from these considerations:
Synthetic Intein:
 GVFVHNGA- AhxK*C
Synthetic SpyTag:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

In particular, let $n_{delftibactin}$ [mol] denote the number of delftibactin mol produced, $n_{glc}$ [mol] the glucose consumed and $t_f$ [h] the time at which the fermentation ends. All of these values can be can be easily calculated based on the results of the previous simulations.
$$ n_{delftibactin} = S_{delftibactin}V_f $$ $$ n_{glc} = S_{glc}^{start}V_0 + S_{glc}^{feed}(V_f-V_0) $$
and $t_f$ is just the time after which $\frac{dS_{delftibactin}}{dt} = 0 $.
Now also let
$t_{offset}$ [h] be the time until the next fermentation cycle can start, $P_{glc}$ [euros/mol glucose] be the price of glucose and $ p_{reactor} $, the cost of operating the reactor per time (equal to the wage for 1 technician per time and the electricity cost). Then the final cost $P_{delftibactin}$ per mol of delftibactin is equal to:
$$ P_{delftibactin} = \frac{n_{glc}P_{glc} + (t_f+t_{offset})p_{reactor}}{n_{delfti}} $$
Based on the above equation equation, for each simulated point of the production envelope, the cost per mmol of delftibactin was calculated (Fig.6). In the figure the trade-off between growth rate and delftibactin production immediately becomes obvious. In fact, the relationship of price to growth rate appears to be parabolic and actually has a global minimum. This global minimum of 0.1755 Euro per mmol of Delftibactin achieved to a growth rate $ \mu = 0.37 h^{-1}$ (total process time of 29.7 hours, final delftibactin titer of 61 mmol/L) is the cost we will assume in the next section.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Result_-_-_TEXT.html," coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used; thereby helping to prevent resistance development.
The Worm Buster
The first thing the team did was to define the desired characteristics of the worm buster and outline the project strategy
Requirements
Our bacteria needs to live in the intestinal tracts of horses.
They also need the ability to report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces.
The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
Project Outline
1. Worm Culturing
The first step was to obtain live nematodes by the recovery of the eggs from the feces. After this process the large strongyles were divided from the small strongyles using a 3D printed microfluidic chip or a microscope and stored for successive use.
Figure 2: The first stage of worm culturing.
2. Transcriptomics + Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we needed an approach that would allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we developed new applications of two existing approaches.
Transcriptomics
For the first one, we have been developing a custom transcriptomic analysis protocol. This was necessary because transcriptomics is a new application for Oxford Nanopore technology. The transcriptomics procedure relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA. This will ideally reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!                                       As our result show, transcriptomics with the nanopore MinION works if a better technique to reduce the amount of RNA in the sample is discovered thus we have discovered a new application to Oxford Nanopore Technology.
Figure 3: Flowchart representing the trancsriptomics outline.
Phage Display
The second approach used a technique called “Phage Display”, which utilizes a random peptide library expressed on the surface of phages. By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple peptide suggestions that may bind"

Because to see it and do it myself put it into a state of reality that made much more sense than a thing that you just talk about. It was very nice and interesting to do experiments in a real laboratory and to imagine being a biologist who wants to find the biological origin of an unknown sample. And generally to know that something like this is possible is fascinating. I would like to do something like this again and I would suggest to do it with my friends.

9th - 11th May 2012 4th Annual Meeting of Senior Experts of Chemistry (GDCh)
After the project of the iGEM team of TU Darmstadt stood firm and the beginning of lab work came up, the team had the opportunity to present their project to the elder people. The Society for German Chemists (GDCh) organizes every year a meeting of senior experts in chemistry. At this congress, the team could occur with three posters and convince the elderly from their project ""Next Generation Recycling"". The project met with great interest, and there were long discussions about costs and feasibility of it. It was not unusual that present chemists themselves were involved in the production of plastics or on the other hand developed new chemical-based recycling processes on it. Many did not know the way of seeing things with the view of biology yet and were surprised what opportunities this new view offered. The iGEM team quickly realized that it is not easy to convince a chemist from biology. It was easy to explain the degradation of the polymer with its chemical structure, but it is more difficult to explain genetics and even more the BioBrick system. Nonetheless was the presentation a huge success and they were able to convince the elder people of the idea. It was not only convincing the people for the project, but also the discussion about the new topic of Synthetic Biology, which is a contrary topic in Germany. It was important for the team to achieve not only one group of residents in Germany but as many as possible. For the team it was necessary to inform the people about new scientific technologies in a true and open way. Chemists, who are still working and dealing with the recycling of waste, came to the team and wanted to know, if the project could be extended to other substances. It turns out that the method of bioremediation is not used in its maximum manner and there are a lot more tasks outside to deal with. So the project of the iGEM team of Darmstadt is a hint into to the future and could soon find its application.

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"Professor Yves Carlier
Professor Carlier is a researcher in infectious diseases and clinical immunology at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. We first contacted him early on in our project to gain more information about the pathology of congenital Chagas disease. He informed us about the benefits of diagnosing Chagas disease in neonates, such as that treatment with benznidazole cures around 100% of babies if given before one year of age but not later in life. He emphasised the need for a diagnostic for neonates that would detect alive parasites,  strengthening our resolve to focus on congenital Chagas disease. To ensure that our test would be triggered only by an active infection of living parasites, we decided to design the diagnostic so it would detect the circulating cruzipain naturally released by living parasites into the blood and would not involve the lysis of the parasite to release cruzipain.
Dr. Carlier also directed us towards specific reading, such as his latest review on Maternal-fetal transmission of Trypanosoma published in 2017. Information from his review and other published research helped us estimate the parasite concentration in the blood of newborns and immunity parameters after treatment, which were required for our modelling, and about which very little is known due to a lack of long term studies. Further correspondence with Dr. Carlier provided us with insights into the parasitology of congenital Chagas disease influenced our applied design. For example, the examination of biological samples of the same neonates weeks after birth increases the sensitivity of parasitological detection since the neonatal parasitic loads often increase up to 13 months after delivery, consequently we recommend testing all infants using our kit twice in the optimal diagnostic strategy for congenital chagas disease using a rapid protease detecting kit.
Dr Cristina Alonso-Vega
Dr Alonso-Vega of the University of San Simón, Cochabamba who ran the National Congenital Chagas Disease Programme in Bolivia from 2004-2009, and is an expert in congenital Chagas gave us specific guidance for implementation of our diagnostic device in Bolivia. She confirmed the suitability of our congenital test in Bolivian hospitals, where most deliveries occur. We also learnt that Chagas treatment for under 15’s is free, giving us confidence that our diagnostic would be accessible and impactful in containing Chagas if provided in a hospital setting.
Our discussion with her further emphasised the requirement for a rapid point of care test that would allow treatment of infected newborns to begin before they left the hospital, which led us to re-evaluate the desired output of our kinetic models"

NYMU_TAIPEI
We have continued and strengthened our long-standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). They troubleshooted our cloning procedure and design of primers, gave us protocols for assaying biofilm production, and trained our future iGEMers (Leona and Catherine).
In return, we helped add to the characterization of their lactose-induced suicide mechanism: the Holin-Endolysin-NrtA system ( BBa_K2350021 ). We measured the population of their kill-switch bacteria in different lactose concentrations, and found that our results are consistent with their findings.
We independently tested the function of NYMU_Taipei’s lactose-induced kill-switch system. Different concentrations (0-250 mM) of lactose were tested for their effects on bacteria population. Experiment: Yvonne Wei
Additionally, this year two members from TAS (Catherine and Leona) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments and human practices for NYMU throughout the year. In Boston, they will also help NYMU present their project at the Giant Jamboree.
CGU_Taiwan
We first met the CGU_Taiwan team at the end of our presentation for the Asia Pacific iGEM Conference hosted at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU).
They were excited that our biofilms were able to trap nanoparticles and wondered if biofilm could trap ink as well. CGU_Taiwan is working on improving the procedure to manufacture reprocessed paper. They found that a process called “flotation,” typically used to de-ink paper, could cause significant paper fiber loss. They wondered if biofilm could potentially replace the current flotation process to preserve paper fibers. We offered to test this for CGU_Taiwan. We used a similar experimental procedure as our preliminary biofilm trapping experiment"

iGEM Copenhagen: Bricks of Knowledge
The Copenhagen iGEM team has set into motion a great initiave called Bricks of Knowledge. As the name says, the initiative is all about collecting knowledge in bricks (videos). The idea behind it is to provide the new teams and pretty much the whole iGEM community with important information related to the competition. The way they implemented it was by inviting other iGEM teams to make a video about any topic they find relevant, it could be anything going from  fundraising and creating your team's wiki to lab and modeling techniques. We thought this was a very interesting project, so we decided to leave our footprint on this project and made our brick about autoclaving.

Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Modular_-_-_TEXT.html,"ucleotide synthesis has a limited sequence length that can be reached without errors, so larger constructs require the use of subcloning, which further expands the project’s cost. This is when the In-Fusion tool comes in handy, as it makes it possible, through flanking site recombination, to construct precise DNA molecules by joining several fragments. This allows for the synthesis of separate sequences to be ordered and then these fragments to be used in a single reaction that will end up with the final desired construct, with the modular design strategy implemented.
Having the option to easily manipulate different sections of the genetic construct makes it possible to debug a genetically engineered system by switching the involved components and using trial and error, so malfunctioning parts can be edited. This property also makes it easier to characterize certain parts by enabling the use of different expression assemblies. A module can be constituted by a switchable promoter or reporter gene, for example, offering the opportunity to reuse systems that have been proved useful to study new single parts.
Promoters for P. pastoris
Ever since the potential of genetic engineering became apparent, we have seen a rise in the use of synthetic biology to develop full-fledged systems working for the very interests of mankind. The idea that a basic system could potentially be used in the production of a whole range of molecules suggests that this kind of multi-directed manufacturing could be designed to optimally synthesize any given product at a given time. This is when the idea of a modular biofactory comes up, and the proper strategies for its design and execution were the focus of the project. When working with P. pastoris as an expression system, a need for a controlled expression evidences a lack of related parts in the registry. Therefore, the characterization of four inducible promoters is presented. The registry’s insufficiency of expression tools for alternative systems like this yeast is thus addressed. P. pastoris offers an expression system that has proven useful in substantial protein production, especially in molecules requiring post-translational modifications. Cultures of this yeast are able to achieve relatively large cell densities, allowing greater amounts of biomass to be used for production. Also, this organism is non-pathogenic and regarded as biologically safe, making it a relevant alternative for expression systems.  Using GFP as a reporter for the strength of each promoter, the detected fluorescence is registered as proportional to the level of expression of the gene. The emitted radiation can be quantified by a fluorescence microplate reader, as well as by fluorescence microscopy, using specialized software (ImageJ) for an objective appraisal of the images. The results here presented reveal the successful implementation of the promoters in"

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#PlasmidConstruction_-_-_TEXT.html,"rep Kit . Some of the overnight   cultures seemed to already express the sfGFP (see Figure 5). Firstly,    concentration of the plasmids obtained was measured on Nanodrop.    Secondly, plasmids were sent for sequencing and then stored at    -20°C.
Figure 5. Pellet of the overnight cultures from sample     2 and 5. Looks like the sfGFP(Sp) is also expressed in E. coli Top10.
Sequencing:
Sequencing results showed that sfGFP(Sp) gene is present (see Figure 6). However something happened with the prefix and the suffix most probably during cloning steps. It looks that prefix and also suffix was disrupted by insertion of few base pairs. We cannot really explain what happened and due to time limitation we could not fix this problem. However sfGFP(Sp) is clearly expressed in E. coli (see Figure 5).
Figure 6. Sequencing result of sfGFP(Sp) in pSB1C3. GFP gene itself is underlined by red line.
Conclusion:
The sfGFP(Sp) was cloned to the backbone pSB1C3. However from the sequencing results we could see that this part contains bad prefix and suffix (see Figure 6). GFP gene is underlined by red line on Figure 6, however you could also see the bad prefix and suffix.
Experiments
See decoy experiments with sfGFP(Sp) in B. subtilis.
sfGFP(Sp) in pDR111 and in pDR111+message plasmid
sfGFP(Sp) is a reporter gene originally optimized for Streptococcus pneumoniae. It has been shown when expressed in B. subtilis that the signal is even brighter than the one from sfGFP(Bs) (Overkamp et al. 2013) . sfGFP(Sp) was cloned either only to pDR111 integration plasmid or to   pDR111+message plasmid. These plasmids were constructed with an interest to   have easier screening when integrated into the B. subtilis genome. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be integrated into the B.   subtilis genome. By double cross-over it replaces amyE gene, which is   necessary for production of alpha-amylase ,   with desired insert which is located between amyE front flanking region and   amyE back flanking region. See the plasmid map below.

SDS-PAGE Verification of Fractions
Verify purity and presence of protein at correct MW on SDS.
If pure, proceed to BCA pooling.
If impure, proceed to BCA pooling only with the most purified fractions.
BCA pooling
Pool the most pure fractions together in a 50 mL conical to concentrate the amount of proteins in solution possible for the Co-Spinning Procedure.
Use the Protein Concentrators purchased to centrifuge and concentrate the solutions completely.
Imidazole removal via dialysis of pooled fractions
Imidazole interferes at the 280nm necessary for excitation during the BCA colorimetric assay, protocol used here [1]
Save 4 mL of the pooled fraction for dialysis using dialysis cassettes following the Teule (Nature 2009) protocol here [2] .
The following is the protocol (using tubing -- will be adjusted for use in cassettes):
Take a piece of prepared dialysis tubing and wash it under running deionized water. Clip one end of the tubing to make a bag. Transfer 4 ml of the eluted fractions into the dialysis bag (fractions 4–7 from Steps 51 and 52) and close the bag with another clip. Place the closed bag in a large beaker filled with deionized water (4 liters) over a stirring plate to dialyze the samples at room temperature. Change the dialysis buffer (water) at least 10 times, at 2 h intervals over a period of 24 h. The dialysis is important to remove the components of the elution buffer. For freeze-drying58, dialyze the sample extensively against 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate.
BCA Assay
Conduct BCA Assay using the protocol and reagents found here [3] .
It is necessary to pool samples and dialyze"

In order to create a bistable in S. pombe based on epigenetic regulation, we have mimic the architecture of natural genes, that are flanked by regulatory sequences, and we have designed a gene expression reporter system (promoter:GFP) which is flanked upstream and downstream by binding sites for engineering silencing proteins (SP). This reporter system will be integrated in S. pombe genome. The silencing proteins consist of fusion proteins or kymeras, composed by tetracycline repressor (tetR) and one silencing protein, or a domain of it. TetR will cause binding to tetR operator sites (tetO) and silencing proteins will be responsible for the recruitment of silencing proteins that will compact and inactivate the promoter.  We expect that the recruitment and spreading of silencing proteins at flanking region of promoters will have a drastic effect on gene expression, due to the interference of promoter activity. When silencing proteins are expressed, compaction of DNA sequence will lead to gene repression, resulting in the OFF state. The ON state will be attained by repressing the expression of silencing proteins that will result in decompaction of nucleated structure, just like a zip. The result of this experimental design will be an epigenetic bistable.
ON state: To reach this state it is necessary the addition of three different chemicals to the cell culture: thiamine, doxicycline and uracil. Thiamine is used to repress the promoter of silencing genes. Thiamine regulates expression of Pnmt1 promoter (no message in thiamine promoter, 41X). Doxicycline functions as a decompaction compound, because of it ability to dissolve the structure nucleated around operator sites of reporter module, allowing the expression of"
Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportFullIntroduction_-_-_TEXT.html," is about ethics in synthetic biology. Thus, we will poll, question those hopes, anguishes and promises linked to that new discipline in that ethical perspective.
The ethical reflexion has some intellectual constraints : we will have to take account of and challenge the abstraction of the moral and normative while facing the complexity of the social world it is trying to rule. Ethics in science is quite difficult to define, I decide to consider it as the challenge of the coexistence of a free scientific research, both in theory and practices, and the social responsibilities of those scientific theories and practices. In this introduction, we will have to consider two sets of stakes, two dimensions relevant to that challenge. At first, in the field of ethics : how and for what aim was the ethical reflexion on the sciences built? Then, in the field of science : why do scientists have to consider, through the concept of risk, the social world?
Perspectives from the field of ethics : polyphony and the moral imperative.
Deontology in science (as a professional ethical code or a code of professional responsibility) , since Hippocrates, was gradually twisted, invested, questioned by a series of social actors and disciplines. It no longer belongs to doctors and, largely, to scientists, on their own and in a “corporatist” way, traditional and endogenous, to rule the moral implications of their works and productions. It is an ethics “by doctors, for doctors”.
The main rupture which leads us from medical ethics to bioethics happened after World War II, with collective reflexions about human rights and science, coming to us from the “by doctors, for doctors” perspective. During the 60's, two kinds of events happened that shaped the development of bioethics : some scandalous cases (for example the Thalidomide, the Brooklyn and Willowbrook cases) and the emergence of new critical and political discourses claiming individual rights, autonomy and contesting authority, and, through that criticism, medical and scientific authority.
The singularity of bioethics comes from this plurality of legitimate social actors, disciplines and discourses about “good practices in science”. Among these, medical and scientific discourses are joined  with discourses from the theological and juridical fields, as well as discourses from activists, ecologists, citizens, consumers, patient, etc. That singularity comes with a enlargement of the scale of the object of the ethical thought : from medicine to life science. In the United States of America during the 70's, that movement came with a polarization of the ethical concerns"

I am the leader of the biofilm group at the INRA Micalis Institute. I have focused my research on microbial biofilms present in the food chain with special emphasis on their role in the persistence of pathogens. One of my main scientific line of interest is to identify the link between the 3D spatial organization of biofilms and the survival mechanisms of cells in face to the exposition of antimicrobials. Recently, my team reported that a tiny proportion of certain Bacillus species can tunnel through biofilms, creating pores that allow molecules to flow in. We are now evaluating the industrial benefit to pretreat target biofilms with swimming Bacilli cocktails to increase their efficacy and reduced their ecological impact.

I just graduated from the INSA Lyon in Biotechnologies but after two participations at the iGEM Competition, I couldn’t do anything but continue my studies with a master in bioinformatics. After two years working in the lab for the team, I came back this year trying to help out the new team, sharing my experiences. Actually, they didn’t really need my help. They’ve done a great job with Biofilm Killer. And for sure you’ll have to deal with them in Amsterdam and Boston.

We decided to investigate the significance of other factors that may prevent people from taking medications to treat their illness. We asked the participants to rank the following factors against each other: efficacy, cost, accessibility, potential short term side effects, potential long term side effects, and invasiveness of the treatment. The graph showing these results is depicted below:
The graph shows that most people believe efficacy is the crucial factor when determining whether or not to use a medication. After that, potential long term side effects seems to be the next candidate on the list, followed by invasiveness, cost, accessibility, and short term side effects. Based on these results, we now have an idea of what aspects of our product to address and how to prioritize them accordingly.
The results of the survey we distributed to various iGEM teams and members of the local community indicate that many people would be amenable to oral administration of a cancer therapeutic. Notably, ingestion of some probiotics such as the one described by Danino et. al. in “Programmable Probiotics for Detection of Cancer in Urine” (2015), would enable colonization of colorectal hepatic metastases by E. coli. The receptivity towards an orally ingested probiotic for cancer treatment will be considered when designing an administration protocol for SilenshR.
Additionally, the results of the survey seem to indicate a preoccupation with the multifarious side effects of the pursued treatment avenue. While cancer is a deadly disease whose prognoses vary, the side effects of chemotherapy could prove daunting enough to discourage some patients from pursuing therapy. For this reason, we designed the SilenshR bacterium to be capable of specific targeting of cancerous tissue. The advancement of SilenshR beyond the haphazard systemic cytotoxicity of chemotherapy might offer cancer patients peace of mind and assurance when considering pursuing treatment.

UCL_London,2010,Team:UCL London#Genetic Circuit_-_-_TEXT.html," the cell to begin producing the proteins. Traditionally, this was done with the manual addition by the operator of IPTG to the cells. The employment of inducible promoters, i.e. pNark, that works by interfering with a repressor protein, LacI, a protein that inhibits transcription by binding to the promoter. The polymerase, T7RNA P, is located downstream of the pNark, where it binds to DNA and begins transcription. The repressor protein, LacI, blocks the access to the pLacI promoter, because it is prevented by the pNark promoter. Therefore the role of the pNark inducible promoter is double: to accept the signal for cell induction and production of mRNA and proteins through the loop and also to inhibit the repressor binding to DNA. The addition of IPTG into the system, will cause the induction of the pLacI promoter which was repressed by the LacI proteins during the duration of the positive feedback loop and will be the regulator. The anti-PA binds to the promoter activator and reversibly stops the positive loop and hence, transcription terminates.
According to Purnick and Weiss (2009), the first wave of synthetic biology includes the combination of promoters, RBS (ribosome binding sites) and transcriptional repressors for the formation of functional modules e.g. controlled protein expression. Such a novel circuit design was based on principles like the creation and analysis of a genetic circuit, the experimental evaluation of the circuit and the combatibility of the results with literature. Moreover, they refer to directed evolution, which is about the optimisation of biobricks and the system i.e. the biological circuit.
The graphs, as produced with the BSim programme, show the protein expression. The positive feedback loop gives a much quicker red fluorescent protein expression, or within a specific timeframe it yields a higher protein expression compared to the normal IPTG method.
Therefore, as more “mature” engineering fields exist like mechanical and electrical, the project was “expressed” in those terms. For example the standard computational programmes SolidWorks and Verilog are powerful tools for the expression of equipment and circuits respectively in the engineering fields mentioned above. Comparatively engineering toolboxes that will enable the visual construction of models, using those programmes for the needs of a synthetic biology, will enable a quantitative understanding of how parts of a biological system when come together behave in different manners. Through this combination it is believed that the whole perspective of Synthetic Biology will be transformed (Carlson, 2009).

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Implementation#methodology_-_-_TEXT.html," later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Genetic probability model
In our project, we aim to get C. elegans strains with the preference for blue lights and the aversion for red lights by miniMos injection. Therefore, we build a miniMos injection model in order to simulate and estimate numbers of injected worms that can expressed two phenotypes.
Fig 2.1  The overview of miniMos Transfection Model
Fig 2.12  The overview of microinjection
The successful rate of miniMos injection
First we need to consider the successful rate of miniMos system. The microinjection needs accurate operations to inject plasmids into C. elegans gonads, which allows plasmids to enter the embryos and maintain the phenotypes. Therefore, accurate manual operations can lead to a promising result. According to the miniMos protocol, the probability of correct injection is approximately 60% excluding manual errors, and about 10% of F1 can be rescued, meaning that the plasmid expression rate(transposon transfers target gene into chromosomes) is about 10%. [1] So the successful rate is:
accurate rate of manual operation * plasmid expression rate = 60% * 10% = 6%.

The stable inheritance rate
After got heterozygote F1 via miniMos injection, our next step is to get stable expression worms in F2 generation. During the F2 generation, based on the Mendel's laws, if two genes are located on different chromosomes, their alleles will segregate independently during the formation of gametes. And Mendel calculated the probability of getting stable expression F2, the ideal rate is \frac{1}{16}
. Therefore, in our experiment, the prospecting result of getting target strains is"

The detected gas content proves the correctness of the literature data, which was simulated in the laboratory according to the proportion of gas in the exhaust gas in the literature. A proportionate gas is manually mixed and passed through water to prepare an unsaturated solution. Depending on the time of access, the amount of carbon dioxide in the solution is continuously tested and used as a source of data for our mathematical modeling.

    3. Paying Visit to Biochemical Research Center and Discuss Project with Professor Xia Xu
On Sept.26,2018,members of the Team AHUT_China were very honored to visit the biochemical research center and visit professor Xia Xu.Professor Xu is a doctoral supervisor.Her research direction is mainly based on molecular simulation,which is designed for drug delivery, CO2 capture and transformation, biological materials,anti-microbial, disease treatment and functional polypeptide in vitro-detection, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, microfluidics, online detection technology and so on.
We communicated with Prof. Xu about the project of absorbing CO2 in the air by introducing the synthetic modified carbonic anhydrase gene into escherichia coli and raised some relevant questions, and she gave us detailed answers.Here were our interview content.
Fig.10 Discusstion with Pro.Xia Xu
①Q:The laboratory has synthesized the gene sequence of human carbonic anhydrase by the total synthesis method, which, as far as we know, is a little bit different from the original one. May I ask you what these differences are?
A:Compared with the natural one, the synthetic gene of human carbonic anhydrase by the total synthesis method replaces the 203rd amino acid.As a result,the synthetic gene performs more stable when exposed at high temperatures.Our main application scenario is in the factory, so the modified human carbonic anhydrase must be highly active under such conditions.
②Q:Our project is to introduce the full synthetic gene sequence of human carbonic anhydrase into escherichia coli through psb1c3 carrier to achieve the goal of absorbing CO2 in the air through carbonic anhydrase. Therefore, we want to get some information about the frontier in this field home and abroad, for instance, the technology of absorbing CO2 in the air through biology or other methods and so on"

Conclusions and Future Work
We have successfully managed to BioBrick standardise deGFP for the first time, and have fully characterised this reporter, both in cells and in cell-free systems. As expected, this GFP variant showed fluorescence in both types of chassis. We also compared this GFP variant to superfolder GFP (sfGFP), which as far as we are aware has not been done before. We found that sfGFP had a higher fluoresence intensity in whole cells and CFPS systems compared to deGFP.
deGFP was engineered from the eGFP variant originally by removing RBS-like binding sites from the sequence, and truncating the sequence in an attempt to enhance translational efficiency. It may be possible in the future to engineer a better alternative to deGFP by using sfGFP as a starting point, rather than eGFP.

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production"

This is corroborated by the fact that there is a strong band between 200 and 300 bp, which corresponds nicely to the length of pCYC (288 bp).  However, it is important to note that there was also a small band around 700-800 bp as well.

I-SceI is an intron-encoded endonuclease. It is present in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and recognises an 18-base pair sequence 5'-TAGGGATAA▽CAGGGTAAT-3' (3'-ATCCC△TATTGTCCCATTA-5') and leaves a 4 base pair 3' hydroxyl overhang. It is a rare cutting endonuclease. Statistically an 18-bp sequence will occur once in every 6.9*10^10 base pairs or once in 20 human genomes.

pRha L-rhamnose-inducible promoter is capable of high-level protein expression in the presence of L-rhamnose, it is also tightly regulated in the absence of L-rhamnose and by the addition of D-glucose.
pRha is probably the best candidate for us because of two reasons:
It is a new promoter, and so it will be orthogonal to any other existing system. It supports the modularity idea of our project.
It was reported in the literature to be appropriate for the expression of toxic genes.
L-rhamnose is taken up by the RhaT transport system, converted to L-rhamnulose by an isomerase RhaA and then phosphorylated by a kinase RhaB. Subsequently, the resulting rhamnulose-1-phosphate is hydrolyzed by an aldolase RhaD into dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which is metabolized in glycolysis, and L-lactaldehyde. The latter can be oxidized into lactate under aerobic conditions and be reduced into L-1,2-propanediol under unaerobic conditions.[ 7 ]
The E. coli rhaBRS locus. In the presence of L-rhamnose, RhaR activates transcription of rhaR and rhaS, resulting in an accumulation of RhaS. RhaS then acts as the L-rhamnose-dependent positive regulator of the rhaB promoter.

When cultivated with AzoF in cis- or trans-conformation we detected a significant difference in the lycopene production. Therefore, we proved that photoswitching of enzyme activity on protein level  can be achieved using our system.
Design of the AzoF-RS
The AzoF-RS ( BBa_K2201207 ) was based on a part exchange with CU Boulder 2017 . They got it from the Schultz lab, which performed a selection experiment on the M. jannaschii TyrRS to evolve a new aaRS capable of incorporating the photoisomerizable phenylalanine-4‘-azobenzene (AzoF). Figure 1 shows a sequence alignment of the protein sequences of the M. jannaschii TyrRS and the AzoF-RS after the selection process.
Figure 1: Sequence alignment of the M. jannaschii TyrRS and the AzoF-RS of the Schultz lab. The alignment shows six differences in the protein sequences, at position partizipating in the binding process.
Two Amber-crtI-Variants
We created two variants in which the crtI gene in the lycopene pathway has an amber-codon incorporated; one at the position 318 and the other at position 353. We cultivated E.coli BL21(DE3) transformed with  the two amber-variants and a functional CrtI for 24 hours at 37°C and centrifuged the culture. The pellet of the strain with the functional CrtI showed a visible orange color, typical for lycopene (Figure 2). The two amber-variants showed no color due to the absence of lycopene caused by the non-functional CrtI in the lycopene pathway .
Figure 2: Cell pellets of the three crtI-variants vortexed in 400 µL acetone. Functional CrtI-variant (left), amber-codon at position 318 (middle) and amber-codon at position 353 (right).
We then extracted the lycopene from the pellet to quantify the amount of lycopene produced by the three cultures. For that, we resuspended the pellet in 400 µL acetone and vortexed it to solve the lycopene. After adding 400 µL water, we performed an absorbance measurement. First, we generated an absorbance spectrum to identify the best wavelength for the quantification (Figure 3).

One rus overexpressing A. ferrooxidans strain and another expressing the mer determinant for a mercury resistant A. caldus strain. Once more suitable transformation protocols have been developed, it maybe feasible to modulate quorum-sensing signals with engineered microbes by either attenuating or amplifying natural signals or sending artificial signals to promote biofilm formation or mobilization respectively as recently demonstrated with engineered E.coli cells.
Fungi in acid mine drainage
Roles of fungi, the natural residents of acid mine drainage(AMD) and its attenuator are not emphasized adequately in the mine water research. Though AMD appears to be a certain special enviroment with relatively high metal concentration as well low pH, several species of fungi are also isolated from the AMD carrying streams, even AMD. Generally, fungi occur over a wide pH range (pH 1.0–11.0) and have been detected in acid habitats like volcanic springs, acid mine drainage or acid industrial wastewaters. Many of them are primarily acid-tolerant, but truly acidophilic species have also been detected[talbe.1]. While extracellular precipitation, complexation and crystallization, metal transformation, biosorption and sequestration are seen for fungi, endow fungi the ability to survive.
Under this condition, fungi may play the important role as primary degraders of complex organic matter, due to the absence of invertebrates that actively shred the leaves (shredders) at pH values below 3.5. At the same time, the fungi will contribute to oxygen consumption, thereby limiting oxidative stress for the anaerobic bactiria. Moreover, fungi can be directly involved in the reduction of ferric iron or sulphur. Comparatively, more reports are available concerning the absorption of heavy metals by fungi, in comparison to bacteria or algae in freshwater ecosystem. Fungi can absorb metals in their cell wall or adsorb in extracellular polysaccharide slime. This capacity enables them to grow in the presence of high amounts of heavy metals. Fungal activity in acid mine drainage is represented in Fig.3

Conclusion
Biomining, is used to describe the novel approach in mining industry when microorganisms are applied to the extraction and recovery of precious and base metals from ores and concentrates. Compared with the conventional approachs, such as pyrometallurgical technologies and pressure leaching in mining industry, bioming has its unique advantages in energy conservation and"

Aside from these minor differences the experiments were kept equal to one another and the same processing steps were performed upon completion. (It should be noted that the experiments were performed using the Xl-1-Blue E.coli strain as this strain showed the most promising results the previous time around.
Having taken the samples during the expression experiment they were spun down and purified. This purified sample was then loaded onto a 12% SDS gel for analysis.
SDSgelPurified0andprocent The columns labelled C- and C+ are respectively a negative and positive control. The negative control was obtained by purifying a sample of an aerobic culture containing the same bacteria. The positive control was a known EGFP protein (which has a higher height due its binding to the CNA35 protein. There are also two sets of samples with the names t1 through to t6. The first of these come from the repeat experiment at 0% Oxygen and the second set from the repeat experiment at 5% Oxygen.
Looking at the thick band of proteins at approximately 60kDa is again clearly visible. Again the band where EGFP is to be expected has been outlined and once again the bands seen there are of very low intensity. Looking at these results it would appear that they are equal to the results of the previously performed expression.  In an attempt to enhance the EGFP bands, and to show without doubt that these vague bands are in fact EGFP, it was decided to perform a Western Blot.
The Western Blot was performed by first running a 12% SDS gel loaded with the same samples as were loaded on the SDS gel shown in . This gel was then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blotting for 60 minutes at 100V the membrane was washed in a PBS/Tween solution containing 5% milk powder. Hereafter the membrane was washed, now with a PBS/Tween solution containing 0.5% milk powder and EGFP binding antibodies. After washing this antibody solution off the membrane with PBS/Tween solution, another 0.5% milk powder PBS/Tween solution now with the according secondary antibody was poured over the membrane. Finally the membrane was washed with pure PBS/Tween again before being stained with TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) solution. This revealed the EGFP bands which were still to be found on the membrane. The stained membrane can be seen below in .

The reaction mix was inactivated by heating it to 80°C for 20 minutes. A ligation was set up with the fragments, and 9 µl of the ligation product was transformed to 100 µl of competent DH5α.
25/09/18
Felix
The transformation was successful. 6 colonies could be spotted. These were inoculated overnight in 5 ml LB with chloramphenicol.
26/09/18
Lorenzo, Felix
The DNA of the inoculated cultures was minipreped according to the miniprep protocol . After the first spin down we noticed that the bacterial pellet of one of the colonie number 6 was slightly red. Because it is known that RFP expressing bacteria turn red even without excitation, we concluded that it was most likely that this colony expressed RFP, and thus that the transformation worked. After the isolation of the DNA, a colony PCR was done with the VF and VR primer. The total size of the band that we expected was 824 + 156 -6 = 974 bp for the fragment + 271 bp for the part outside the BB_sites generated by the VF and VR primer. The total size of the fragment should thus be 1245 bp. The fragment in lane 6 lies between the 1000 bp band and the 1500 bp band and starts slightly lower than the middle, indicating that it is most likely a band of correct size.
The DNA of this colony was send for sequencing.

The sequencing results showed that the construct was correct. Since both the promoter::RFP fusion, and the Custom receptor were now available to us on plasmid backbones with different resistance genes, both constructs were transformed to E. coli DH5α.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

Quick Facts:

Obligate Parasite
Course of Infection
Yersinia pestis is the cause of what is colloquially known as the Plague. Primarily found in rodents, which contract the bacteria from their frequent contact with fleas, humans play no role in the long term survival of Y. pestis. (Perry 51) Transmission of the bacteria occur when fleas feed on the blood of rodents, some of which is regurgitated into the mammal. The spread then continues through predators and other mammals that either come into contact with infected rodents or directly ingest the infected rodent. Today, domesticated cats are the primary cause of most Y. pestis infections, prompting concerns over veterinarian health and creating a resurgence of attention for the bacterium.
Infection Types
There are three primary forms that human plague cases will occur in, these being bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. “Over the past 24 years, the majority of patients in the United States have had either bubonic or septicemic plague.” (Perry 57) Pneumonic plague is far more rare and deadly. It is spread by respiratory droplets and its incubation period can be as little as one to three days. Symptoms of the bubonic form include painful and swollen lymph nodes and fever. The symptoms of the other two forms are hard to detect. Septicemic plague symptoms resemble that of other gram-negative septicemias (Perry 58) and pneumonic plague can be misdiagnosed as other pulmonary infections since chills, headaches, and gastrointestinal disturbances are common symptoms.
Treatment
All three forms are treatable with antibiotics such as Streptomycin, Gentamicin, Oxytetracycline, Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, and Do"
Grenoble-Alpes,2017,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#LabBook_-_-_TEXT.html," Vc’s genome [2]. Indeed, the integrated sequence contains genes for toxins, responsible for symptoms of cholera disease. Based on the actual knowledge [3], the target has been chosen inside CTX’s genome, and more precisely within the non-pathogenic genes of CTX (i.e. genes with roles in the reproduction or in the metabolism of the bacteriophage). One requirement was to detect something specific to the bacteriophage CTX. After a blast of all CTX’s genes, genes with low similarity to other organisms have been retained. Then the target had to be quite small (less than 100 bp) as well as being cut with a single enzyme (ideally blunt end). Finally, the target was found in RstA gene (1080bp, implicated in CTX DNA integration and replication [3]), between nucleotide 726 and nucleotide 765.

Two versions of the probe has been designed. The first (Version 1) permits a cloning with a single restriction enzyme EcoRI (Figure 2).

The insertion strategy was changed afterall  in order to facilitate the cloning.
The probe has been imagined based on the genius system of Cork Ireland 2015 team and all the data furnished by New England Biolabs (NEB) website. It is flanked with two EcoRI sites at each end for its insertion in a plasmid backbone. It also contains :
Two restriction enzymes producing cohesives end, BmtI and BglII, which goal is to remove the little sequence in between on the bottom strand and thus to create a perfect complementarity with the target.
Two nicking enzymes, Nt.BspQ1 and Nb.btsI, i.e. enzymes that cut one strand of the double DNA strand. Thereby, the top strand is removed, allowing the binding of the target.

Upon cooling the bottles and the sterile water, the liquid culture from the 2L flask was distributed evenly between three bottles (and balanced by adding sterile water).  The bottles were centrifuged at 6000g for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was discarded.  Each cell pellet was resuspended in 25mL of sterile water, and vortexed to resuspend.  Each bottle was pooled, mixed, and distributed evenly between two 50mL falcon tubes.  8mL from one was taken to be used for a small-scale protein purification.  The remaining bottles were balanced, and centrifuged again for 15min at 6000g.  The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was stored in the -20C freezer.  The sample for small-scale purification was centrifuged, resuspended, and transferred to a 1.5mL before collecting the pellet to be frozen at -20C.

2) Modified. Gal1 system
In this pathway, we introduced one kind of artificial transcription factor (ATF)—Z4EV into the regulation of HO gene expression. With Z4EV working with our Modified. Gal1 promoter, we hoped to reach the on off-target dynamic control of HO gene expression.  Our design for getting the Modified. Gal1-HO-CYC1 parts (MGHC) is quite the same as that for GHC mentioned above, only that we acquired our Modified. Gal1 part from the gene synthesis.
Fig. 1-2. Modified. Gal1 system
Fig. 1-2. Modified. Gal1 system
As for the expression of Z4EV gene, we intended to induce it into the SynX chromosome in SynⅩ-dUra by homologous recombination. With overlap PCR strategy, we put a homologous domain CanA (originally from Can gene in chromosome X) in the upstream of the promoter of Z4EV. Thus, we got our CanA-TEF-Z4EV part. Then we planned to use Tdh2t as terminator attached with Leu-CanB (another part of Can gene).
Next, for double using the Leu-tag, we introduce Vika/vox system. We intended to attach the Vika operator (Tdh3p-Vika-Tdh2t, TVT) following the Z4EV gene. We had two groups of yeasts, as mentioned above, one of them were aimed to accomplish MTS and become MATα, the other with functional genes remained as MATa. According to our design, the former will express Vika gene and generate Vika recombinase, and the other contains functional genes whose expressions are controlled by vox-Terminator-vox structure. Thus, the function genes' expression will be initiated during the cell fusion in yeast mating process with Terminator being deleted.

TEST of MTS
In this section, we only got to test the Gal1 System due to time limits. And we figured that the result for Gal1 System is adequately enough to represent the feasibility of our designed strategy for MTS.
The whole test process can be divided into three steps.

In vitro CRISPR assay + EMSA
To test these dCas9 constructs we again included an electrophoretic migration shift assay as last year. As the dCas9 constructs were designed to not have nuclease activity, while retaining the ability to bind to the gRNA and target DNA, we set up variations of the in vitro CRISPR assay to track the progression of the target DNA, gRNA, cleavage products, and protein migration on a DNA retardation gel (6% acrylamide in TBE, ThermoFisher Scientific).
The four purified samples were subjected to three treatments (Figure 2, 3):
Pre-incubated: gRNA + enzymes (incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes in all samples)
Incubated: gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C)
Deactivated: gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C) and a deactivation step of 20 minutes"

ATTRIBUTIONS
Our iGEM journey started at the end of 2015 when EPFL students were invited to join in the 2016 iGEM team. After the selection, we started brainstorming in February 2016 where after a few months of literature research we came up with this project of combining CRISPR-dCas9 and the Cello software. Between the beginning of June and July, we designed and ordered all the parts we needed. And then finally, in July, we were able to start our exciting work in the lab! And we have been working hard ever since then to present our end results to all the other teams and jury members end of October in Boston, MA.
Our project is partially based on the project of the 2015 EPFL iGEM team. The general design of the gates comes from their BioLogic project.

This being my first year in iGEM, I am really enjoying the learning curve and the new experiences. I cannot wait for more workshops and conferences to meet new people. When I've finally got some time off I enjoy getting outside, away from distractions, with great views and good friends. Or playing with my stereo (and you thought vinyl was dead.)
Mackenzie Coatham
Hi iGEMers! My name is Mackenzie and I’m a fourth year biochemistry major who is competing in iGEM for a THIRD time!  I’ve been involved in scientific research since high school and still love every minute of studying proteins in translation or exploring what synthetic biology has to offer.  When I’m not in a lab coat holding a pipette, I can often be found dancing or watching my fair share of So You Think You Can Dance!
Lisza Bruder
Hello!!  My name is Lisza and I have just completed my BSc in biochemistry and this will be my third year involved with iGEM.  I love being involved with research and academia which means that iGEM is perfect for me.  iGEM gives me another area of research to explore that is outside of my usual field of biochemistry.  One of the best things about iGEM is being able to help other students learn and watch them grow over the season.
Harland Brandon
I am a fourth year Biochemistry student and second year iGEM team member at the University of Lethbridge. Currently I am enjoying doing research not just with iGEM but in a research lab as well. I enjoy most things from science, to writing, to enjoying a good beer upon occasion. This year I am really looking forward to contributing to the synthetic biology community and our iGEM team. Aside from this rather bland biography of myself here is another version which should be able to put a smile on your face cortesy of my wildly wacky imagination:
It has long since been thought that the Harland was only a beast of myth, one which was said to a close relative to the tooth fairy but instead steals left over food from fridges and unguarded chip bowls. He is a beast with short blond hair and a height nearing that of a small llama. If provoked he will be easily startled and will release his bowels in order to disgust a potential threat.

iGEM CALGARY ON NUTV'S FULL FRONTAL - JULY 4, 2009
NUTV (New University Television) is a non-profit organization that seeks to provide University of Calgary students with the means to participate in television production. NUTV programs are aired on campus and in Calgary. This year, iGEM Calgary has had the opportunity to appear on NUTV as a part of our 2009 media campaign.  We were part of its monthly show called Full Frontal, a magazine-styled segment showcasing news, art, and human interest stories. The iGEM Calgary segment was aired on July 4th. 2009. This story was covered by the NUTV news Reporter Julie Phillips and edited by the NUTV programme director Justin Hardjowirogo. The news coverage explored the different areas of our 2009 iGEM Team: namely Wetlab, Mathematical Modeling, Second Life (TM) and Ethics.
We also introduced the iGEM competition, synthetic biology, and our quorum sensing project.  Watch the video here, with interviews from Thane Alexander Kubik (iGEM Calgary Team Co-Leader), Carol Chan (Engineering Student) and Patrick King (Second Life Team Leader).

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge#RNAi_-_-_TEXT.html," only requisite knowledge of the genome. New dsRNA-based pesticides will be employed cheaply and specifically without costly design and massive amounts of resources currently utilized in the development of novel pesticides. Pesticides represent a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide, and with the scalability of this synthetic biology mode of production, this project represents a readily commercializable method of producing large quantities of highly specific pesticides applicable to a wide array of pest species.
For large scale production, our group will likely use fermenters for sufficient growth. However, as demonstrated, the concentrations of dsRNA required for gene silencing are sufficiently low that the large-scale production need not necessitate massive amounts of resources.
Human Practices
As a part of the design of our project, we looked over the ethical implications of our study. We looked into a variety of different farming methods and uses of pesticides. We examined off-target and non-target effects by ensuring the target sequences we selected were compared against the entire database of sequenced genomes using the NCBI BLAST program. We also spoke with various experts and held a panel discussion regarding the efficacy of our project from the lab to the field.
We also contacted major small molecule pesticide distributors to estimate the current cost analysis. Finally, we collaborated with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada to further explore the ethical implications of our project.
Risks
RNAi: Off-Target and Non-Target Effects
The RNAi is used more extensively in pesticides due to its target specificity. However, it does not come without the possibility of negative effects or errors in what RNAi sequences are targeted. Ideally, the RNAi manufactured should only target the specific sequence that causes virulence in Fusarium graminearum which would be an on-target effect. Due to sequence similarities across species and within the genome of the target pest, there could be unwanted effects. Two types of these effects are off-target and non-target.
Off-target effects are when the processed RNAi silences a part of the genome that is downstream or upstream of the target sequence, or only part of the target sequence. RNAi technologies have been found to have a lack of sequence specificity [1]. Therefore, a virulence factor may not be targeted, allowing F. graminearum to continue infecting crops. A 100% sequence match is often required for the RNAi to work [2], any slight sequence change or mutation could render the RNAi sequence unable to disrupt the target sequence. Therefore, important to know what the exact sequences are that will cause death in the organism when down-regulated. Just because a 100% match is required for the RNAi"

The target organism is accounted for when collecting the necessary genetic code - as it may have already have the metabolic capability coded into its genome. Additionally, BioMORTAR will consider the existing biological library, the BioBrick registry, which is submitted to and verified by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. BioMORTAR plasmid designer then finds an enzyme coding BioBrick sequence in the registry and uses it in the plasmid as appropriate. BioMORTAR also provides an easy-to-use interface for selecting the regulatory BioBrick parts for highly tuned pathway expression, including a given plasmid backbone, promoter sequence, ribosome binding site , and terminator sequence. Such controls allow for the novel pathway to be constitutive or regulated, the backbone plasmid to be multiplicative in the host (high copy number), or for complex self-regulation of the novel pathway (feedback inhibition).
Reads the enzymes from the generated metabolic pathway
Searches the databases for the genes for the required enzymes
Attaches specified promoters, ribosome binding sites, and terminators
Organizes all of the genetic code and creates a plasmid in silico
References relevant genes on various databases, allowing the user to easily create the plasmid in the lab
COBRA cell Modeling
The final part of BioMORTAR is the in silco prediction of cellular behavior and growth with the incorporation of the plasmid into a selection of organisms, more specifically Escherichia coli iJR904, iAF12 and the textbook strains; Helicobacter pylori iIT341; Methanosarcina barkeri iAF692; Mycobacterium tuberculosis iNJ661; Staphylococcus aureus iSB619; Saccharomyces cerevisiae iND750. The genome-scale metabolic reactions and pathway reconstruction models have been provided by the Biochemical, Genetic and Genomic knowledge base of large scale metabolic reconstructions, or BiGG (Schellenberger, 2010) in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format. To assemble predicted growth and cellular behavior, the model is loaded into the Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Toolbox (COBRA) using the Matlab software (Becker, 2007). This program is able to construct reaction fluxes of a biochemical reaction based on user-defined bounds for fluxes through reactions within the metabolic network. The COBRA program uses dynamic flux-balance analysis (FBA) to predict the maximum growth rates"

- KP Today we started out by getting photographed. We also watched the phage group’s presentations. It seems as if they have a good start to their project. We didn’t have too much time to do our own experiments, but we did set up an overnight to do mini-prep tomorrow, and we streaked out our plates of lambda phage. - KK The three phage groups presented today. I realized how very quickly each of our groups has specialized to the point that I have to concentrate deeply to understand what seems to be second nature to members of the phage group. That’s good! It means each of our groups is moving along nicely. The objective of the phage project is to make a library of sizes - the biggest and smallest phage capsids possible using phages that have already been well characterized and approved for medicinal purposes. One group is working on selecting for the largest phage possible, one for the smallest, and another group is developing a method to purify both phages as they are made. Afterwards, we laid out singles of our three E.Coli strains with Lambda prophage incorporated into its genome. Tomorrow Kelton and I are going to go in and check on them after our Intro to Medicine class.

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," while holding the rope, which they were not allowed to let go of. Almost every team managed to make a perfect square in time.
After the task, we evaluated the problems and findings, which arose during the task. The main conclusion was that structure and good communication is very important, regulated by a leader who guides the whole group by making sure everyone understands the task, evaluates if the task has been performed correctly and channels all the input of the group. This conclusion is also applicable in their own iGEM teams.
Tar-Transformation
Figure 1. Colony PCR of 6 Tar expressing colonies.
Since the Tar receptor plays a central role in our project, we opted to use the biobricks BBa_K777000 and BBa_K777001 . After isolation from the distribution kit and subsequent transformation of these parts to E. coli DH5-alpha we performed a colony PCR on several clones using the VF and VR primers, to confirm the presence of the Tar construct in our bacteria. The results of this screening showed the presence of a DNA fragment of 1200 bp, even though the expected fragment size should be 1762 bp (Figure 1). Sequencing results showed the presence of a GFP coding sequence downstream of an undefined region that presumably contains a promoter sequence. These results were confirmed by examining the plates under the fluorescence binoculars.
We hypothesized that this was due to inconsistency in our DNA distribution kit, since we did not isolate any GFP expressing constructs, with the exception of constructs that were already used for the interlab study. Because these constructs were isolated on a separate occasion, we asked other iGEM teams if they could replicate these results. The Dutch teams from Eindhoven and Groningen decided to help us by testing theses parts from their kit and sharing their results with us. From these results it became clear that the parts BBa_K777000 and BBa_K777001 from their kits showed no fluorescence at all (Figure 2 and 3).
Since we really needed these parts to complete the methylation part of our project, team Groningen decided to send their parts to us. The effort that both teams put into helping us is a perfect example of the iGEM spirit. We would like to thank both teams for their time and effort!

If now it is possible to store images in DNA, in the near future we    might be able to store complete movies on DNA
DNA sequence drops to $0.0002 per Megabase
Fourth fictional scenario
CryptoGErM is designed primordially for information that requires to    be stored for a longer period of time and whose accessibility is not    required immediately. However, we are pretty sure that    this would change in the upcoming years due to the fact that DNA    sequencing is becoming faster and cheaper every year. The inclusion of    new and modern techniques, like massively parallel DNA sequencing, [8] have resulted in the    decrease of the price and time needed for the DNA sequencing    parallely to the increasing of the number of megabases that can be    read.
Since 2008, [9] it has    been predicted that DNA sequencing techniques would evolve till the    point that we will be able to obtain the DNA sequence in just a few    hours or minutes, even though many technical challenges have to be    overcome first.
The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), a division of    the National Institutes of Health (NIH), established to take part on    behalf of the NIH within the International Human Genome Project (HGP),    has been tracked the costs associated with the DNA sequencing (These    tack is done within the Centers founded by the National Institute). This    data can be consulted freely on the webpage of the NHGRI, in the    section “DNA Sequencing Costs: Data. [10] The following graph contains the data of    the costs of DNA Sequencing up to October 2015.
Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence
The graph above shows how the cost for the sequencing of DNA has    plummeted since the beginning of the 21st century; this is mainly given by    the introduction of high-throughput techniques.    By October 2015, according to the data provided by    the National Human Genome Research Institute, the cost for    Megabase base of DNA sequencing was $0.0145. By this year    2016, the cost of the DNA sequencing is expecting to be further    reduced. However, until now, not official data has been released.
According to Moore’s Law, that states that the number of    transistors in a dense integrated circuit and its computational power    doubles"

Background
• Two Mycobacterium genes of interest, designated EtnR1 and EtnR2, are suspected to control a two-component regulatory system for ethylene detection and metabolism in the native NBB4 strain
Aims:
• Test recombinant expression of EtnR1 and EtnR2 in E. coli.
• Characterise the interactions between ethylene, EtnR1, EtnR2 and EtnP.
Suspected Circuitry
• EtnR2 is thought to bind to ethylene, leading to phosphorylation of the putative transcription factor EtnR1.
• Binding of EtnR1 to a putative ethylene promoter (EtnP) then activates transcription of the genes responsible for ethylene metabolism.
Results
• Confirmed expression of EtnR1 and EtnR2 in E. coli.
• Characterised EtnR1 as a DNA-binding protein by confirming binding to EtnP.
BioBricks
We submitted three new BioBricks to the iGEM parts registry:
• BBa_K1996000 – EtnP sequence from Mycobacterium NBB4
• BBa_K1996001 – codon optimised EtnR1 sequence
• BBa_K1996002 – codon optimised EtnR2 sequence
Background
The first ethylene-oxidising bacterium, Mycobacterium sp. strain E20 , was isolated in 1978 (de Bont and Harder, 1978). Subsequently, the characterisation of the enzymes involved in aerobic ethylene metabolism was aimed at utilising such strains for microbial bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes, such as vinyl chloride, as many of these are environmental pollutants (Mattes et al., 2010). However, a separate stream of research has identified another potential use for ethylene-oxidising bacteria – in regulating and monitoring fruit ripening.

In order to get a clearer picture of UDCA-contained drug’s manufacturing circumstance in China,                         our team visited Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company to interview the experts                         about current chemical producing methods. According to Mr. Xing Ruwen and Mr. Li Jinlong, the                         most popular method of producing UDCA-contained medicine in the market mainly focuses on                         chemical pharmaceutical procedures. Yet this approach has disadvantages including relatively                         weak efficacy and potential harm to health of the workers. He praises our aim to produce UDCA                         medic in biopharmaceutical procedure and consider it very promising. Furthermore, he encouraged                         us to cut off cost so that our method can be accepted by the market and the patients. This                         suggestion helped us to clarify our future goal.
Mr. Xing Ruwen
Mr. Xing Ruwen is the chief engineer in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company. He is                         an experienced manager who has been working on Chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drugs                         for years.
Mr. Xing introduces us the traditional chemical procedure to manufacture the UDCA-contained drug.                         Also, he leads us to visit the processing workshop and teaches us many valuable knowledge about                         drug production.
According to his opinion, chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drug basically has two                         disadvantages: the first one is its high risk; the second one is related to profit, a factor                         that influences manufacturing the most. For its potential high risk, Mr. Xing conveys that it                         comes from the utilization of metal sodium. Sodium is well-known for its highly-reactiveness; it                         is able react violently with water, which at the same time release large amount of heat and                         might cause potential safety issue to the workers. He praises our thought of avoiding the                         dangerousness and very much acknowledges our method.
Mr. Li Jinlong
Mr. Li Jinlong works as the production manager and he also participating in marketing                         department’s work in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company.
Mr. Li patiently answers our questions related to marketing. Analyzing its cost, demand and also                         profit, Mr. Li helps us to determined our minds on trying to solve the problem step by step. He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification"

2. Function:
Facts from official website:
iGEM software developers should work closely with experimental synthetic biologists and iGEM teams to build tools that are genuinely useful to the synthetic biology and iGEM communities. Software tools could directly help synthetic biologists in the lab, at their desktops, or even in how they communicate with each other and access information. You may wish to build a tool that:
Improves design, assembly and testing of biological circuits
Makes bioengineering more predictive
Helps biologists discover parts and exchange information about them
Improves parts registry navigation
Helps the iGEM communities communicate with one another / identify problems
Serve as a better biobrick database API
Parses information from one form to another

Laccase CotA from Bacillus pumilus DSM 27 ( ATCC7061)
Summary
First some trials of shaking flask cultivations were made with different parameters to define the best conditions for production of the His tagged CotA from Bacillus pumilus DSM 27 ( ATCC7061) named BPUL. Due to inactivity of the enzyme in the cell lysate a purification method was established (using Ni-NTA-Histag resin and Syringe or ÄKTA method). The purified BPUL could be detected by SDS-PAGE (molecular weight of 58.6 kDa) as well as by MALDI-TOF. To improve the purification strategies the length of the linear elution gradient was increased up to 200 mL . The fractionated samples were also tested concerning their activity and revealed high activity. Optimal conditions for activity were identified. After measuring activity of BPUL a successful scale up was made up to 3 L and also up to 6 L that enables an intense screening afterwards. A further scale up to 12 L with a optimized medium (HSG) was implemented to enable additional experiments to characterize BPUL. With this a total specific enzyme activity of ~40 U mg-1 was determined for BPUL at pH 5 at 25°C with ABTS as a substrate. Additional scale up experiments will be important for further real world applications.
