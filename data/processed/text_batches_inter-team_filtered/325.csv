Part Improvement
Our Improved Part: Extracellular phosphate sensor with GFP reporter ✔Fully Functional
Preliminary modelling results revealed that the strength of the phosphate promoter is one of the highly sensitive parameter in the design. As the original phosphate construct BBa_K116404 (constructed by NYMU Taipei in 2008) is weak, we decided to improve the part by increasing the expression level and range to facilitate our building of the kill switch.
Hence, our team has decided to improve upon the original phosphate sensor-GFP reporter, by replacing the weaker RBS BBa_B0032 of the original part with the stronger RBS BBa_B0034, to augment the GFP expression. We have successfully constructed our version of the phosphate-sensor with GFP reporter BBa_K2447000 and had successfully improved upon the original part in terms of yielding greater GFP expression. Our part shows, on average, 40 fold increase in GFP expression (Figure 3) when compared to the previous version of the construct. The original phosphate construct is also insensitive to high phosphate concentrations above 50 µM where similar levels of GFP expression are observed (Figure 4). Unlike the previous construct, our improved phosphate construct is much more sensitive to various phosphate concentrations from 0 to 1000 µM, particularly at phosphate concentrations above 50 µM (Figure 3).
Characterisation Protocol:
Transformed with  E. coli MG 1655 cells were incubated in LB broth with kanamycin (50 ng/µL) at 37 °C for 24 hours before being diluted 100x and then incubated for another 2-3 hours to reach OD600 of 0.1. Cells were washed in MOPS medium (0.2% glucose) and subsequently re-suspended in MOPS (0.2% glucose). Next, cells were loaded into 96 well plate preloaded with various concentrations of phosphate concentrations. 10 mins interval reading of OD600 and GFP absorbance was conducted over a continuous 8 hours run of the microplate reader at 37 °C.

Having decided to make a bioclock which would display time, we started searching for different ways of achieving this goal. We needed a display unit, a counter and another part to measure time. We had below ideas for the different parts.
Display unit:
1)Make use of an array of LEC (Light Emitting Cells) constructed by last years Valencia iGEM team to display the hour numerically.
2)Display different colours for the different hours by using the different colour biobricks from last years Cambridge iGEM team.
After discussion we decided to use the second method to display the time. Later we decided to use fluorescent proteins rather than the colour proteins as the Cambridge biobricks was not a part of the 2010 distribution. However, the fluorescent proteins could very easily be replaced by the colour biobricks.The idea to degrade the reporter (either fluorescence or colour) was to use a protein degradation tag. Hence, over time the reporter would get degraded having displayed the time.
Counter and Measuring time:
1)Using one of the oscillators that had been made earlier in combination with a counter.
2)Novel idea to use the rate of diffusion to measure and count time at the same time by using the spatial placement of the colonies to count the hour.Although this idea was a combination of biology and physical diffusion, we decided to go ahead with this approach due to various considerations.Few of them are given below:
- The idea of being able to have such a complex system on a single agar plate was something new and exciting.
- Being able to use micro-fluid chambers for combining the units was a possibility
After discussion we decided to use the second method to count and measure time.In retrospect this seems a interesting choice as many teams and research groups have"

That’s because the toxin addicted time was too short that only part of bacteria expressed cbtA. While expression of cbeA made most bacteria appeared in bacilliform in 6h observation. Because the experiment time was limited, we didn’t get the distinct result. We think that more solid result will appear if we extend the observation duration.
3.TJU-China
As for collaboration with TJU-China, we provided them some vital materials, and they helped us finish the indigo synthesis experiment.
This year, TJU-China utilized a novel infrared fluorescent system to track intestinal bacteria in real time. To verify their system can work in many different kinds of cells. We sent the Bifidobacterium longum and plasmid to them. Here is the link to their wiki
TJU-China also helped us a lot. When we used monooxygenase TfdB-JLU to degrade 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase. We found that there is some blue matters when culturing bacteria. So we read a lot of literatures and datum on the internet, finding the TfdB-JLU can catalyze benzprole or tryptophan to synthesize indigo. So TJU-China helped us to verify whether our guess was right. They cultured our bacteria in LB fluid medium. When its OD600 values reached 0.4, they divided the culture into seven test-tubes. Next, they added 0.2mM IPTG in each test-tube. Then, they added different concentrations of Trp solution as follows, and cultured for 16 hours and the results are as follows.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."
Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," quorum sensing could be developed, resulting in a highly sophisticated tool for bacterial communication.  In order to achieve this, one would need to alter the primary structure of rxRFP to effect a shift in the emission spectra.  Although this would be difficult and somewhat unpredictable, there is precedent for altering the emission spectra [4].
More generally, this platform is a mechanism by which transcription can be regulated with high precision by virtue of a two-step input. One application of this platform that we envision is a novel therapy for cancer. Tumors often contain a heterogenous group of cells that experience different redox states that is at least partially a function of the cell’s malignancy. This platform will allow for precise, dose-dependent responses based on the redox states of individual cells.
We also envision the use of this platform in industrial bioreactor designs, where oxidative stress can severely hinder reaction efficiencies. A redox-sensitive fluorescent output will be able to report specific regions within the bioreactors that experience abnormally high levels of stress with high temporal and spatial resolution.
This platform is a novel approach to many challenging problems that we face in medicine, agriculture, industry, environment, and research. Although it is still in early stages of development, refinement and optimization of this platform has significant implications.

ETHZ_Basel,2010,Team:ETHZ Basel#Modeling#Movement_-_-_TEXT.html," 0.14±0.19s and a run length of 0.86±1.18s (each value given as mean and standard deviation).
In a changing extracellular environment (e.g. increasing concentration of Aspartate), mainly the distribution of the run length adjusts, whereas the distribution of the tumbling length only slightly changes.
The average speed of an E. coli during directed movement is approximately 14.2±3.4μm/s, whereas during tumbling the average speed is significantly smaller.
In a constant extracellular environment, the absolute angle change between two directed movement phases is Weibull distributed, with a non-zero maximum and a mean and standard deviation of 68±36°, whereas the absolute angle change during one directed movement period has its maximum around  0°, with mean and standard deviation 23±23°.
Assumptions
Mean Times
In accordance with the experimental data given in [1] , the mean tumbling length was assumed to be independent of the extracellular conditions, unlike the mean run length, which is known to fluctuate for wild type cells under different extracellular environments. Besides the experimental evidence in [1] , this assumption also has a biological interpretation: tumbling is believed to occur because the flagella push each other away and disassemble after rotating counter-clock wise (directed movement). The time spent in tumbling is a stochastic variable mainly representing the time the flagella need to reassemble afterwards, and a single process of reassembling is only weakly correlated with the frequency of tumbling.
Velocity
During the directed movement phase, the speed of an E. coli cell varies only slightly around its mean value, whereas during the tumbling phase, the speed is significantly smaller and can be neglected (see [1] ).
Therefore, we assumed in our model that the velocity during directed movements is constant and zero during tumbling.
Direction Changes
During one directed movement phase, the angular speed is Gaussian distributed, with zero mean and a tuned standard distribution, such that, when integrated over the mean run length, we obtain the properties stated above and in [1] .
Reproducing the distribution for the angular change between two directed movement phases was much more challenging.  Choosing the angular speed independently at every integration step, as we did for the directed movement case, would lead to a distribution which reaches its maximum at zero, which would be in discrepancy with the empirical data in [1] . Therefore, we decided to assume a constant angular speed for the entire period between two directed movement phases. The angular speed was drawn from a tuned distribution"

What’s the connection between porcelain and STEP? We came to a workshop and made a STEP plate with our own hands. As a traditional Chinese art, it contains philosophy from our ancestor. Round and smooth, the porcelain plate serves people as a container, while it would easily hurt us when broken into pieces. Just like our system, it’s never easy to create one and make it serve the public for the right purpose.
Ethical, Social and Political Considerations
When developing a therapeutic project for cancer, it’s not only the technical issues that need to concern about, but also ethical and political issues. Though China have earned a large number of research achievements in the field of cellular immunotherapy, till now, none has been approved or applied in clinical treatment.  The question stays on in our mind- why there is a lack of ethical and political considerations in China, regarding this new therapy? What can we do to make a change? For this purpose, we stepped out of the lab, contacting professionals in the field of ethic and policy, to find out the answer. Also, Dr. Xu, an oncologist of Fudan Univ. Cancer Hospital, explained the approving process of current clinical trial of cellular immunotherapy to us. What’s more, we received a phone call from National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, after contacting them by e-mail, which explains the regulations we concerned about.   In our meeting with Dr. Jie Yin(link), an expert in medical ethic, she admitted that the main issue concerned with our project is safety, considering its high cost and risk. Thus the government will give top priority to its approval. For the particularity of cancer patients who are at the end of their life, cellular immunotherapy served as a last resort. Patients flooded into it, striving for a chance to survive. We were reminded that there are certain clinical indications that need to be satisfied before a clinical trial, which made us reflect on a fairer distribution of medical resources.   In China, collective consciousness always plays the leading role on the historical and social stage, covering the light of Spirituality Concern on the value of individual life. Compared with the unprecedented hot market, the lack of ethical consciousness should receive more attention. We called for the existence of humanity in this “technology & market first” society, truly benefiting every single patient.
Just in early October, we received an official phone call from National Health Commission , answering our concerns in the e-mail. Its official firmly declared"

250 microlitres of Solution III was added to each of the 10 tubes and the resulting solution centrifuged for 20 minutes. The resulting solution could be seen as a cloudy white precipitate of chromosomal DNA and protein. Instead of removing the supernatant and disposing of it, once the spinning had stopped we extracted 1ml of supernatant and placed them into 10 new Eppendorf Tubes (labelled '1S', '2S', '3S',...etc). The tubes containing the pellets were then discarded.
To the 10 tubes containing supernatant, 600 microlitres of prepared isopropanol was added. These tubes were then placed in the centrifuge for a further 15 mins.
The resulting supernatants for the 10 tubes were then removed and any droplets of solution were carefully removed by a vacuum pump (without disrupting the DNA which had gathered on one side of the Eppendorf tubes). To this, 500 microlitres of ethanol (at 70%) was added.
Making 70% ethanol:
35 ml of ethanol added to beaker
15 ml of water added to beaker
The resulting solution was then spun in the centrifuge for 5 minutes.
The supernatant was removed and the remaining droplets of solution removed without disrupting the transparent pellet the plasmids had formed. Once the plasmid pellet was dried of all the solution, it was resuspended in 50 microlitres of water. The tubes were then lightly centrifuged (for a few seconds) to make sure all of the water, along with the DNA, had congregated at the bottom of the tubes.
Conclusion
We are now ready to carry out DNA electrophoresis on the 10 samples, which will happen tomorrow.

UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#about_-_-_TEXT.html," Times Higher Education World University Rankings, The University of Maryland is the state's flagship and land-grant public institution with 37,500 students, 9,000 faculty and staff, and a $1.9B annual operating budget, including $500M in external research funding.
The University of Maryland chapter of iGEM, UMaryland iGEM, was founded in 2014. It showed great promise by winning a gold medal at its inaugural international convention, a great feat for a rookie team. Riding on this momentum, UMaryland iGEM has since doubled in membership and has taken on multiple research projects: creating an antibiotic-free plasmid retention system, designing a PCR machine that costs less than $50 to build, and educating the community about synthetic biology.

MSc. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 3rd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
I gained so much experience participating on The Biobuilders team 2016 that I, post-Jamboree 2016, then and there on the Hynes Convention Center Hall floor, decided that I wanted more of the iGEM experience. I did so, by seeking participation on this year’s team - It was simply too gratifying for me to pass.   I thoroughly enjoy the learn-as-you-go approach to things - It seems more intuitive to me. In addition to that I appreciate all the things I am subject to learning, that I did not expect to learn. I sincerely believe that this kind of work contributes to my development into a resilient, patient and diligent being.
What did you work on during the project?
I coordinated and organized various ad hoc tasks for our team and -for our annual biobrick tutorial. I was main contact for communicating our project to the outside world in addition to being involved in the administrative-, the outreach- and the human practice part of our project.

What is Wheat Stem Rust Fungus?
Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) is a rust fungus that occurs globally in all locations where wheat is grown but is most prevalent in areas with warmer and moist climates. When Pgt infects a plant, conducting tissue within the stem is severely damaged, resulting in lower nutrient absorption and less nutritious grains. In extreme cases, the crops can even be unviable.
The fungus progresses through many different structures during infection. The most characteristic structures are the reddish-colored urediniospores that form infectious structures on the wheat plants and are spread by wind. They form on the stoma of the black teliospores that form towards the end of the growing cycle and enable the fungus to survive during the winter season. Aecia are reproductive structures that form on barberry and release aeciospores that are windborne and infect wheat. Due to this, one common precaution taken by farmers is the removal of barberry near their crops.
In order to infect crops, Pgt spores contain avirulence factors that are released into the plant cells. Differences in types of avirulence factors distinguish different races of Pgt, and each race often has multiple types of avirulence factors. Resistance
proteins in plants recognize the effectors secreted by Pgt and trigger an hypersensitive immune response in the plant, causing localized cell death and preventing the"

The p15a and pMB1 have a green fluorescent phenotype and the pAMB1 is paired with E2-crimson reporter, which appears black in normal light and red under UV light. The results show that E.coli only grew with active reporter genes on the KAN and CAM plates, but did not grow on the CRB and TET plates. The second mixture contained only 3 plasmids, pAMB1+KAN, pMB1+KAN, and p15A+KAN, and was plated on a single KAN plate. We believe we did not see growth for CRB and TET because the DNA concentration might have been too low or the incubation time was too short.
Figure 2: Collaboration with Rice University — One-Tube Reactions. The plates above represent Rice’s attempts to utilize the one-tube reactions. The plates exhibit multiple morphologies, demonstrating that multiple assemblies have been successfully introduced into cells. As in Figure 1, E. coli was plated onto LB plates with varying antibiotics.
Rice University performed the same initial tests independently. One tube had 8 different assemblies (pAMB1+AMP, pMB1+AMP, p15A+CAM, pAMB1+CAM, pAMB1+KAN, pMB1+KAN, P15a+KAN, p15A+TET). This reaction was plated on 4 different plates, each with a different antibiotic. This way, only the E. coli that had picked up each specific assembly would grow on the respective plate. Figure 2 shows that E. coli only grew with active reporter genes on the KAN and CAM, as well as CRB. Their CRB plate was left to grow longer than ours, which might be why they saw positive results. TET was not plated because Rice University did not have the antibiotic available. The second tube contained only 3 reactions, which were pAMB1+KAN, pMB1+KAN, and p15A+KAN; this was plated on a single KAN plate.

Here we enlist the requirements we met to deserve the Silver Medal.
1. Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
We were able to validate the correct assembly of Biobricks BBa_K1903006, BBa_K1903008, BBa_K1903010 and BBa_K1903012 by analyzing PCR products on agarose gels and DNA sequencing. Thus, we corroborated the expression of each of the proteins by protein extraction and SDS-Page analysis. Lastly, we corroborated the correct performance of the Plac promoter by inducing some of these BioBricks and analyzing the before and after induction protein profiles.
For this section, we worked with the following BioBricks:
BBa_K1903006
BBa_K1903008
BBa_K1903010
BBa_K1903011
BBa_K1903013
BBa_K1903014
2. Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way.
As Latin Americans we established a great relationship with the other teams of the region. We had the opportunity to share protocols and advice with TECCEM iGEM team and mutually support other latin friends.

The overall design of our team's project is interwoven across several different sections in our wiki. The Experiment page clearly outlines the steps and design processes that our team went through before and during our research. Most notably, we structured our research around a space mission with the end goal of producing a Martian habitat out of mycelium. The actual Mission Architecture addresses several design problems; how will the mycelium grow on Mars? How will the mycelium grow into a specific shape? What shape will this habitat actually be? How will humans on Mars be able to produce more materials when needed? All these vital questions are explored and evaluated in our Mission Architecture page. These considerations and research have been reflected in our approach in the lab and research.
Please read more about our Mission Architecture, and hence the overall design of our project, linked here.

To overcome this problem, the 2010 UW iGEM team developed new prefix and suffix regions that are based on BglBrick (BBF RFC 21 ) standard and designed to eliminate self-complementarity from the prefix and suffix of the plasmid. These vectors dramatically increase the Gibson assembly efficiency of large-scale gene assemblies and are also compatible with iGEM standard BioBrick parts.
What did we do this year?
Seeing that this is a very efficient method to do cloning, we continued to make improvements to the methods and created a Gibson Assembly Toolkit!
Creation of 5 plasmid vectors
Our new vectors for Gibson assembly follow the naming convention of pGA. To make our pGA vectors, we first amplified the backbones and the pLac GFP insert respectively. Then we performed a Gibson reaction to combine them together to make the pGA vectors.
All togeher, we created 5 pGA vectors and submitted them to the registry:
2 High copy extraction/cloning vectors
pGA1A3, pGA1C3
1 medium copy expression vector
pGA3K3
2 low copy expression vectors
pGA4A5, pGA4C5
As listed above, each of our vectors have varying copy numbers, antibiotic resistances, and purposes within the magnetosome gene assembly. However, they all appear to be very efficient will multiple gene inserts.
For experimental details comparing the efficiencies of pSB1A3 and pGA1A3, see our assay results . In addition to the characterization of assembly efficiency, we used the pGA vectors for the Magnetosome Toolkit project. First, we efficiently extracted and BioBricked all the 18 mamAB magnetosome genes. We also made super-assemblies from these BioBricks to make 10 kilobase plasmids (see mamHIEJKL and mamQRBSTUV ) from 2 kilobase pieces by assembling up to five fragments all in one cloning step!

Help New Students
    We spent 3 days, 17th October to 19th Ocober, to help our school to receive new students. Thus we had to pause our project for a while.
    
    There are 3 railway stations in Shenzhen. They are Shenzhen west station, Shenzhen north station and Shenzhen station. Most new students get off the train at Shenzhen station. Since our school locates far from those 3 stations. We decided to send school bus to the station to pick up the freshmen. The earliest train arrived at 5:00am. So we had to get up at 4:00am and then spent one hour to the station. It was really exhausting those days.
    
    Though tired, we were still very happy.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#HEARTBEAT database_-_-_TEXT.html," a relative frequency of 60%. In case of VDR, AP-2 co-exists in 48% and WT1 in 54% of all VDR-promoters. In the following we proceeded in analogy to series one. We created a variety of sequences where we included TFBS in proximity to the pdf-maximum of their frequency distribution besides the VDR and SREBP binding sites. Depending on the number of species of TFBS we distinguish between a blue (1 TFs), green (2 TFs) and orange (3 different TFs) series. Finally all spacer sequences were filled with a random sequence with A:T and C:G content ratios being equal. To make sure that our sequences are as specific as possible we iteratively checked and modified our sequence with the Transfac match tool [21] until no other TFBS expect for our chosen ones were detected. Additionally we tested the sequence for every restriction site used in any Biobrick standard. Finally we added a HindIII at the 5' end and a SpeI restriction site at the 3' end to allow for cloning the construct into the reporter plasmid.

HEARTBEAT analyzes transcription factor binding preferences
For the statistical analysis we plotted the absolute frequency of occurrence for each TF-binding site in a histogram against the position relative to the TSS where the TSS is located at base 1001 -1003. Each bin comprises 20 bases analogous to different low resolution approaches which analysed the spatial distribution of TFBS with a sliding window of 20-25 bp [22] , [3] , [23] . From 356 different TFBS for which Transfac contains at least one binding matrix 144 TFBS occurred at least within 50 from 4390 natural promoters. TFBS with less than 50 counts were removed from the selection and not considered for further analysis. In Fig. 7-10 the spatial distributions of Sp1 , AP-2 , IPF1 (Insulin promoter factor 1) and Kid3 binding sites are shown. The red solid line represents the re-scaled probability density function (pdf). We introduced this function for two reasons. On the one hand the pdf is more robust with respect to outliers than a normal histogram. On the other hand we used the rescaled area under the curve between a shifting frame of 20 bases as a measurement for the significance of a particular TFBS occurrence. The vertical red line in each plot defines the maximum of the pdf. Around the respective base position the majority of binding motives are located within the natural promoters. The maximum"

Abstract
We further developed ""Dr. E. coli"": our project of iGEM 2010. Last year, we showed that Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) works in E. coli by injecting GFP into RK13 cells. T3SS is a syringe like organelle found in bacterium such as Salmonella which uses it to inject virulence effector proteins into a target eukaryotic cell. We think this system can be applied to direct reprogramming of somatic cells among many other things.
We tested T3SS performance and tried to make it more convenient. For this purpose we designed a plasmid backbone which can instantly produce ready-to-inject fusion proteins from ordinary biobrick part. Using it, we tried to further characterize this system by injecting a library of protein domains.
In Science Gallery we exhibited awesome photographs related with biotechnology in public. We tried to catch the pedestrians’ interest in current synthetic biology and explore their thoughts.

OVERVIEW
Modeling is significant for supporting and improving the meaning of our project. Generally                     speaking, we hope to use mathematics methods to verify the feasibility and validity of our project.                     In this modeling, four core variables were introduced: fluorescence intensity of DFCH-DA probe,                     fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-Orp1 protein, external H2O2 concentration                     and intracellular H2O2 concentration.
roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression cassette is our core manner for detecting and measuring ROS level.                     In the further application of our device, users can calculate antioxidative ability by collecting                     roGFP2-Orp1fluoresecent intensities data. The whole modeling goes with the goal that making                     roGFP2-Orp1 realize it's proper functions.
To verify the functions of yno1/ndi1 genes and roGFP2-Orp1 fluorescent protein, DCFH-DA                     fluorescent                     probe was chosen as our output signal reference, which can detect and measure ROS concentration                     changes and present relative antioxidative strength. The process is indirect, so we set up Fluorescent                         Probe Model to normalize fluorescence intensities and H2O2 concentration, which made them comparable to each other.
To simulate the accumulation of intracellular H2O2 and set a relationship                     with external H2O2(the external H2O2 is the H2O2 we added in media), H2O2 Decomposition Model was induced.
With simulating the process that how roGFP2-Orp1 generates, reacts and degrades inside cells,                     roGFP2-Orp1 Michealis equation Model described the connection between roGFP2-Orp1 and intracellular                     H2O2.
With the three models mentioned above, we finally proved the accessibility of our roGFP2-Orp1 detecting"

ZJU-China attaches much interest in communication with other teams. It’s very necessary to know more about others and to help each other is the very tradition of Zhejiang University. This year, we helped H4Z to get started in iGEM, helped HZAU with modeling and provided BNU with two important gene circuits.
To help H4Z, we held some seminar in Zhejiang ST, in which we talked a lot about how to run an iGEM team and what should be paid attention to in an iGEM project. Also, we did our experiment in the same lab so we got even more time to help them. In the modeling part, our dry lab helped them write their wiki in a technical way.
The picture of teaching high school teams to do experiment.
BNU
To help BNU, We constructed two main circuits, first one expresses a serine integrase. This intergrase can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP (click here too see more information from BNU's wiki)  , the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome. This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two"

Lab 2
The students started off their day by continuing their research into the cinnamaldehyde concept for their portion of the project.    They then met with Chia, Vanessa, Drew, and Andrea in order to present their ideas for the project and receive the critical feedback needed in order to enhance their project and provide a direction to follow.    During the discussion and presentation, an idea was brought up by the mentors to fuse the chitinase enzymes onto the outside layer of the E. coli cells while embedding genes in order for the cell to produce the poisonous cinnamaldehyde.  This combination was agreed upon by both the mentors and the students to pursue.  The students then attended a safety meeting on base from 1-2.  They then proceeded to travel to UES and there they continues their research on the now 2 decided upon topics.

Lab 1
Dr. Breedon assisted the LabPats in designing primers and sequencing their plasmid for IDT to make. They discussed plans on trying to make their own plasmid from scratch via Gibson Assembly, as well as double checking the final product with the IDT construct. They ordered many primers and parts, like different ribosome binding sites attached to the CheZ gene.
Lab 2
The students in the RX laboratory began their day at UES researching the now solid plan of binding two forms of chitinase to the outside of the E. coli cell membrane while having the cinnamaldehyde break into and kill the fungi cells. Max researched the process of which the cinnamaldehyde kills the cells and the production levels of phenylalanine and  cinnamaldehyde plus the lethal concentrations. Peter and Travis dived into deeper research of the various forms of possible chitinase options for the use of the project.  They completed this by making a table focusing on the genome of the chitinase production, the bacteria the genome derives from, optimal growth conditions, impacts on fungi, and the size of the chitinase  The students at the end of the day traveled to RX and meet with Chia to discuss the research they had found and to narrow down the specific research to perform; i.e. the sequences of the genes

Architects Competition of Microorganism Application
We held the Sichuan University 2016 Architects Competition of Microorganism Application: Human Microbiome in May and June. The students from Sichuan Agricultural University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China were also invited. 209 students from Sichuan University and Sichuan Agricultural University attended the competition. After the first oral defense, 15 teams were chosen to attend the final.
The final was held in the largest lecture hall in Jiang’an Campus of Sichuan University. More than 10 professors attended it as the judges. After the final defense, one gold award, two silver award and four bronze award were issued (details listed below).
Holding the competition, we elevated the students’ understanding on human microbiome and iGEM competition and improved their ability of designing project. “This competition makes me learn more about human microbiome and iGEM competition. I hope it will be held after many years,” said a competitor.

Recent studies suggest that gut microbes are participants in atherosclerosis development. Specifically, choline, phosphatidylcholine—trimethylamine (TMA)-containing nutrients abundant in foods can serve as dietary precursors for TMA N-oxide (TMAO) generation, in mice and humans, a metabolite that accelerates atherosclerosis in animal models. Amount those trimethylamine (TMA)-containing nutrients choline accounts for the biggest part in human gut because it’s also the primary digestion products of phosphatidylcholine. Blood TMAO levels are associated with risks for both prevalent atherosclerotic heart disease and incident major adverse cardiac events in multiple independent cohorts. And, recently, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) has been identified as a novel"

We were surprised by the rate a positive answer to this question. Indeed, only 11% of those polled answered they would not accept to wear our device. Among health professionals, 36,5% would recommend our prosthesis to their patients, whereas 54,5% do not know and about 9% would not recommend our device. It is important to point out the fact that the same percentages are found concerning their answers to the question ""would you wear a Neuronarch prosthesis?"".
Figure 11:Percentage of people who would accept to wear NeuronArch prosthesis
Our survey was also a way to present our project to health professionals.  Even though this part was hard to fill, as it requires 2 characteristics (working in the field of health; being in contact with amputees), it was very interesting to analyze the answers of persons working in the medical fields and to read their comments. We discovered that there was a real interest in our project.  For example, we asked whether they thought our project was feasible and what they were thinking of our project. Out of 8 answers, 6 were « Yes », 1 was « Maybe » and the last was a comment on our project « Project that tries to improve a real current problem ». We also gathered some information on the percentage of implant-related infections, the ways to improve the comfort of the patients who are wearing a prosthesis and information on how implant-related infections are treated.
Figure 12: Answers about ways to treat infections
Feedback on our survey
The last part of our survey was a feedback on itself. We wanted to know if it had helped people to understand what synthetic biology is and if our explanations were sufficient.  We asked questions about whether or not our survey helped them understand what synthetic biology is, on the clarity of our explanations and the relevance of our questions. In order to better evaluate the impact of our survey, we wanted people to evaluate their knowledge of synthetic biology before and after answering our survey.
Figure 13: Feedback on synthetic biology
One of the most important aspect of this study is that, among those who did not know synthetic biology at all (14%), more than the half have a positive evaluation of their knowledge of synthetic biology. Indeed, to the question: Did our survey help you to better understand what synthetic biology is? they gave 4/5 or 5"

(B) Amplification of the kanamicine resistance cassette that replace the RybB gene after lambda red recombination. (C) Amplification of the disrupted RybB gene after removing the resistance by FRT recombinase expression.
Besides, we achieved a strain without F’ plasmid by setting up a continuous culture without F’ plasmid selection and checking if any bacteria had eventually lost that plasmid. Finally the metabolic burden made its work and strains without this plasmid arose in the culture. The plasmid lost was checked by the lost of beta-galactosidase activity (X-gal plating) and proline auxotrophy (growth in minimal medium plates) whose characteristics were codified by the F' plasmid.

In order for future characterisation of this part, the model should be modified in order to guide in vivo efforts accordingly. We also lacked the time to co-culture this part with the Sensynova platform's multiple modules in order for the creation of variants for the Evry Paris-Saclay. The part BBa_K2205023 , the Evry Paris-Saclay's psicose biosensor system as the detecting unit of the platform, has been submitted to the iGEM registry for future work and characterisation by future teams.

BioBricks used: BBa_K2205029 (New) , BBa_K2205030 (New) , BBa_K749021(TMU-Tokyo 2012 )
Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Output) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by implementing the formaldehyde biosensor as a variant to the detector module of the Sensynova platform.
Background Information
The formaldehyde biosensor, part BBa_K749021, was selected was originally made and submitted to the iGEM registry by the TMU-Tokyo 2012 team. This part was chosen as a variant to the detector module present in the Sensynova platform due to the fact that our adaptor module present in the framework, Sarcosine Oxidase, was made in order to convert glyphosate into formaldehyde, in order to overcome the limitation in the detection of glyphosate due to its little-known knowledge.
Figure 1: Part BBa_K749021
The BBa_K749021 is composed of the formaldehyde sensitive promoter BBa_K749008, the formaldehyde regulator protein frmR (BBa_K749004) coding sequence, a GFP coding sequence and a double terminator (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012).

Overview
The Tongji 2016 iGEM team has been focusing on nowadays treatments of tumor worldwide and how to improve the current photothermal therapy using synthetic biology. IGEM was a fabulous stage and we did a lot of human practices. For us, it was a beginning and we are going to do more in the future.
Public Education and Engagement
Shanghai Science and Technology Museum
On Aug 16, 2016, with 3 other iGEM teams, we made an exhibition at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum. During summer vocation, there are many kids visiting the museum with their parents. We introduced the iGEM competition by playing some both interesting and scientific videos to the people who visited the museum that day.
A grade 9 student even asked us some questions about synthetic biology. It’s a great opportunity to popularize scientific knowledge. More than 5000 people have seen our project, what’s more, we had a good communication with other teams about our projects! All 4 teams introduced their own projects, received some suggestions from others, and our friendship has been improved.
Teams include: NYU Shanghai, Tongji, SJTU, XJTLU
Course with No.2 Middle School Affiliated to Tongji
On Sep 30, 2016, 168 grade 10 students from No.2 Middle School Affiliated to Tongji University spent a day visiting the Tongji University campus.

It is expected this model can help us to understand how our system can inhibit bacterial growth and help to improve our biological device to make it more effective.
Some Equations:
Threshold – The minimum number of cells required for the target cells to become virulent and cause infection. The target cells must be below this line by the critical time in order for them to not be harmful (due to the body being prepared to fight off the bacteria).
Critical Time –The time period during which the body can fight off subcritical the infection loads.
Using this model we could calculate the effective time window of our spiRNA for a number of different infections using data specific to both the pathogen and to the gene targeted. As such, it could be used as a tool for finding the optimal gene to target, given the correct data."
Paris_Bettencourt,2011,Team:Paris Bettencourt#HumanPractice#wikiAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html," and hope matters will evolve by themselves. Just like Virginia 2011 pointed out, the presidential commission still believes that it is up to governments and public agencies to finance 'risky research' or non-profitable ones (such as tropical diseases which are virtually absent in Northern industrialized countries but where the pharmaceutical market is).
Analysis of the iGEMer's point of view
We see that we cannot trust the U.S presidential commission to address correctly the patents issue and it brings about absurdity most notably outlined by MIT 2010 . Since we already are in this sort of market-free environment and asked to think critically let's turn to the analysis and reflexion previous iGEM teams did. While some do not bring anything significant, a couple teams stand out. Freiburg Software 2010 compares the rise of synthetic biology to the change of company controlled source code into open source codes and they propose that if everything was to go in the public domain - and they should, states Tianjin 2010 , because it belongs to society - then companies could survive by offering long term services and expertise in specific domains. Otherwise, we find ourselves (the students) in a difficult choice: a potentially  exciting and new design/system but that has to be paid for or not doing it at all. Conceptually, from the iGEM's point of view the real strain is between accessibility and exclusivity.
How can we bridge the concepts of sharing and open-source with the justifiable desire to reward real innovators? Insight on how to solve this question is offered by uOttawa 2010 by achieving what they call a ""reach through licensing agreement"" whereby researchers pay little or nothing for using patented material and if a new innovation is made then the original patent holder can have a share. This idea is very interesting since it frees fundamental research from patentability issues, problem could arise when it comes to sharing. It is imaginable that legal minima could be set in order to solve future problems. They argue that it shifts the legal issues from researchers to those who actually want to make profit.
This also brings us to what seems to be a confusion, it often seems that innovators are impersonated as single researchers who deserves in the theory financial gains for their discovery whereas problems are often described in a setting where it is an already wealthy company which files patents and make a whole vending strategy around them.

DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China B#GrayValueConcentrationModel_-_-_TEXT.html," above two formulas into the relevant literature [2], where model (2) is very                         consistent. Simultaneous model (2) If the enzyme is compared to a slide, the substrate is similar to the additive. The resulting enzymatic reaction rate - substrate concentration and                         gray value - has a good fit to the added concentration. So using this model is very suitable. In                         other literature [1], the results obtained are also consistent. The relationship between gray                         value and concentration in this model is shown in Figure 1(a), which applies to multiple stages                         of the project. The different substances added are shown in Figure 2(b).
(a) Addition of added substances
(b) Relationship between different additions and gray values (joined                                 separately)
(c) Fixed antigen grayscale model curve
Fig.1 Gray value and additive concentration relationship
In the step of immobilizing the antigen, other conditions are controlled and a large amount of                         experimental data is used to reduce the error. Experimental Results After data processing,                         Figure 1 (c), Equation \(\mathrm{Y_1}\), can be obtained. The resulting image was used to                         predict                         other data and found good consistency. The established gray value - concentration model is                         consistent with the experiment. Therefore, the antibody immobilization model was further                         established and the result of the equation \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) was obtained. It can be seen from                         the                         model and experimental data that the gray value is positively correlated with the additive                         concentration when the concentration is not large. It can be seen from the model and                         experimental data that the gray value is positively correlated with the additive concentration                         when the concentration is not large and is greater than 0.4 μg/ml.
$$ y = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} x \quad \mathrm{(Ψ_q)}$$
$$ y = 6.4904 x \quad \mathrm{(Y_1)} $$
$$ y = 9.3506 x \quad \mathrm{(Z_1)} $$
When the concentration of the additive is not very large, the formula (2) can be changed to the                         formula \(\mathrm{Ψ_q}\).
Grayscale values are also available when the slide is fixed to anything. Therefore, it is                         meaningful to perform statistics on the gray value of the unfixed antigen. The \(\mathrm{Y_1}\) equation is                         the result of correcting the zero point deviation and comparing the relationship \(\mathrm{Ψ_q}\). \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) can be                         obtained"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the steady state EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml).
To calculate the total population of each stage, the trapezoid rule was used to calculate the area under the population mesh and estimate the total population.
BFU-E Cells
108 stem cells become BFU-E cells on day 0. BFU-E cells grow exponentially as they age. Their proliferation rate is not dependent on EPO. As result, the population of BFU-E cells grows at a constant exponential rate as they age.
$$ BFU{-}E_n = BFU{-}E_{n-1}\times e^{\beta_{BFU-E} \times \Delta t} \tag{23}$$
$$ BFU{-}E_{n+1} = BFU{-}E_{n}\times e^{\beta_{BFU-E} \times \Delta t} \tag{24}$$
Cells committed to become red blood cells continue to grow in this manner until they reach the age of 7 days. At this point, the BFU-E differentiate into CFU-E cells.
CFU-E Cells
CFU-E cells are strongly dependent on EPO for their survival.
$$ CFU{-}E_n = CFU{-}E_{n-1}\times e^{(\beta_{CFU{-}E}-\alpha_{CFU{-}E}(EPO(t))) \times \Delta t} \tag{25}$$
$$ CFU{-}E_{n+1} = CFU{-}E_{n}\times e^{(\beta_{CFU{-}E}-\alpha_{CFU{-}E}(EPO(t))) \times \Delta t} \tag{26}$$
The equation shows that the apoptosis rate of CFU-E cells is dependent on the concentration of EPO at a given time. As the concentration of EPO increases, the apoptosis rate of CFU-E cells decreases.
Figure 16. The effect of EPO on the apoptosis of CFU-E cells.
The logistic equation that governs the apoptosis rate of CFU-E is seen in the equation below.
$$\alpha_{CFU{-}E}(EPO(t))= \frac{(a_1 - b_1)}{1+e^{k_1 \times EPO(t) - c_1}}+b_1 \tag{27}$$
The CFU-E stage starts once cells reach the age of 7 days and continues until cells differentiate into Erythroblasts at an age of 13 days.

Finally output is modelled through the equation:
So there two design parameters in our bioreactor design model required for consideration.
D (dilution rate) and Sin (initial substrate concentration)
 
Cost Estimation
In order to achieve economically viable bioreactor we need to use a cheap easily available source of growth medium like molasses.
-Molasses cost $0.07/kg
-The density of molasses is roughly 1.4 kg/L
-Therefore, 1 L of molasses will cost $0.07 x 1.4 = $0.098
 
 
1-Dodecanol manufactured by conventional methods usually is contaminated by long carbon chain compounds, hence are associated with expensive purification costs. The low downstream processing costs of our final product 1-dodecanol obtained from bacterial degradation of SDS may help us cut down our costs, hence this could lead to development of a economically viable product.
 
 
A rough estimate of price of operation can be given by based on the substrate consumption and enzyme production rate

Part 1 Sense Fatty Acids: We investigated four different sensing mechanisms using: 1) fatty acid metabolism regulator protein (FadR), 2) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) 3) liver- fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) and 4) binding immunoglobulin protein, HSP5 or glucose regulated protein (GRP78). The four sensing mechanisms were measured and compared.
Part 2 Introduce Glyoxylate Shunt: We introduced two key enzymes of glyoxylate cycle: isocitrate lyase (ACEA) and malate synthase (ACEB), which allow plants and bacteria to use fatty acids as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Here, the amount of fatty acids was measured to compare fatty acids uptake rates of cells expressing glyoxylate shunt.
Integration of Parts: The integration of sensing mechanism and glyoxylate shunt allows inducible glyoxylate shunt, in which the high levels of free fatty acids in the medium increase fatty acid uptake rate of glyoxylate shunt.
Although the problem of malnutrition may remain unsolved, the inducible glyoxylate shunt introduced to mammalian cell increases consumption of fatty acids, lowering the risk of excessive fat accumulation that presents risk to health.

As the first modern university in China, Tianjin University has a history of 120 years. However, our School of Life Sciences is very young and fresh, which was founded in 2012. Though our college is so young, we have made many achievements owing to the great supports given by our university and the hard work of our professors and graduates.
This year is the first year when our school took part in the iGEM competition. The recruitment included all undergraduates in our university. After resume screening, audition and a tough winter vacation work which required candidates to submit a complete project design with protocols, 22 students were chosen as the members of team Tianjin 2015.
Our team consists of students majoring in life sciences, chemical/pharmaceutical/biological engineering, computer science, and even electric engineering. In particular, Yifan Zhang in computer science is from Zhejiang Sci-tech University. We are divided into four groups which are responsible for wet lab, wiki&design, modeling and human practice.
In our iGEM journey, our instructors always give us great help, and many graduates shared their experience with us. Since all of us are green hands in biological research, a small step for our project could be a gaint leap for ourselves. No matter what the result is, we have spent a happy and fulfilling time all together.
It is the second time for Ketong to take part in iGEM. And this year not many people would play jokes on him because he has become the team leader and usually shows his straight face. He doesn't like pretty loli anymore, but he still loves female.
Dongqi is another leader in our team. She is lazy in body but hardworking in mind. Larry in the book The Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is often called Boss by Junjie Yu because she could conduct biological experiments perfectly.
Yang is a junior student majoring in Biology. He would show"

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," prophylaxes which become less and less effective due to the rising inefficiency of antibiotics. A global trend that leads to the point where even the most standard surgeries, like cesarean section, become potentially lethal again.
The Lung, a prime target for opportunistic infections
The lung is a common target for various infections and diseases, which are commonly overlooked or considered harmless. That has multiple reasons: As everybody knows,the flu and catching a cold aren’t major threats and belong to the most common diseases that affect humans. The other point is, that the lung itself lacks nervous tissue and therefore infections, tumors and other alien compounds are easily detected by the patients themselves, even though it is often too late because that implies that neighboring tissue is affected as well.
Many facultative causative agents like E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa reach the lung by bacteria commonly living in the gut microbiome. Pseudomonas is one of the most common causes for hospital acquired pneumonia since it can contaminate breathing devices, survive in disinfectants and other unlikely places. All those strains can form biofilms which lead to chronic infections that potentially have a lethal outcome and are extremely hard to cure. [6], [7]
A Trojan Horse, high jacking bacterial virulence strategies
Since developing novel antibiotic compounds is a very difficult task that requires vast amounts of capital, we decided to tackle multiresistant bacteria in a more elegant way by utilizing endogenous peptides for a new angle of attack,  utilizing the conserved iron pathway that most bacteria share, that plays a huge role in virulence as iron acquisition is a crucial factor for the development of stable cultures in a host organism and thus infect it. Due to coevolution of hosts and bacteria, immune systems have adapted deprivation of harmful bacteria of any iron sources to effectively contain infections.
Therefore, harmful bacteria developed multiple pathways to acquire iron in the human body. Two of those are solely parasitic, capturing human proteins like transferrin or hemophores to internalize them and harvest the iron3+-ions to finally degrade the proteins.
The third mechanism originates from bacteria. Many virulent species carry genes for siderophore synthesis. Siderophores are relatively small peptides with a high affinity for iron3+-ions that scavenge iron from the bacterial surroundings. This mechanism is crucial for bacterial proliferation under infectious conditions, since the human immune system includes many mechanisms to deprive harmful bacteria of the needed trace element. Some siderophores include mechanisms or a sufficient affinity to extract iron3+-ions from human proteins. The utmost important factor for our project, however,"

TIMELINE
TIMELINE | Building the Neptune Flow
16 - 30 May 2016
Training and Orientation
Our project is part of an existing workflow in our lab, and during training and orientation we learned about the flow and how we fit in. We also started to test tools that we could use to build our graphical user interface and planned out what we could do with the hardware setup.
See More
June 2016
A GUI is Born
After testing out tools, we decided to implement a web application using a node.js (operating as a local server) framework. We started ordering parts and 3D printing components to set up the hardware.

July 2016
Expanding Horizons
We started building Neptune piece by piece. From what was initially a GUI designed only to interact with hardware, the idea of Neptune as a full-fledged toolchain arose.
See More
August 2016
In the Trenches
We carved out the major components that make up Neptune today. The Specify, Design, Build, Assemble, and Control pages were built with the end functional goal of each component clearly laid out. Many iterations of control infrastructure prototypes were made and firmware was solidified.
See More
September 2016
End-to-end Integration
Full integration of Neptune software and hardware was made. Neptune software was stress-tested by benchmarks and levels of hardware precision were evaluated and documented.
See More
October 2016
Release
Programming time dedicated to bug-fixing. We validated our work through multiple test cases including a collaboration with the MIT wetlab team. We released our software and hardware as open source on GitHub and NONA.

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," operation also brings errors. Thus, we tend to assume that the negative and positive inputs ($H_n$ and $H_p$) are subject to normal distributions as below
$$ H_n \sim N(EH_n,\sigma_n^2) $$
$$ H_p \sim N(EH_p,\sigma_p^2) $$
Besides, the error of affinity of receptor and receptor amount in per yeast, as system errors, are also considered. From papers, we know that affinity $K$ is probably between $5nM$ to $15nM$, and the receptors in per yeast $R_p$ is probably $10^4$,thus
$$ K \sim N(10,2.5) $$
$$ R_p \sim N(10^4,\sigma_R^2) $$
And we also consider an uniformity error of the system output ($Flo_t$), which is caused by the error of fluorescence detection hardware.
$$ Flo_t \sim N(E(Flo_t),\sigma_f^2) $$
After defining deviations of the system, we simply take follow parameters to testing.
$$ \sigma_n^2=5\%EH_n \; \sigma_p^2=5\%EH_p \; \sigma_R^2=500 \; \sigma_f^2=1\%E(Flo_t) $$
Then, we can use Monte Carlo methods to simulate the negative and positive result. We choose 100000 iterations Gibs Sampling to simulate this system. And the outcome is demonstrated below.
And we can use the ROC to decide the proper threshold that makes the testing most accurate and efficient. The ROC plot is showed below
From the ROC, it is clear that the threshold of the testing should be 8.822 and the AUC that measure the quality of testing is 0.929, which is adequately high.
Risk Analysis
At the final part of the modeling, we are interested in how the errors of input and system influence the testing accuracy. First, we continue to use the definition of error in the previous part,and more specific class the errors into two parts.
Relative system errors
The relative error of the testing system, mainly because of the uncertainty of sensitive parameters and fluorescence detection error of the hardware.
Relative input errors
The relative error of input concentration of histamine, basically because of the operation errors and the natural variance of samples.
And we also use the Monte Carlo method to simulate it and get a heat plot, which gives us hints about how errors in system and input influence the testing quality. In this analysis, we use"

What is a Biosensor?
Click to learn more
Biosensors can be thought of as any device which is capable of sensing an analyte (e.g. a molecule or compound) or certain condition (e.g. pH or temperature) through the use of a biological component (Turner, 2013). One example of this would be a canary in a coal mine, where in the presence of carbon monoxide, the canary dies. A perhaps less morbid and more advanced biosensor example are those which have been developed by synthetic biologists. All organisms use native biosensing devices to monitor molecules of interest and initiate cell responses. For example, maintenance of cell homeostasis requires the sensitive detection and subsequent regulation of many molecules, such as metals, fatty acids and hydrogen peroxide (Rensing & Grass, 2003, Zhang & Rock, 2009 and Marinho et al., 2014). Two-component systems are common biosensing systems in bacteria. These systems allow bacteria to respond to extracellular signals by the phosphorylation of a sensor kinase in the presence of a target molecule, which subsequently phosphorylates further response regulator proteins. These response regulators can alter cell behaviour through protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, or RNA binding (Gao et al., 2007).
In recent years, there has been a substantial increase the number biosensors produced using synthetic biology methods. Synthetic biology involves the application of engineering principles to the manipulation of biological systems. Biosensors constructed using these methods adapt the native cellular biosensing processes discussed previously, such as protein or RNA binding, and use these interactions to induce transcription of a reporter gene, such as"

Variation of parameter q in Fig. 6
As expected, the shape and maximum are the same within error limits, and a delay can be clearly seen. Delay increase with concentration. The reason for the delay is that, the way across the cytomembrane is different for aTc and IPTG. ATc enter the cell by passive diffusion, and IPTG by active transportation, Therefore the expression of toxin is faster. During the delay, antitoxin are synthesized and form binding with toxin. As long as the toxin is neutralized by its antitoxin, bacteria return to the normal state and grow as if in free conditions. This can be described in following forms:
{\rm{v}} = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}                         {{v_0},}&{t \le {t_0}}\\                         {{v_0}\exp qt,}&{t > {t_0}}                         \end{array}} \right.\quad(7)
To calculate ${{\text{t}}_{0}}$, we use correlation coefficient to measure the similarity of growth rate of control group ${{\text{v}}_{0}}\left( \text{t} \right)$ and experiment group $\text{v}\left( \text{t}+{{\text{t}}_{0}} \right)$, then ${{\text{t}}_{0}}$ should be the interval that maximum the correlation coefficient:
\mathop {\max }\limits_{{t_0}} \left| {\frac{{E\left( {\left( {v\left( {t + {t_0}} \right) - Ev} \right)\left( {{v_0}\left( t \right) - E{v_0}} \right)} \right)}}{{\sqrt {D\left( {v\left( t \right)} \right)D\left( {{v_0}\left( t \right)} \right)} }}} \right|\quad(8)

At 50 µM, the optical density of the wild type cells decreases to an OD of 0.05 from the initial reading of 0.17. In comparison, the mNARK-Lycopene cells achieved a final optical density of 0.33 from a low of 0.05. At the 100 µM concentration, the wild type cells flat lined, remaining at an optical density of 0.25, while the lycopene cell concentration increased substantially from an optical density of 0.07 to 0.45 after four hours of growth.
In summary, out analysis has shows that our mNARK-Lycopene device protects the cells from oxidative stress and, from this, we can assume that this effect will continue once our lycopene probiotic is consumed by and aging person. Additionally, it has been proved that the cells will be able to survive and multiply in the gut and colonise it. Therefore providing protection to neighbouring cells by ‘mopping up’ the oxidative stress.
After establishing that the mNARK-Lycopene device improves cells growth compared to wild type E. coli, the growth of the Lycopene cells was measured against lycopene expression.
First, the cells were grown in LB media with 2 mM copper (II) sulphate. As shown in the plot, the mNARK-Lycopene device reached a higher cell density of 0.57, which corresponds to an OD485 of 0.68. Wild type E. coli does not achieve such a cell density and, by extension, lycopene expression. From an initial cell density of 0.08, the wild type cells reach a maximum cell density of 0.34. Additionally, the gradient of the graph represents the rate at which cells express lycopene. The plot indicates that the mNARK-Lycopene device expresses lycopene at a higher rate than the wild type cells. It is clear that, for both the mNARK-Lycopene device and wild type E. coli cells, lycopene expression increases with cell density, as more lycopene is being produced as a result of there being a larger number of lycopene producing cells. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mNARK-Lycopene mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells from dying. Therefore allowing cells to grow to a greater optical density, and, as mentioned above, greater cell density corresponds with greater lycopene production.
The second graph is derived from experiments using LB with two different concentrations of sodium nitro"

Introduction & Motivation
The in vivo proof of concept implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 as an anti-viral in plants requires integration of the coding sequence for Cas9 along with its corresponding sgRNA(s) into a plant genome. We've chosen to design sgRNAs that will guide Cas9 to three highly-conserved coding sequences of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) genome where it will induce double-stranded breaks. As the virus attempts to reproduce its own DNA and express virulence proteins in the plant cell nucleus, it is hoped the consitutively expressed Cas9 endonuclease will have a severe impact on the number of viable viral genomes and provide a meaningful level of immunity.
Choice of Viral Target Sites Panel Toggle
When Cas9 is used to target plant chromosomal DNA for genome engineering, the double stranded breaks it makes are most often repaired by error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)
. As Cas9 cuts the viral genome, plant NHEJ repair mechanisms will also inadvertently act to repair the viral chromosome. If only one evolutionarily nonconserved site on the viral genome is targeted, even after a Cas9-guided double stranded break it is possible that the viral genome will be quickly repaired without any major detriment to its life cycle. To increase the probability that the virus will be rendered inert, multiple sgRNAs targeting highly conserved sequences throughout the viral genome will need to be expressed simultaneously. In addition, targeting the CaMV genes most important for reproduction and export may help decrease the number of stable virus mini-chromosomes in the nucleus, reduce synthesis of new viral DNA, and stop export into the cytoplasm. A recent study by Seeger & Sohn
targeted Hepatitis B virus in a human cell line. They found that most gRNA targets were able to reduce the number of HBV-positive cells five-fold or more, but mechanism of immunity not entirely clear. For most gRNA designs, the Cas9 breaks"

Density Dependent Motility
Fig. 3 Designed genetic circuit
In experiments, we designed a circuit  that the cell motility was repressed by cell density ρ. When the cell density ρ was high, the  diffusion coefficient D became small.  Therefore, the fisher’s equation as equation (2.1) was not valid  in this  case any more.
In  order to be simple, we firstly considered  the one dimension problem again. We assumed the  cell density at point x was ρ(x) at time t. In a very short time τ, there would be two groups of cell at x moving into its nearby points x-δ, x+δ, due to the random walk. And the amount of cell in each group  were proportional to the product of D(ρ(x)) and ρ(x). Therefore,
(3.1)
In the limit τ-->0 and δ-->0, we obtain
(3.2)
 
And the functionDρ(ρ)  was a decrease  function. For a simplest case, we considered a Heaviside Function(Fig.4). There was a threshold of cell density above which the cell can not swim forward but always tumble in the same place. Considering five points with the different cell denisty, among which there were group cell swimming to the nearby sites, we assumed that only the cell density in the middle of which was larger than the threshold. Then the cell in the middle would not go out of it. At the same time, the cell nearby would incessantly come into this point. As a result, the cell density here would increase, while the cell density nearby would continually decrease until zero.
 
The numerical simulations gave us the results  shown in Fig.5. The cell density showed a periodical-narrow-peak structure.  These peaks were what we wanted, as they produced some regions of low cell density,  though the whole pattern was not quite similar with that of experiments. And the exact pattern would come out when we took account of the other parts in the whole genetic circuit(See Full Model ).

Assigning the tolC codons to a specific secondary structure was based on previous research [3].
RESULTS & LIMITATIONS
Click the arrow above for the results obtained from out experiments and assessment of the simplifications and limitations of our method:
Limitations
Our model is fairly simplistic in its nature. It is limited in the scope of mutations, only handling missense and nonsense mutations. Insertions and deletions/frameshift mutations would add considerable layer of complexity in programming both how to generate these mutations as well as analyzing the effects of these mutations. Our model also limited itself to the coding portions of the genes. The effect of mutations on any control sequences (promoter, RBS, ect…) would be more difficult to predict because their effects are not due to amino acids, but rather their interactions with other molecules in the cell. One could hypothesize that a mutation either upregulating or downregulating gene expression could work in favor of our project; downregulation (or stopping transcription) would likely make the bacteria hypersensistive to the antibiotics, and an upregulation could increase the likely hood that that individual bacterium would be infected by a bacteriophage (more receptors = more binding opportunities)
. We, however, are not prepared to make that claim.
Results
Results are output as a .csv file which can be opened using a program like Microsoft Excel or Apple’s Numbers for further analysis. On a run of 1000 mutants on E. coli’s tolC gene we got the following numbers:
Changes of charge
358/1000
Polarity changes
338/1000
Premature stops added
46/1000
Predicted Function Destroying Mutations
395.25/1000
Predicted mutations preventing phage binding
446.25/1000
Meaning out of every 1000 tolC mutants we would predict approximately 446.25 to be resistant to a TolC-binding bacteriophage, and 553.75 to be infectable. Of the phage-insensitive mutants, we would predict 395.5 (88.6%) to be hypersensitive to (what would be under normal circumstances) efflux-resisted antibiotics, and 50.75 (11.4%) to be both phage insensitive as well as possessing the normal antibiotic tolerance.

Introduction
What is Synthetic Biology?
Synthetic Biology is a prominent area of science that offers the potential to open up vast areas of new research. It encompasses both science and engineering to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems as well as re-designing existing biological systems for useful endeavours.
What is iGEM?
iGEM is the “international Genetically Engineered Machine” competition for interdisciplinary undergraduate student teams. iGEM seeks to test the idea that biology can be engineered in the manner proposed by synthetic biology. Each student team must devise a project in which they design and engineer a novel “genetic machine”. Teams are given a kit of biological parts which they are encouraged to use and characterise, whilst also submitting new parts and devices for future teams to exploit. The teams present their project and results at regional jamborees. Several teams progress to the world finals based at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US. There are various judging criteria ranging from designing the best wiki to having the best modelling practice, this is yet another element in which the multi disciplinary learning opportunity is highlighted.
Since its competitive beginning in 2006 iGEM has grown rapidly, with 193 University’s entering for the 2012 competition!
A little bit about Us...
The University of Exeter is situated in the heart of Devon's capital city!
This year the University is entering their first team into the iGEM competition. The team consists of four Biologists, four Physicists, an Engineer and a Mathematician. They have the support of several members of staff who have all been willing to give up their spare time to help when needed.

Collaboration with Newcastle team
Following our iGEM Northern Meet-up, we asked Newcastle to help us to convert our deterministic model of interactions between phages and bacteria into stochastic one. Although nobody from their team had previous experience in modelling using Python packages,   StochPy in particular, they received extensive training in modelling in general that proved to be very useful for us.
During over 2 hours long Skype session with Bradley Brown and his team members we worked thought our model together bit by bit trying to find a solution. We shared the basic principle behind StochPy and our draft models, whereas Newcastle proposed a   working solution. The result of this collaboration is reflected in our GitHub page with a commit title “Introduction of Newcastle help in stochastic model”.   This collaboration is also mentioned on the official Newcastle 2017 wiki Collaborations page .
Collaboration with Edinburgh UG team
Throughout the project we have extensively collaborated with the Edinburgh_UG team . The collaboration resulted essential for both teams to develop their projects.
Collaboration 1
2017 Edinburgh OG and UG teams worked together to deliver a presentation for the Synthetic Biology Society at the University of Edinburgh on October 11th. The main focus of our presentation was to raise awareness and promote iGEM competition through   an introduction to iGEM history and principles and the explanation of our projects.To achieve this, we explained how iGEM have helped us to develop practical and problem-solving skills, to come up with solutions to world problems and finally helped   us to collaborate and integrate our project and ideas into the real world.
The audience, 30 people from both under and postgraduate degrees, seemed to be very motivated to join the 2018 team, asking many questions about the detailed procedure of application.
Collaboration 2
We helped the Edinburgh UG team incorporate stochastic modelling into their project. Up until this point, they were having difficulty modelling the catalysis of recombination by site-specific recombinases. With our feedback they were able to develop   a complete model that allowed for their designs to be tested in silico.

What could SMITe become?
We have created a futuristic ""kit"" of what we imagined SMITe could become in the future. We had the opportunity to borrow equipment from Danderyds Hospital in Stockholm where we could film a short movie and take some pictures. The movie stages a doctors appointment at the wound clinic. The patient has a chronic wound on her left leg and the wound is not responding to the usual treatment.

Having catered to the issues of rise time and fall time, as well as holding the ON and OFF states for a long time similar to how square waves behave, we then also wanted to have the oscillator be noise free. Noise in biological systems can hamper the oscillations by driving the cells out of phase due to copy number variations of the plasmid, leaky expression, and other factors.
How our square wave oscillator caters to the noise is as follows –
High cooperativity repressors – High cooperativity ensures a near digital response, and therefore lower concentrations of the repressor would not be able to repress their corresponding node well enough, due to their requirement to dimerize in high numbers.
Low copy reporter – Demonstrated by Paulsson et al, one of the main sources of noise in the repressilator was that the reporter was placed in a high copy number plasmid. Such high copy numbers (containing pUC19 or pMB1 origins of replication) can have large cell to cell variations in copy number, thereby reporting in a faulty, noisy manner. Therefore, as was done by their group, our square wave oscillator contains the reporter on a low copy backbone (p15A ori).
Removing degradation Tags – Paulsson et al, in the same paper, reported that the ssrA degradation tags that were used at the end of the repressor genes in the repressilator also employed machinery that was noisy. Removing these tags from his system brought down the variance significantly. Our square wave oscillator employs the same strategy for noise reduction.
