For the protocol we will use in seeding the plate, see yesterday's entry.
GFP reporter Zif268 plasmid transformation
We also want to duplicate the plate reader experiment using our GFP reporter strain, so that we can show definitively that there is more Zif268 (represented by the GFP) in one well versus another.
Miniprep of GFP Zif268 reporter plasmid: 151.5ng/uL, 260/280=1.89
Transformed 1.5mL EcNR2 selection strain with 1uL plasmid (time constant of 4.8)
Recovered 1hr in LB, and then added spec
Grew 1hr in spec and then reinoculated 30 uL into a fresh tube of LB+spec to grow overnight (seeing as even with a poor time constant, 100 ul yielded over 100 colonies on the plate that Noah had tried earlier).

Adding phosphatase to CB bottom
Because we did not cut enough DNA yesterday, we decided to add phosphatase to a sample of CB bottom backbone we had cut before. This sample, which had already been PCR purified and eluted in 30 ul of EB, had a concentration of 69 ng/ul according to the nanodrop.
In order to make sure the sample was cut appropriately, we ran it and a sample of the CB bottom we cut yesterday on a 4% e-gel.
A comparison of our old and new CB bottom backbones. Note, new has already been phosphotased.
The band was much more intense for the old sample, and it looked like it had a concentration of between 40 and 100 ng/ul. We decided to perform the reaction on 20 ul of the cut sample (for approximately 1380 ng of DNA) and used the following recipe:
20 ul DNA
1 ul phosphatase
2.33 ul phosphatase reaction buffer.
We incubated the reaction at 37* for 1 hour 10 minutes, and heat deactivated the enzyme by heating it at 65* for 20 minutes.
We then PCR purified the sample, eluting in 30 ul of EB, and got a yield of 41.7 ng/ul, meaning we had a total of 1251 ng of backbone, which was more than enough for our ligation.

Data in DNA format has many advantages. The     right choice of organism can deliver even more advantages. We     chose Bacillus subtilis. It is not pathogenic for humans, it is     naturally competent and a well-researched model-organism. On top of     all that it can form highly resistant endospores. Viable spores of B. subtilis could be recovered from a 250 million year old salt     crystal [2] . What else could we wish for as a highly safe storage and transmission system? The sequences of key and message     are being integrated into the genome of two different B. subtilis strains by making use of the BBa_K823023 B. subtilis integration     vector which integrates into the amyE locus. A scheme of the integration process is shown in Figure 3 and the sequences integrated in the plasmid is visible in figure 3. Like this they can be     shipped or stored separately what makes interception of our system     for unauthorized parties even harder.  Genomic integration of both     message and key is safer than plasmid integration because the     relevant sequences are hidden in a full genome. Whole genome     sequencing is more elaborated than sequencing of plasmid,     especially if unauthorized parties don’t know what they are looking     for.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," was one of the reasons we chose it as our topic.
PAL
The first of our two approaches for probiotic treatment of PKU is based on the enzyme, called phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). Naturally, PAL enzyme is found mostly in plants and fungi and is involved in the response of various stimuli, such as pathogens, light, temperature.
The main function of PAL is to break down L-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia (picture). Both of these compounds are easily degraded to other metabolic molecules and have no toxic effect. Mainly because of this, PAL enzyme may serve as possible substitution to phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), the main phenylalanine processing enzyme in human cells, which is inactive in PKU cases.
A small number of researchers have previously reported a potential PKU treatment using PAL enzyme, however, none of these studies got as far as clinical trial stage, mainly because of the therapy design or low expression levels. Most of the researches considered injecting an active PAL enzyme directly into the bloodstream of the patient. Even though this is definitely the quickest approach, it causes numerous immunological problems. In addition, it is also difficult to maintain enzymatic PAL activity up to the certain level in the bloodstream.
Rather than using naked enzyme directly in the bloodstream of the patient, we considered creating a probiotic bacteria to deliver PAL to the intestine, where food is digested and most of the amino acids are transported to the bloodstream. This way enzyme itself is protected from most of the environmental factors and can steadily maintain its activity. At the same time, because probiotic bacteria will be found in the intestine, not in the bloodstream of the patient, it does not cause immune response.
In our project we used PAL enzyme sequence derived from Anabaena variabilis, cyanobacteria. We chose PAL enzyme naturally found in bacteria because it is more likely to maintain its function in our model organism E. coli. Our team used PAL biobrick, previously created by Stanford-Brown 2015 iGEM team (K1692004) , and managed to improve it by adding different kind of tags to its sequence (K1983000) and K1983001.
It is rather simple, but effective and brilliant approach. Our newly engineered probiotic bacteria with expressed PAL activity would take care of excess phenylalanine in the human gut after every meal. Protected by bacteria from the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract, PAL easily maintains its enzymatic activity (see results ).
Following PAL activity results, we considered additional ways to make the system even"

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," LSAS result is a subset of a corresponding NLSAS result.
Overview of LSAS and NLSAS
Overall, LSAS generates a single or multiple operon paths in which a preceding operon directly activates a succeeding operon, and NLSAS paths in which any of the preceding operons can activate a succeeding operon. In general, a resulting LSAS operon path includes operons mined from same or similarly conducted experimental protocols, where the operons are optimized to coexist in a system. As a result, LSAS can return well optimized operon paths and interactions, which may be used in biochemical reactions with higher confidence. The SBiDer web application can further facilitate the use of such operons paths by providing literature and other published resources. NLSAS, on the other hand, can generate an operon path by including operons from dissimilar experimental protocols. So, using NLSAS can potentially lead to the discovery of novel operon paths and thus new biochemical systems. By providing LSAS and NLSAS variations of the search algorithm, SBiDer assists a user in capturing the biological reality underlying an operon activation as accurately as possible, and provides a means to evaluate, analyze, and apply the results.
Complexity Analysis
The SBiDer network is based upon the Petri Net model, which allows for the capturing of boolean logic. The linearity of the network representation of the database is such that one input transition leads to one operon, which leads to one output transition, and one list containing all species produced by that operon, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 - Petri Net representation of an input species node, an input transition, an operon node, an output transition, and a species node consisting of only the species produced by the current operon respectively.This is the representation used for the construction of the SBiDer database since they allow for the incorporation of boolean logic.
This entire structure can be collapsed into one node since there is no branching, and allows us to represent the network as a directed graph, as shown in Figure 2. By condensing the network in this fashion, complex searches can be conducted in a more efficient manner.
Figure 2 - Operon representation of the network where the input and output transitions have been collapsed into one operon node to decrease the complexity of the search algorithm. This is possible because an input transition always points to one operon and one output transition always points to one species node.

Kyoto,2010,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria [3] [4] . Also, it can be applied to other ideas such as E.coli capsules which scatter drug or aroma by cell-lysis responding to a certain signal. Therefore, the cell-death devices based on diverse approaches, including previous iGEM projects have been developed [1] [3] [5] [6] . However, present cell-death devices are not useful because they have two problems as follows:
They are not quantitatively characterized [7]
They are not applied to many promoters [8] .
Therefore, we attempted to solve these problems and design new BioBricks that are better characterized and more applicable cell-death device to contribute to every future projects.
Problems of Present Cell-Death Devices
1.Need for Quantitative Characterization
In previous iGEM, many teams focused on λ lysis cassette, which is a killer-gene derived from λ phage and causes cell lysis. However, they have only characterized its lytic activity qualititatively. Quantitative characterization of its lytic activity is necessary in order to design a universal and applicable cell-death device. For example, we wish to analyze when cell lysis occurs after induction of λ lysis cassette, how many cells lyse, whether all of cells lyse or not, and so on.
2. Solution to the Restriction on Application of Promoters
In constructing a simple circuit consisting of an inducible promoter and λ lysis cassette, the combination are limited by the promoter's basal expression, strength of killer-function and many other factors.  We looked for the solution to this problem and came up with an idea; using both the lysis cassette and its antikiller-gene, SΔTMD1, which lacks the code for trans membrane domain 1 of killer-gene. We can use two promoters (a constitutive one and an inducible one) for regulating cell-death balance. Into this circuit, we can apply more promoters to this device by using an appropriate constitutive promoter.
We considered that lysis cassette and SΔTMD1 are the most appropriate to killer-gene and anti-killer gene [5] . This was because we found some articles which show the effect of SΔTMD1 in the yeast [9] and also because previous iGEM teams already dealt with lysis cassette.

Background
Synechocystis PCC6803 as a model chassis
Cyanobacteria have been the first truly photosynthetic microorganisms  to appear on earth about 2.4 billion years ago. (ref:Evolution of photosynthesis. Hohmann-Marriott MF, Blankenship RE.)With the emergence of synthetic biology and new genetic tools it is of no surprise that many research groups are using cyanobacteria as a chassis suitable for a range of aplications. They include: detection of water soluble pollutants and commodity chemicals production (reference)
Among the many qualities of synechocystis there are two of them that provided us an interesting opportunity to develop an iGEM project. First, being a photosynthetic organism, each culture is, at least for an important time span, a self sustainable system. Second, cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotic organisms to exhibit circadian behaviour. Moreover, the principal proteins involved in the process have been characterised in synechococcus as well as the cyclic expression pattern in synechocystis. (reference)
Lux operon: more than just a reporter
The lux operon is a group of genes that is responsible for a density dependent bioluminescent behavior in Vibrio Fischeri. It is composed of 8 genes, LuxA and B encode for a heterodimeric luciferase; LuxC, D and E the enzymes that recover the decanal substrate and LuxR and I are responsible for regulating the whole operon. Lastly LuxG is believed to act as a FMNH2 dependent FADH2 reductase, although luminescence is not affected in its absence. LuxAB has been widely used as a reporter dependent"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

Arizona_State,2012,Team:Arizona State#FieldApplications_-_-_TEXT.html," contamination could come from heavy rain, flooding, development of a new community, natural disaster, etc. Within minutes of the test being initiated, a pathogen would be able to be detected. This would greatly decrease the amount of locals that could get infected with the pathogen because a contamination warning would be implemented the same day. According to current practices and timelines, a water contamination warning would not be able to go out until two days after the pathogen was detected (Pitkanen). Our biosensor would reduce this time by turning days into minutes. By using the team’s biosensor, we are able to engineer our biosensor to a specific phenotype of pathogen. We would be able to do this onsite or have our biosensor pre-designed before its implemented. This would eliminate expensive lab experiments and time by already having the phenotype of the pathogen determined.
What are the possible sources of an outbreak?
As defined an outbreak is an occurrence of a disease greater than two or more infected patients caused by the same water exposure (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Though many of these instances occur in developing countries with lack of sanitation and public health awareness, outbreaks still occurred in industrialized nations such as the United States and Canada (Shannon). For example, in Denmark there was an outbreak of Campylobacter jejuni that happened between the years 1995-1996 (Engberg). This bacterium is similar to E.coli in that it behaves very similar. Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common bacterial causes of diarrhea in humans in developing countries (Engberg).
In December of 1995, a procedure was performed to test the amount of nitrate in the ground water. In the process of testing this, a sewage pipe was damaged and then leaked into the ground water supply. It took over a four weeks for the water pump to be turned off from the initial contamination (Engberg). For this particular case, a very high coliform count was found in the infected water. A coliform count is recognized as a water contamination test. The test involves the counting of colonies of the coliform-bacteria Escherichia coli (E.coli)in a 100 milliliter water sample. The result is given as ""Coliform Microbial Density"". This indicates the amount of feces present in the contaminated water sample(The Law Dictionary).
The Environmental Protection Agency, instituted rules for beaches and recreational waters to ensure that people who came into contact with bodies of water would not become ill. These regulations stated that for any bodies of freshwater, the advisory limits are 235 CFU/100 ml"

Human Practice
This year, our main focus about human practice is communication. We truly believe that it is the key to bringing dynamic and new ideas to our iGEM community. And it is our job to observe others’ opinions as well as to give others advice. Therefore, this is not only our human practice presentation but also proof for the friendship between our team and all the groups or individuals below.
2014/4/12-SJTU Aniversary Carnival
We first focused on our own school community. After all these years of support from the university, we really wanted to bring fun activities to help everyone learn the beauty of life and synthetic biology.
In April, with the opportunity of School Anniversary Carnival, we designed games about gene codes and biology lab equipment for people to participate in. Over 100 people stepped in our tent and enjoyed their time with us.
2014 Summer Vacation-Shenzhen Foreign Languages School
This year we were also lucky to have younger iGEMers’ companion. SFLS iGEM Team has recently become an official partner of our team. Our cooperation mainly contains two parts. Based on same focus on membrane, Shenzhen_SFLS Lvdagunr project of 2014 iGEM HS utilized the LGT membrane protein Biobricks BBa_K771107 and BBa_K771102 which was submitted by 2012 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai.  Also, one of their teammate, Zhang Yuyin, came to our lab to help out. With the summer visit, we had a lot to share with each other considering the same interest.
2014/8/3~8/7-The 2014 iGEM Formosa in NCTU
During August 3rd to 7th 2014, 7 of our team members attended the 2014 iGem Formosa in NCTU.

For children, probiotics are the important method to maintain remission. But for adult patients, it is still hard to observe this effect. Actually, intestinal flora is in large quantities and very complicated. Therapeutic mechanism of supplementary micro ecological preparation (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, etc.) is not clear and sometimes it is hard to determine the clinical effects.
A2: Intestinal microecology is one of the factor causing inflammatory bowel disease. Treating inflammatory bowel disease completely through changing intestinal microecology still have a long way to go. For example, fecal bacteria transplantation is effective only in a few patients. (But for the inflammatory bowel disease with the concurrency of infection of clostridium, it is the first-line therapy.) Personally, treating inflammatory bowel disease in the direction of intestinal microecology is very promising.
Survey
This survey consists of three major parts: intestinal diseases, gut flora and synthetic biology. As people know life-related diseases, i.e. intestinal tract diseases, better than merely intestinal diseases, the survey is needed to start from a boarder aspect and be narrowed to intestinal diseases.
363 shares of answers are received, with 81.82% of which have no idea about iGEM. People above 40 years old contribute to 46.55% of all answers and people from 26~40 take up 15.43%. People below 26 account for 15.43%. Participants come from all walks of life, with only 36.36% of them being students.
In the first part we investigated people’s cognition in intestinal diseases. People believe that cancer and AIDS are the most severe diseases. Heart attack ranked the third, followed by Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s, then the pneumonia. Intestinal tract diseases are among the least severe common diseases, as expected. However, 84.3% of participants have witnessed the suffering of intestinal tract diseases, with the cost of treatment covers a long range. 8.82% cost is below ¥100, 29.41% ¥100~500, 24.18% ¥500~1000 and 23.2% beyond ¥2000 . Only 6.21% participants claim that 1~2 days are needed to cure the disease, while different people suffer from various intestinal tract diseases, with the time required to cure ranging from days to more than half a year. Furthermore, 50% people get the diseases once or twice, while the rest suffer more often. Among all the intestinal tract diseases"

In response to 3rd and 4th proposition: They pointed out genetic engineering is just a different in the degree of breeding we’ve been doing for thousands of years. However, there is a point at which a difference in degree constitutes a difference in type, and genetic engineering crosses this line. We also already have lots of scientific progress at the status quo, and don’t need to cross this boundary.
In support of 1st and 2nd opposition: Things do get out, so treat them carefully.
In support of 3rd opposition: There is potential for a dangerous arms race, and government must check corporate science, ensuring a sufficient knowledge base is built prior to its application. Government is more representative of the people, particularly of their moral interests.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," 1: Schematic figure of how cAMP is involved in regulation of gene expression. Without cAMP, CAP can’t bind to its specific site and downstream genes are only expressed in low levels. With cAMP, CAP interacts with CAP and ,by this, can bind to the CAP site and interact with the RNA polymerase. Downstream genes are expressed in high levels.
For B2H an E. coli strain lacking the cyA gene, which is encoding the catalytic domain of the adenylate cyclase and does not produce cAMP, is used. Consequently, cells can no longer utilize maltose or lactose. This phenotype can be rescued using the complementary T25 and T18 fragments of the catalytic domain of the adenylate cyclase toxin from Bordetella pertussis. Those fragments are cloned to genes of interest in plasmids called pKT25 and pUT18, respectively. Those fragments when splitted can no longer synthesize cAMP (Figure 2 B). If two hybrid proteins interact in this assay the two fragments of the catalytic domain come into close proximity and produce cAMP(Figure 2 C). The cAMP/CAP complex is formed again and regulates the mal or lac operon positively. Cells containing interacting constructs can utilize maltose and lactose again. Based on this, interaction of proteins can be screened using methods based on the lac operon or the maltose operon. For this, several different media are used:
LBv2 agar plates supplemented with IPTG and Xgal used for Blue-White Screening if the lac operon is functional. You can read more about Blue-White Screening in the VibriClone part of our description.
MacConkey agar plates supplemented with maltose to test if the mal operon is functional. When cells utilize maltose, acids are formed and cells turn red because of the pH indicator neutral red.
M63 minimal medium agar plates supplemented with maltose to test if the mal operon is functional by screening for growth of colonies.
Figure 2: Principle of a Two-Hybrid system based on reconsitution of the adenylate cyclase of B. pertussis. (A) The full-length catalytic domain can synthesize cAMP. (B) T25 and T18 fragments, when coexpressed as splitted peptides, are not able to interact and cAMP is not synthesized. (C) Both fragments, when fused to interacting proteins, get into close proximity and cAMP is synthesized.

（5）On July 13th ------ Biogrowing Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co. Ltd
    Guided by the head of the R&D department, we visited the company's laboratories, learning a lot about some high-tech equipment. In the conference room of the R&D department, we conducted a far-reaching discussion with the person in charge. He told us the application regulations and policies of genetically engineered bacteria, which made us realize that genetically engineered bacteria cannot be eaten directly, which caused substantial changes in the direction of our project. We no longer stuck to the probiotics direction and try to find new application directions.

Prevention of Leaky Expression
While we had originally intended to use fluorescent proteins under lac-controlled promotors by themselves as target vectors, we were concerned that even the relatively low copy number (10-12 per cell) plasmid pSB3K3 would offer enough binding sites for LacI to titrate away the wild-type lac repressor. Indeed, leaky expression is rather noticeable in parts I763004 , J04430 , I13601 and J5526 , in some of them even with bare eyes. Therefore, we increased the number of wild-type LacI generators in the cell by including constitutive LacI expression cassettes in our target vectors. This effort resulted in devices K142073 , K142074 , K142075 and K142076 , which can still be induced with IPTG to yield rather strong fluorescence (except for part K142075 , which showed extremely weak fluorescence).
Figure 10: A 1% agarose gel of XbaI/PstI test restriction digests of plasmid pSB3K3 holding fluorescent protein generators I763004 , J04430 , I13601 and J04450 . After ligation four colonies were picked per construct and a test restriction digest was carried out to identify the plasmids holding the correct inserts. B Having subcloned I763004 , J04430 , I13601 and J04450 , respectively, into plasmid pSB3K3 , the resulting plasmid was linearized by SpeI/PstI restriction digest and the constitutive LacI expression cassette I739002 was cloned behind the fluorescent protein generators to build devices K142073 , K142074 , K142075 and K142076 . After transformation, devices K142073 , K142074 , K142075 and K142076 were streaked onto LB-agar plates containing 1mM IPTG and imaged under UV light with a Nikon D80 SLR
As shown in the next chapter, induction of cells co-transformed with pulse generator K142027 and target plasmid K142073 yielded a strong increase in fluorescence.
Expression Level upon Induction
Due to the remarkable strength of the LacI IS repressor evidenced in our genetic experiment, we were concerned that if LacI IS was transcribed in small amounts despite tet-repressor regulation, which is supposed to be extremely tight, it might repress expression of the target protein despite induction and result in a pulse generator that is unable to initiate expression of the"

Characterizing Non-Lysosomal Inducible Protein Degradation
TinselPurple samples under varying levels of IPTG induction in the Chrome-Q base ready for imaging
Scientists around the world struggle with questions regarding chromoprotein expression, specifically in regards to their use in biosensors.  Biosensors are often seen as low-cost alternatives to expensive detection equipment for underfunded labs and field work.  Lambert iGEM was inspired to address the problem of quantifying chromoprotein expression through development of a 3-D printed original device: Chrome-Q, software app, and verification with a chromoprotein genetic circuit. Additionally, samples were prepared with the 3-D Fuge (which was modified from Prakash Lab’s Paperfuge) to investigate the viability of using a low-cost centrifuge to process cells for visualization.
Quantifying color relies on measures of Red, Green, Blue (RGB) values and evaluating them in a color space known as Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV). Another consideration for color quantification is standardization of environmental light.  To achieve this a device, the Chrome-Q, was developed to create a standardized environment for capturing images using Android and Apple mobile device cameras.  Self-developed android software evaluates the RGB images resulting in HSV values.  These HSV values can be normalized for cell density through subsequent serial dilutions of the cultures and plating to count Colony Forming Units (CFU).

Right: Chromoproteins under four different levels of IPTG induction plated to determine CFU's
Throughout the development of the Chrome-Q, engineering design principles were implemented.  Feedback and resulting changes were implemented into the next iteration.  Five different prototypes led to the final development of two designs optimized for both Android and Apple mobile devices.  The Android software was written in C#.  The Chrome-Q stl files and software are available on the hardware page are open source.
The device and software were then used to quantify data of ATUM’s Protein Paintbox proteins TinselPurple, ScroogeOrange and VirginiaViolet under varying levels of IPTG induction. An assembled genetic circuit of: Promoter- R0040, Ribosomal Binding Site B0034,"

Sulfite Biosensor (Food & Nutrition)
Sulfite is also a common ingredient in many preserved foods, such as wine or canned goods, by maintaining reducing environment that is unfavorable for pathogenic growth, unfortunately some people are allergic to sulfite and, especially in wine, can have an adverse effect on taste. However, as our construct is an effective way of detecting redox levels, it could be used to detect levels of sulfite present in food and drink. This may prove helpful for the food industry where a compromise between food preservation and taste needs to be determined.
Oxidative Stress Detector (Diagnostic)
Cancer cells often survive in environments of oxidative stress, and evolve mutations which amplify this stress. Out reporter system could therefore be used in a cheap diagnostic to detect cancer. The Leiden 2018 iGEM team proved how the SoxR/pSoxS system can sense oxidative stress exerted by hydrogen peroxide.
Improved Biophotovoltaics (Energy)
Ferrocyanide/ferricyanide serves as a common electron carrier in biophotovoltaic systems: devices that generate electrical power from the electrons released by photosynthetic cells during photosynthesis (Anderson et al., 2016). As the cell generates power electron carriers are converted from ferricyanide to ferrocyanide. This would modulate the response of our system, meaning that its integration into these devices could be used to provide simple feedback control.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," open-source model in the sharing of genetic constructions, iGEM has enabled a setting in which the students, as scientists in the making, are embedded and assimilating with an expert culture that integrates the issues of biosafety and biosecurity while also promoting a public engagement and exchanges on a transnational to almost global level. A last counter-intuitive element, finally, has to do with how iGEM has managed to have an impact because of the incentives it provides to students. In essence, the competition prompts them to learn about and subsequently create external accountability through the objectives of public engagement by interacting with various stakeholders, regardless of the different kinds of borders they are confronted with. (Zhang 2012).
The Professionalization of the Synthetic Biologist: Beyond Self-Governance
As became clear in the previous chapter, collaborations and exchanges have been key in creating and fostering a community of synthetic biologists, most saliently through the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Besides this open-source biology network, according to Mukunda et al. (2009), to make this community culture open and safe, it must operate as a professional organization that can ensure biosecurity (Mukunda et al. 2009). When it comes to a specific iGEM team, such as UCL iGEM 2014, it is evident that the context of the competition provides a framework for incentivized self-regulation (Zhang et al. 2011). Moreover, the entire experience of participating in iGEM is about combining the burgeoning of a new-fangled life science discipline with education, a sense of community formation, and the creation of a collaborative and open network of students (iGEM 2014b). This set of social conditions is what Weir and Selgelid (2009) would consider as appropriate for the process of professionalization, which has been proposed as a way the governance of synthetic biology could be operationalised. The motivation behind it is that the concept bridges the bottom-up approach of autonomous self-governance with the top-down involvement of political and legal schemes. In other words, the useful and effective characteristics of the former are made compatible with governmental interventionism, taking into account that scientific objectives are matched with the public concern for accountability (Weir and Selgelid 2009).
The purpose of professionalizing synthetic biology is to connect the scientific value of expertise with the responsibility of the scientists to practice their field in a way that is morally accepted. The origins for this strategy comes from medical and engineering professions, where expertise is associated with the morality of the practice of the profession. If the same"

Other wise, several 3-rd party open source software or tools are used in our iGame source code. Libsbml is used to deal with sbml file operations. Qwt and Qwtplot3D are used for simulation data visual system.  At the early stage of our project SBML Ode Solver and Sundials were our main ode solver to produce the simulation data from our sbml model file, because the latest SBML Ode Solver is 1.6.0, developed in 2005, which is out of date and fail to support the newest sbml Level 2 Version 4 standard. We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

Hi! I am Man Li from WHU-China. I met iGEM one year ago and I am totally into it. In my mind, iGEM is not a competition merely but a club. In this club, students who have the same interests in genetically engineering work together. We set our goals, and achieve some ridiculous ideas. As for myself, I am an outgoing girl. For me, research in biology is one part of my life. In my mind, the quality of life is equally important to the achievement I make in biology. I play violin in my spare times, and enjoy the peaceful afternoons. In WHU-China, I am the one who mobilize the atmospheres in our laboratory and cheer others up.

This phosphorylation results in the loss of binding capacity of the aminoglycoside to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, which would lead to inhibition of protein synthesis without the presence of the APH ( Begg EJ and Barclay ML, 1995 ).
As indicated by the first results, the reporter genes under control of the virB promoter showed a slight but measureable expression without any induction of VirA with acetosyringone. This basal transcription resulted in the growth of bacteria without induction of VirA at normal working concentrations of kanamycin of 25 to 50 µg mL-1 ( Sambrook J and Russell DW, 2001 ).
Concludingly, prior to the screening experiments it was necessary to adjust the concentration of kanamycin, which inhibits the growth of uninduced bacteria, while allowing bacteria to grow when an appropriate inductor was present and able to activate VirA. This analysis was performed using the method of determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) as described below.
Determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of kanamycin
There are several ways to investigate the susceptibility of bacteria to inhibiting drugs like antibiotics. Nevertheless, the result of all these tests is the amount of an assayed substance that inhibits visible growth of the bacteria, called the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The most common way of determination is to grow bacteria in liquids with several concentrations of the inhibiting drug. This procedure is chosen mostly, since many different conditions can be measured at the same time by using microtiterplates ( Wiegand I et al., 2008 ).
As we planned not to use the kanamycin in liquid culture but in LB-Agar, we chose to determine the MIC at the same conditions as the desired experiment. Therefore, we planned to construct E. coli inhabiting the native VirA/G signaling system and a kanamycin resistance read out and plated a small volume in different dilutions on LB-Agar without kanamycin. The grown colonies could then be transferred to agar plates with rising concentrations of kanamycin using replica plating. By counting the colonies it should be possible to calculate the percentage of colonies that could withstand each kanamycin concentration. This experiment should be carried out with and without acetosyringone to determine a kanamycin concentration induced E. coli could withstand, while the same population of bacteria dies without the presence of acetosyringone.

This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this time, Prof. Xu suggested us to                         separate the two enzymes into two steps. (see figure 2) After listening to his suggestion, our                         team worked together and produced our new experiment plan with a two step reaction instead of                         one. In this way, the end product will not be transformed back into CDCA, and the mass                         production of USCA proves to be successful. As well as enhancing the biopharmaceutical effect of                         UDCA, we also aims to reduce the production cost. When we were designing the experiment, we                         included the usage of cofactors: NADH and NADP+. However, the cost of cofactors can be immense                         if they are not regenerated. After hearing about our problem, Prof. Xu suggested us finding                         enzymes to help with the regeneration of cofactors. With his suggestion in mind, we eventually                         employed GDH(Glutamate Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADP+, and LDH(Lactate                         Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADH. Carefully answering our questions and giving us other valuable information and cases about our topic, Prof. Xu used his actions to encourage us                         in refining our experiment and to give it a try.
Outreach
Contact with Local Hospital and Patients
In addition, we contact local patients from Xuanwu hospital who suffered from liver cirrhosis to                         discuss the curing effects and prices of various UDCA-contained medicines in the market to                         determine our direction. Through our interviews, we understood that current UDCA medicines in                         the market are unaffordable for patients with average or below average income in long term                         treatment. Also, medicine which price can be accepted by the patients has relatively weak curing                         effect. In order to solve this problem, we consulted experts from doctors from Xuanwu Hospital.                         She reported that UDCA has a large pharmaceutical application. As well as UDCA’s usage in                         dissolving gallstone, its efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing                         cholangitis (PSC) as an adjunct to medical therapy has been well established. Newer indications                         include its use in the management of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, post liver transplant                         rejection, graft-versus-host disease and acute viral hepatitis, where it not only relieves                         symptoms of cholestasis but also arrests ongoing hepatocyte necrosis.

HFUT-China
We are invited to test the front end of the project of the team HFUT-China for finding bugs and fix them. We found four bugs and design flaws.
1. When we clicked the button on the 'project' page to expand the gene chain list and delete designated gene chain, it might occasionally fail to delete although a notice of successful deletion is displayed. We discovered that it was caused by transaction locks of the database, which led to a failed concurrent Ajax request. This failure cannot be detected by the program, which would not stop the front end popping a successful notice.
2. The dragging-up of the recommending gene chain in the 'design' page might fail occasionally and the dragging function collapsed meanwhile until we refreshed it. It was diagnosed that problems were gestated in the interaction between the action scopes of AngularJS and NG-sortable database. We fixed it once after the bug was detected.
3. We found that there was not a clear button for registration, which made it difficult for users to register. It might affect the user experience.
4. Expanding the relationship network in the 'gene relationship' page may lead to the overlapping of the balls of surrounding genes.
We spent days on fixing bugs above and succeeded eventually. This experience contributed much on strengthening the bond between the team HFUT-China and us.
USTC
The procedure of the team USTC involved processing images of fluorescent cells. However, it required distinguishing the part of fluorescent cells from those non-fluorescent ones and the background as the pretreatment.
We calculated the distribution of the greyscale of images. Based on the distribution, we can determine which pixels may belong to fluorescent cells and which pixels may not.
Therefore we are able to cut out the part of fluorescent cells from remainders, which helped the team USTC solve this little tiresome problem.
SJTU-Software
We accepted the invitation from the team SJTU-Software to fill out their questionnaires. They told us that our opinions and advices on their project really mattered, which we were truly glad to see.

Bioprecipitation using P.syringae
Project Description
The arid climate of Australia has become notorious for causing widespread problems for agricultural industries.  That is, the scarcity of water hinders the production of crops and livestock, as well as forcing restrictions of daily water usage for households.  Team UQ Australia aims to solve this problem through the use of a bio-precipitation technique, thus increasing the availability of our most precious resource.
Pseudomonas syringae is a common bacterium, primarily found in colder climates (optimally at 22°C), and is well known for its biological ice nucleation properties, i.e. the formation of rain/snow.  This bacteria expresses an ice nucleation protein on its outer membrane (InaZ). InaZ acts as a scaffold for the formation of the ice crystals, this directly"

Project Description
Managing byproducts of the extraction and refinement processes is a common problem in harvesting natural resources, such as oil. In most cases, tailings ponds are used for storing the toxic water byproducts, which not only have severe negative environmental impacts but also by using current methods can take decades before they can be reclaimed. The current remediation methods need to be improved to provide economical, effective and efficient processes to decrease the negative environmental impact of the tailings ponds. The tailings ponds contain toxic organic compounds, heavy metals and fine clay particles, all which require improved methods of treatment. We will produce a tailings pond clean up kit that uses environmentally safe methods to accelerate the decontamination of toxic organic molecules, heavy metals, and settle the fine clay particles at an increased rate. Toxic compounds will be degraded into metabolizable compounds at increased rates by using proteins that act within a common degradation pathway co localized within a microcompartment in the form of an easily distributed dry powder. Removal of heavy metals, such as iron, from samples of tailings ponds water will be achieved by inducing the formation of iron nanoparticles, which can be removed together with the generated biomass. The rapid formation of fine clay sediments will be facilitated by the use of bacteria cell aggregates, increasing sedimentation rates from many decades to days or even hours. The kit will consist of either cell- free components or genetically modified organisms (GMO) that pose no threat to the environment as they will have been programmed with a method of rendering the cell inert and destroying its DNA once"

For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
Volume strategy is a special method to solve problems introduced by diffusion reactions. Consider a transport reaction S1->S2 in which the species S1 is moved from the first compartment with volume V1, to the second with volume V2. The rate constant is k but the rate law is not k*[S1]*V1, because the concentration conversion is needed. The correct expression is N*k*[S1]*V1. The volume strategy just uses N*V1 instead of V1 as the volume of the first compartment. To have a general definition, the volume of a compartment is defined as V*N1*N2, where:
V is the volume of the compartment itself;
N1 is the number of compartments located in its outside compartment;
N2 is the total number of its outside compartment
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
Chains in our Chain-Node model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those in the system.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: compare the first part of two chains by their partReference and partType in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or to the end of either chain. At this stage, besides partReference and partType, two parts are considered equal if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the"

Communication with Other Teams
It is natural for contestants to be curious about what their competitors are doing. The forum organized by NCTU provided a perfect opportunity for every team attended to satisfy their curiosity. During the Forum, we communicated with teams from universities all over China. Posters and presentations were made to introduce every team’s design and progress; questions were raised as well as helpful advices. Every one attended really touched the thrill of iGemer’s happiness, and got home fully load.
We are very lucky to have the opportunity to join the big family of iGEM and put our ideas into reality, and it is even luckier that we are able to witness the clash of ideas and the genesis of even crazier ideas. Collaboration is what makes this competition complicated but is also what makes it inspiring and long-lasting.

Aim: In this experiment we have tried to use jetPEI-Macrophage and jetPRIME     transfection reagent in order to transfect microglia cells (BV2) and     astrocyte cells (C8-D30), respectively, while using HEK-cell as a positive     control. The use of HEK cell-line as a positive control, is due to its     transfectability by the various techniques.
Importance: This experiment was carried out in parallel with experiments using     different methods of transfection (different reagents, calcium phosphate     and electrophoresis) in order to find an efficient way of inserting our plasmids into microglia for the continuation of the project.

Theoretical background:
jetPEI®-Macrophage allows DNA transfection of macrophages and     macrophage-like cells. It contains a mannose-conjugated linear     polyethylenimine that enhances binding to cells expressing mannose     receptors, such as macrophages. jetPEI®-Macrophage is able to condense DNA     into compact particles similarly to jetPEI®
jetPRIME® is a novel powerful transfection reagent based on a polymer     formulation manufactured at Polyplus-transfection®. jetPRIME® ensures     effective and reproducible DNA and siRNA transfection into mammalian cells.     jetPRIME® is extremely efficient on a wide variety of cell lines. This     powerful reagent only requires low amounts of nucleic acid per     transfection, hence resulting in very low cytotoxicity.
Procedure:
Day 1 - Splitting of C8-D30 cells to 6-well plate for experiment

Tyr-134 → Phe
The Thr-59 and Tyr-69 belongs to CDR H2, while Leu-113 and Tyr-134 belongs to CDR H3. Let’s see what happens after antibody design.
1.Thr-59 → Val
Figure 3. Energy before and after mutating Thr-59 to Val
Other terms of energy have minor influence
(Terms of Rosetta Energy Function can be found in principles )
As we all know, Thr has polar side chain, while Val has hydrophobic side chain. After mutating Thr-59 to Val, the solvation energy (Figure 3 fa_sol) has dropped dramatically, while the Van der Waals interaction energy (Figure 3 fa_atr & fa_rep, while calculating total energy, fa_rep should multiply by 0.55) has decreased a little. That means this mutation is in favor of the folding of protein, benefiting total energy.
2. Tyr-69 → Glu
This mutation results in notable changes in charge distribution. With negative electrification, Glu has accumulated negative charge. (Figure 4) Since the area surrounding residue 69 has positive electrical charge, the electrostatic energy has reduced. Calculating by the Rosetta energy function, the electrostatic energy is decreasing by 1.25 kcal/mol after the mutation.

(B)After mutation
3. Leu-113 → Trp & Tyr-134 → Phe
These two residues are on CDR H3. In fact, they are close to each other, although they seem separate in AHo Scheme residue numbering. More important, they are directly on the interface of VEGF and VEGF-scFv. The pentapeptide on the interface, Phe Phe Leu Pro Tyr, has been in placed of by Phe Phe Trp Pro Phe.

This area collected high ratio of aromatic amino acids. π–π stacking plays an important role in the stabilization of conformation. After mutation, the Leu-113 is replaced by Trp, which has an indolyl, an aromatic heterocyclic substituent"
Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of various types of technology, published dozens of specialized magazines, nearly a thousand kinds of monographs. Taiwan in recent years has also set up seven research centers of science and technology, and some universities also specifically recruit graduate students in science and technology, science and technology enterprises specializing in the recruitment of legal and technical director. At the same time, many countries are also strengthening the research and legislation of science and technology. Science and technology legislation, scientific research and specialized personnel training has become a global boom.
China also adopted the Popularization of science and technology in People's Republic of China in 2002, which shows that China is also attaching importance to the popularization of science and technology law. It has established a new mechanism from the angle of legislation and social promotion. It has also formed an atmosphere of popularization.
In my opinion, there is still a long way to go for the promotion of science and technology law, in which scientific research and technology development institutions, institutions of higher learning should become the main force of propaganda, such as through popular science activities, popular science publicity , held lectures and other measures to further expand the public understanding of science and technology work and support.
3. What legal developments have been made so far? What are the existing deficiencies, and if there any suggestion for Legislation in China?
So far, in the Constitution, civil law, administrative law, criminal law and other traditional jurisdictions had establish a large number of technical and legal norms in the legislation, but also carried out special legislation in the field of science and technology. Its main legal system can be divided into several aspects, such as scientific and technological progress law, science and technology contract system, scientific and technological achievement right protection and so on.
With the development of the times, China's science and technology legislation also need to improve. Such as legal gaps, some legislation is too principled and lack of operability, and some regulations are ineffective, many laws and regulations are issued in different departments in the process of reform, and therefore there are contradictory and repeated too much. Therefore, China's scientific and technological legal system construction should also continue to strengthen and perfect.
My proposal for this is: Our country should further speed up the process of scientific and technological legislation, targeted and complementary legal gaps, and further refine the relevant implementation details, make scientific and technological legislation more systematic, standardized, and adapt to the times.
4. Whether the genetically modified bacteria can be applied to human disease treatment？If so, what are the legal considerations?
With the advances in modern DNA manipulation technology, humans can modify bacterial DNA, thus affecting human health. Many bacteria have been modified to synthesize"
UPF-CRG_Barcelona,2016,Team:UPF-CRG Barcelona#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymatic pathways. However, our two aproaches were quite diferent. Sevilla’s team focused on velocity and straight-forwardness with a C script that took the input as text files and displayed the output as another text file, a log of the different concentrations of the different compounds over time. Visualitzation or post-processing of the data was left to the user, which made the program more modular, albeit less user friendly. Our approach, Polyenzime, was a bit widder in scope, incorporating inhibition reactions and source/sink nodes, and consisted on a GUI where the user could intuitively create and run the pathways, obtaining the evolution of the system in handy graphics without further ado.
Comparing the two prespectives on the same problem gave us the opportunity to further develop our approach, strengthing its downsides (implementation of a runge-kuta algorithm to make the integration more robust), and reinforcing the advantages (improving the user experience in a variety of ways). We could also interchange valuable feedback that lead to some bug-fixes and improvements. This would not have been possible without intensive comunication between the teams, and we thank the collegues at Sevilla for the patience and support trough our programming endavours.
With the wide array of topics iGEM comprises, finding another team with a common front to collaborate with may be difficult. We were lucky to have that opportunity, and we belive that the project has improved and gained context as a consequence.
In the image we can see a model of UPO-Sevilla’s team represented in our software.
Survey
We decided to conduct a survey so as to know what the opinion of the population was about our product. In that way we could adapt it to their needs and make some modifications trying to reduce their concerns.
The survey was conducted by using Typeform platform .You can check our survey out by clicking here .You can also go for the Spanish version by clicking here .We used Facebook and Twitter to spread the survey and finally,the survey was carried out by a total of 137 people from all around the world.
By analyzing the results we found out that our product was targeting a really common concern since 62% of respondents have a medium concern about suffering from cancer in the future and a 20% are considered to be also excessively concerned about that.
In addition, although there is not a safe value intake of red and processed meat, it has been recommended by the WHO (World Health Organization) to reduce it. Around 75% of respondents consumes red and processed meat 1-3 times per week or more and 8% and 20%"

The first quadrant was named B. Sub (B. subtilis) WB800, and another as DNAzyme. The remaining two quadrants were negative controls. 30 μL of E. coli DH5α in liquid media was pipetted to the quadrant labelled DH5α and a bacterial spreader was used to distribute the liquid culture within the quadrant. This process was repeated with the B. subtilis WB800 cultures on the plate with the labelled B. sub-quadrant. The plates were then incubated upside down for 36 hours at 37°C.
The next day, the DNAzyme, which was sent by team iGEM McMasterU in pellet form, was diluted to the concentration of 8 μM using 12.50 μL of autoclaved ddH2O. 5 μL of the DNAzyme solution was pipetted onto the E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 quadrants. 1 μL of DNAzyme was also pipetted onto the quadrants labelled as DNAzyme. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. A picture of the plates was taken under UV light.
Results and Discussion
In our first attempt, two sets of overnight cultures of E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 were made using different colonies. The cell density of these overnights was then calculated from OD600 measurements. This conversion was done using the Cell Culture Concentration from OD600 Calculator from Agilent Genomics.

Figure 5. Simplified diagrams of our detection plasmids.
Our designed inserts are not compatible with Biobrick assembly standard 10. The reason for this was that there were no plasmid backbones or hardly any other parts designed for S. cerevisiae in stock in the iGEM registry. Additionally, the characterization of the parts were lacking. The plasmid backbone we eventually chose was pRS415-GAL, as it was easily available to us, suitable for our purpose, and there was experience that it had previously worked well in S. cerevisiae . Our plan was to modify the best of our designed inserts to be compatible with Biobrick standard 10 (to have defined prefix and suffix) after testing and analyzing them.
Our plan to test the functionality of stress promoters is to use hydrogen peroxide to induce stress in yeast cells containing stress promoter plasmids, and measure the differences in YFP fluorescence intensities. From these results, we hope to obtain a linear relation between inducing hydrogen peroxide concentration and YFP intensity. These tests cannot be done with microcystin-LR, since it isn’t imported into the cell without the VL3 transporter, and thus doesn’t cause a strong enough response. All the same, as hydrogen peroxide is the main reactive oxygen species produced in stress caused by microcystin-LR in yeast cells, we planned to use this compound directly in our primary experiments. After proving that our sensor works with hydrogen peroxide, and finishing transporter implementation, we can then transform our stress promoter into cells with the VL3 transporter already integrated into their genome. This way, we could test our promoters with microcystin.
Modelling
We are going study our detection mechanism mathematically in order to obtain better understanding of it. Our plan is to create simplified molecular and mathematical models of our detection mechanism which will describe  how the transcription factors are affected and how they affect the regulation of our promoters under oxidative stress. Then, we will simulate these models with COPASI modelling software. We hope to validate our model with experimental results for each construct. In addition, we hope to determine theoretical detection thresholds and measurement accuracy estimates, as well as provide suggestions for optimal promoter design for future iterations of the project.
As modeling goes into great detail on subjects not as tightly related to the biological design of the project, it is presented in more detail in it’s own page .

Previous related projects - a review
In 2010 iGEM competition, Queens-Canada team submited halorhodopsin from H. salinarum as a biobrick and inserted this gene into C. elegans. However, it was not well characterized. This year, we are trying to clone halorhodopsin from N. pharaonis, which has already been successfully introduced and proved to perform complete light cycles in E. coli , to our biobrick system1. We aim to characterize the efficiency of this halorhodopsin to be a well-documented biobrick and a useful tool in E. coli .
 
In previous iGEM projects, various light sensors have been developed, including red light sensor (UT Austin, 2004) and blue light sensor (University of Edinburgh, 2010). They are all light-induced fusion transcription factors that trigger gene expression under the control of specific promoters, facilitating simply on/off switch and light-coupled communication. However, our design makes halorhodopsin not only a dynamically tunable light sensor – by coupling with chloride sensitive promoters (e.g. Pgad), but also an energy converter – by converting solar energy as chemical potential and further turned it into electricity. Our project would provide a wilder scope of applications from signal transduction and gene regulation to energy harvesting.

Mainly sponsored by:"
Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#HumanPractice#Handbook_-_-_TEXT.html," the o-16s ribosome and o-RBS, so if we put the device at the upstream of the target genes, we can control the expression of target genes precisely. At the same time,  RBS sequences are necessary in almost every cell,therefore an extensive application can be performed by  our o-ribosomal.
Our teammate is performing gel-cutting.
Not only can our project  regulate gene expression  and prevent genetic pollution, but also it will not consume any extra nutrients, and  have no influence on the normal life activities of bacteria.
On the other hand, different RBS sequences can influence the efficiency of the translation, so we can use a series of RBS sequences to regulate  gene expression with a gradient rate. The possibility of genetic pollution can also be reduced in this accurate process.
Finally,  the o-ribosomal devices can be used to establish a orthogonal system, in which cells  have specific o-ribosomal devices instead of the original ones. Being different from other ordinary cells, they cannot be expressed in normal cells even if the target genes from orthogonal system spread out,which leads to  a strong protection against genetic pollution. It is obvious that genetic pollution  can be completely prevented in this orthogonal system. There were also several projects which were related to gene expression regulation in iGEM last year. For example, the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team designed a set of Codon-Switches that regulate target protein biosynthesis (translation).In their rare-codon switch, the translation of the protein can be finely turned up/down with the control of rare tRNA amount, aaRS that charges the rare tRNA and rare codons. Besides they also made other two switches that could be turned on/off without background noise. One called the stop-codon switch was to use stop codon as the controlling element. The other one called the initial-codon switch was to use any codon but the original start codon to initiate translation. What's more, the projects of the BYU Provo team, USTC-China team, Peking-R team and some other teams were all related to gene expression regulation too. We believe that maybe the principles of these projects can also be used in the prevention to genetic pollution. So if you are interested in this, you can know more through their wiki.
As iGEM teams are from different countries which may have different regulations for biosaftey. So on the one hand, it's necessary to collect information and make standard biosafety rules for basic synthetic biology experiments. On the other hand, our simple biosafety handbook cannot be suitable"

To get a better idea of how can we improve and move ahead with our project,we first set out to talk to some of the researchers and professors of various departments, both inside our institute and outside. Following is a summary of the talk that we had :
Talk With Prof. Shaunak Sen
Dr. Shaunak Sen is a Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering at our Institute, specialising in Control Theory.  When we started brainstorming over our project, we reached out to him for advice about square wave oscillators that we were planning to design. It was he who suggested to us the idea of using an oscillator feeding into a toggle switch in order to generate Square Waves. He further introduced to us the work Dr. Richard M Murray had done on oscillators with ring topologies. He also told us about trying out relaxation oscillators in order to generate a better Square wave response.
Talk With Prof. James Gomes
Dr. James Gomes is a Professor at the School of Biological Sciences, IIT Delhi. His research mainly revolves around the field of Systems Biology. Once we had decided the topology for our project, we discussed with him at length about possible improvements and also got a lot of help from him in our Square wave Modelling. However, he wasn’t very convinced by our topology and rather suggested to us to use 'build up and fire' kind of oscillators for better generation of Square Waves.
Talk With Prof. Vivekananda Perumal
Dr. Perumal is a Molecular Biologist at the School of Biological Sciences, IIT Delhi. Our talk with him was indeed very helpful to us in the execution of our project. It was he who suggested to us the"

Ran FVA on WT WM1788 and N2 fixing WM1788.  Starting comparing the flux range overlaps between the two outputs using Excel.
- Experiments From Jun 12
Strange result
L_exp9
Observed CO2 and H2O export fixed for N2 fixing WM1788.  Started checking pathways (glycolysis, PPP, TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism, reactions involving flavodoxin) to find out why.
- Experiments From Jun 15
Compared flux of N2 fixing of WM1788
L_exp10
Compared flux ranges of N2 fixing and wild type WM1788 within main metabolic pathways (glycolysis, PPP, TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism) as well as within reactions that included oxidized or reduced flavodoxin.
Main result- pyruvate synthase (produces acetyl coA from pyruvate) in the N2 fixing strain has a higher flux than in wild type.  Additionally, many reactions within TCA cycle have a lower flux in the N2 fixing strain than in wild type (this is expected- N2 fixing WM1788 should have a depressed metabolism), except for malate dehydrogenase (produces oxaloacetate from malate).
- Experiments From Jun 16
Continued analysis of WM1788
L_exp11
Continued analysis of differences between wild type and N2 fixing WM1788.
Determined neither strain is using the glyoxylate shunt.  Performed comparisons of all reactions involving malate, oxaloacetate, acetyl coA, and pyruvate.  Malate oxidase (reaction at equilibrium) has a much more negative flux in N2 fixing WM1788 than in wild type.  Seems that oxaloacetate from malate dehydrogenase (higher flux in N2) feeds malate oxidase reaction to produce more malate and oxygen in the N2 fixing strain.

Exploring relationship between pyruvate and acetyl coA in N2 fixing strain versus wild type

Identified two other reactions containing both acetyl coA and pyruvate (besides pyruvate synthase), however both have the same flux in both N2"

BBa_K1508003 (IIA(Glc) + double terminator)
This biobrick contains gene coding for  IIA(Glc) (BBa_K1508002), followed by double terminator (BBa_B0015). IIA(Glc) is glucose-specific phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate : glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS). This circuit inserted to the upstream part of plasmid Bba_J04450. We hypothesized that by over-expressing the enzyme, more glucose can be uptook compared to normal condition.
Coding
BBa_K1508002 (IIA(Glc) - E.coli glucose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA)
Phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a major carbohydrate active -transport system, which is executed by a cascade of protein rally. For glucose uptake, IIA(Glc) is the only enzyme specific to glucose transport. We measure the concentration of glucose in the medium using catabolite repression mechanism toward lacI promoter activity upstream of a reporter gene, mRFP. We expect by over-expressing IIA(Glc) in E. coli, we will obtain different range of glucose standard curve in our measurement system.

We want to do this in order to get more practical experience and have a good time with other engaged students. Some of us have never been in the lab before, and others feel that the scheduled lab-exercises in our studies are just too predictable. At this point, we wish to design a project that will span the subjects of synthetic biology, characterization, mathematical modeling and simulation of a biological system as well as a broader outreach to the general public.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," toxin production using quorum sensing and subpopulations ?
What are important parameters for the optogenetic killswitch to function optimally?
Will BeeT be capable of surviving in sugar water ?
What is the best application strategy for BeeT?
Population Dynamics
For the final product, BeeT, we intend to use toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, also called Cry toxins. However, these toxins are also harmful to our chassis, resulting in a reduction of toxin production when it is needed to kill the mites. To counteract this effect we envision the use of quorum sensing that activates Cry toxin production only when there is a large quantity of BeeT present. Ideally, BeeT is able to produce Cry toxin over a long period to improve its effectiveness against mites. However, if an entire population of BeeT is synchronized, we hypothesize that only a single burst of Cry toxin will take place before both the BeeT and mites are killed. Thus, this system will not be maximally effective over long time periods. To accomplish this we need multiple subpopulations of BeeT: some producing BeeT while others are recuperating. To help understand this complex system we use dynamic modeling.
Quorum Sensing Circuit
Quorum sensing is a cell-cell communication system. The detection of chemical molecules allows the bacteria to sense the presence of other bacteria.  In this way the bacteria control gene expression in response to changes in cell number 1, 4 .   This process is achieved through the production and release of an Acylated Homoserine Lactone (AHL) autoinducer An autoinducer is a signal molecule related to cell density. .   The AHL can diffuse from one cell to the other. There are many different types of autoinducers in quorum sensing systems. When sensed, the autoinducer can trigger other cells to produce more autoinducers.
The quorum sensing system consists of two proteins: LuxI and LuxR. LuxR is constitutively expressed, together with AHL it forms a complex which activates the transcription of a toxin. In our case we use the detection protein Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) to follow the behavior of the system 2 . LuxI encodes an AHL synthase. AHL is a molecule that can diffuse freely through the cell membrane, and in this way travels from cell to cell. LuxR encodes for a protein and together they form a complex. In a natural system the LuxR-AHL complex controls transcription of LuxI, forming a positive feedback loop that increases the amount of AHL in the system "
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Human Practices#Outreach#Campus Events_-_-_TEXT.html," team will be participating in over the next couple of weeks.  Upcoming symposiums include the BHSC Symposium in October and the University of Calgary Student Union Research Symposium in November.
BACHELOR OF HEALTH SCIENCES (BHSc) RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM: OCTOBER 1ST
The University of Calgary iGEM team was fortunate to give poster and oral presentations at the Bachelor of Health Sciences (BHSc) Research Symposium on October 1st, 2009. The goal of this annual symposium is to get young undergraduate students with no research experience interested in research by showcasing summer projects. Although this symposium was important as a means of practicing presentation and poster skills for iGEM, we also used this opportunity to recruit students for UofC iGEM 2010.
As few students knew exactly what we were doing, our mission was to get the word out about iGEM. We did this by first explaining iGEM and Synthetic Biology, and then by delving into the four aspects of our project: lab, modeling, Second Life and human practices. Students seemed quite surprised that undergraduates were able to manipulate DNA to produce cool functions in the wetlab. Moreover, our Second Life initiative was showcased and received quite a lot of interest and great feedback because of the innovated platform to teach students about synthetic biology. We also let the students attending the symposium know about the academic backgrounds and interests of all of our members. They found it quite surprising that most of our members are either 1st or 2nd year students (this seemed quite young!) from not only health sciences, but engineering, computer science and kinesiology as well.
The UofC iGEM team stood out from the other research projects because we showed the students that research doesn’t have to be strictly science. They understood that although iGEM is a competition in synthetic biology, it is moving away from simply biology and requires teams to pursue other initiatives (such as outreach and ethics) within the field to be recognized as successful projects. We received a great number of questions about our project and the role of every individual in our project. The amount of interest about iGEM demonstrated by the undergraduates far surpassed anything we had expected. We hope that we got the message across that the UofC iGEM team strives to create a multifaceted project and that in order to achieve this goal, we require enthusiastic students from all types of academic backgrounds. There’s no doubt that our participation in the BHSc Research Symposium will increase the number of students wanting to be a part of U"

ZJU-China,2017,Team:ZJU-China#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," from Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24. We put these four genes, phlABCD, under the control of a strong promoter which is present in the plasmid backbone we used. This backbone( BBa_K525998 ) was obtained from the part registry. We call this new biobrick 2,4-DAPG PhlABCD Cluster ( BBa_K2207997 ). Upon transformation of this biobrick into BL21 E. coli cells and induced with IPTG，our engineered bacteria will synthesize DAPG.
Result
We utilize the High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method to detect the biosynthesized DAPG. Luckily, we finally detected the DAPG from E.coli cells as Fig. 2. shows.
Fig.2 Results of DAPG detecting by HPLC
In this way, we successfully confirmed that this biobrick can work in E.coli.
Application Prospect
We have confirmed that the biobrick can work smoothly in E.coli, and the amount of biosynthesized DAPG is considerable. Therefore, we believe this part has promising application prospect.
DAPG can act as signal molecules to affect the structure and function of the relative protein (phlF). Therefore, we can make use this biobrick to construct a new type of transcriptional switch together with phlF protein and phlO operator. We will have other choice other than tet system. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation is rapid, so this set of system has strong potential to be applied to several signal transduction pathways that requires higher sensitivity.
DAPG can act as antibiotic, and be toxic to certain organisms. So we can use this biobrick to construct a type of kill switch for some organisms together with phlE( BBa_ K2207031 ), which is codes for an efflux pump[8].
DAPG can act as induction factors of ISR. The plants' autoimmune mechanism can be activated under the presence of the DAPG, which will lead the plants to their prime state. Thus, the plants will have stronger resistance to the following diseases and invasion.

The current perception about the storing of sensitive information
What is the impression of sending information through conventional means
How the nationality influences the perception of digital and physical storing of information
To achieve the aims of the survey mentioned above, we planned to    reach as many people as possible from different countries and different    ages. By looking to previous surveys conducted for former iGEM Teams,                 we have found out that most of the surveys    carried on were mostly in English, thus their    results would be limited exclusively to English-speakers. However, how    about the people that use social media but do not speak English?
CryptoGErM is also interested in their opinion! They are    important to us!
We invited iGEM Teams to share the survey on their social media in    order to achieve as many people as possible. In addition to that, we collaborated    with iGEM Teams around the world that translated the original survey to    their native languages. We have versions in English , Chinese and Spanish .
The following map shows the nationalities of the participants    involved in the present survey:
Map 1. Nationalities of the survey respondents
Firstly, we asked our survey respondents which is the most frequent    method that they use to send sensitive information. As depicted in    Graph 1, 89% of the people send information through digital means    (Email, social media and instant messaging apps) Likely because of the    speed and accessibility that these communication means provide to the    user when compared towards physical sending (Regular Post).
In addition to that, 50% of the people who answered our survey trust    sending their information through regular post and email, while 33%    trust only one between the two mentioned methods. 17% of the population    does not trust sending information by any of the methods mentioned above.    This is summarized in Graph 2
Graph 1. Communication means used frequently by the survey respondents to      send sensitive information
Graph 2. We asked      our survey respondents if they trust sending information through      email and regular post
From the two questions above, we formulated an initial conclusion:    Survey respondents use and trust digital and physical means for sending of information.
However, what would happen if they might need to send highly secure    information. Would they trust current and conventional methods such as a    letter in regular post or an email?    How would their initial conclusion change when the information that has to be    sent would change from hardly secret to highly secret?

What is the iGEM Competition about?
iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is the premiere Synthetic Biology competition organized by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), it is aimed at undergraduates from leading institutions across the globe.
The competition began in 2003 with just 5 teams, by 2009 there were 112 teams and for 2010, 180 teams are predicted to take part.
How does it work?
“Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells.”
“Participants will all specify, design, build, and test simple biological systems made from standard, interchangeable biological parts.”
What is Synthetic Biology?
“An emerging scientific community that is defining a new cross-disciplinary field called Synthetic Biology. Synthetic Biology is fundamentally about the union of Biology and Engineering. iGEM will introduce you to the fundamental ideas of Synthetic Biology and will give you the opportunity to perform cutting edge research in a field that is continually evolving.”

Overnights were first prepared in 0uM and 1uM AHL concentrations with appropriate antibiotics in LB media in a rotating incubator at 37C.  The 1uM AHL overnight was diluted 1:100 into fresh LB media with appropriate antibiotics and with 1uM AHL to serve as the positive control.  The overnight with no AHL was diluted 1:100 into fresh LB media with appropriate antibiotics and either 0nM, 0.1nM, 1nM or 10nM AHL.  The 0nM AHL solution served as the negative control.  Each hour after dilution, 1.5 mL samples were taken and put immediately on ice and stored at 4C to create triplicate 0.5mL samples for use in the Beta-Galactosidase assay.
Cell growth curves as measured by OD600 were obtained and are plotted below.
Figure 1: OD600 versus Hour
There is no substantial difference between the positive and negative controls.  The growth curve associated with the 0.1nM solution is also substantially the same as the controls.  In contrast, the growth curves for 1nM and 10nM are considerably delayed compared to the controls.  However, after 14 hours, all solutions under study have approached stationary phase.
The Beta-Galactosidase Activity (measured in Miller Units) is plotted below.
Figure 2: Beta-Galactosidase Activity versus Hour
As observed in prior work (e.g.,   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145315/ ) the high levels (>20,000) of Beta-Galactosidase activity associated with AHL concentrations of 1nM and 10nM are correlated with delayed cell growth.   While the negative control has a relatively low level of Beta-Galactosidase activity, as expected, it is remarkable to note that the positive control has a lower level still.  In a quorum sensing context, we might make sense of this as follows: the constant presence of a high-level of AHL does not require the same action as a sudden change in AHL.  In this case, some refractory mechanism would                         appear reasonable.  The unit-step change of AHL concentration to 0.1nM results in increased activity that attenuates to negative control levels after approximately 5 hours, consistent with being on the low-end of the AHL scale.  In                         contrast"
