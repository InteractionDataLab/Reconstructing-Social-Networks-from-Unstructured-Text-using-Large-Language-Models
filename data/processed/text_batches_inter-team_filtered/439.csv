Combining control over climatic conditions and Synthetic Biology, ChatterPlant intends to increase the total control of any crop in each moment through distinct color protein expressions. Nevertheless, consumers wish to find fruits and vegetables with the best possible organoleptic properties. In this context, our project is based on sentinel plants. With the aim of controlling those conditions that humans can resolve (e.g. nutritional deficiency), we propose a diagonal system of sentinel plants in order to cover the maximum possible area (Figure 5). Sentinels plants will be able to warn us in order to modify some condition (eg. Nutritional solution improvement).
Figure 5. Graphic representation of a possible sentinel plants distribution.
However, pathogen infections are the major cause of diseases in greenhouse crops . Being aware of its repercussions, our team proposes that all plants located in the ChatterBox incorporate the pathogen detection system to increase detection control. Bearing that in mind, we resolved to use a steroid injector in order to trigger color code genetic circuit in order to accelerate the needed corrective measures.
AND GATE
Tightly regulated promoters are essential to construct more reliable and predictable genetic circuits for Synthetic Biology. Weakly expression of any interested gene is an undesired effect which is usually caused by promoter leakiness. We resolved to design an AND gate because it is a digital logic gate that use logical conjunction -two both inputs are required in order to produce a specific output-. In our work, only when stress signals appear, and RDF is expressed by external stimuli, colour protein is synthesized, and we will be able to detect it.
Furthermore, the recombinase logic gate (without gp3) operates as a memory circuit and the input promoters do not have to be turned on at the same time for the output to respond. For instance, for the AND gate the inputs can be ON at different times and never simultaneously and the output will still be ON (Fernandez-Rodriguez, Yang, Gorochowski, Gordon & Voigt, 2015). To surmount this issue, Endy and co-workers suggested that rewritable logic could be designed by continuously expressing PhiC31 recombinase to hold one state and then an external input is connected to the expression of gp3 in order to produce color protein.
Spatial and/or developmental controlled gene expression of the color protein can be achieved using a recombinase logic AND gate.

Pharmaceuticals
Many clinically used drugs are derived from fungi. A few notable examples include the antibiotic penicillin, immunosuppressant cyclesporin A, and the statins lovastatin and squalestatin, which act to reduce and remove low density lipoproteins from blood vessels and lower chance of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Fungi are extremely useful in biotechnology efforts and pharmaceutical research because they are able to utilize many unique metabolic pathways to produce a wide array of bioactive compounds capable of producing many positive pharmacological effects [1]. The biocompounds synthesized by our organism, Ganoderma lucidum, are capable of regulating the immune system, inhibiting platelet aggregation, reducing blood pressure, and lowering levels of cholesterol and sugars. In addition, Ganoderma lucidum has the potential to be used against the Human Immuno Virus (HIV), exhibits anti-tumor activity, and can propagate anti-diabetic effects. [2]
Ganoderma lucidum also has many immuno-modulating effects by activating T-cells and macrophages, which act as the body's first line of defense by releasing cytokines, nitric oxides (NO), and other mediators. These cytokines and NOs are important chemical messengers for inducing biological responses. In the case of Human Immuno Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Ganoderma lucidum produces many natural products that can serve as anti-HIV agents. Triterpenoids such as lucidenic acid O and lucidenic lactone inhibit HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase, an enzyme encoded by HIV to aid"

When this kind of probiotic is been prepared to be released the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board and the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics are often involved and give out statements and input in regards to the applications for clinical trials.  There all pharmaceuticals that contain any modified organism need to be labeled with “This product contains (a) genetically modified organism(s)”, and all of the trials regarding GM pharmaceuticals are posted on the Swedish Medical Products Agency’s website . In Europe, the following companiy working with engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge: ActoBio Therapeutics (part of Intrexon) in Belgium.
United States
Engineered probiotics are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, as they are neither a food nor a drug. As a result, they currently do not require large clinical trials like other drugs in America.
The followeing companies working with engineered probiotics has come to our knowlegde: Azitra , Synlogic and ZBiotics .
In Brazil, there was no law that regulates genetically engineered probiotics, but in 2018 ANVISA, the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, opened up the public consultation and now genetically engineered probiotics were added to the regulation. Besides, there is no companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics.
With this research, we were able to see that there is a growing movement of engineered probiotics mostly in the U.S., but that there still is a lack of laws and regulation all over the world to regulate these products before they can reach the market and the final consumers.
Jiangnan China
Besides the research about probiotics in China, we collaborated with Jiangnan China by helping them with the safety of their project. They needed help in designing a kill switch and, because we were both working with probiotics, they asked us some ideas. We shared with them information about our kill switch and also other strategies used for biocontainment.

Their whole idea of a database is really cool though, as it means it’ll be so much easier for future teams to look at relevant past projects, to find out what has previously been done and what can be built upon.
It was the first session back in the lab after doing the Interlab study too. Most of the team - Dan, Pablo, Eloise, Hannah, Andy and Jack - were in the lab at some point today. They resuspended Killer Red DNA from the iGEM parts we had been sent, then attempted to transform it into competent cells. They made 9 plates for incubation - positive and negative controls, 3 chloramphenicol resistance plates and 4 ampicillin resistance plates.
Beyond that, the day was mostly focused on designing parts and designing experiments.

Dr John Love, one of our lead supervisors, came back from a conference trip today. We met with him this morning (at 8am!!!) in Costa (so at least we could get some coffee) to discuss what we’ve done so far on lab work, human practises, wiki and modelling, and get some feedback.
He gave some incredibly useful advice on how we could expand our lab work more, looking at different ways to characterise the kill switches. In regards to human practises, he loves the board game (and gave us funding for 16 more physical copies), and suggested using surveys to quantify the impact of the board game on the students using it. He also agreed to take part in ‘Desert Island… Science?’ which is fantastic!
We’ll be meeting with Dr Love and Dr James, our two lead supervisors, in sub teams next Tuesday, so it’s time to start finalising who fits into what roles so we can organise those teams.
The KillerRed transformations from yesterday were unsuccessful - there was either no growth of 1-2 colonies on all the plates. However, we believe we know the error - we attempted to transform 1μl of DNA, which may be too low of a DNA concentration, so the transformations will be reattempted with 5μl.

Beijing Institute of Technology
During the meeting,we exchanged our experience and discussed with each other pleasantly.Moreover both sides introduced the project of iGEM in previous years and conducted in-depth communication about selection, training, management and inheritance of the team.In addition,we also talked about the considerations of the participation in the United States and the process.of iGEM in 2018.
Accompanied by the captain of BIT-iGEM of 2017 named Anyi Li, our delegation visited the relevant laboratories attentively. In this process , a heated discussion on the laboratory's usage criteria,inspection of the instrument,maintenance of the instrument and training methods of laboratory skills was held
University of Chinese Academy of Sciences
The captain of 2018 in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the team members of 2017 exchanged experience cordially with us by the form of a salon. In this process, we were harvested with valuable suggestions about the direction of the topic selection, arrangement of the experiments , team relationship, etc. What's more,we established a good friendship with them..
Beijing Normal University
First of all, our delegation visited the dedicated and independent laboratory with a small conference room belonging to iGEM in the School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Beijing Normal University. Our two sides conducted in-depth discussions on the history and the development of the team.
Then, the members of the iGEM team of Beijing Normal University and the team director named Xudong Zhu communicated about iGEM-related situation, common problems and coping methods with us.And Xudong Zh also gave us some valuable life experience.
Finally, our teacher Sun Dongchang had a deeper discussion with Dr.Zhu on project innovation,the train of team spirit, and the management model of the iGEM from college.

New developments in tissue engineering are closely linked to stem cells, stem cell differentiation and cultivation of stem cells. Yan Chen et al. and others (see ""stem cells"") have shown that only few genes are responsible for proliferation and differentiation of cells in vivo, in situ and in vitro. A big challenge is for example the establishment of a vascular system of blood vessels to supply tissues with nutritions and oxygen. Virtually any tissue larger than 0,1 mm needs such a vascular system [6] . One of the factors that leads to the creation of such blood vessels is the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). It has been shown that its expression is controllable using the Toolkit of iGEM - Team Freiburg 2013.
Another problem is the lack of knowledge about the composition of growth factors, extracellular molecules and scaffold driving the proliferation and differentiation of different tissues. The possibility to finetune gene networks may be crucial in prospective research.
Our toolkit enables researchers around the world to get a better idea of complex intra- and intercellular networks. The uniCas toolkit is a first step towards the goal of understanding and ultimatively controlling cell fate.

Introducing SLIM to the US market - perspectives and considerations.
by Lars Øvlisen, 2012
Obesity and the western implications
The creation of SLIM (Sucrose limitation and inulin metabolization) has opened a wide variety of possible uses. Sequelae of obesity now hold the position of being one of the most urgently growing health and financial problems of western civilization. The growing problem is especially visible in North America where more than two thirds of the population is overweight and one third is obese*. The negative impacts of obesity include health-related diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. In conjunction with these health issues, general psychological wellbeing, as well as actual psychological diseases, is also of important focus when looking at the impacts of obesity. The increasing financial burden related to sequelae of obesity includes medical costs spawned by the direct implications of health-related diseases, but equally important is it to recognize second stage costs in form of absenteeism, presenteeism, disability and premature mortality.
The goal of SLIM and ideas for implementation
The goal of SLIM is to be able to function as an accelerate of weight loss and could therefore be considered a great candidate as a supplement for currently active weight loss programs. Conversion of sucrose to inulin is the primary product of SLIM, but the effect of use also exhibits a positive byproduct in the form of sustaining a higher quantity of fibers in the stomach and intestines than normal. The possible implementations for SLIM are many, but the nature of the product guides it towards the market for consumer foods. Food products involved in common western mealtimes could be ideal entry points for the implementation of the SLIM product. This includes, but is not limited to yogurt, white bread, pancakes, dairy products, cereal, cake/biscuit products and food ingredient products. Implementing SLIM in daily consumed and well recognized food products could give the producing companies an easily created additional value for their existing product repertoire or create a basis for a whole new line of SLIM incorporated products. In either way the producing company would have the freedom of exploiting SLIM induced possibilities in their company’s products by introducing the possibility of a healthier choice and thereby obtaining a very important strategic competitive advantage compared to their respective market competitors. Utilizing the capabilities of SLIM, the soda industry could have its whole playing field changed. Modern diet soda drinks have frequently been subject to discussions concerning the possible ill effects of ing"

Team
iGEM EPFL is a melting pot of specialties and eccentric personalities. A computer scientist, a chemist and 7 bio-engineers have come together to test out wild hypotheses and spend countless hours in the lab. Tearing their hair out when they fail and running victory laps around the campus with each success.
Over time the team has become more efficient and cohesive, but that took time… The eccentric and sometimes larger than life personalities of each member has wrought some particular situations. Situations that make fun conversations around a beer, something that the team might be a little too fond of.

The presentations started out great and many interesting talks were given, most of them focused on foundational science. The food we got in the breaks was very tasty and together with a nice big coffee, we were ready for the next speakers. When the talks were over everyone met in the lobby and then wandered around looking at the different posters, asking questions and taking notes.
Over the course of four days the conference offered talks and presentations from all corners of the synbio field, ranging from research results and new techniques to ethics, jurisdiction and safety issues. We had the opportunity to talk to many different people, including Drew Endy, Megan Palmer, Tobias Erb, John Glass and the iGEM Headquarter.

We even organized a small meet-up with three other iGEM Teams attending the conference. There we presented our projects to each other and also to interested people, like Richard Kitney from imperial college, who gave us great feedback on our project and our presentational style.

But the conference itself wasn’t the only place you could connect with interesting minds. After the talks and the poster sessions, we set out to explore the city and its culture together with a few other people from various countries. From Chinatown and little India to the botanical garden and Orchard Road, this city does not fail to amaze. In the evening we enjoyed the exotic food and talked about the presentations we were most interested in and the possible future of the field. ￼

 3 . Callobration  with NEU-China
On August, 2018, our team established a connection with iGEM group of NEU-China-A and thus a couple of video conferences have been made so far. The two teams introduced their own projects in detail; the project of NEU-China was to design a biological system against IBD and prevent CRC by using engineered probiotics. Since the concentration of NO in the intestines of IBD patients was about 100 times higher than that of normal people;  NO molecules were chosen as inflammatory signals, and probiotics (Nissle 1917) were selected as chassis organisms. The project consisted of two sets of devices, one of which was an anti-inflammatory equipment, including a sensor for detecting inflammatory signals, an effective enhancer and an effector secreting interleukin 10 (il-10). Another one was an anti-cancer device,which is able to express a kind of myrosinase from cruciferous vegetables by virtue of engineering probiotics. Meanwhile, it can transfer glucosinolate, a natural ingredient in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. Such a kind of product was a type of organic molecule with cancer-fighting ability and at the same time it could inhibit oxidative stress. Similarly, it could work against intestinal inflammation. In addition, we used cold shock kill switches (cold shock expression Lysis and maz-ef) to prevent our engineer bacteria from escaping into the environment and causing DNA contamination.
During exchange of project experience with each other, we learned that NEU-China-A had a little bit of a problem in one of the plasmid insertion experiments, so they asked us for help and wanted us to conduct the construction experiment of secreting the yebf-homoil10 plasmid. Our counterpart and we made it clear about what we were going to cooperate followed by three video meetings. NEU-China-A helped us carry out experiments on optimizing the conditions of prokaryotic expression of CSCA protein and purifying expression. In a similar way, we helped NEU-China-A perform fragment-linking experiment. NEU-China-A provided us with original plasmid of PCDF-Duet1 (dry powder tube), taught us to overlap the secretion label Yebf (from BL21"
BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," DH5α, and added arabinose to induce the expression of recombinase. When the OD600 is about 0.6 which means the bacteria is at the log phase, we made it competent for electroporation transformation.
2. Preparation of donor fragment
We designed homologous arms with the length of 50bp and 500 bp. The short one was designed on the primer, while the long arm was constructed through over-lap extension PCR                                     (OE-PCR).
After several times of try-error, we confirmed the comparatively optimal condition for lambda Red recombination. The target site is LacI and the host is DH5α. The homologous arm of 50 bp is enough for recombination.
Using the pKD3 as template, we added the cat expression cassette behind the testing parts, the whole donor fragment was sandwiched by 50bp left and right homologous arm.
Fig.2Four testing circuits used as our donor fragment
Fig.3 DNA Agarose Gel electrophoresis of donor fragments
3. Transformed the donor fragment through electroporation into the competent cell we prepared before
After transformation, we observed clones on the chloramphenicol plates. We selected the positives clones through colony PCR.
Fig.4 Recombination model and the sites of verifying primers
According to our design, the donor fragment is about 2000 bp, while the substituted fragment on genome is 1083bp, which means the successful integration will result in over 1000 bp increasing of length on the locus of LacI. We used the verifying primers to test whether we have successfully integrated these donor fragments.
Fig.5 The positive clones are 1~7, separately indicating the testing circuits above, and 8 is the negative control whose template is the original genome without any integration.
Compared with the negative control with no integration occurred, the colony PCR showed that we have successfully integrated the four circuits into the LacI locus of genome.
Site-directed promoter mutation
We have two combinations of inhibitor and ""in-promoter"": TetR-PTet, CI-PR. The strength of ""in-promoter"" will decide the expression level of killer gene. Directly applied these two combinations, we got the initial threshold. In order to adjust the threshold, we planned to mutate the ""in-promoter"" and got mutants with various strengths. We chose PTet as our target promoter. Through literature research, we chose the -35 region as our mutation region. We mainly used RFP to indicate the promoter strength in our wet experiment.

Amsterdam,2012,Team:Amsterdam#practices#results_-_-_TEXT.html,", but these risks should not impede progression”, she continued. On the question whether SB required a new legislative framework, she answered that a new framework would probably only hinder scientists and companies, without improving the current risk assessment. According to dr. van der Vlugt, each GMO should be assessed by a specific analysis on the genes introduced in that GMO. This way the risk assessment is built on contemporary knowledge, without having to replace the current biosafety framework.
Controlled environmental release of GMOs
GMOs could threaten the environment if they release hazardous gene products. Therefore these GMOs should be analyzed for so called potentially hazardous gene products (PHGPs). Examples of PHGPs are: protein toxins, gene products and sequences that are involved in genome rearrangements, gene products involved in apoptosis or activated proto-oncogenes. GMOs that carry a construct that may encode for a PHGP are handled with extreme precaution, until the risks of the specific construct have been assessed. [1]
Points of action
Since our Cellular Logbook system contains genes of which there products have a role in genome rearrangements (the M.ScaI methyltranserase and a Zinc Finger), we included a little risk assessment in the design process of our Cellular Logbook.
Human Outreach
We had two main goals concerning public engagement and human outreach:
1. Introducing SB to the general public and engaging in a dialogue.
We approached a broad audience by:
Featuring in a documentary that will be broadcasted next year in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Participating on a national art, music and science festival, named Discovery Festival .
2. Creating awareness amongst students of the two universities of Amsterdam (UvA and VU).
Young, bright minded scientist earn to get acquainted with the exciting and promising field of SB. Especially, since we have noticed that only a little group of students in Amsterdam ever heard about SB and iGEM, we felt called upon to change this. We decided to do this in two ways:
Giving a short interactive presentation to first year life science students, during the introduction week of the universities.
By press releases in the online and print version of the universities magazines.
Discovery Festival
The Discovery Festival is all about experiencing new things in the form of art, music and science. It will be held on the 28th of September in 3 major Dutch cities: Rotterdam, Eindhoven and Amsterdam. The general theme of the Discovery Festival 2012 is Do It Yourself (DIY).

Transcription:
An extensive literature survey revealed that it is difficult to predict transcription rate, particularly combined with the proper promoter dependence. It is even near impossible without good wet-lab data.
A recent review by Shiue and Prather (2012) describes this problem in the following way: “due to the large sequence space and relative lack of understanding regarding polymerase-promoter interactions, the development of such predictive models remains a daunting task”. Also recent discussions on stochastic gene expression suggest that reliable, quantitative predictions of mRNA production are a daunting task.
In the past, many iGEM teams predicted their transcription rate using a formula introduced by NTU-Singapore in 2008 :
We fear that this formula is not a proper representation of transcription rate for a number of reasons :
The reference claiming an average transcription speed of 70 nt/s is no longer available. We tried to search for an average transcription rate ourselves and we can’t seem to find realistic values.
This formula does not take into account promoter strength. This is remarkable, because the strength of a promoter is a measure for how many times a transcript is initiated. (Watson et al., Molecular Biology of the Gene, 7th edition). The stronger your promoter, the more transcripts are initiated, the more the gene is transcribed in time and thus the higher transcription rate.
Gene length, aka the number of nucleotides involved, could influence transcription rate. The longer the gene, the higher the chance that the polymerase starts proofreading, slowing down the transcription rate. We did not find any reference in literature incorporating gene length as an important transcription rate parameter.
Summarized, we would strongly suggest to other iGEM teams to refrain from using this formula, because it is not a realistic representation of the transcription rate.
In our case, we observed most uncertainty in the transition from transcription to mRNA production. As an alternative to the modelled mRNA production step, we tried to determine in vivo mRNA concentrations using qPCR. This means that we will drop formulas [1.A] and [1.B]. If you want to know more on how we tackled the qPCR, please go to our WETLAB part .
Translation:
Initiation is usually the most important rate-determining step of the translation process (McCarthy and Gualerzi, 1990). Combined with the fact that there is a negligible chance for premature disassembly of the ribosome and mRNA, only the rate of translation initiation has to be known to determine the rate of translation .

Another knotty problem is the resource for gene cloning. Along with the development of genome-based technologies, the whole genome sequences of more and more organisms are realized. Thus, directly cloning genes from the genome is feasible. However, in my opinion, the concept of biobricks proposed by iGEM competitions is more feasible to those amateurs: sufficient and precise information about the design, sequence, function and so on of standardized parts would free the biohackers from the suffering of searching appropriate functional genes from genome-wide scale and designing the proper primers to clone them. In addition, the standardized method of cutting and splicing the inserts and vectors also make process of molecular cloning more convenient. Imaging that one day kits of biological parts can be purchased from special markets, the DIYbio will become a novel popular forms of entertainment for those DIY fans.
Fig2. T-virus in the Resident evil. Source: http://www.umbrellacorporation.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=55&Itemid=9
Even though the biohackers constantly asserted that they should not be confused with bioterrorist, the DIYbio still raised disputes about biosafety immediately after its birth. People worry that things might get out of control and dangerous new life forms might be unleashed, causing unintended consequences. After all, the assumption that one day in the future viruses similar to the T-viruses in the Resident evil series will be developed in a garage seems not to be absolutely ridiculous. Prompt actions seem to be imperative. Above all, the construction of a rational and judicial legal framework is extremely urgent. Relevant laws should define the bioterrorism clearly and properly and stipulate the duty of government to prohibit misuse of the DIYbio and protect the people from attacks of terrorism.
To be more specific, government, as the server of the society, ought to take the responsibility to monitor the security of experiments conducted by biohackers. Firstly, research projects of DIYers should be declared to government at first, thus valid evaluation and useful guidance could be supplied by the expert panel. Secondly, business deals involving biological resources, especially genetic resources, should be controlled strictly by the government. Thirdly, the process of the experiment also should be declared to relevant departments regularly. An effectual communication channel between government and biohackers is crucial.

Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to αν integrin-positive breast cancer cells in vitro as demonstrated by confocal imaging and flow cytometry. Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. The results suggested that exosomes modified by targeting ligands could be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications in our project.

To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA, we transfected the plasmid loaded with this siRNA into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and extracted protein to perform western blot. Significant down-regulation of K-ras can be observed in A549 cells treating with anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, compared with the control group, demonstrating that anti-KRAS siRNA has a gene silencing effect on lung cancer cells.

Monday
In the morning we did further research into the enzymes required for luciferase recovery. You can see the pretty picture of the luciferase cycle we made here .
In the afternoon we presented our proposals to our supervisors who said we could look at trying to optimise luciferase and LRE for E. coli (perhaps using mutagenesis), we shouldn't assume that anything with bacterial luminescence will work (after all, this is biology) and we should think about chassis design.
We also received a new toy of a low light camera, which Bill and Theo tried to get working - and succeeded, as you can see opposite. After receiving an e-mail at about 4pm saying we needed to give a 15 minute presentation the next day in Newcastle, Hannah and Anja started working on that too.
Tuesday
Today was the first day of the UK iGEM teams get together in Newcastle. We all made it (just about) on the 6.50am  train, arriving for a free lunch at 1pm and talks from each of the different teams through the afternoon.
We thought that we would all be pros at the team building exercise involving tower construction again, but only a few of the towers stayed up at all! A wet walk to La Tasca for dinner in the evening was worth it for the delicious food, and it was nice to meet all the other UK teams.
Wednesday
On the final day of the iGEM get-together we had talks in the morning about practical lab tips, health & safety and human practices.
After another free lunch and an afternoon in Newcastle we headed home keen to get started on lab work the next day. It looked like the other teams were much further along than we were.
Thursday
Barbara gave us a talk about health and safety in the lab so we were now ready and raring to go with lab work.
We also generally carried on researching but felt that we were losing focus on what we needed to do, so had a team meeting over lunch to find out what needed doing and assigning tasks to certain people. Here is our to-do list.
Ben also made a Meccano-like stand for mounting the light sensitive camera, as you can see in the photo.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Modeling#Silencing_-_-_TEXT.html," targeted.
There are two possible approaches for modelling the incomplete repression, each reflecting a different physical mechanism that allows leaky YFP expression. In the first mechanism, RNA polymerase is sometimes able to cleave the bound dCas9-sgRNA complex from the DNA. In the second mechanism, the complex binds inefficiently and is sometimes separated from the DNA, permitting transcription to continue.
We assumed that the incomplete repression is accounted for by the first mechanism. This assumption was based on several studies
showing radically different repression rates if the complex targets the promoter, preventing transcription initiation, rather than targeting the DNA further downstream and impeding transcription elongation. The differences in the system behaviour depending on whether or not RNA polymerase has the opportunity to bind suggest that the ""cleavage"" mechanism may more closely resemble the chemical reality.
Consequently, we modelled incomplete repression using a leaky expression term proportional to the expected YFP expression when the complex is saturated. The differential equation model was updated with the following term: When the concentration of the complex is zero, YFP mRNA is produced at the rate expected from the unrepressed sarA promoter. At a large concentration of the complex, the YFP mRNA is produced at only 60% of the possible rate from sarA.
Parameter Search and Fitting
We turned to the literature to find parameters for our model. We first looked for exact parameter values in S. aureus. If these could not be found, we next looked for ways to to estimate the parameters using other available data for S. aureus and finally searched for the parameters in other gram-positive bacteria. Aggregating parameters from many experiments across the literature is by nature a somewhat uncertain endeavour, but those parameters about which we are very uncertain are marked with asterisks. A general rationale is given for each parameter, but details on the more circuitously estimated parameters are given after the table.

The only model parameters without some basis in the literature are the association rates for dCas9 and sgRNA. However, since the model is based on the QSSA that those dynamics are much faster than the others in the model, we were able to define a range for those parameters based on the other.

This year, our goal was to complete the first part of our biological system: expressing perchlorate reductase. We have been diligently working on designing a bioreactor where the planned biological extraction process can occur. Our project expands on the current knowledge available to address perchlorate contamination - not just on Mars, but on Earth as well. By constructing a system that reduces perchlorate biologically, we hope to expand the avenues available to deal with perchlorate contamination as well as contribute to research regarding this particular gene.
Human Practices
Our team contacted businesses and institutions involved in Mars expeditions, agriculture in rough conditions, perchlorate contamination, as well as environmental contamination in general. We had also been in contact with Astronaut Shawna Pandya, however, due to her busy schedule, we were unable to interview her.
Thanks to the generosity of staff, researchers, and students at the University of Alberta, we were able to ask for public opinions on the colonization of Mars.
Would you go to Mars as a first-wave colonist?
If I had some skill or use that I could contribute that nobody else could, then yes, I would probably go in the first wave. I think it’s very important for humanity to colonize Mars. If I was going as a tourist with others, however… then no.
Tyler Hrynyk, member of the AlbertaSAT team
My worries about that one-way trip to Mars is that you're attracting people who, conventionally, would be considered to have mental issues… if you’re coming and going, you want risk-takers, you want people who absolutely believe that they can handle any problem that faces them. But here, you’re saying that there’s a problem and there’s absolutely no way to fix it. If it was [a] one way [trip] and you were giving me sufficient technology to… set up a self-sustaining colony and be able to live out a normal life… that’s a different story than if you say, “we’re giving you food to survive on Mars for 8 months and then you’re going to die”... Guaranteed death versus a high-risk pastime; those are two completely different personalities… Risk can be appealing because it is challenging, but inevitable death… not so much.

The E.coli have been happily amplifying the chromoprotein plasmids (although only the aeBlue ones seemed to bother expressing any themselves as they have a bacterial promoter) and are chilling in the fridge over the weekend ready to be overnight cultured and lysed to give us a Summer's worth of chromoprotein gene DNA to play with.
I ran my first PCR with Miha to amplify up fragments for the chromoprotein constructs - we're trying five different colours, all of which we're nuclear localising and two of which we are trying unlocalised as well.
After running on a gel, the PCR had worked its magic perfectly on all but track 3... The template used apparently had several kb of stuff inserted between the two primer sites that I was unaware of and therefore did not work at all, whoops. Upon trying again with a new primer that only copied the N7 localisation sequence to Gibson in later, when I came down at the finish time it emerged that the PCR cycles were only 10% done. Lessons learnt - don't get minutes and seconds mixed up when reprogramming a PCR cycler. I stayed late refixing my mistake today :)
Excitingly, a lab in Tokyo that ran a mutant screen on a benzalacetone reductase from Rheum Palmatum (Chinese rhubarb) and found that the S338V mutant is twice as efficient as the wild type enzyme has agreed to send us DNA for both the wild type and the mutant. I'm excitedly awaiting a package of DNA from Japan.

Edinburgh,2015,Team:Edinburgh#Practices#Morality#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html," different action-guiding principles as their criteria for morality, and a few of the most common - stated in their most basic forms - include: Deontology, according to which an action is morally wrong if it is not in accordance with a set of rules or laws; Contractualism, according to which an action is wrong if it is reasonably rejected to on the basis of a mutual social agreement; and Utilitarianism, according to which an action is wrong if it causes more societal suffering than well-being (Alexander & Moore, 2015).
There is great debate as to which of these normative theories is the most plausible; however, it is neither the purpose nor within the scope of this essay to facilitate this discussion. Instead, it will suffice to say that there exist complex arguments in favour of each, and that each is as plausible, or implausible, as the next in terms of the likelihood of standing as the objective moral principle. The strategy to be undertaken in this essay, then, is to select one normative theory as the standard by which to judge the implementation of the biosensor, knowing that another standard could be used just as easily.
Utilitarianism will be used as this standard because it is relatively straightforward compared to the other alternatives. In the case of judging the implementation of the biosensor against the utility principle, it is more or less a process of weighing the positive consequences that action has for society against the negative, and this avoids a lengthy and unavoidable discussion about which laws are supreme in the case of Deontology, or what qualifies a reasonable objection in the case of the most popular form of Contractualism. Here is Utilitarianism restated (M&R, 2005:5):
Utility Principle: The fact that an action would promote well-being is a reason to perform the action. The fact that an action would promote suffering is a reason not to perform the action. An action is morally right just in case it promotes at least as great a balance of well-being over suffering as any of the available alternatives; otherwise it is wrong.
Section 2: Separating the Demographics
Taking the implementation of the biosensor as the action, the Utility Principle can render a moral verdict depending on whether it causes more pain than well-being. In order to quantify the positive and negative consequences, it is useful to conceptualise the populace as splitting into four rough categories: (1) those who do not use drugs and have strong dispositions against them, (2) those who use drugs problematically, (3) those who use drugs recreationally and (4) those who do not use drugs but have no strong"

Conferences
Innovate Calgary Workshop
The Innovate Calgary workshop was held at the University of Lethbridge as part of the initial training for the South Venture Business Plan competition. This workshop was the first exposure to the business world for the members of Synbiologica Ltd. We were introduced to the basic components of a business plan, intellectual property protection, insurance, funding sources, investment and networking.
Accelerate SOUTH50
Accelerate SOUTH50 is an entrepreneur and technology event where founders, business leaders, start-up entrepreneurs, advisors, investors, mentors and students converge to expand and support the entrepreneurial eco-system in southern Alberta. This event was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Network of Southern Alberta (RINSA). We had the opportunity to learn about the different kinds of intellectual property and brand protection, how to develop and expand on our business plan using the Growth Wheel®. It was an excellent opportunity to network with technology focused businesses and investment groups.
Alberta Aboriginal Entrepreneur Youth Camp
Isaac Ward is an aboriginal student at the University of Lethbridge invited to the Alberta Aboriginal Youth Entrepreneur Camp (AAYEC).  It was an opportunity that would provide aboriginal youth and students aged 18-35 in the province of Alberta to learn about basics of starting a small business.  It was a weeklong camp that integrated intense business training provided by the Acadia Centre for Social and Business Entrepreneurship with integrated cultural practices provided by camp mentors and Elders that encouraged aboriginal students to explore the skills required to be a successful entrepreneur.  The camp was held at the Red Lodge Guest Ranch in Bowden, Alberta, and organized by the Alberta Indian Investment Corporation.  At the camp we learned about skills such as Team Building, research, marketing, business operations, financing and presentation skills were taught.  The camp gave Isaac the opportunity to really take time to focus on exploring the aspects of business while integrating the sustainable practices of his aboriginal heritage.  He was able to bring these skills back to the Synbiologica group and apply them towards developing our business plan.
GeekStarter Workshops
The Alberta Innovates Technology Futures GeekStarter Program provided us as well as the other entrepreneurial and collegiate iGEM teams in Alberta with workshops and guest speakers who have been involved in iGEM and specialize in specific areas of synthetic biology. We also had the opportunity to give practice presentations to previous iGEM judges before attending the iGEM competition.

We think that iGEM should be about assembling biobricks fast and combining them in any thinkable way with existing or new parts. Therefore we introduce a simple and fast way of building new devices or whatever you want with ready to use PCR products. Read more about the Plug'n'Play with DNA assembly standard.

Modeling
Formation of modified Virus-Like Particles is key to the success of our project. Therefore we first predict the structure of the subunits after which we use a model describing the formation of the whole VLPs .
Finally, we wanted to know the applicability of our device. Therefore, we used a human body model which is based on the model made by the Slovenia 2012 iGEM team . We extensively modifyed this model to make it applicable for VLPs, their affinity with diseased tissue, the speed of excretion and degradation and finally, the drug delivery at the targeted tissue.

InterLab Study
""Measurement is fundamentally an act of communication."" - Jacob Beal
Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component to all engineering disciplines. The same holds true for synthetic biology, which has also been called engineering biology. However, the ability to repeat measurements in different labs has been difficult. The Measurement Committee, through the InterLab study, has been developing a robust measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) over the last several years. We chose GFP as the measurement marker for this study since it's one of the most used markers in synthetic biology and, as a result, most laboratories are equipped to measure this protein.

Project Design
Inspired by the natural Bordetella phage's diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) system, we sought to develop an in vitro analog that could produce even greater numbers of possible major tropism determinant (Mtd) protein variants. This would test the structural limits of the Mtd and its target-binding ability, provide a broader perspective on the bacteriophage’s host-range specificity, and potentially introduce a new method of generating antibody-like proteins that can bind onto selected targets.
Generating Diversity
To this end, we first isolated the Major tropism determinant (mtd) gene from the Bordetella phage genome, which was generously donated to us by Jeff Miller’s lab at UCLA. Initial attempts at moving the components of the DGR into E. coli have not successfully yielded a functional product. However, the Mtd protein is still a choice candidate for our project given its ability to resist structural deformation following mutagenesis of the variable binding domain. Without the native reverse transcriptase-mediated homologous recombination system to generate diversity, we designed a series of overlapping oligonucleotides with mutagenic islands that bind to the mtd gene’s variable repeat and introduce random nucleotides during PCR. The farthest oligonucleotide at the 3’ end of the gene also contains a Serine-Glycine linker and a FLAG-tag that would facilitate purification from undesirable byproducts during mRNA display.
Oligonucleotide design for generation of Mtd mutagenic islands
This in vitro system has several advantages over the natural DGR, and boasts even greater possible protein diversity. Naturally, only adenine bases within the mtd gene’s variable repeat region are modifiable. While this still provides a significantly large number of possible variants, the primers used in our experiments do not have to follow the same adenine site-specific mutation restrictions, and permit entire sections to be modified. Primer-mediated mutagenesis thus provides even greater sequence variation than the normal DGR system. An enormous library of unique variants can increase the chances of identifying a protein-binding species in a screen. Having a large copy"
Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," an overexpressed protein between 20 and 25 kDa. PETase has a weight of 24 kDa, so the band is exactly where we would expect to see PETase. In the control that has not been induced (0M IPTG), we do not observe a band between 20 and 25 kDa. This experiment again demonstrates our system’s inducible control: the blue box shows there is no band in the absence of IPTG.
If you are wondering what the dark band below the PETase band is, it is lysozyme that we used in our cell lysis protocol. Lysozyme was run as a control, which you can see has a dark band in the same location.
For the SDS Page protocol, please refer to our experiments page.
An additional experiment we performed to confirm the presence of PETase was a Western Blot. While the SDS page can show a protein of the proper size is being expressed, a Western allows us to probe the identity of protein itself. To make PETase easily detectable via Western Blot, we designed our constructs to include a “His tag” which is targeted by a commercially available antibody. By running an SDS-PAGE as described above, we could separate all the proteins in the cell by size. Then we could transfer these proteins to a paper membrane and stain with a the commercially available anti-His antibody.  Because our recombinant PETase protein is the only his-tagged protein in the cell, we would expect to see a signal only from the band which contains PETase. See details of this protocol on our experiment spage. Here were our results:
Western Blot shows inducible expression of PETase and PETase-sfGFP fusion.
At 30 kD, we see a band which corresponds to the approximate expected size of PETase (28.6 kD). This band is strongest in lane 1, which contains lysate from our PETase construct that is unfused to GFP and induced with IPTG. Additionally, we see a band at 70 kD in lanes 2 and 3, which is the expected size of PETase-sfGFP fusion. Unexpectedly, we also see a PETase-sized band in lanes 2,3, and 4, which should only have a band at 70 kD for the PETase-sfGFP fusion. We hypothesize this is because the PETase GFP fusion is being degraded by proteases because it is so large. We hypothesize the smear we see between 70 kD and 30kD in"

3. With BIT
    This year, we were happy to cooperate with BIT, we collaborate with each other in many aspects. Firstly, they did us a great favour in founding this new team. Secondly, we met each other and discussed about our project design in June. We explained the project idea and design to each other and we also discussed about doing modelling and hardware equipment. We offered some advice on modelling and they showed us some tips of making hardware in return. Besides, they showed us the labs around. Apart from this meeting, we shared the Interlab data with each other and analysed whether the consequence was proper together. We were truly thankful to be guided and cooperate with such a lovely team!

4. With HZAU
    The CcaS-CcaR TCS we applied to respond to green/red light was used by HZAU-China 2017 before. They have been working on improving this TCS for two years, which means they are more experienced than us to deal with the construction and usage of this system derived from cyanobacteria. They helped us with the approach where we could acquire plasmids containing the light-sensing components, and they also shared the experience on how they regulated the expression of CcaS and CcaR protein to control this optogenetic tools and what they achieved. Thanks for they guidance and their precious experience on CcaS-CcaR TCS.

Therefore, we ordered a synthesized IDT G- Blocks® and assembled it using Gibson cloning. To achieve a complete Monobody from our submitted part, the RFP can be replaced with randomized variable regions allowing an easy visual control. To insert the variable regions, we amplified the backbone, including Monobody constant regions, the cMyc-linker and rpoZ by using the primers MB-bb-fw and MB-bb-rev . After annealing the single stranded oligonucleotides V1-1 (a) + V1-2 (b) filling in the parts resulting in the double stranded fragment V1 and annealing oligonucleotides V2-1 (c) + V2-2 (d) and fill-in yielding V2 and a Gibson assembly with V1, V2 and the backbone combined the parts.

Outreach
In order to promote synthetic biology and attract public’s attention on the relationship between synthetic biology and social life, this summer, we carried out scientific exhibitions, high school teach-ins, online promotion and develop a set of cartoon images demonstrating the applications of synthetic biology. We hope people, particularly the youth, could gradually raise their awareness of biological science through various interesting and impressive experiences in our practice. Compared to developed countries, the growth of biological industry is still limited in our country, we believe that the more people know about synthetic biology (such as what social problems can be solved with synthetic biology, what safety issue might arise as it develops) the faster the biological industry can develop. It is no doubt that biological industry plays an increasingly important role in sustainable development in modern society,and we hope our efforts could contribute to this trend.
Scientific Exhibition   (Figs. 1 to 5)
Cooperated with the iGEM team of South China University of Technology ( SCUT-China ), we held a scientific exhibition about synthetic biology in Guangdong’s Science Center. We devoted ourself to popularize synthetic biology by promoting combat of antimicrobial resistance, MDC, and some other applications of synthetic biology. The theme of the exhibition is how synthetic biology improves our life, aiming to popularize the knowledge and application of synthetic biology in social life, history of iGEM foundation and introductions of our project. In the scientific experience section, visitors can obtain latest information about iGEM projects on posters and in video display area. They can also get a glimpse to the micro-world through the microscope provided. In the engagement section, visitors can take snaps with our cartoon images which strands for different application area of synthetic biology. Moreover, signatures of those who show supportive attitude to development of synthetic biology are collected on a signature wall. According to official statistic, over 5,000 visitors were attracted to the Guangdong’s Science Center per day on average. So we believe that our exhibition is influential and impressive to the public. We thank SCUT-China for great cooperation to"

We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

We may also teach them about riboswitches or other regulation methods that might be applicable to their project.
ITESG
We partnered with a non-iGEM team of students from the Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Guanajuato (ITESG) in Mexico. They developed methods for creating a low cost growth media for Y. lipolytica str. PoPPY from upcycled dairy waste. To learn more about our collaboration with ITESG, check out our Partnership page !
iGEM TecCEM
The TecCEM iGEM team approached our team with an interesting proposal; their team wanted to create a fun iGEM-themed music video showcasing iGEM teams from around the world. They requested we take a brief video of our team dancing to the Maroon 5 song ""Moves like Jagger"" that they would turn into a fun parody called ""Moves like iGEM"". This collaboration was brief, but we had fun coordinating with other iGEM teams worldwide for a fun side-project.
iGEM ULaval

If have access to Nano Drop or equivalent, first determine the concnetrations of your part in ng/μL using 2μL of recovered sample. Zero the instrument using the same TE buffer that was used to elute your sample
Determine the remaining volume of your sample
To convert the concentrations of your part from ng/μL to pm/μL (pm/μLPart), use the very close approximation: 1pm/μL = 670 ng/μL divided by the length of the part (kb)
If the concnetrations significantly exceeds 0.04pm/μL, then adjust the recovered volume of your sample (μLrecovered) with TE buffer using the formula below:
Add vol (μL) = [25 x pm/μLPart x μLrecovered] - μLrecovered
An alternative method to calculations is a gel-based method and can be used to approximate a workable concentrations as described below:
Set up an agarose gel as described above, and prepare a gel sample of the digested DNA, add 1μL of DNA to 9μL of load mix (LM)
Load the entire sample into a centrally located well
Load 10μL of DNA ladder to one side of your sample and 15μL to other side
Following electrophoresis, photograph the gel at lowest possible exposure where all bands remain visible but where gel background appears as dark as possible
To determine the minimum concentrations of your sample, compare your product band to the nearest sized ladder band in either or both ladder lanes that has an intensity that is closest or lower than yours
NOTE: For the 10μL load, all bands correspond to 20ng of DNA except for the 500, 1000 and 3000 bp bands, which correspond to 60ng. For the 15μL load, all abnds are 30ng of DNA except for the 500, 1000 and 3000 bp bands which are at 90ng.
The value that you decidde on represents the minimum concentration of your sample expressed as μg/μL
Use formula described in step (3) to convert the concentrations to pm/μL

3) Introduced a gene which encodes for a synthase to use GPP to form monoterpenes. We chose 5 different synthases that each produces different monoterpenes in different proportions [8]:
Synthase PgTPS-Pin2 catalyzes GPP into producing 70.5% β-pinene and 29% α-pinene + other monoterpenes in negligible amounts.
Synthase PsTPS-Car1 catalyzes GPP into producing 66.4% 3-carene and 2.7% α-pinene + other monoterpenes in negligible amounts.
Synthase PgxeTPS-Cin catalyzes GPP into producing 65.6% 1,8 cineole, 3.0% α-pinene and 2.6% β-pinene + other monoterpenes in negligible amounts.
Synthase PgTPS-Cin catalyzes GPP into producing 81.1% 1,8 cineole, 1.9% α-pinene and 1.9% β-pinene + other monoterpenes in negligible amounts.
Synthase PsTPS-Pin catalyzes GPP into producing 83.4% α-pinene and 12.6% β-pinene + other monoterpenes in negligible amounts.
Based on these changes, I created a modified model:

Block diagrams of biochemical pathway for PsTPS-Pin synthase , PgTPS-Pin2 synthase , PsTPS-Car1 synthase , PgxeTPS-Cin synthase , PgTPS-Cin synthase .
Please note:
1) The enzymes ERG12, ERG8 and MVD1 are NOT RATE LIMITING; therefore, we chose not to include them in our simplified model. However, these enzymes are accounted for in our simulations.
2) The RATE LIMITING STEP is at HMG2 .
Now, I needed to model these chemical equations as a series of differential equations. As an engineer, I don't have a biochemistry background"

Genome Alberta Blog Posting
Genome Alberta sponsored us this year to share with their website's audience some of the interesting things we were doing with genetics and synthetic biology this year.  We have authored a number of the blog posts and been featured in one of their writer's blog posts.  This was a great way to interface with industry and show a more 'humanistic' side of iGEM.  It also provided a great opportunity to connect with Alberta and Canada's scientific community and industries. More blog posts will find their way up over the next few weeks!

Detect and Destroy: Data Page
Figure 1. The Calgary team has developed a dual system for the detection of toxic components in tailing ponds and the remediation of these compounds.  Tailings ponds are large bodies of water containing waste products produced from the extraction of bitumen in the oil sands.  Our biosensor included the identification of a toxin promoter through a transposon screen.  An electrochemical detector was implemented with a multiple output system allowing for the detection of multiple compounds simultaneously.  This promoter/detector system was then complemented with the production of a biosensor prototype involving both a physical device and a software program for easy data analysis.  Rather than just sensing toxins in the tailings ponds, a major objective was to detoxify the tailings through the reduction of toxins such as carboxylic acids (mainly naphthenic acids) and catechol, while turning them into usable hydrocarbons.

Result: Mr. De Torbal could help us search for patents that had been granted in the field of aptamers. He was open for any further questions about patentregulation.
Existing biosensor methods
With our sensor device we want to find a way to produce a universal sensing method. Therefore it is interesting to look at requirements for sensor systems and the techniques other sensor systems use. To learn more about sensor techniques we spoke with Dhiredj Jagesar, working for DSM (a dutch institute involved in the application of scientific researches in health, nutrition and materials) and involved in the development of one of the most frequently used tests in livestock: the Delvo Test. Furthermore we talked to Menno Prins, professor at the university of Eindhoven, who is very much involved in research towards new sensing techniques. Short summaries of these talks are presented below:
D. (Dhiredj) Jagesar – Scientist working for DSM, in 2006 finished his PhD thesis about “Intercomponent Interactions and Mobility in Hydrogen-Bonded Rotaxane”
Goal: Learn more about detection methods making use of microorganisms.
Approach: We talked to Dhiredj Jagesar about the development of the Delvo test that he was involved in. Also we asked Dr. Jagesar if he could give feedback on our idea.
Results: During the talk with Dhiredj Jagesar we learned about a test that made use of bacteria as basis for detection, but still used these bacteria in a completely different fashion. The Delvo Test makes use of bacterial growth as an indicator of the presence of antibiotics in milk. Therefore this test doesn’t make use of modified bacteria, but simply exploits their intrinsic capacity.  Since dr. Jagesar was involved in the production of the test he could tell us more about the requirements that need to be met before bringing such a device to the market. DSM performed as merchandizer of their product. Therefore they performed extensive internal validation to be able to present the customer with a decent product. To gain credibility also external validation of the product was performed. Dr. Jagesar however opted that our product would probably have to deal with different regulation, since it involved the use of modified organsims.  Finally we requested dr. Jagesar to give some feedback on our device. Thereby he emphasized that we should be able to defend the use of bacteria in a sensor-system and he referred"

Results of Previous Colour Transformations
We took the violacein pigment bacteria (right plate in photo) out of the fridge to find that the purple colour had started to develop. They were therefore left at room temperature overnight. The colour appears to be within the bacteria, with little or no bleeding into the media. The control plate (left plate) is the untransformed TOP10 E. coli.
The Orange plasmid transformed into the Roche strain (with upregulated upstream pathways) had also produced colour. The two controls are above the trannsformed strain; the plate on the left shows TOP10 E. coli (i.e 'normal' E. coli colour) while the plate on the right shows the untransformed Roche strain.

On Wednesday afternoon we transformed pPCB15 (CrtEXYIB, producing beta-carotene) into MG1655 (""Parent""), MG1655 PT5-dxs,idi,ispBDF (""Roche"") and TOP10. Results of overnight culture are as follows:
Top row from the left: pPCB15 in MG1655-PT5 (""Roche""), pPCB15 in TOP 10, pPCB15 in MG1655 (""Parent""). Bottom row from the left: K152005 in TOP10, R0011 in TOP10 (negative control).
Close-up of pPCB15 in MG1655-PT5 (""Roche"")
Close-up of K152005 in TOP10

All three strains show yellowish/orange pigmentation, indicating production of beta-carotene. We are confident that the Crt enzymes (E, B, I, Y) can function normally in E. coli, and the rate of pigment formation is fast (overnight). Previously, K152005 (CrtEBIY, without promoter) took about 3 days for yellowish/orange pigment to develop, which might be due to the absence of promoter. To confirm this, we will put K152005 under strong promoter (R0011, constitutive), transform the construct into E.coli TOP10 and the two MG1655 strains, and see if there is improvement in the"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#OSCAR#FluxAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html,".  FVA can also examine different ranges of bacterial growth vs. product output which is valuable in assessing validity of models in the wet-lab.
Using FVA to optimize OSCAR
What Are We Trying To Model?
FVA provides a method to modulate the inputs of endogenous metabolic pathways, but could also investigate what chemicals are needed in the growth media to upregulate an introduced pathway in E. coli.  In the latter case, we need to specifically model the flux rate of metabolic pathways responding to different growth media conditions and generate an optimal set of metabolites that should be added to improve production rate. Development of a tool to model the optimal flux would also benefit numerous iGEM teams and research labs who engineer bacteria with novel pathways.
How could systems like OSCAR benefit from this model?
Much like chemical reactions which need optimal environmental conditions to achieve maximum production rate, microbes require certain conditions to accomplish cellular tasks at maximum speed. During industrial scale up, the optimal conditions for production needs to be maximized to reduce cost of production to a minimum. Conditions in the microbial bioreactor systems are more crucial than chemical synthesis reactors ⎯ simply due to the increase in simultaneous reactions occurring. Furthermore, the selection and concentration of compounds in the growth media can severely affect the growth rate. If a computational model can predict an optimal set of metabolites for media composition, this will save time, resources, and funds.
Figure 2: Diagram of the relationship between growth rate and production rate, and the computed optimal growth rate.
How does the program work?
Our program is built upon flux variability analysis applied by the functions in the Cobra Toolbox. It uses the published E.coli iAF1260 and E.coli core models provided from the Systems Biology Research Group (Dr. B. Palsson) at the University of San Diego. Using this as a base, we constructed reactions and metabolites for the hydrocarbon production components of OSCAR. Specifically, new reactions corresponding to the PetroBrick as well as the upgrading (desulfurization and denitrogenation) pathways were engineered into the E.coli base chassis. Running FVA will give an output correlated to a optimized growth rate. Moreover, this FVA algorithm running at optimal biomass flux rates can provide a range of outputs for your product of interest (Figure 2). This allows the user to select an optimum point where compound production is maximized.  Finally, the program will analysis the data with an algorithm to generate a set of media compounds that is expected to accelerate production rate.

Plate 1_1 This is the Intersession BBs assigned and passed through FPCR. The problem is the conflict with BB 3L.3_23.C2.01  From this picture and from the sequencing results, we see that the BBs are really not the ones that were intended to be built. This means that the clones are on the plates are actually clones of 3L.3_23.C2.01. Somewhere along the way, a dirty SOC/ or LB Carb mix was introduced and caused the wrong BBs to be inserted into the plasmid. As for the few BBs that did get inserted correctly, none of them were perfect clones.

From our construction successes (< 95%) and our lack of perfect clones we must conclude a mixed result from our experiments. This method has many advantages and disadvantages that need to be accounted for in order to assess the ultimate efficiency and accuracy of the protocol.
First and foremost, this is a very costly protocol (refer to Jasper’s report) and even with one pass through the FPCR to CSPCR workflow, the price of the reagents cannot be reconciled with the lack of successes on our sequencing results. We use more BBs since it costs more to overlap every part of BB. This extra cost cannot be offset by the increased efficiency since my results suggests that even with the new protocol, a single perfect clone cannot be found out of 12 submitted clones. The increased accuracy was supposed to improve the parts where the overlapped regions met.
We must also take into account the relative difficulty that these BBs offer in their"

Collaboration with University of Calgary iGEM - Wet Lab Collaboration
Overview
This summer, Calgary iGEM reached out to us expressing interest over our project and about beginning a collaboration between our teams. Their goal is to develop a process for bioplastic production on a Mars settlement. This is a novel method that couples waste management in space with the high cost of shipping materials to a Mars mission crew. Calgary iGEM has been working hard in engineering E. coli to produce bioplastics from human waste feedstock. The bioplastic of interest is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), which can be synthesized with their engineered bacteria using volatile fatty acids (VFA), compounds that are present in human waste. Calgary’s interest in our team stemmed from the need for a fast and effective E. coli detector to incorporate into their bioplastics synthesis system on a Mars colony. Our DNAzyme would serve as part of their containment system, and quickly alert crew to leakage from the synthesis system. Our team was very interested in this potential application of our DNAzyme and decided to mail a quantity of it over for pilot testing from Calgary iGEM.
Experiment
A small amount of DNAzyme was shipped to Calgary for testing its specificity in the presence of E. coli, and confirming lack of cleavage activity in the presence of other bacteria. The following outlines the procedure followed by Calgary iGEM and their results.
Overnight cultures of E. coli DH5α and Bacillus subtilis WB800 were prepared in liquid M9 media and diluted to a concentration of 106 cells/mL. Quadrants were drawn on agar plates with M9 media and labelled as either E. coli or B. subtilis, DNAzyme, and two negative controls (Figure 1).
On the quadrants labelled as bacteria, 30 µL of the overnight E. coli or B. subtilis were spread and left to grow for 36 hours. Calgary encountered a lack of bacterial growth following this incubation step. They decided to use a thicker agar plate and plate a higher concentration of cells (108 cells/mL), which resulted in colony growth (Figure"

Hypothesis 5: Subcloning of Im2 into tryptophan regulatory system
Hypothesis 6: Bacterial proliferation of tryptophan regulatory system with Im2 in medium containing tryptophan in a concentration gradient
The next step would be to subclone the immunity protein 2 into the tryptophan regulatory system construct and perform proliferation tests. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to complete these experiments.

Hypothesis 1: Genome integration of RFP as a pilot study
A genome integration study was performed with the plasmids from iGEM HQ and the transposase plasmid ( pTNS2 ) provided by Addgene. The purpose of this experimental part was to determine the viability of both plasmids when implemented into the same bacteria and the success rate of a study utilizing machinery for genome integration. The RFP construct was cloned into the UPO-Sevilla 2011 plasmids ( C18Sfi and C18R6 ) which were subsequently transformed with the transposase-containing suicide plasmid.

All red colonies contain RFP, but only some of them contain both RFP and pTNS2; the white colonies are empty carrier plasmids.
The integration was confirmed by colony PCR using primers that anneal to the genome of the bacteria. The forward primer anneals to the gene following the attTn7 integration site (glmS), while the reverse primer binds to the transposition cassette. A"

2.3 Prevention pathogen
In the applications of controlling pathogens, quorum sensing system plays an important role in regulating growth and reputation of microorganism. So we could restrain quorum sensing system to control microorganism to make our life more healthy and nice. The most important part in the metabolism of pathogens controlled by quorum sensing system is the synthesis of toxin and the formation of membrane system. If we can restrain these two kinds of effect may we decrease some potential diseases resources and improve the effects of antitoxins. What's more, it is a particularly attractive point to prevent pathogens through restraining their quorum sensing system instead of killing them directly as it offers the prospect of combating effectively infections resistant to all existing drugs. As we all know, just treat diseases via using antibotics or antitoxin can help these pathogens improve their resistance to various drugs, which is very dangerous for us human being. To date, although we've found that different fungus form different signal molecules, the quorum sensing system almost takes part in cell morphological transformation and information communication. We think our oscillatory gene circuits provide a very useful and meaningful model to promote more and more research in this field[11].
Gene sinusoidal signal generator
With the development of science and technology, computer had been here and there with larger RAM, faster CPU and smaller volume. All these changes owe to VLSI （Very Large Scale Integrated Circuites）, which consists of different electronic component.
Just image what if we can control cell as a biocomputer. Cellular computer is a device consists of different kinds genetically engineered bacteria, which can do the calculation, such as add and subtract like a normal computer. To finish such a device, scientists need various gene circuits to complete different operations. These circuits are just like electronic component working in an electronic computer.
At the beginning of this century, biocomputer is still a crazy dream far more than a possible blueprint. But now scientists have had the technology to make this ""impossible mission"" comes true. In recent months, scientists from Stanford constructed a new ""bio-crystal valve"" by DNA and RNA, which can do the logical operations in the living cells[6].
Two months later, scientists from MIT used less than 3 gene devices to do the digital operation in division, logarithmic and square root. Thus, constructing gene circuits as electronic devices have become possible. From their research, their cellular calculator which uses analog computation has more advantages in computing efficiency in part count, speed and energy consumption compared with digital computation[7].

3) Partition Function
To determine the reaction rate constant ${K}_{{p}_{1}}$ , ${K}_{{p}_{11}}$ , ${K}_{{p}_{12}}$ , we seek for partition function. Inspired by the references [3], we applied the partition function to the dynamic description of the translation process, in which we can obtain the probability that the ribosomes bind to RNA and then succeeded in converting the probability into translation rate. Further, we can calculate the reaction rate constant ${K}_{{p}_{1}}$ , ${K}_{{p}_{11}}$ , ${K}_{{p}_{12}}$ by utilizing the concentration data of (2),(4),(5) from our wet lab experiments.

(1)Ribosomes are always in large concentration.
(2)Ribosomes are more inclined to bind with RBS.

The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.

AGP K.O./INV Construct Components
ADP Glucose Pyrophosphorylase (AGP) Gene: The slr1176 open reading frame was PCR amplified from total Synechocystis PCC6803 genomic DNA and subcloned into pSB1a3. Forward and reverse primers were designed with 5’ extensions containing iGEM prefix and suffix sequences.
Invertase (INV) Gene+double terminator: The INV gene was synthesized based on the sequence of a Zymonomas mobilis invertase gene described by Neiderholtmeyer et al. (Applied and Environmental Microbiology (2010) 76: 3462) which was codon optimized for expression in cyanobacteria. The gene was also synthesized with a double transcriptional terminator designed from sequences described for iGEM part BBa_B0015. The synthetic gene was subsequently subcloned into pSB1C and has been designated BBa_K558006.
petBD promoter+RBS: The strong light inducible petBD promoter will be used to drive the expression of invertase gene in Synechocystis. The petBD+RBS (BBa_K390015) was generously provided to us by the Utah State iGEM team.
Kanamyacin resistance cassette (KanR): The kanamycin resistance cassette was PCR amplified from pUC4K (Taylor and Rose (1988) NAR 16:358). This cassette includes the neomycin phosphotransferase 2 gene with its own constitutive promoter and transcriptional terminator. This cassette is frequently used to select for positive transformants in Synechocystis.
Gibson Assembly of AGP K.O./INV Components
Primer Design: Forward and reverse primers for each DNA part were designed with 20 base pair overlapping sequences with the upstream and downstream flanking segments. This will create 40 base pair overlaps between neighboring parts in the construct.
PCR: Inv, KnR, and petBD+RBS were amplified from BBa_K558006(Nevada), pUC4K, and K390015(Utah State) respectively under standard PCR conditions. AGP in pSB1A3 will be amplified to include the vector. This will be used as the backbone for Gibson Assembly.
