Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."
Tsinghua,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," can convert the binding ability of TALE protein to its target DNA sequence to a easier available parameter, the florescent intensity of RFP. When the TALE protein is expressed, the TALE may binds to its target, which may interrupt the transcription of LacI. The lack of repressors may lead to the expression of RFP. So the stronger florescent intensity means the better binding ability of TALE protein.
Validation
We change the normal RBS sequence in the LacI coding sequence into an RBS containing three tandem TALE binding site sequences. So we have to validate that the LacI protein can express normally and can normally inhibit the expression of RFP.
We transformed this plasmid in to E.coli DH5α with electroporation and chemical transformation. We spread the plate and culture it in 37 degrees Centigrade for more than 15 hours until small colonies can be seen in the plate. At this moment, the colonies might look red for the sake of the delay of expression of LacI. We picked colonies into the 10mL tubes and added 5mL LB broth with Chl antibiotics.
After six hours’ shaking at 37 degrees Centigrade and 220 rpm, we got the tubes out and double, four times, eight times diluted. (40μL of 0.1M IPTG was added as the positive control group) After another shaking for 12h, florescence of the bacteria was evaluated with an enzyme-labeled instrument and OD600 was tested with spectrometry.

Three Plasmids
Three Parts & Three Plasmids in a Glee
In a synchronized oscillatory system, three important parts should be included: the oscillator, which is the biochemical machinery that generate the oscillatory output; the coupling pathway that ensure the connection among cells; and output pathway, which is also known as a reporter that reflect the state of the oscillator to downstream targets (Fig. 2-1).
Fig. 2-1 Circuit working mechanism
Oscillator
Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell signaling mechanism that refers to the ability of bacteria to respond to chemical hormone-like molecules called autoinducers. When an autoinducer reaches a critical threshold, the bacteria detect and respond to this signal by altering their gene expression. In our circuit, QS (from Vibrio fischeri) is installed as a positive feedback while aiiA (from Bacillus Thurigensis) acts as a negative one to compose an oscillator together. In the quorum sensing part, the luxI gene is at low expression level and produces LuxI protein that synthesize a kind of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which is a small molecule that can diffuse across the cell membrane and mediate intercellular coupling when it reaches the threshold as enough biomass accumulated. AHL will bind intracellular protein LuxR, which is also consecutively produced by luxR gene. The LuxR-AHL complex can activate the luxI promoter, and the positive feedback loop is built. At the same time, the aiiA gene, which is under control of the same promoter is expressed and produce a lactonase enzyme known as aiiA that hydrolyzes the lactone ring of AHL. (Fig. 2-1) In this system, the activator enhances the expression of both activator and repressor, which shares the common motif of many synthetic oscillators.
Coupling
The communication range of quorum sensing, however, is limited by the diffusion rate of AHL, could only reach cells over tens of micrometers. So, we introduced the coding gene for NADH dehydrogenase II (ndh) and put it under the control of the same luxIpromoter, which means ndh also has a periodical expression in accordance with the oscillator. NDH-2 is a membrane-bound respiratory enzyme that generates low level H2"

Today was another busy day filled with meetings. I had a meeting with Bing in the morning about the data model. Here are my misc notes:
Need to define the Clotho Keywords (CK) list
This is a set of objects. Objects have fields as well
We DO NOT define a relationship between objects
Add the ability to have a Keywords Extensions (KE) list
Require a binding file
The binding file assigns database tables to CK objects and fields
The once the binding file has been created, then the new data model will create connections based on what is in the database. This allows for two types of checks by tools:
A check if a CK is bound to an element in the database
This allows straight retrieval and committing to the database
A check if a CK is reachable from another CK
This allows relational queries
Reachability from CK to CK can be determined through KE objects as well.
After the data model meeting, I spent the afternoon with 9th graders from Cal Prep. I showed them around campus, our lab, and JCA lab. It was fun. They were great kids and had a lot of energy.
The last meeting I had was with Bing and Nina about the robot. We went over the protocol that Jenn sent us. It appears that there are three basic operations that we can support:
Transfer (ONE well to ONE other well)
Combine (Move MANY wells to ONE other well)
Move (ONE well to MANY wells)
Nina and Bing are going to begin to code these primitive operations. In addition to the operation itself, there are two other axis:
The parameters for the operation

Even confronted with the possible consequences of their consumption of dairy and beef products, most people were not willing to change their nutrition for a better climate. Additionally, it should be considered that clicking “Yes” in a survey is probably much easier than turning something into action for real, so in reality the “No” fraction would probably be even more numerous. This implies that there should be another way of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions caused by livestock, and with our project we want to show how this could be achieved.

Survey on Synthetic Biology
""In which of the areas where synthetic biology is applied do you wish for progress?""
We also wanted to figure out what the public expects synthetic biology to contribute to society and in those areas that synthetic biology is applied in, where they wish the most for progress. Among these areas are medicine, renewable energy, environment, and nutrition. To those who were not familiar with the term “synthetic biology” we gave a short introduction, of course without influencing their opinion. The question was: “In which of the areas where synthetic biology is applied do you wish for progress?” Apparently most people are interested in the use of synthetic biology for medicinal or environmental purposes, whereas less wanted synthetic biology to solve problems concerning renewable energy and the least wanted synthetic biology to interfere in nutritional issues. The results for nutrition and renewable energy were somewhat expected - genetically modified food is a hotly debated topic in Germany and renewable energy may be a somewhat intangible term, especially as the connection to synthetic biology is probably not as obvious as for the other areas.
""In which of the areas where synthetic biology is applied do you wish for progress?"" - Analyzed by age
On the other hand, we were quite surprised to find that people obviously cared about the environment as much as about medicinal issues. However, it would sure be interesting to see whether the age group has an influence on what the respective persons chose. Therefore, we also asked for the persons’ ages and got the following results. Especially for environment and medicine it is interesting to see that persons younger than 40 years and persons of 40 years or older seem to form two distinct groups with equally distinct opinions. While the younger ones decided for environment more often, the opposite is the case for the older ones who are more interested in the use of synthetic biology for medicine. Although these differences might not be significant one can still assume that the age influences a person’s"

Measure Abs600 of these 1:10 diluted cultures
Dilute the cultures further to a target Abs600 of 0.02 in a final volume of 12ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube (covered with foil to block light).
Take 500 μL samples of the diluted cultures at 0 hours into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, prior to incubation. (At each time point 0 hours and 6 hours, you will take a sample from each of the 8 devices, two                           colonies                           per                           device, for a total of 16 eppendorf tubes with 500 μL samples per time point, 32 samples total). Place the samples on ice.
Incubate the remainder of the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm for 6 hours.
Take 500 μL samples of the cultures at 6 hours of incubation into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Place samples on ice.
At the end of sampling point we need to measure your samples (Abs600 and fluorescence measurement), see the below for details.
Measurement:
Pipette 100 μl of each sample into each well. From 500 μl samples in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, 4 replicate samples of colony #1 should be pipetted into wells in rows A, B, C and D. Replicate samples of colony #2 should be                       pipetted                       into wells in rows E, F, G and H. Be sure to include 8 control wells containing 100uL each of only LB+chloramphenicol on each plate in column 9.                       The setting used were the same as those used for the calibration protocols.
Layout for Abs600 and Fluorescence measurement:
At the end of the experiment, we have two plates to read. We have one plate for each time point: 0 and 6 hours. On each plate we will read both fluorescence and absorbance.
Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E.coli cultures protocol
This procedure can be used to calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit (CFU) counts, which are directly relatable to the cell concentration of the culture, i.e. viable cell counts per mL. This protocol assumes that one bacterial                       cell                       will give rise to one colony.
For the CFU protocol, we will count colonies for our two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and our two Negative Control (BBa_R0040)"

BCA for Concentrated Fraction
Following the manufacturer's protocol, a BCA was conducted on the concentrated sample made yesterday via a 20kD Pierce concentrator. 9 standards were used to plot the Beer's Law Calibration Curve, and ultra pure water was used as a blank. Immediately after addition of 1mL of working reagent to 100ul of concentrated Tamura sample, the solution turned a deep purple, and this qualitative observation indicated early on that the sample was concentrated to a good extent. (Judging from the 9 standards' reactions after adding working reagent, the less concentrated samples were green and the more concentrated samples were purple.)  After spectroscopy, it was discovered that the concentrated Tamura sample was even more concentrated than the highest standard concentration, resulting in an absorbance reading of 2.66. This value is out of the 0.1-1.0 working absorbance range for Beer's Law.  The spectrophotometer was unable to generate an estimated protein concentration in ug/mL. So, the data from the standards were plotted and an equation from the line of best fit was generated. The corresponding absorbance was then calculated from an mathematical expression, the quadratic function ( ), and found to be 2970ug/mL, which is approximately 3mg/mL, a 0.3 w/v %.
Note: The concentrated Tamura should have been diluted down until it generated an absorbance reading between 0.1 and 1.0, this would have allowed for a more accurate calculation of its concentration. This will be done next time if we run into the same problem with our purified and concentrated proteins.

After cleavage, the 2A peptide remains fused to the C-terminus of the upstream protein when the proline is linked to the N-terminus of the downstream as Figure7. According to the Thomas's research, 2A peptide system has proved the high-efficiency of co-expression and cleavage in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
 
Therefore, we decided to construct the expression system to co-express Cry and Cyt genes in single vector based on 2A peptide system
7.Toxin Groups
As mentioned in the Action mode of Cry and Cyt toxins, Cyt can increase the toxicity of Cyt. Therefore, we designed various toxin groups based on the 2A-peptide system as following figure8.
 
 
Considering the bias of codon in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii, the synthesis biology company helped us to synthesis the Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt1, Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt2, Cry11Aa-2A-Cyt1, Cry11Aa-2A-Cyt2, Cry4Aa-2A-Cyt1, Cry4Aa-2A-Cyt2 toxin gene groups.
8.The Protein Express Platform in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii
Generally, E. Coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are good platforms to express proteins from eukaryon or prokaryote. But considering the cost of our product in the natural world. Algae will be a better choice for us because they can make use of sunshine to produce proteins by photosynthesis. Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii is a typical genus of green alga. The integrating data of genome, high efficiency of protein express and mature systems of culture and transform. Therefore, we constructed six toxin express devices as Figure9.
 
9.The Culture and Transformation of Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii
The most transformation is based on electro transformation technology. But due to the unknown reasons, we still could not transform Hsp70A-Rbc S2 Promoter-Intron-Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt-Terminator device into Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii. With the help from SZU-China, they helped us to transform it by glass-bead technology. You also can find the culture and transformation protocols in the Protocol"

The team came together during a course in mammalian cell biology in June, and that was when the idea of iGEM popped into our heads. Even though we started the iGEM project late June, we have managed to design a fully standardized cloning system called Plug'n Play with DNA. We thought that time should be spent on making cool iGEM projects, instead of struggling with unwanted restriction sites and cumbersome assembly systems. This led us to standardize USER fusion by designing the Plug'n'Play with DNA assembly system.
Our Plug 'n' Play with DNA kit consist of:
49 ready-to-use BioBricks.
21 backup plasmids.
A quick 'n' easy guide on how to customize the standard
To ensure that the BioBricks and devices have been assembled correctly we have tested the functionality of them in Aspergillus nidulans and in mammalian cells. We have characterized the two fungal promoters, PalcA and DMKP-P6,  and demonstrated function of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in mammalian cells.  The characterization of the fungal promoters was successfully performed with an X-gal analysis, where the expression of ß-galactosidase results in blue colonies. Furthermore, quantitative ß-galactosidase and Bradford assays were performed in order to measure protein production and ß-galactosidase activity. Both promoters proved to be of medium strength. For demonstration of the Plug' Play with DNA system in mammalian cell lines, U-2 OS was transfected with plasmids containing genes encoding fluorescent proteins. The transfected cells capability to express the fluorescent proteins was investigated with confocal microscopy, which resulted in amazing pictures of fluorescent peroxisomes and coloured U-2 SO cells.

Since, it is proven that rats possess an innate fear response to this compound even in trace concentrations, we decide to use this approach to develop a rat deterrent which would serve our purpose and alleviate post harvest losses faced by the farmers of our country. But we didn’t stop there! We knew that the hallmark of a true societal venture is the ability to convert a “Project into a Product”. To this end we decide to develop the following:
RATTEL
TOMCAT
BIOREACTOR
RATTEL-RAT Timidity tester from Evidence based Learning
In order to get the maximum output from minimum input we integrated a new facet to our Product Design and created a software for the most effective deployment of TOMCAT. This led to the development of RATTEL, a software based on Active Brownian Dynamics designed to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of murines exposed to Pheromone based on experimental parameters and field data. This is used to predict the best location for device deployment, given possible points of entry of murines, environmental factors, and the configuration of placed stored grains, such that the aversion response seen in the murines is the maximum.
A user of TOMCAT can easily use this software, and rest assured that the location at which TOMCAT is deployed is the most efficient for that particular environment.
TOMCAT -Topologically OptiMized Click Activated Tool
In order to deploy our Genetically Modified Organism (GMO), we had to make sure that our product was robust enough to be deployed in the granaries of farmers, have a reasonable shelf life, and be secure enough not to allow any GMO to escape.
This led to the development of TOMCAT and TOMCAT+
Two 3D printed yeast incubating modules, containing highly nutritious media in the form of a hydrogel and our GMO in spore form in a sealed chamber on the inner walls of the device. The device contains another secondary chamber containing the lysis media. A novel feature in our device is that the spores can stay in the sealed chamber in their dormant state for a very long time, and can be spread on top of the media at any time following a simple click mechanism.
Steps to use TOMCAT:
Note: Further, optimization will be carried out to increase the period over which TOMCAT produces FearOmone.
Note: The minimum period after which the second button must be clicked is 2 days, so that"

Expression of Cas9-expresso constructs in C321ΔA
Both the acquired Cas9-expresso constructs as well as pEVOL-Asp were transformed into C321ΔA as described in Lajoie et al. (2013) 1 .
Sept 1 - Okt 10
Expression of Cas9-expresso constructs in C321ΔA
An expression experiment was performed with 3 ml cultures induced overnight with rhamnose, arabinose and synthetic amino acids when applicable. This yielded no visible Cas9 bands.  The same happened when 5 ml cultures where induced for 4 hours. What worked, was the protocol with bigger volumes followed by Ni-NTA purification (the majority of the actual work with the FPLC was performed by a supervisor)
First, samples were purified as described, but with addition of DNAse. This gave good yields, but DNAse remained in the purified fractions as was later found out during in vitro Cas9 assays. However, without DNAse also a good yield was obtained.

The green line indicates the amount of His buffer B that is passed through the column.
SDS-PAGE was performed on different fractions after purification. a) Cas9. b) dCas9. c) dCas9-Ala10BipA. d) dCas9-Ala10Asp. e)dCas9-Ala10TAG, no synthetic amino acid.
in vitro Cas9 cleaving assays
Assays were performed with all produced guide RNAs, according to the protocol . Substrate for cleaving was a PCR product including the gene encoding RFP, which is targeted at the N-terminal side, both on the template strand (guideRNA 2 and 4) and the non-template strand (gRNA 1). Size of the uncleaved PCR product is 4140 bp, cleaving generates a 3100 bp and a 1040 bp fragment.
No Cas9 biobrick?
When I started making the constructs for the Cas9 kill switch, two approaches were taken: taking the Cas9 that is available in the iGEM registry (BBa_K1218011) and pdCas9 (Addgene plasmid # 46569) as a starting point for making mutations and expressing Cas9. I did not manage to transfer BBa_K1218011 to another backbone. Furthermore"

Was ist iGEM?
Die International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) ist einer der renommiertesten internationalen Wettbewerbe im Bereich der Synthetischen Biologie (SynBio) für studentische Teams. Im Verlauf einer Wettbewerbsperiode (ca. 8 Monate) entwickeln die interdisziplinären Teams ein künstliches biologisches System durch die Kombination von Gen-Bausteinen (BioBricks) unterschiedlicher Herkunft in einem Träger-Organismus. Diese BioBricks werden im Verlauf des Projekts selbst hergestellt oder von Teams aus den vorherigen Jahren bezogen - der Open Source-Gedanke ist ein wichtiges Element der iGEM competition.
Seitdem der Wettbewerb im Jahr 2003 zum ersten Mal vom Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ausgerichtet wurde, wurden schon viele Systeme mit einer (potenziellen) Anwendungsmöglichkeit in den Bereichen Umweltschutz und Medizin entwickelt, wobei beispielsweise Biosensoren, Selbstzerstörungsmechanismen für GVOs und Methoden zur Bekämpfung von schweren Krankheiten häufige Projektthemen darstellen. Regelmäßig werden auch ganz neue Systeme/Techniken wie CRISPR/cas oder TALEs von iGEM-Teams aufgegriffen und in den Wettbewerb eingeführt.
Das Team Tuebingen wurde 2012 von Studenten und Studentinnen der  Biochemie, Bioinformatik, Biologie und Pharmazie gegründet. Mit dem ""Tübingen Yeast Progestin Screen (TYPS)"" konnte dieses Team einen Bronze Award erreichen. 2013 setzte das Team Tübingen das TYPS-Projekt (siehe auch ""Projekt 2013"") fort und konnte sich aufgrund der Erfahrungen vom Vorjahr einen Silver Award erarbeiten. Im Rahmen von iGEM2014 wurde mit der Erstellung eines Systems zur Umwandlung der Blutgruppen A, B und AB in O komplett neues Terrain beschritten.

8.
We exchanged the Triple SpyTag-SUP monomer for Triple SpyTag-LBP or Triple SpyTag-CBP, and tried using the same strategy to adsorb lead and cadmium. The results were remarkable, clearly demonstrating that the Uranium Reaper strategy has much potential to be expanded to other heavy metals. (Learn more)
 
 
Even though the efficiency of the Uranium Reaper system may be somewhat lower than current methods, it could certainly be optimized through further development work. Importantly, Uranium Reaper is much better in other aspects. In the future, we plan to optimize the entire Uranium Reaper strategy in order to enhance the adsorption efficiency.

Day 61 14/09/15
We miniprepped our plasmids, digested them and then ran them on a gel to see if we had successfully assembled our biobricks. We set up two more soft agar plates, one containing VS45 expressing the fusion protein CsgA ss - Sup35 and the other with VS45 containing no external plasmid. We incubated these at 37ºC overnight. We measured the conductivity of the inoculated plates produced on the 11/09/15. We also used AFM imaging to confirm that our fusion protein was being expressed in the incubated VS45 cells
Day 62 15/09/15
We digested our biobricks and ran them on an agarose gel. We also prepared our samples for shipment. We measured the conductivity of our three different soft plates, one expressing conductive amyloid fibres, one expressing amyloid fibres lacking cytochrome and our negative control, with no amyloid. AFM imaging was done to see the progress of amyloid growth on inducing plates
Day 63 16/09/15
We digested more of our biobrick and ran it on an agarose gel. We spent the remainder of the day writing for the wiki. We measured the conductivity of our soft plates. AFM imaging was done to see expression of amyloid fibres in our cells
Day 64 17/09/15
We used AFM to image our cells. We also measured the conductivity of the soft plates. The rest of the time was spent writing for the wiki and updating it.

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," training and efficient surveillance will be a time bomb for which we do know that monstrous harmful bioproducts will be made someday in the future, and indeed, it will be a significant threat to the current biosafety basis. Recall our memory to iGEM2009, Peking surveyed DIY bio, almost ten years later, we conducted a similar DIY bio-survey. We tried to order materials for molecular experiments, using the delivery address to our home, and the result was quite shocking that we can buy almost everything for the molecular experiment, from the internet. Then, we went through relevant laws and regulations throughout the world, in which we found no laws related to credit certification and the address certification about the people who book the biology reagent. Most of the laws are about the quality certification and how they would serve the user after they bought this. We interviewed the Director of a center for disease control and prevention. He said that in his experiment with the disease caused by the bacteria leak, vast impacts such as environmental pollution had been observed. and our country has been making great effort towards elimenating such leakage accidents and incidents. He said it is not easy to solve the problem with hard work, rather it needs the cooperation between all the countries. He made an example of 731 army during the second world war two, in which the outbreak of pathogens caused significant physical and social harm. We are still on our way to win the battle, and the effort still needs to be put in.
Community and Future
Also, we hosted two major meeting in Beijing. In a biosafety forum in October, we invited a team leader who runs his high school lab, lab teachers from a university lab, and a former team member from Peking iGEM2009, who participated in their DIY bio investigation ten years ago.
We concluded that the development of DIY bio should be taken seriously, and the permanent way to solve its safety and security concerns is through implanting biosafety awareness into our academic culture. Also, as iGEMers, we should strive to be the considerate and responsible leaders in our community, to ensure the biosafety issue has been taken properly. Another meeting was with biology Olympians all over China, in which we discussed the future of biology community during the meeting, especially with more and more high school iGEM teams coming up in China contrasted with the lack of relevant instruction and education to the students. We came up with the idea of setting up a collaboration between schools to share and overcome difficulties hand in hand. This kind of meeting will be continued after iGEM2018, since the community usually grows"

Random positioning machine (RPM)
Since many bacteria are known to behave differently in space, we are interested in the effects of simulated Martian gravity on gene expression. Various bacteria are known to grow faster and become (more) pathogenic in space and we wanted to know if this was also the case on Mars. As such, we measured gene expression in 3 different conditions: 1g (control), 0.37g (Martian gravity) and 0g (space, ISS). Of course, we cannot actually travel to Mars to experience its gravity, but instead, we used the Random Positioning Machine (RPM 2.0) by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands. The Random Positioning Machine by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands is a machine that allows us to do the impossible: experience Martian gravity here on Earth! The machine calculates a path over 3 axes, that will average the gravity exerted on whatever we put inside. This way, we can simulate any amount of gravity between 0g (e.g. space, ISS) and 1g (Earth). Martian gravity is approximately 0.37g and we performed many of our experiments with this amount of gravity. This way, we can accurately predict the behaviour of our E. coli nizer, using experimental conditions that would also be experienced on Mars!              Four strains, Pseudomonas putida and three different E. coli strains, were used. These strains were spread on agar plates and these plates were kept under different gravities: the gravity on earth and the gravity on Mars.
RNA sequencing
Using differential gene-expression. For the iGEM competition, we would like to identify highly up and downregulated genes, so that their respective promoters can be used as gravity BioBricks. This will allow other contestants to use our promoters which will ensure their intended system also works under Martian gravity. Furthermore, we want to asses whether E. coli displays the same changes on Mars as observed in space. Perhaps the Martian gravity is sufficient to suppress potential pathogenicity and perhaps we will uncover that it will be just as dangerous as"

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#BioPlastic Recycling: PHB_-_-_TEXT.html," the plastic can be completely degraded in 6 minutes. The reason for fast degradation is that we have relative large kinetic parameters for the enzyme. Polylactic acid was not used as the substrate in our kinetic assays. Therefore, we made an assumption that polylactic acid in the model has similar chain length as that of the substrate in the assays. In reality, the PLA plastic is in solid form which enzymes can only degrade the plastic from the surface. The efficiency of degradation will be massively reduced due the 3D geometry. A 3D model is needed for future improvements of plastic degradation. The kinetic data of degrading solid form of PLA also need to be defined.

Our chassis can grow with P(3HB) and 3HB▼
Summary
Our chassis can grow and survive in reasonable concentrations of P(3HB) and 3HB. To increase tolerance to 3HB we have re-designed our system to include expression of Bdh2 (BBa_K1149050, 3HB dehydrogenase), which breaks down 3HB to acetoacetate.  Acetoacetate toxicity was examined and these data are being utilised along with our metabolic models to determine the effects of differing levels of 3HB and acetoacetate on bioplastic (P3HB) production.
MG1655 transformed with either native phaCAB or empty vector (control) plasmid were grown for 6h in LB containing 3-HB or P-3HB to assess any potential toxicities associated with these bioplasrics.
3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)
Toxicity of 3-hydroxybutyrate in LB with phaCAB and EV expression. 3HB was tested at 5 concentrations for toxicity - 1 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM, 10 mM and 237 mM. Between 10 mM and 237 mM, there is a clear toxicity effect observed. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.

Promoters and integration vector for Synechocystis from iGEM Utah State received. Promoters/integration vector in pSB1C3 used to transform E. Coli. Cultures streaked and grown overnight. Colonies selected from streaked plates, liquid cultures grown overnight. Liquid cultures miniprepped to isolate plasmids. Digestion using EcoR1 and Pst1 performed on each of isolated plasmids including INV ang GLF, gels run and imaged. LB with 30% glycerol stock prepared for freezing of E. Coli. An apparatus for growing Synechocystis was prepared using a flask and glass tubing connected to an aquarium pump to aerate the culture. Synechocystis was grown in a photobioreactor for four days, and the OD730 was measured once a day to determine growth. Synechocystis was grown in BG-11 medium with either 0% glucose or 50 mM glucose. Over four days, the OD730 did not change for either type of culture. This indicates that the Synechocystis did not grow, and that modifications to the growth apparatus are necessary. A larger volume of culture is necessary, as well as a humidifying device.

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," ScAvidin and free enzyme by the reaction described in figure 5:
Figure 5: Overview of primary enzymatic reaction.
Besides the central parameter k1, which is the reaction rate constant for the reaction, both snake venom concentration and the concentration of the expressed composite part seems to have an influence on the rate of the reaction. As the snake venom proteases are not depleted during the reaction, no differential equation for concentration of venom is made. That leaves us with a very manageable set of ODE’s (Figure 6):
Figure 6: ODE’s for the primary enzymatic reaction
When simulating these ODE’s, the initial venom concentration is set to be 100 ug/mL, as this was the highest concentration of venom that we used in our experiments. The initial fusion protein concentration is set as being 2.47×10-6 mol/L (2.47 uM), as this is the maximum binding capacity of our biotinylated beads [1]. The reaction rate constant has been determined from the data of our protease substrate assay, where we calculated a rate constant of k1 = 0,014 on the basis of the data from Bitis gabonica venom on well O22 of the substrate set.
Figure 7: Plot of the concentration of released β-gal as a function of time.
As can be seen in figure 7, the crossover time, where the concentration of released enzyme exceeds that of the substrate, is around 50 minutes. The time-scale seems to be realistic, and seems to be matching our experiences with our own substrate/venom reactions. For future calculations, the time used in this first reaction will be referred to as “T1” .
Secondary reaction
The secondary reaction is described in figure 8. ONPG is catalysed by β-galactosidase to ONP and galactose. As the reaction runs at Vmax due to the high substrate concentration, the rate constant for the conversion of ONPG can be described by kcat.
Figure 8: Depiction of the secondary reaction
The goal was to see if an optimal incubation time for the primary enzymatic reaction could be identified. We calculated the concentration of ONP needed to give off an output signal that corresponds to what we would expect, if we had used amilCP as a reporter molecule, and incubated our device for 60 minutes. The theoretical absorbance of amilCP released after an hour of venom incubation can be calculated from the β-galactosidase function determined from the primary reaction above, and the molar"

1. 3+net
3+net is a new concept in the environment track, jointly proposed by ECUST-China and many other universities in China. The purpose is to provide guidance and reference for the iGEM team and bioremediation field. 3+net separately elaborated from the three perspectives of application, biosecurity and society, and explored the relationship among the three.
In order to provide more feasible suggestions for others and better translate laboratory results into technologies with social value, 3+net summarize the protocols for general bacterial resistance elimination from the application point of view; The suicide switch and mechanism, summed up the hardware of various scenarios of soil, water and air; from the social perspective, formulated iGEMer's laws and regulations on bioremediation from China, and investigated the opinions of Chinese people on applying biotechnology to environmental governance. 3+net provides a universal solution to the current problems, which will greatly promote the development of bioremediation.

As a member of 3+net, we took on the task of hardware. This is somehow a big problem. Every year, many “environment track” teams develop amazing biological pathways, which provides the possibility to solve some practical problems. However, time is limited. As for the platform of the application-hardware device, these teams will encounter difficulties more or less. Many teams are taking the detours that others have already traveled over and over again. We hope to solve this problem - in fact, many teams' projects are consistent in the application scenario, we can classify these application scenarios and provide an optimal hardware template for each situation. In the future, the team can find a template and modify it to suit their projects.

iii) Modelling
Since the parts that we have found belongs to yeast organism, it was hard to us to manipulate it in bacteria E.coli. We designed the tests of this part by characterizing one of the subunits of methane monooxgenase (MMo). For the functional activity of monooxygenase enzyme, there are required 3 subunits as A,B and C. The A subunit of methane monooxygenase is 210 kDa protein that is supposed as the methane binding active site of monoxygenase complex. This protein consists of non-haem iron and contains p-hydroxo bridge structure. We planned the experiments of this step as characterization of protein A by PCR amplification with specific primers of full construct device to obtained the sequence of protein A. The methane gas is applied to cell culture with our modelled device then the cells were centrifuged and the gas concentration is measured from supernatant.

Users can change the integration site by engineering the vector: <partinfo>BBa_K300986</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K300987</partinfo> are flanked by two AvrII and two NheI respectively and for this reason the two Homologous Regions can be excided. New homologous sequences compatible with RFC10 can be digested with XbaI-SpeI and assembled because AvrII, NheI, XbaI and SpeI have compatible sticky ends. Note that this assembly is not directional and the correct orientation can be validated through sequencing with standard VF2 and VR primers.

Self-cleaving affinity tags to easily purify proteins
Conventional affinity-based protein purification methods rely on specific binding of the fusion tag to an immobilized ligand, but they are affected by severe limitations, as explained in the Motivation section. Briefly, they imply the use of expensive proteases for tag removal from the fusion protein, requiring the appropriate aminoacidic sequence to be included between the tag and the target protein. Moreover, the cost of the affinity resins used in the process is far from negligible, especially on industrial scale.
The use of self-cleaving protein elements coupled with innovative affinity tags has been recently proposed to overcome these limitations. For all these reasons, in this section a technique compliant to the BioBrick assembly standard and based on self-splicing affinity tags derived from the fusion of Phasins, Inteins and a short flexible linker is proposed.
Tag
Phasin
Phasins are proteins involved in formation and stabilization of PolyHydroxyAlkanoates (PHA), intracytoplasmic inclusions in microorganisms like Ralstonia eutropha which serve as carbon and energy storage. As such, Phasins exhibit highly specific binding to PHA granules and can be used to create tags for proteins, while PHB can be used as the affinity matrix.
In literature, it has also been shown that the Phasin-tag"

""With a knife, you can cut bread or slit another person's throat: that's ""dual use"". Originally, the term comes from the export control and stands for technology, machinery and software that can be used not only peacefully, but also for military purposes. In the current discussion about dual use, it is often also about the misuse of such goods by terrorists. They are subject to special export controls or restrictions and are listed in various national and international lists. Sometimes ""dual use"" also very generally refers to any harmful, immoral or dubious use of technology, such as when learning pattern recognition programs are used to monitor or manipulate humans. Technologies, machines, software: these are products that usually start with scientific research. Research is free and in basic research, unrestrained curiosity is not only allowed, but desired. However, researchers need to think about what they are developing, whose hands their results could reach, and what might become of them in the worst case scenario. This applies not only to the developers of centrifuges, which can be used in medicine as well as for the production of nuclear bombs, or for chemists who work on substances that could be used for chemical weapons, but for all researchers, including e.g. findings of psychology on the manipulability of humans. Presumably, no scientific discipline can fundamentally be dismissed from these considerations. In 2011, researchers from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam changed avian influenza viruses so that even mammals could transmit them, thus triggering a debate: May science have to do that to better assess the risk of pandemics? Or does it  unintentionally help bioterrorists? In 2017, Canadian researchers rebuilt the extinct horsepox virus. A dispute over the question of whether such research results should be published followed. Is full disclosure always the best way for everyone? The dual use problem is also very present in artificial intelligence (AI) research. Since its inception, AI research has been and continues to be heavily promoted by the military.

As an example for a scenario where crop nutritional                         improvement is needed, we imagine a farmer from South                         America, for example Brazil. He wants to grow his own                         tomato variety (Solanum lycopersicum) but with an                         increased concentration of b-carotene and lycopene. The                         amount of cases of deficit in the intake of these two                         compounds is high in these regions.
The carotenoid biosynthesis pathway branches after the                         formation of lycopene. One important branch forms                         carotenoids such as b-carotene or violaxanthin. By                         reducing the expression of lycopene e-cyclase (e-CYC),                         carotenoid synthesis is up-regulated in seeds. The                         higher total carotenoid content resulting from                         reduction of this protein expression suggests that this                         gene is a rate-limiting step in the carotenoid                         biosynthesis pathway(7). Employing the user-friendly                         strategy of HYPE-IT this gene can be silenced by                         knocking it out in order to obtain the desired                         phenotype.
Nutritional impact
Carotenoids are essential for the organism as they are                         antioxidants that contribute to lower the risk of                         developing cardiovascular illnesses or some types of                         cancer. Additionally, b-carotenes are precursors of                         vitamin A, needed for a correct development of the                         organism. Vitamin A deficiency represents an important                         problem. It is calculated that 251 million children                         less than 5 years old have vitamin A deficit. In fact,                         an estimated 250 000 to 500 000 vitamin A-deficient children become blind every year, half of them dying                         within 12 months of losing their sight. (8) Moreover,                         between 1 and 2.5 million of deaths are related to                         enteric and respiratory diseases caused by this                         deficiency every year (9)(10)
Environmental impact
Improving quality of the tomatoes will require a higher                         demand, and consequently, the production. As a                         consequence of the overexploitation of the terrain, the                         farmer will need to increase the expenses in water,                         fertilizer, pesticides and other investments. The                         consumption of these natural resources causes                         environmental problems that need to be taken into                         consideration. Furthermore, carbon emissions due to                         fuel and energy expenses will be increased.
Socio-economic impact
A better tomato nutritional value will have a higher                         demand in the global market because the farmer will                         increase his yield, rising his income and possibly,                         creating new job positions.

Background
Background - The era of cellular memory
Biological memory has currently been defined as a sustained cellular response to a transient stimulus1. Cellular memory devices with cell or cell population have been developed in recent years. Some of them are based on transcriptional level, like toggle switch2, the others are based on DNA level by employing various recombinases3, 4 or CRISPR5, 6. Although existing devices may have different functioning mechanisms, they all share the same ability to store the past and retrieve it whenever we need. Here, we will introduce some existing memory devices and the potential usage of cellular memory before introducing our project.
Memory devices based on transcriptional level
There are two types of devices in this category, toggle switches and positive-feedback loops. They all store the information by staying in a certain transcriptional state. Most of the devices here are mimics of circuits that have already existed in various organisms.
After the bacteriophage lambda switch was found in 2000, a genetic toggle switch was firstly constructed in Escherichia coli2 as a memory device(Fig.1). With this repression loop, the transcriptional system switches between two stable states. As shown, the repression loop mainly consists of two components, promoters and repressors(known as transcriptional factor). Repressor 1 inhibits Promoter 1 from expressing Represser 2, while Repressor 2 inhibits Promoter 2 from expressing Represser 1. In other words, Represser 1 and Represser 2 are mutual antagonists, which means only one of them can be highly expressed. Without inducers, both of the states are possible. However, after the induction, things may change. For example, when Repressor 1 is highly expressed, Inducer 1 can stop the inhibition of Repressor 1 and starts transcribing Repressor 2. After that, Repressor 2 represses Promoter 2, thus reducing the concentration of Represser 1 and switching to another state. Furthermore, even if Inducer 1 disappears after the transient induction, this state is stable. By adding a reporter following either"

Coli hosts with the gene for Dispersin B, which was released along with the phage progeny. The researchers achieved 99.997% degradation of the biofilm. This is essentially what we are thinking to do: engineer a phage to infect a bacterial host with a gene that expresses a protein that will accelerate the degradation of cholera’s biofilm. These researchers show that it is possible for E.Coli. OUR PLAN: Our first step needs to be to get cholera-specific phages to work with. CTX theta phage is a very famous and well characterized (we found a paper elucidating it’s entire genome) cholera-specific bacteriophage. It is a temperate phage. Chinese researchers used VP4 phage to study serotype O1 cholera. In"

We have maintained this wild-type sequence of the gvp gene repeats, as this arrangement has been found to be conserved in the buoyant  strains of P. rubescens. We hypothesize that the preservation of this sequence may have influence  stoichiometric control of gvp subunits, or transcriptional efficiency.
As of now, the gvp3.0 construct is still undergoing thorough characterization. Though, the BioBrick has been sequenced verified and submitted to the iGEM BioBrick Registry as part of Team UAlberta’s Parts Submission. Currently, we have performed a series of buoyancy assays with gvp3.0 transformed E. coli. Though, we have been getting inconclusive results as different instances of our buoyancy assays have shown different indications of buoyancy, while some have not.
A promising sign which may indicate that the gvp3.0 construct is successful in generating gas vesicles when expressed are our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs. With the help of Dr. Xuejun Sun and Mrs. Priscilla Gao, we have obtained images of our gvp3.0 transformants where structures, that resemble those of gas vesicles, as described in [insert citation], are observed. However, it will be necessary to repeat imaging of our samples with TEM with a separate biological replicate to confirm that gas vesicles are being synthesized.
We faced several difficulties before getting to the final gvp3.0 construct. Our first attempt in the assembly of the gas vesicle proteins, which we referred to as gvp1.0, attempted to clone in 11 gas vesicle genes split up into 3 gblocks. Unfortunately, after many, many attempts, we were unsuccessful in assembling the whole cluster using Gibson Assembly. So, it was back to gene design once again! During our gvp2.0 attempt, we had another gas vesicle construct, based on the gas vesicle gene cluster from Planktothrix rubescens , being made in parallel.  A paper published by 2012 iGEM team, Ocean University China, used two genes from the cyanobacteria and they were able to observe buoyancy. However, after some further digging, recent iGEM teams, like Groningen 2014, were not able to replicate their results. Thankfully, our discussion with iGEM team IISc Bangalore lead us to other literature which convinced us to use the wild type gene sequence in P. rubescens to help our chances in conferring"
Grinnell,2011,Team:Grinnell CN#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"C3 plasmids containing the three promotors.
The transformations had a lot of small colonies, too many to count.  4 isolatable colonies from each transformation were prepared through freeze-thaw and PCR amplified to confirm sizes.  Sizes of four colonies were unclear because the promotors are so small that it is difficult to tell the difference between a band that contains only WT dspB and one that contains both WT dspB and a promotor ( DspB Figure 2 and the first four lanes of Esp Figure ). Therefore, a sample of WT dspB was PCR amplified as a standard for comparison and run on a gel against the ambiguous transformation results ( DspB Figure 3 ).  These gels confirmed the sizes of WT dspB + PrsaA and WT dspB + the BioBrick promotor BBa_K081005 but not WT dspB + Pxyl.
Four more colonies were freeze-thawed and PCR amplified and run on a gel against the standard WT dspB but none contained WT dspB + Pxyl ( DspB Figure 4 ).
Week 7 July 10-16
WT dspB: PrsaA + WT dspB and BBa_K081005 + WT dspB were miniprepped.  Will continue working on WT dspB when we recieve the sequencing results and determine whether we need to make new primers to eliminate the stop codon from the gene.  4 more colonies were picked from the transformation of WT dspB into Pxyl and two colonies showed the expected size ( Figure ).  This band was gel extracted because of the presence of another brighter band.  WT dspB + Pxyl was then digested with EcoRI and PstI and then ligated into pSB1C3 previously digested with EcoRI and PstI and then transformed into E. coli Top10.  The results of this transformation were confirmed on a gel ( Figure )
Optimized dspB: 4 colonies from the transformation of optimized dspB were PCR amplified and one colony showed the correct size ( Figure ).  An overnight culture of this colony was miniprepped, digested with SpeI and PstI and ligated with rsaA that had been previously gel extracted and digested with XbaI and PstI and then transformed.  4 colonies from the transformation plate were PCR amplified and 3 matched the expected size of optimized dspB + rsaA ( Figure ).

Development of the Project
 
In order to test the expression of foreign CDI systems in DH5-α and Enterobacter aerogenes, we need to express each CDI system on a plasmid. We first received two recombinant E. coli strains from the Hayes lab located at the University of California, Santa Barbara: EPI100 with  pDAL930, containing the CDI system from EC869, and X90 with pDAL660, containing the CDI system from EC93. Our next objective was to transform electrocompetent DH5-α with pDAL930 and pDAL660 to see if we could express foreign CDI systems in DH5-α. We performed competition and aggregation assays on the transformed DH5-α, using the strains obtained from the Hayes lab as positive controls and ampicillin resistant DH5-α as a negative control. Assuming this is successful, we would move on to expressing two CDI systems derived from Enterobacter aerogenes in DH5-α individually and performing the same set of assays. These CDI systems must be isolated from genomic DNA and constructed into plasmids using Gibson assembly and overlap PCR. We plan on fusing the CdiA and CdiB genes from Enterobacter aerogenes with the CdiA-CT and CdiI genes of EC93, and inserting this chimeric construct into a pSC101-derived pSK33 backbone. Successful colonies are screened using CPCR and sequencing.

This way of thinking was also felt by the team in the way that when one is immersed in the practice of synthetic biology, one gets a better understanding of how much of the uncertainty is actually perceived as a social construction without having a good understanding of the scientific process.
[Georgia] ""The whole scientific process, I think part of the reason that scientists say that the science is good because we see every step of the way. We see like what we go through and the safety aspects and if, if the public was taken on that journey with us, they’d be more likely to kind of like hold a similar opinion because I feel like sometimes there are these misconceptions that scientists come and go in the lab and decide to do this one day and create crazy things (…). But if they were there from the offset watching us struggle and trying to make everything perfect, there might be less of a worry from the general public that we’re crazy"".
...
[Tanel] ""I think the advantages of engaging with them just, I mean they have no idea what we have been up to, as you said, from the start to the beginning, and understanding what it entails. That’s our responsibility"".
[Georgia] ""I think both sides, that they keep checks on us. We help them understand. I think it’s that way of doing it in general in science, just always having people that aren’t entirely immersed in this world. Being a part of it and being here to spread the word"".
All this gives an indication of the self-correcting risk society explained by Maurie Cohen (1997). Uncertainty becomes recognised or is rendered acceptable as a source for social and institutional learning, here exemplified by the iGEM competition. Therefore, it can also be termed as a reflexive governance that aims for a sustainable development of synthetic biology (Voss et al. 2006).
Conclusion
The advent of emerging technologies, at a time when environmental deterioration creeps up on the edges of modern society, has led to a crumbling of the certainties in power and knowledge that the institutions of modernity use to be able to provide. From the premise of technological optimism, these technologies are strategically employed in order to ‘outsmart’ any ecological setback as long as our societal framework adopts the necessary environmental reforms. The promise revolutionary change that synthetic biology brings, thus falls into that same category, and aims to recalibrate the reductionist logic of modern industrial practices. However, in trying to erase the measurable risks of such a classical industrial hazard like toxic textile dye effluents, the Goodbye AzoDye project of U"

We noted that even without the LovTAP expression part (K191003), part BBa_K191005, the LovTAP reporter construct, expressed RFP. We attributed this to the presence of tryptophan in LB (which activates expression of RFP in K191005, and so we created and tested a Minimal Media solution that did not have tryptophan in it.
At this point, material from PKU arrived, and we transformed and made glycerol stock/miniprep of nearly all the parts they sent. We were unable, however, to transform a crucial component of our circuit - the memory module (with Kan resistance). This, at first, was because of a tricky kanamycin resistance in our competent cell stock! After much time spent resolving this contamination, we proceeded to re-transform the bistable part (into DH5a), but still were unable. Note: At the point of the wiki freeze, we have still been unable to transform this part, but will attempt to do so again before the Jamboree.
From the LovTAP-repressed reporter construct, which we termed WT LovTAP R2, we obtained solely the double-repressor component (TrpR-RBS-TetR-p(TetR)) by PCR, to which we added the rfc 21 standard restriction sites (as the TrpR promoter has illegal speI sites, making it incompatible with rfc 10). This new part, termed Lov2 was then ligated into pGEM, transformed and miniprepped.
We transformed and made stock of CI and AraC from the registry, and Mnt-TerTer from team Davidson-Missouri Western. By PCR, we added to the left hand of each CI, AraC, and Mnt-TerTer the bgl standard prefix + RBS, and to the right hand side bgl suffix. Once these products were ligated into pGEM, transformed and miniprepped, we were poised to perform a rolling assembly to create a composite part Lov2+RBS+CI+RBS+AraC+RBS+Mnt+TerTer.
As we were running short of time and the summer had concluded, we decided to add only CI to the LovTAP repressed double repressor. We double digested CI from the registry and a double terminator and ligated the two. PCR was performed to obtain bgl-prefix+RBS+CI+TerTer+bgl-suffix.

A little bit of information about the problem
By the end of 2013 iGEM World Jamboree...
...iGEM Foundation vice-president Meagan Lizarazo came to us with a question: Why does Latin America have such a low participation on iGEM? And what could we do to improve that?
To answer those questions, team UFMG 2014 worked hard and focused our human practices on this subject.
We analyzed the data on iGEM team participation over the years. As we can observe in the graphs, iGEM grows every year (Figure 1), and Latin America participation grows too (Figure 2).
However, our share of participation, in comparison with other continents, is really small. We are stuck at a ~5% participation, which has oscillated but not really changed over the years. Asia and Europe started their participation on iGEM at low rates as well, but they were able to grow. Since around 2010, Asia, Europe and North America converged to an equal participation on iGEM, having a share of around 30%  each (Figure 3), while Latin America runs far behind.
But why does this happen? Why can’t Latin America improve its participation on iGEM?
Why?
To investigate why Latin America is not well represented on iGEM, we decided to apply a questionnaire to all teams from Latin America that have participated in iGEM over the years.
During our brainstorms to formulate the questionnaire, we noticed that the obstacles we face taking part on iGEM are pretty much the same ones that impair the development of all scientific research in our region.
Our questionnaire was then targeted on the difficulty of doing research in Latin America as a whole, focusing on problems we have struggled with and which we believe are the main barriers for Science here.
It consisted of seven questions:
What is the limiting factor for scientific research project development?
On average, how long does it take to get the imported orders in your lab?
How was your experience of import for scientific research projects?
Have you ever been forced to abandon a project due to problems with the import of material?
Is funding provided by development"
Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," target DNA. Due to the origin of replication limits described in the SynORI 2017 iGEM project last year, it is necessary to limit bacterial transformations to only three plasmids. In order to deliver five DNA constructs with only three plasmids, we used Gibson Assembly to clone our constructs onto the shared plasmids (Figure 4).
Fig. 4 - The three combination plasmids used in the Cerberus DNA Detection system.
While the original idea was to heat shock in linear fragments of target DNA to detect, after consulting with graduate students familiar with bacterial transformations we determined that this strategy would potentially be ineffective due to bacterial recombination altering the target DNA sequences. Therefore we instead chose to target a whole GFP plasmid that we could guarantee would be transformed into the cell without sequence alteration.
We specifically chose to target a GFP plasmid because we could then confirm binding of each dCas9 protein independently. For example, adding just the plasmid with the adCas9 fusion protein plus the sgRNA (far right in Figure 4) and the GFP plasmid leads to knockdown of GFP but no RFP transcription, thus proving successful targeting and binding of the sgRNA and pyogenes dCas9.
Targeting GFP Plasmid
Fig. 5 These six diagrams represent the six different sgRNA constructs we designed in order to optimize for ideal spacing distance between the two dCas9 molecules as well as the ideal orientation for which the dCas9s land on the target DNA.
When initially discussing the system with Dr. Qi, we asked the question: What is the ideal spacing length between the two regions we are targeting on the GFP plasmid? While Dr. Qi could recommend having a minimum spacing region of about 20 bp given the size of the dCas9s, the actual ideal spacing distance could be anywhere from 20 to 100 base pairs and was a statistic that needed to be optimized for our specific system.
Additionally, there were three possible orientations in which the two dCas9 molecules could land on the molecule depending on whether they bound to the coding or template strand of DNA. Given the orientation and inter-sgRNA-target spacing length, we devised six different sets of sgRNA constructs to test each dCas9 orientation at a short (20 to 40 bp) and a long (50 to 90 bp) interspace region (Figure 5)
One limitation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence must be present in the target DNA directly upstream of the 20 bp"

IGEM 2013 team member selection has been successfully concluded! 18 students from the school of life science were selected from numerous candidates. Among them, 12 are juniors and 6 are sophomores. We believe our new team will achieve more than previous years!
Preparation for the coming 2013 igem competition get started after the close of 2012 igem competition. Several members of the 2012 team, including FanXiao, YangTianF, ZhuMeng, ShiXxiaoJ, LiJinY and SunXiaoC, had a meeting at 21th, November. During the meeting, they discussed about convening the first team meeting, exchanged views on the weak points of the previous project, and shared the lessons they learned. They concluded that:
1) the standard part must be used in the project--even if not used in the core part.
2) when coming to the importance of the project, the reasons shall be logically unflawed. Viable application should be included that benefits the society.
3) creativity \innovation is of great importance.
4) data and reference must be presented with the PART.
5) the MODEL part should be improved: members in the MODEL team should understand every detail in the MODEL including parameters, solvability and application. Ideally, MODEL should be a reliable guide to the wet experiments.
6) more efforts should be devoted in helping other teams.

Disparities in water also exist on more local levels within these countries. In China, the southern part of the country experiences sufficient precipitation and rich groundwater supplies but the North is particularly drought-prone. With large cities like Beijing and Tianjin situated in the North, water distribution is a pressing concern.
Pollution of water supplies is also a significant issue faced by countries. According to the UN, only 28% of wastewater is Russia is properly treated and just 20% in Brazil. This contaminates freshwater supplies and can make otherwise safe water non-potable. A recent survey by the Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources states that only 22% of the countries groundwater supply is safe for human consumption (CMLR 2013) (Cohen & Siu 2013).

Case Study: California
California is the USA’s most populous state containing one eighth of American people. More than 90% of the region is under severe water stress (US Drought Monitor 2014).
The widespread drought is likely to worsen due to climate change, Diffenbaugh (2014) notes: “Research finds that extreme atmospheric high pressure in this region – which is strongly linked to unusually low precipitation in California – is much more likely to occur today than prior to the human emission of greenhouse gases that began during the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s”.
The ramifications could be severe. The drought is estimated to cost more than $2.2 billion to the Californian economy, with 17,100 part-time and seasonal jobs being lost (Howit 2014).
At present, California relies on groundwater reserves in order to replace surface water losses. If the drought continues for more than 2 years it will lead to significant groundwater depletion. and increasing costs of groundwater. This increase is not predicted to impact the prices of commodities and so would be translated as loss of revenue for farmers (Howitt et al 2014).

MARS Repository
Summary
Microfluidic devices are often highly specific, performing entire specialized experiments on a chip. This means that these chips are not useful or relevant to an average member of the synthetic biology community.
With this in mind, we set out to make the MARS repository. This repository would consist of generalized microfluidic chips that could be useful to any synthetic biologist.
To determine what protocols synbiologist would find useful on microfluidic devices, we reached out the the Biological Design Center located at Boston University. This community of synthetic biologists gave us insight as to what procedures are performed every day in the average synbio lab. We were able to identify eight protocols integral to synthetic biology: Cell Lysis, DNA Digestion, Ligation, Transformation, PCR, Fluorescence Testing, Antibiotic Resistance Testing, and Cell Culturing. These eight protocols, as well as Cell Sorting, make up the nine chips currently located in the MARS repository.
Each of the nine chips located in the MARS repository are located within one of three subcategories:
These nine chips, each performing a basic individual protocol, can be combined together to perform more complex synthetic biology experiments.
Each chip is fully documented, providing all the necessary files for replication and usage. These files include:
Design Files
Manufacturing Specifications and Instructions
Usage and Testing protocols
As well as other useful tools and resources to make them as accessible as possible. Full chip documentation can be found on this Wiki and will be available on Github and Metafluidics as well.
These chips are currently in the water testing phase, but they provide a framework that can utilized and built upon by future iGEM teams and the synbio community to allow for biological testing and optimization. A good starting point to explore the repository from are the Cell Lysis, Cell Sorting, and Transformation chips!

I'm experiment group's member, Nankai university's sophomore(now is a junior student), Senhao Kou.iGEM can be a game for senior students while really a challenge for me, especially in such a busy and hot summer, experiments are challenging and time contribution can be confused, the result can be sometimes confused (It is really a nightmare for lab workers).Well I have to say interlab is so interesting and even funny (especially when I finish the chart). I also do something in HP part, walking around and visiting companies makes me understand researchers are so busy and high-producing (and poor when they find they failed the experiment...) At last,I really hope a happy and successful ending in iGEM.

Hi, I am Qiuhan Lang, a member of team NKU_China. With two years of biology learning, I have been attracted by the progress of exploring the mystery of life. At the same time, practicing communication and organization skills are also my wishes, so I am more than glad to join in the group of human practice in our team. I think scientific results should always be linked with social practical application, and what we are trying to do from human practice is to make research and social connect to each other closer.

Team Meeting, Lab Cleanup and Ethics
Lab Meeting: Discussed Ethics Conference and paper
Lab Cleanup in the afternoon
Worked on our ethics rough draft.  I read over some ethics reports form last year (Heidelberg and TUDelft) to get some ideas for format/ structure. I re-wrote the introduction that we used for our last ethics assignment for AIF to have a better explanation of synthetic biology and our project in general.  Fahd and I divided up sections to look at and add to this weekend (Economics and Legal for me and Social and environmental for Fahd) and then we will send it to Stefan to tie things together and make it more unified.  We made a list of few papers that will be helpful in doing this.  I also typed up some of my lab notebook to be used on the Wiki.

Deployment
Where should our biosensors be deployed and why does it matter?
One inspiration behind our S.A.F.E.B.E.T. is to fulfill the currently inadequate system to monitor the overall water quality of the Athabasca region. In addition to gaining a better picture of the overall water quality, the system should be cheap enough to be worth implementing. Therefore, choosing strategic locations for our biosensors is very important in order to keep the cost and complexity of our system to a minimum.       Imagine for a moment that there is a river and in this river there is a spot where chemicals are seeping into the river from the soil. As these chemicals seep into the river, they are carried downstream via the bulk motion of the stream and spread across the width of the river through turbulent mixing.  Taken together, bulk motion and turbulent mixing affect the spread and transport of chemicals as seen in Figure 1. If a biosensor is placed in the wrong part of a river, it may never even make contact with a chemical spilling into the river upstream. On the other hand, a biosensor can be strategically placed so as to maximize the likelihood of making contact with a chemical from an upstream spill. Using a tiny bit of luck and a lot of Fluid Mechanics, we must determine the optimal placement of S.A.F.E.B.E.T. devices to provide a comprehensive picture of the level of toxins in the Athabasca river basin.
Theory
If S.A.F.E.B.E.T. is too far downstream from a chemical source then the chemical will be too dilute to detect. Therefore, S.A.F.E.B.E.T. needs to be at most some distance $L$ downstream of a chemical source in order to detect the chemical.       So for a given river width $W$, how do we"

-----* The world language *-----
KU Leuen
As we all know, the iGEM teams are from all over the world, even if we use English to communicate, the language barrier still cannot be ignored. Based on this reason, we cooperated with Ku Leuen team in translating other countries’ team introductions into the local language (for us are Chinese). In this circumstance, Chinese teams would grab the information more clearly, and handle cooperation more effectively.
-----* A standard protocal *-----
BIT
Recently, more and more teams selected microfluidic technology and lyophilized bacteria technology, but there were no standardized guidelines. This year, from September to October, we cooperated with the BIT team, based on our own project design, in making a micro-flow control and freeze-dried bacteria protocol. Importantly, this protocol standard can be opened freely, and we are glad if other teams would provide supplements according to their experimental data. Hopefully this standard protocol will be vital to iGEM teams as much as possible. See the protocol (Chinese only now)

Birger Lindberg Møller, Professor and Head of the Center for Synthetic Biology, University of Copenhagen. We really appreciate that Professor Birger Lindberg Møller, as head of the Center for Synthetic Biology, provided us with a letter of recommendation for our funding applications.
Eva Horn Møller, PhD, Senior Drug Product Specialist at Zealand Pharma A/S. We had a very fruitful discussion with Eva Horn Møller regarding our project. Eva highlighted the importance of having the patient and his/her safety in mind. She further pointed out that we need to take special care to determine what that might be secreted in our system  in addition to our protein of choice. She suggested that we could use a special E. coli strain with disabled lipopolysaccharide. These are all ideas that we intend to incorporate into our project. Eva also suggested that working on smaller, non-glycosylated peptides – including antibody fragments – may be the best way to go.
Lise Arleth, Professor in structural biophysics at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen. Lise answered our initial questions about artificial membranes, which helped guiding the development of our membrane-focused experiments. She also put us in contact with Dr. Alessandra Luchini.

Monica is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business. In addition to iGEM, she does research with Professor Anderson in technological advancements in education. She is also a member of CUAppDev, but she agrees that iGEM is phenomenally better. When she emerges from her CS 3110 cave, she can be found window shopping for cute things, making videos, or attempting to curb her obsession with double chocolate chip muffins by grabbing another one. When she is not trying to multitask five things at once, she can be seen hanging out with her wonderful, amazing sister Amanda (#bowdown) as well as her comrade Conrad (aka Connie) and her suitemates.

3. Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device.
We have designed a device (
BBa_K2016005
) using the
BBa_J23100
promoter, adding an RBS site to it, and coupling it to a GFP with a ryhB binding sequence.
In a bacterial infection, lipocalin is produced by the human or animal organism. Lipocalin prevents bacteria from uptaking iron. We use GFP expression as a means to determine and quantify the presence of bacterial infection, by utilising the ryhB pathway.
In the presence of lipocalin (thus, absence of intracellular iron), ryhB can freely degrade GFP mRNA in bacteria. In the absence of lipocalin (thus, presence of intracellular iron), the Fur regulator represses ryhB, and GFP is produced.
We have used fluorometry to experimentally validate that our engineered bacteria change their levels of GFP expression after addition of a defined amount of iron."

Edinburgh,2014,Team:Edinburgh#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," turned away. We emerged from the exams intact, ready to devote our time to iGEM. We did the research, read the papers, and prepared for the next meeting that would herald the official start of our project.
Week 1 (26th May – 1st June)
Wednesday 28th
The team assembled in the Waddington building, ready to pit our five ideas against each other. Some had not survived the research process (the glowsticks), some did not seem to constitute a full project (the switch), and the others were not without their problems either. No clear consensus emerged, and team stuck around until late at night, trying to make them work.
Thursday 29th
Both L-glucose and dye manufacture were more or less ruled out on this day, which left us with no actual project to speak of. This was widely considered an undesirable state of affairs, and great efforts were gone to in the search for something new. Another late night, another intensive search through the track lists – still no success.
Friday 30th
Two fresh ideas came out of this day’s efforts. One – synthetic honey – went pretty much nowhere since bacteria would just be killed by honey, but the other seemed to have more life to it. This was metabolic wiring, and arose from a recent paper on the subject. This occupied most of the day.
Saturday 31st
Work continued into metabolic wiring, and a second project idea arose – could simple biological logic gates enable bacteria to play a game of Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma against each other? The two ideas were developed in parallel, and it seemed we were getting somewhere at last.
Sunday 1st
The two project ideas continued their development, with diagrams and schematics being produced. Population control was looked at as a possible use for the metabolic wiring.
Week 2 (2nd June – 8th June)
Monday 2nd
We presented the two ideas to one of the supervisors, Jon Marles-Wright, and it was agreed to combine the two into one project – develop metabolic wiring and BioBrick it, and use IPD as a showcase for how it can be used. More detailed research also began.
Tuesday 3rd – Friday 6th
Much more intensive research could now be done, now that the idea was ‘official.’ Actual genes and pathways were found which could be implemented, and circuit diagrams for different IPD strategies were devised.
Saturday 7th – 8th
It was time to get ready for the SULSA conference next week, where we would be presenting our idea for the"

Main Contribution
Our main part contribution is the Spinach2.1 BioBricks (BBa_K1330000 & BBa_K1330001). Spinach is an RNA aptamer, developed at Cornell University, that binds and activates a fluorophore called DFHBI. Spinach2 is an improved version of Spinach with increased fluorescence. Spinach2 has not been included in any BioBrick until now.
The Spinach2 sequence contains an internal SpeI site, which makes it incompatible with the iGEM assembly standard. To overcome this we predicted several mutations that should not affect folding, and synthesized these mutated versions of the sequence. One of these mutated sequences, Spinach2.1, was confirmed to have fluorescence comparable to the original Spinach2.

Apart from a mother lode of practical information, the conference also offered great food and a unique opportunity to intermingle with the other European teams. This is where we met our friends from the Bielefeld team amongst many, many others and, in short, had an amazing time!
Radio interview by ""Harddisken"" (The Hard Disk)
On June 16th we featured on the national Danish radio program The Hard Disk . It’s a 1 hour technology program focusing on the impact of new digital technologies on the society, our culture and our daily lives.
The program first aired in 1994 and is one of the longest running shows on Danish radio.
The program we participated in dealt with synthetic biology because of its fast development and its dependency on computing power to perform sequencing, modelling and other analytic tasks. Thinking of cells as pieces of electronics like in the iGEM competition intrigued The Hard Disk.
Andrew Hessel from the Singularity University in California was the first to be interviewed, he talked about the technological development in synthetic biology and how computers are used in synthetic biology.
After the Andrew Hessel interview, Tommy and Kir presented our project talking about how we would model the bacterial function and the dangers of loading new applications into the bacteria.

Science Camps
About a week after the new students start their long years of university study, they go for a weekend trip (September 10-11th) with their social tutors. These weekends are called Science Camps, but are mostly about being drunk and naked. In an attempt to save the poor first-year students' souls, we went out to 3 Science Camps and told them about the iGEM competition and our project, thereby bringing the science back to the Science Camps! We also gave them a genetic rebus where they had to translate a gene sequence to amino acid one letter code. The result was the slightly misleading message ""IGEM TIME IS PLAY TIME""!
These bright minds of tomorrow, however hungover, seemed interested enough and we were met by a positive atmosphere. There is yet hope for SDU in the future iGEM competitions!

We can develop the information we have in a system of equations:
Recombination
In all our simulations, we assumed that recombination would happened after 20 minutes in contact of arabinose, plus a certain random time following an exponential law of average 10 minutes. After this random time, it is not certain that the bacteria will recombinate. In our simulations, we decided that our cell would recombinate with a probability of 0.05
LuxI
Once a bacteria has recombinated, there is necesarily a latent time before LuxI is actually synthetised. There is then some more time before a bacteria produces full rate. The amount of LuxI produced inside a bacteria stays in this very bacteria, and it is commonly accepted that the concentration of LuxI reaches a plateau and keep this value. According to the data found in the literature, we chose to set the latent time to 10 minutes. Then the concentration increases during 10 minutes linearly until the maximum concentration is reached.
LuxR
Let's call R the constant concentration of LuxR in a cell. Some of it binded with AHL and we call it LuxR*, so this gives:
The complexation between LuxR and AHL gives a chemical equilibrium determined by the constant Kreac:
so at the equilibrium:
which gives:
AHL
Following the paper ""A synchronized quorum of genetic clocks"" by Hasty and al., we define the intracellular concentration of AHL, [AHLi], and the external one, [AHLe].
Internal and external AHL concentrations change as AHL is produced by the cells and can go throuh the cell membrane (kinetic constant kI and kmembrane respectively).
The first term says that if the cell produces LuxI, then it produces AHL at a certain rate. The second term concerns the exchange between the cell and the medium, and is proportional to the difference of concentration. The concentration of AHL in the room [AHLe] decreases as the microfluidic device evacuates it, which gives birth to a diffusion term in the equation caracterized by the kinetic constant kdiff.
where kdiff is related to parameters of the fluid and of the device, kmembrane is the same as previously, but is now compensated by d, the cell density, so that the exchanges between cells and the medium is balanced.
Here we consider only the case where the concentration of AHL is homogeneous, ie the concentration inside and outside the cell are the same. This is justified since the caracteristic time of diffusion of AHL between the outside and the inside of a cell is short compared k"

The cost-efficiency allows for a standardized method to uncouple low-budget institutions from the need for expensive equipment and highly trained personnel.
Furthermore, we would like to conduct an economic review of our project and, depending on the outcome, a business strategy based on the improvement and distribution of hardware and biological component kits.
Social and cooperation opportunities
The open hardware components can be easily accessed and assembled and thus stimulate fair distribution of the entire technology involved in this project. For device construction, reusable parts will be employed wherever possible in order to reduce the environmental footprint.
Due to the modularity of our hardware components, we aim to create additional devices for self-assembly and use in the lab. We also intend to bring open hardware and software development much closer to synthetic biology, and consider several cooperation opportunities with other iGEM teams and industry partners.

They had a fairly simple, yet very interesting idea and they worked they way from bottom to top. They got the attitude, the hard work and the necessary support.
Based on these conversations, we think success in iGEM can be within our reach, too, even though we are the first Finnish team participating in iGEM! In fact, we believe that being the first team makes us look for advice from all over the world and brings a truly international feeling to the project.

Plac Characterization
We used a medium-strength Plac promoter and put it into biobrick format. You can find this biobrick on the Parts Registry under the number K613000 We characterized it by coupling the promoter to RFP and adding increasing concentrations of IPTG.
We didn't transform a LacI gene in the DH5alpha cells. Still, these cells can have a basal expression of the transcription factor. By adding IPTG to the cell's medium, we make sure to inhibit any endogenous LacI expression, in order to have the maximal RFP expression that can be driven by our Plac biobrick. The plasmid used for this characterization was J61002 Plac-RFP .
IPTG induction
Description
The DH5alphas cells, even if the plasmid we transform doesn't contain TetR, can still have a basal expression of the transcription factor. By adding ATC, we are able to inhibit this TetR basal expression, revealing the full power of Ptet as a promoter sequence. This is explained in these cartoons:
Cells without IPTG:
Cells with IPTG:
Experimental results
The cells treated with IPTG producd more RFP than their non-treated counterparts; this difference is not striking, showing that the basal expression of LacI by our DH5alpha cells is quite low. The normal expression of RFP driven by our Plac promoter is of 530 normalized RFUs; the highest value is 640 normalized RFUs.

TU-Delft,2013,Team:TU-Delft#Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html,", after intensive literature research we found a molecule very similar to the AIP molecule used in these experiments, that is known to pass the outer membrane. The molecule bacitracin [5] has been shown to interfere with cell wall synthesis in Gram negative species, therefore being able to pass the outer membrane as cell wall synthesis occurs in the periplasm. Comparison of the molecular structures of bacitracin and AIP regarding size, molecular weight, polarity and charge (fig. 3) gave us an indication AIP should be possible to pass through the outer membrane of E. coli without any modifications done on the outer membrane.
Figure 3: Molecule structures of bacitracin and autoinducing peptides
Results
Using Cyflogic 1.2.1 software [6] , FACS data was analysed, showing a clear induction of the AIP receiver GFP construct by AIP. The difference between the blue and the red line (218) indicates the difference in fluorescent signal of uninduced and induced cells. Untransformed Bl21(DE3) and constitutively expressed GFP were used as respectively negative and positive control (fig. 4). The significant difference between the uninduced and the induced samples is determined with a P-value >10-4 as described in the next paragraph.
Figure 4: Fluorescent signal measured with the FACS. The white line refers to the control BL21(DE3) cells. In blue the uninduced pBAD AIP receiver GFP is shown. The red line represents the AIP induced receiver cells. The green line shows cells constitutively expressing GFP. The fluorescence intensity scale is logarithmic and the total number of cells counted per sample is 10,000.
Significance test
To test if the difference between the uninduced and induced result is significant a statistic test is performed as in [7] . Here it is assumed that both results are normal distributions, as the number of datasets is large (central limit theorem) [7] . Then the critical value equation becomes a simple one:
Based on the induced and uninduced data as in Table 1, this t-value is calculated as 52.7. This is a very high value and corresponds to a one-sided p value of less than 10-4. This means that there is a significant difference between the induced and uninduced curves.

Eggplant rust
They experience the same problems as solitary farmers in their own fields and often encounter rust threatening their eggplant and garlic crops. However, they make sure to spray correct doses of fungicides and measure them out at designated mixing stations while wearing proper protective gear. Since not all farmers have access to expensive fungicides in their own farms, Cultivaid works to find low cost or natural solutions. For example, they often use garlic as a natural insecticide.
Cultivaid expressed interest in out device and specified that it could be better used by them if data could be made available to department officials. This would allow large organizations and the government to track the spread of the fungus and allocate resources to combat the spread of fungal infections.

What is DIYbio?
DIYbio or ""Biohacking"" essentially describes citizen science in biology, usually molecular biology. Biohacking often happens as an activity in an established Hackerspace, at home, or in dedicated DIYbio spaces such as Biocurious or Genspace . DIYbio.org and the Google DIYbio Group are the online focal points of the international scene. For a more in-depth look at DIYbio, we recommend the NTU-Singapore 2009 iGEM team's DIYbio exposé .
Access Survey
As our collaboration with the London Biohackers gained momentum, we decided to learn more about the global DIYbio community to give our partnership more context. We started an ongoing survey of the community specifically to understand if, and how, these communities desired access to the tools of Synthetic Biology and the Registry of Parts. This investigation will develop into a project beyond iGEM, but here we present some of our initial findings (based on initial responses from LA Biohackers, openbioprojects, Biotinkering Berlin, BiologiGaragen, Lab"
NU_Kazakhstan,2013,Team:NU Kazakhstan#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the proposed study. Their combination in one simple, easy and portable test detection assay or test system would generate a fast diagnostic methodology.  CEA is a 201 kDa glycoprotein that is involved in a cell adhesion. Its specialized sialofucosylated glycoforms serve as functional L-selectin and E-selectin ligands which are critical to the metastatic dissemination for cancer cells. Serum CEA is currently one of the most relevant and widespread tumor markers of colorectal cancer (Christenson et al., 2011). It is used for prognosis and monitoring in colorectal cancer patients (Sturgeon et al., 2008). The use of CEA for screening and early diagnosis is limited due to a lack of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (Smith et al., 2002).
Biosensors and immunoassays as more recent methods for the rapid detection of single-tumor markers... Biosensors and immunoassays
Biosensors and immunoassays as more recent methods for the rapid detection of single-tumor markers have been well progressed for cancer diagnosis. According to the International Union of Applied and Pure Chemistry, a biosensor is a sensor composed of biological recognition elements (e.g., antibodies, enzymes, or aptamers) whose interaction with their analytes is detected with a transducer. The transducer is a device that converts the chemical or physical signals into something measurable such as an electrical signal (Thevenot et al., 1999).  Biosensors consisting of various types of transducers, such as optical, electrochemical, mass-based or calorimetric were designed for detection of either single or multiple tumor markers. Biosensors for the detection of CEA, IL-6, and autoantibodies to ECPKA are reviewed in Rusling et al. (2010), Tothill et al. (2009), Arya and Bhansali (2011), and Tan et al. (2009). Most of such biosensors use antibodies as biorecognition element. As for DNA aptamers, Wang et al. (2007) selected aptamers against CEA, although the quantitative data on aptamer affinity towards its target were not presented. Application of tumor markers for cancer diagnosis is facing great challenges, because most markers are not specific to a particular tumor and no single marker can be used for accurately predicting disease in all of its stages. Panels of cancer biomarkers can improve their diagnostic value in complex biological samples. Therefore, the development of highly sensitive and selective sensors capable of simultaneous detection of multiple analytes has attracted much attention."
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Management_-_-_TEXT.html," reflected in the legal section of our budget. To manage personnel in the company as further key individuals are brought in, we will acquire a part time administrative assistant in 2016 when production begins to ramp up. Finally, during the first five years, should the need arise, we are preparing to take on a new Chief Executive Officer, replacing Emily Hicks and David Lloyd. Although they will be responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the company during its initial start-up phase, with growth of the company, it will likely be important to attract someone with significant experience in this. This move may also allow us to be better positioned to obtain venture capitalist funding needed for late-stage production costs.
Contingency Plans
In the event that certain situations that could disadvantage FREDsense were to occur with regard to key personnel, we have developed a set of contingency plans that could be implemented. These are listed below for each outlined scenario.
Death of an Officer
Upon the death of an officer, the shares will be bought from the estate of the deceased by the company. These shares can then be bought by the founders of FREDsense at the current market value of the shares. If the remaining founders do not purchase these shares they can be purchased by other shareholders or kept by the company at the discretion of the board of directors. In the event the officer holds a joint position with another officer (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer, or any other position in the future), the other officer will take full responsibility for this role. In the event that the officer has a unique position, a replacement will be brought in, with unanimous agreement from all remaining officers. This position would be compensated with shares in the company.
Officer Withdrawing From the Company
If an officer wishes to withdraw from the company then his/her shares may be purchased by the remaining founders for a negotiable amount. If the remaining founders do not wish to purchase these shares then they will be purchased by the company for the current market value of the shares. In the event the officer holds a joint position with another officer (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer), the other officer will take full responsibility for this role. In the event that the officer has a unique position, a replacement will be brought in, with unanimous agreement from all remaining officers. This position would be compensated with shares in the company.
Advisor Withdrawing From the Company
If an adviser wishes to withdraw from the company then his/her shares, if applicable, may be purchased by the founders for a negotiable amount. If the remaining founders do not wish to purchase these shares then they will be purchased by the company for the current market"

Approach
As a team we highly value responsible research. Therefore, we wanted to make sure our project is responsible from the start till the end and beyond. To ensure a highly responsible project, we made our project pass through the phases that constitute Responsible Research and Innovation according to Stilgoe et al. (2013) , i.e. anticipation, inclusion, reflection, and responsiveness.
The dimension of anticipation focuses on researchers investigating what is known, what is possible and what is likely in the field. This includes scenario building, making an assessment of their plausibility through interaction with experts as well as the general public, and the stimulation of an open and multidisciplinary collaboration. This we did through surveys, train debates, and through visiting conferences to learn about developments in the field and to make connections.
Subsequently, inclusion targets the process of open innovation and user-centered design. It focuses on transparency and collectively challenging regulations and standards. Grove-White et al. (2000) argue that the public conversation should stretch further to include the debate on future social worlds, while critically rethinking the ‘social constitutions’ inherent to the technological choices – that is, the ethical, political and social implications of the development. This we did during inclusion processes as the train debates and the expert discussion in Stirling.
Throughout the project, the process of reflexivity has continuously been going on. We are used to professional self-reflexivity during the complete product development process. Our team continuously challenged our detection and we even had an intra-team detection method hacking challenge. However, as was stated by Wynne et al. in 1993, responsibility makes reflexivity into a public matter too. According to Stilgoe et al. (2013) reflexivity demands scientists to publically combine their scientific and moral responsibilities. This has been a prominent focus from the choice of our topic till our final design as can be seen from our interaction with the many stakeholders involved and the design requirements we derived from that.
Lastly, we responded to all stakeholder input by making a value sensitive design by which we managed to answer all needs and preferences of our stakeholders to come to an optimal method.
1. Anticipation
As a first stage in Responsible Research and Innovation we focussed on addressing the need for gene doping detection as well as on making an assessment of the challenges constituting gene doping with respect to the future.
1.1 Relevance of Gene Doping Detection
Due to a lack of an implemented detection method it is hard to assess whether gene doping is currently happening. We can say now however that it is a more eminent threat than you might have expected"

The copper pieces in the flasks were massed and it was determined that the average mass of copper etched away by the flask containing copper was greater than the average mass of copper etched in the case where there was no bacteria (11% mass loss versus 1%, respectively). Biological etching was considered a success.
Aug 9
Observations were made of the petri dish setups.
Big Copper with Cardstock:
- w/ bacteria: bacteria seems to promote oxidation of Cu (Copper turned green) w/o bacteria: copper turned a very dark brown. solid media in bac and no bac have turned yellow.
Nail Polished Copper:
- no visible etching seem through layer of nail polish for both bacteria and no bacteria. - etching where Cu is exposed is still occurring.
Solid and Liquid Media:
- w/ bacteria: liquid media turned orange-brown and there is some oxidation on copper pieces - w/o bac: copper pieces not shiny anymore and turned dark brown. Liquid media is still transparent.
Aug 10
The copper pieces were removed from all the petri dish experiments. It was determined that more copper was etched from the petri dishes containing bacteria in all cases.
August 12 - August 18
Since the experiment with the solid media encased copper shaking in the liquid media proved successful last week, we decided to repeat the experiment with much less liquid media--the AFM solution would only be a thin layer, with and without bacteria sitting on top of a petri dish with copper submerged underneath a layer of solid media. Setup for this experiment was done this week. The AFM solution was continually replenished throughout the week to ensure the bacteria would always have a source of ferrous ions for continuous growth.
Aug 14
Setup for the hybrid experiment (solid media with a layer of liquid media on top) took place. Solution B for solid media production had to be made again, due to bacterial contamination in our existing batch. Ten petri dishes with four copper samples in each were prepared--five with 15 mL of AFM and 1 mL of OD 27.5 bacteria, and five with only 15 mL of AFM. Dishes were placed in an incubator.
Aug 15
The liquid media in the petri dishes containing bacteria was tinted brown, but remained clear in the dishes not containing bacteria.
New AFM was added to replace the old liquid layer in the petri dishes containing bacteria. The cells were first separated using a centrifuge, and"

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Implementation#construction_-_-_TEXT.html," MET25 repressable promoter with binding sites, hoping to construct a limiter circuit in which we can set the threshold by varying the input concentration of methionine.
Fluorescent Tagging of Transcription Factors
We received our library of transcription factors as fusion proteins tagged with the mCherry fluorescent domain.  As we wish to keep track of the concentration of a number of different elements in our network, we elected to construct repressors bearing the cyan fluorescent protein CFP, which can be distinguished from the mCherry fluorescence from the other repressors and the YFP fluorescent reporter that we use as an output.  We removed the fluorescence from our activator, as we can infer its concentration from the level of input.  With CFP on the tau repressor and mCherry on alpha and R (both under the same promoter), we hope to get a solid understanding of the dynamics of each element of our system given varying levels of induction and different thresholds.
Yeast Integration
In order to easily test many variations on the limiter circuit, we ligated variations on each element onto the same pRS30x series integrative vector.  Thus, we can create a strain bearing the A, alpha, R, and YFP reporter, and later ligate in a variety of threshold-setting tau constructs to test their effects.  As of press time, we have generated the library of yeast constructs and are ready to transform our limiter.  We hope to get some results in time for the Jamboree.

CH2.2.6 - FOUNDATIONAL ADVANCE
“Just thirty-five years ago, scientists could not cut and paste pre-existing fragments of genetic material like we can today. The discovery and application of DNA recombination allowed us to assemble new genes. The synthetic biology community needs other enabling technologies that help to make new accomplishments possible. What are other types of basic tricks does nature use? Have you discovered and applied one that could revolutionize synthetic biology?”
Example:
In Synthetic Biology, standard parts are registered, and the information of each part is uploaded onto the iGEM websites. Synthetic biologists either modify the previous parts or create a new one, but in either ways, there are difficulties.
One way to deal with them is to create different mutants of the standard parts which have various characteristics and recorded them as a “Mutant library”. One of the mutants may be suitable for the future modification or creation with its appropriate protein-binding ability, satisfactory expression strength, and peculiar sensitivity to the chemical used.

REC-CHENNAI,2017,Team:REC-CHENNAI#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," peptide to the membrane, followed by its critical destabilization.
Carpet model of antimicrobial-induced killing
In this model, the peptides disrupt the membrane by orienting parallel to the surface of the lipid bilayer and forming an extensive layer or carpet. Hydrophilic regions of the peptide are shown coloured red, hydrophobic regions of the peptide are shown coloured blue.
However, Lt-2a has a disadvantage; it is found to possess 20% haemolytic and cytotoxic activity. A study done by A.A. Polyansky et al./ FEBS 583(2009) showed that a mutation in the sequence of native Lt-2a resulted in multifold reduction of its cytotoxic and haemolytic effects. Hence, we chose to work with this mutant, Lt-2a F10K (Phe replaced by Lys) as well.
Position of the F10 in the peptide is shown in green color.
QUORUM SENSING
Our project involves genetically engineering E.coli DH5a cells to produce Latarcin and the mutant. We chose E.coli to be our chassis due to its higher transformation efficiency. However, the problem with making E.coli produce this peptide is the toxicity of this peptide to the chassis itself. In order to overcome this, a specially designed quorum sensing mechanism is employed.
Bacterial quorum sensing is defined as a cell-to-cell communication mechanism wherein gene expression is regulated by fluctuations in cell concentration. Bacteria that use quorum sensing mechanisms release certain signalling molecules known as autoinducers into their surroundings. Beyond a threshold limit, these autoinducers alter gene expression by binding to specific promoters within the genome. When a quorum sensing mechanism is incorporated into our project, Latarcin production will begin only after the cells reach a high concentration. Thus, large quantities of Latarcin can be synthesized.
The proposed genetic circuit for quorum sensing consists of three functional devices. The first of these three contains a constitutive promoter (Anderson promoter) coding for the gene for AHL synthesis (LuxI). The second device has another Anderson promoter that regulates the LuxR repressor gene. The last has a Lux promoter that is activated by the binding of AHL and LuxR. This regulates the expression of the mutant Latarcin.
At low cell density, the quantity of AHL produced is too little for it to bring about Latarcin production. As the cell density increases, the cells divide and simultaneously produce both AHL and LuxR. Without the AHL, LuxR is unstable and gets degraded shortly after production. But beyond a certain threshold level"
