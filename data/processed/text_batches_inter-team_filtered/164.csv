I then did restriction digests of my PCR products. I followed the protocol but made changes in that I used all 50 μl of my PCR product (Dr. Grose said she usually uses all of her DNA and I wouldn’t have enough leftover otherwise so I figured I’d try it), didn’t add any water, added 2 μl of each restriction enzyme (usually do 1.5 μl), and added the enzymes very last after mixing up everything else first (last time I made a master mix including the restriction enzymes but I noticed this time that the protocol emphasized putting the enzymes in last). I then set my reactions in the 37°C incubator overnight (last time I think I might have left them at room temperature overnight, so that might be another reason why they didn’t work well).

-Plasmids containing desired inserts have been transformed in W3110 (wild-type) and JC28 (siderophore-deficient) E.coli strains
-Plasmid mini-preps have been made again from transformed W3110 and JC28 strains
Week 6:
-Plasmid mini-preps (from W3110 and JC28 strains transformed with pSB1C3+hemerythrin) have been digested with appropriate restriction enzymes
- Small fractions of harvested pSB1C3+hemerythrin plasmids have been digested with appropriate restriction enzymes; restriction products have been run through an agarose gel and screened for the presence of desired inserts
-Plasmids containing the appropriate inserts have been sent for sequencing
-Sequences have been analysed
Week 7:
- Measured absorbance at 500nm in overnight cultures of Dcr and Mc in JC28 and W3110 strains and Td in W3110 strain in chloramphenicol LB
-No change in colour has been detected between hemerythrin encoding mutant, wild-type strains and negative controls (no hemerythrin expression) suggesting that protin was not expressed
-Tried to figure out what was going on– realised that there were several methylation sites at adjacent positions to the promoters used
-Decided that we should replace the promoters and remove the methylation sites
-New promoters have been ordered

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rectify misconceptions. We tried to ask students and parents questions like - “do you think it is dangerous to work with bacteria” or “is genetic modification safe?” Initial responses were generally negative, but the questions gave us a platform to address the issues.
The concept of toehold switches had also proved extremely challenging to explain. We subsequently developed the analogy of a knot to explain them. The knot prevents a protein making factory (ribosome) from reading the instructions (mRNA) to make a protein that glows (GFP). Through diagrams, and use of animations, we were able to explain the concept of our project. We delivered an assembly where we used this analogy to explain our project and sent out a quiz. To our delight people understood most of our project and a few understood nearly everything. 109 completed the quiz and the majority scored over 75%. Find out more on our engagement page .
We thereby vastly improved our education and public engagement programmes, learning from how people to develop an approach for explaining difficult concepts in an accessible and interesting way. We improved our presentation and communication skills throughout the project. We were delighted that rest of the open days, as well our assemblies and workshops went so well and got people interested in synthetic biology.

A double band for Tn5 observed for all conditions, both bands from the 12% gel were excised and sent for mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry confirmed that both bands were full length Tn5 with both the N and C terminal intact. This concluded that there was not any protease digestion and that the results are potentially due to a gel artifact. As a result, the purification will continue.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual Property is an increasingly important and controversial aspect of scientific advance, and synthetic biology is perhaps the paradigmatic area illustrating the effects of this growing legal influence. When thinking about how teams could turn their ideas from iGEM projects into viable real-world solutions, we realized that intellectual property is a crucial area to address.
Our team has produced a report exploring how teams can approach this task and how iGEM intellectual property policy can make the transition easier.
We begin with a brief overview of current intellectual property law (specifically relevant to the UK) before progressing to look at the challenges this poses for the iGEM competition. A number of different approaches which iGEM might choose to adopt towards intellectual property are discussed and the pros and cons of each are assessed. We then asked a range of interested groups, including iGEM students, professionals, and the public, for their views before concluding with recommendations for addressing intellectual property concerns in iGEM. We offer our conclusions in the form of advice to students, to the iGEM foundation, and briefly explore how a change in the law could have consequences for iGEM. This advice is purely based on our own views and our research which we hope will make interesting food for thought - it is not professional legal advice and should not be relied on as such!
Team Policy
Dealing with intellectual property is not only necessary on a competition-wide level - each team must also make decisions as to how they wish to deal with the intellectual property they will acquire during the course of their project. Deciding whether to file a patent application can be a tricky decision - below are just some of the factors you might want to take into consideration…
Attitudes Survey
We conducted a survey of attitudes within iGEM teams to intellectual property. The results, illustrated below, are analysed in detail in our report. Broadly, we found a noticeable lack of understanding of IP issues, confirming in many ways the findings and excellent foundation work done by British Columbia iGEM team in 2012, and a great deal of social mindedness in the responses.

Help anchor E. coli to the surface of S. mutans for efficient killing and biofilm degradation.
Get started.
How to do it?
Test it!
Our result~
Reference
Before we get started:
Although there are a plethora of oral bacteria, only a handful cause tooth decay, and chief among those is S. mutans (see [Project Overview] for more information). For our modified E. coli to deal with this threat, we need to find a way for them to get close to S. mutans colonies in the oral environment.
Competence Stimulating Peptide, or CSP, is an important quorum sensing (QS) pheromone specific to S. mutans, playing a huge role in their genetic response to population density. The system works since S. mutans continuously release CSP, which bind to the surface receptors of other S. mutans nearby. Check out [Control: Target] for more information on CSP.
The exclusivity of CSP and the ubiquity of its receptors in S. mutans makes it a great candidate for creating an anchoring module!
So how did we do it?
Because of size constraints, we did not want to use the actual CSP molecule itself. Instead, we found C16, a functionally active fragment of CSP which still binds to CSP receptors. Compared to CSP, C16 is smaller and more suitable for attachment on the E. coli surface.
Now that the attachment candidate is found, what’s left is to express it on the surface of E. coli, so it can interact with S. mutans.
For that purpose, we found INPNC, a surface display protein in E. coli biobricked by the 2011 Edinburgh iGEM team. Using INPNC as basis, we created the INPNC-C16 fusion protein, which displays C16 on the surface of"

7.Turn OFF power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully remove the gel from the gel"
HUST-China,2016,Team:HUST-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 that most of the teams(taking up 75%) whose projects are not related to bi-stable or tri-stable state of gene expression have ever considered to utilize a stable-state to optimize their project. We discussed with a few teams and found that they thought designing a bi-table circuit of multi-stable circuit is difficult and constructing complex circuits is burdening. And some teams believed that they hadn’t been involved in such multi-interactive regulation network. We can see that people were used to adopting mature methods to control their gene of interest. Creating new control circuit could be a barrier.
3.Have you ever been bothered with the problems on gene expression cotrolling ? Please choose from the following:
1. Signal attenuation
2. Signal delay
3. Expression leakage
4. Lack of robustness
5. Low promoter intensity
6. Excess promoter intensity
7. Others(please specify)
The result showed that all iGEMers taking the survey have ever been bothered by gene expression problems, among which lack of robustness is the problem most of them (taking up 62.5%) encounter. Expression leakage is the second problem (taking up 58.33%) they are worried about. And these two matters are crucial when we put our engineered strain into practice, because real-world conditions are more complex than lab, there will be factors to interrupt the input signal and gene product let along the background noise in the strain itself. And just as team William and Marry did in 2015 they promoted low-noise promoter to deal with background noise in the strain. What we are trying to do is to decrease noise of signal input, in other words, filtering the input signal to guarantee stable gene product expression.
4. Please describe your problems on gene expression controlling and how do you solve these problems?
On the sheet of answers toward this question, we could see various odd gene expression problems. After combing them, we noticed that 1/3 of respondents had mentioned that they could not find a promoter that had just suitable intensity, neither too low nor too high. To settle this, most chose to change their promoter, others chose to change culture time. However, the variety of promoters is rather limited. Thus, seeking for substitutions is not always the best solution. So here comes the second feature of our signal filter: we can set its threshold by adjusting different regulatory promoters and the amount of its interactive protein. And our circuit can further switch gene expression between two or more thresholds by designing the internal interactive to reach stable state.
5. If there is a tool that can solve these problems, what functions do you expect"

TEDx SYSU
TED is a nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It started out in 1984 as a conference bringing together people from three worlds: Technology, Entertainment, Design. TEDxSYSU is a program designed to give communities, organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at Sun Yat-sen University.
In order to let people know more about synthetic biology and IGEM project. On September 15, 2013，Our team cooperated with SYSU-China(another iGEM team）and TEDx SYSU(an authorized TEDx organizer) . We held a TEDx salon in our campus, of which the theme is “Assembly life”. Three speakers Zheng Lingling, Sun Mengyi and Miaozong were invited to make presentations Deciphering the Code of Life，The eighth day of creation, Computer Network Synthetic Biology to introduce the synthetic biology about its origin, development, progress and application prospect.
There were more than thirty students and teachers participating in the salon. They showed great interest in this emerging field that contain network and experiments. We especially talked about biosafety, the crucial topic in synthetic biology. Team leader of SYSU-China had been invited to introduce the suicide mechanism which was deposited in their project. Moreover, students shared their innovative ideas about controlling artificial creatures. This activity not only advertised the creation spirit of synthetic biology, but also reminded everyone to keep their creation safe.
Game：Life is Synthesizing
In order to let more people know about Synthetic biology and show the dynamics within the cell. We developed an interesting web page game.
Start from the initial stage of life: a cell is producing proteins avidly. Polymerases slide through a promoter, and transcript as much genes until meet the terminator. The little creature evolve into more complex life forms and desire more and more production. Players can evolve their little cell into developed life forms by collecting enough proper proteins. In addition, players have to deal with the biosafety problems when sophisticated creatures been created. Poison proteins may appear and collapse your construction without enough attention. Colleting enough resources and keeping avoid from dangerous zone is the key to final success.
Life is just synthesizing…

We detected the light sensibility of red colony later. RFP coding device （ BBa_J04450 ）, RBS-rfp-terminator ( BBa_K516032 ) and pSB1C3 were set as controls. We plated 100μL the overnight culture on LB medium + chloramphenicol (34μg/mL) and cultivated them at 37℃. And half of them were with light avoidance treatment. After 12 hours we observed the colonies.

We found all the plates transformed PompC-rfp and rfp became red. But the PompC-rfp colonies showed faintly red, and the differences with light or not are not obvious. It shows that PompC-rfp biobrick itself was not sensitive to light. And it also indicated that the PompC promoter has basal activities in E.coli TOP10.
Because in nature, this promoter PompC is upstream of the ompC porin gene. The regulation of ompC is determined by the EnvZ-OmpR osmosensing machinery. EnvZ phosphorylates OmpR to OmpR-P. At high osmolarity, EnvZ is more active, creating more OmpR-P. OmpR-P then binds to the low-affinity OmpR operator sites upstream of ompC. [3]
The essence is that the EnvZ protein senses the mediun osmolarity and then forces the OmpR protein to take one of two alternative structures, which positively regulate OmpC synthesis. [4]
So we designed an experiment to detect under the normal level of the EnvZ, the trend of E.coli PompC activities with the change of osmotic pressure"

Week 23: September 30 - October 4
Practice, practice, practice for our Regional Jamboree presentation!
Week 24: October 7 - October 11
New wetlab data has become available and we have resumed our modeling work. We are currently asking what concentrations we need to be playing with in the lab to see the response we want from Taylor's prussian blue ferritin. To do this we've been looking at differential equations that will show binding of our various TALEs to their DNA targets to form complexes of immobilized DNA (DNA + the TALE on the strip) and then the immobilized reporter (when the FerriTALE is exposed to the immobilized DNA). We can then use the constants Taylor elucidated for his prussian blue ferritin to calculate how quickly we hit the visible threshold.
Week 25: October 14 - October 18
The equations have been put together in a MATLAB clone called Scilab. We are currently looking for constants to plug into the model for the DNA interactions of the TALEs. We have the Kd values for the TALEs, but cannot find any literature relating to separating this into the forward and reverse reactions for TALEs. One thing we plan on doing is testing this to try and feed some data into the model, but haven't been able to do this yet due to lack of protein.
Week 26: October 21 - October 25
The model is ready to test with our experimental data. We were able to obtain the kinetic constants for our TALEs to plug into the model. We are able look at 6 variables in our model and test them over time to see how fast we can get a result in our system. The preliminary results show that our system should be able to give a visible response in a reasonable amount of time.
Week 27: October 28 - November 1

biosynthetic pathways: violacein
Contents
1 Background
2 Violacein biosynthetic pathway
3 Design of a DNA-guided biosynthetic pathway
4 Results
State of the art
Violacein is a compound that is synthesized in five steps from tryptophan. Transfer of the biosynthetic pathway from Chromobacterium violaceum allows production of violacein by E.Coli. Parts for the complete violacein biosynthetic pathway are available in the Registry and succesful production of violacein has been demonstrated by the Cambridge 2009 iGEM team. Besides purple violacein, the same biosynthetic pathway also produces a green side product deoxychromoviridans.
Aims
We wanted to test whether our idea can be applied to the real world application. We examined the advantages of DNA-guided protein assembly on the violacein pathway. Our goal was to construct chimeric biosynthetic enzymes and a DNA program coding for the correct order of biosynthetic enzymes.
Achievements
We designed and constructed a modified violacein biosynthetic pathway composed of five chimeric proteins with violacein biosynthetic enzymes and different zinc fingers. Introduction of DNA program coding for the correct order of chimeric proteins into bacteria expressing violacein these chimeric enzymes resulted in 6-fold improved yield of violacein, in comparison to DNA coding for a scrambled order of biosynthetic pathway. Additionally, this arrangement resulted in a significant decrease of an unwanted side product deoxychromoviridans. These resultates demonstrate in a very convincing way the advantages of DNA scaffold platform for biosynthesis.
Background
Ever since 1882, violacein has been notable as the most obvious characteristic of a soil bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum due to its deep purple color. Violacein is insoluble in water and due to its hydrophobicity retained within cells. Biosynthesis of violacein has been as well as its biological activities were investigated in detail (Duran et al., 2007). Violacein has antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasite, antitumorogenic and many other biological activities, which makes the violacein pigment a very good candidate for further research and industrial production. In addition to potential medical applications, violacein is also used"

Part:BBa_K2267001 :This part can respond to pH in the environment and produce alkaline substances. Ultimately, it can stabilize the pH at around 5 in the environment.
Part:BBa_K2267005 , Part:BBa_K2267006 :These two parts are all composed of pASR and two key genes in the metabolic network of producing BC respectively. It enables G. xylinus to produce BC more effectively.
We  have determined the optimal fermentation condition for the co-culture of G. xylinus&E. coli. We have co-cultured these two modified strains in such condition and resulted a significant increase in the yield of bacterial cellulose.
During the experiments, we have visited companies and communicated in depth with technical personnel in this field about the design of our experiment and feasibility in the actual production process(including operation procedure and possibility for bio-contamination). They speak highly of our project and offer us potential collaboration in the future.
After processing BC membrane produced in our lab, we sent samples to a wound dressing material company for quality check. The report we received demonstrates that our lab-produced bacterial cellulose is qualified in every base items and shows potential to be wound dressing materials. We make sure all the works we done are in accordance with the safety requirements from iGEM committee and our product is absolutely free of living organisms outside the lab.

Cancer Patient
We interviewed a cancer patient who just became eligible for CBD oil in georgia, Our interview gave us insight on how difficult it is to obtain the oil and the laws that are in place to regulate CBD oil. This shaped how we proceeded with future directions moving forward with our project. Some studies say that having some THC is helpful for patients, we are seekings to synthesize a 0% THC containing CBD oil.
Following our protein expression of the Mambalgin-1 protein , our next steps will include testing the analgesic properties in an animal model. Mambalgin can provide a non-addictive opioid alternative to morphine.We know that Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are involved with nociception, depression and inflammation. ASICS are activated by lowering of pH levels in the extracellular space.  We also know that ASIC1 & ASIC2 are expressed in the central nervous and peripheral nervous system. (Salinas, et. al 2014) These neurons are connected to the dorsal root ganglion, which we know to bring in sensory information.  We will be partnering with the Neuroscience Institute at Georgia State using Sprague-dawley rats to test our introduction of mambalgin to the ASICs.  We will inject rats with the expressed mambalgin intra planarly and introduce thermal pain. We will be using the paw thermal stimulator to assess nociception. We will assess results by measuring paw withdrawal latency. We will have one experimental group and two control groups. Saline/vehicle will be our negative control, and our positive will be manufactured mambalgin. Our experimental group will be for our expressed mambalgin in Pichia pastoris.

Emily has been working on further developing the module idea, as the suggestion from Dr John Love is to develop both a second and third year synthetic biology module. Whilst it will be a lot of work to develop a whole second module in such short time, it will be incredible if they are actually implemented. Pablo and Leanne began working on infographic designs to go up on the wiki, looking predominantly on visually explaining the mechanism of action of Killer Red/Orange, Lysozyme and DNAse1.
We sent off our Interlab Study data today to iGEM, in anticipation for the deadline tomorrow. We had decided to do the Interlab from the start as it would be a good way to introduce non-bio team members to the lab procedures, but when we chose Measurement track it also became a compulsory requirement.
Dan, Emily and Joel worked in the lab today. Killer Red and Killer Orange samples were diluted, exposed to light for 6 hours and spread plated. The construct overnights were grown from a starting OD of 0.02 for 6 hours then put through the FACS machine.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#ScienceSam_-_-_TEXT.html,". Even for me, I’m in viruses so I know nothing about the brain, its made neuroscience more accessible to me which is really cool. How did you come up with that…was it you or your lab? No, that one was me. I think I’m lucky that I have a lot of friends that are patient and they let me explain things to them. And even if you don’t explain to actual friends just saying it out loud and actually reducing your own science to its parts. What I started to see as I started explaining it, is I started to explain a hierarchy. I’m trying to explain cells like a hierarchy and they’re [her friends] looking confused. So I’m like ok, they don’t understand this. So ok, what looks the same as this hierarchy that they know about? I thought a family tree, and I really search for analogies all the time so that’s the short answer. Search for analogy that people know about, and every time I make and analogy I get good feedback. Pretty much anything you have to explain, consider if there is a good analogy. Don’t hammer the analogy too much, sometimes it doesn’t work when you really think about it. Think it through and know its limitations. Then it can be really fun because you can say “but unlike a grandma...” and you can really use it for teaching so… yeah, finding the analogy and you find those analogies by looking at your own science for its parts but not with your science lens/eyes. And one thing I’m interested in when I hear you're so active on Instagram and you post pictures of your microscopy which I think is awesome. I always wonder, do you get flack from your lab for posting stuff that might be unpublished, or maybe from the senior scientists that think your work is silly or stuff like that, are you worried about scooping? For scooping were ok. The grandma cell is actually very rare cell type that not many labs study and its really hard to work with so they can’t scoop me, even if they tried. I’m also careful not to show too much info. Sometimes people will DM me and I’ll give them more info there. I actually share a lot but I sometimes blur things or exclude a part from the picture, so I’m actually kind of cautious about that. Ill show in my story figures from my upcoming manuscript but at that point its done enough that I’m not worried. In terms of getting flack-judgements-from other people. People don’t take communications seriously and can you imagine me, a girly looking girl and I’m in"

How We Engaged the Public
The importance of learning has been a priority for our project from the beginning. From start, our project has been focused on involving the public in different ways in order to raise public awareness of our project and Synthetic Biology in general. At the beginning of our project, we got the impression that public awareness about protein folding and chaperones seems to be somewhat sparse. This is something we wanted to change.    By focusing on public engagement we wanted to involve society and enlighten people about the field of our project. Through this, in combination with education, which you can read more about below “Human Practice”, we attempted to improve the awareness concerning the field of our research.
Podcast: Attempting Science
Podcasts have the potential to reach a large group of people and can be about virtually anything one finds interesting or funny.  We thought this was a good way to reach out to a larger audience with our project. The result was a podcast called “Attempting Science” that has been updated on a regular basis throughout our project.
In this podcast, we talked about our project, in order to get a slightly broader range of subjects we also talked about other interesting subjects relating to our fields of study and synthetic biology. After the Nordic iGEM conference, we also invited the iGEM team from Chalmers University to participate. In this episode, we talked about their project and about the problems we have been facing along the way. Through this collaboration we also reached a broader audience, since Team Chalmers Gothenburg linked that episode on their wiki.     By posting our episodes on SoundCloud anyone could listen to them. We also posted about our podcast on our social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) to reach a greater number of listeners. This let us achieve one of our goals, to find a fun way to let people learn more about synthetic biology and to reach out with our project. It is available on our Youtube and Soundcloud!

Thursday, May 31, 2012
Fragments for the Multidirectional Promoter Project were digested and run through PCR by Hannah and Kevin. Kait and Victoria re-transformed the remaining 10 plasmids and 1 from yesterday that did not yield colonies. Kait and Victoria ran a gel to confirm a plasmid they could use in the Codon Optimization Project .
The originally transformed promoters were disposed of. Some of the cultures became a purple color. After centrifuging it was shown that the bacteria themselves were purple. This may be from contamination, so to be on the safe side, these plasmids were re-transformed. This may be an artifact from the plasmids themselves, but there is no consistent pattern. Very strange indeed! Always remember to use good sterile techniques when working with media and cultures!
Friday, June 1, 2012
Today Hannah digested components for the Multiple Start Codon Project . Later she ran a gel and extracted the components for later use. Kait and Victoria prepared a plasmid for the Codon Optimization Project . Kevin and Chris began work on a plasmid backbone and fluorescent component of the Multidirectional Promoters Project .
The team also received a new gel illuminator to see their bands without the use of UV light. They were very excited.

Dominika:
What can you tell us about the infection rate? Is it increasing or decreasing?
George:
It should be decreasing. Because something is happening. People are aware of the disease. They know how to control it. [...] In many areas it is eliminated [...].
Samira:
You seem to be an expert for the global mapping program. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about the trends between different countries? Because we always hear a lot about Ethiopia, that there is a huge problem [with trachoma] there compared to other countries. Can you tell us what’s the reason for that?
George:
I have never been to Ethiopia. I just have data for Ethiopia. So that’s why I told you that reasons are very difficult [to find]. [...] Maybe because of social [or] environmental [reasons]. I don’t know. [...] But what I know [is] when you look at their eyes there is a very high prevalence. [...] Just some few why's that I can answer is: it seems that they have many animals. Because of that there are many flies around. Those flies can easily transfer chlamydia from one to the other. There are children and there are flies coming to their faces. So that could be a reason why the prevalence there is high. Maybe their type of living. Maybe they live crowded. Because in other places they can be poor but because one family is here and the other one is there, they are separated. It can be a poor community but because of their non-communal life, the prevalence is lower. So culture affects [the prevalence] [...].

You looked at all these countries. Do you have like an estimate how the fight against trachoma is going in the countries in general?
George:
Yes. In all the countries where this project GTMP is there is a huge fight [...] against trachoma. [...] I can’t be very very detailed what they are being right now. But for Malawi we can say that we are eliminating trachoma by 2019 and many countries are the same, by 2020 might have eliminated trachoma.
Daniel C.:

Salmonella selection Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009 (VNP) has unique characteristics of high tumor targeting and low toxicity.  It can highly colonize central parts of tumor tissues.  Our project aims to decrease the influence of the bacteria on normal tissues by enhancing the bacteria's ability of tumor targeting through modifying the amino acid metabolism pathways.  We also use VNP as a vector to express exogenous genes with anaerobic promoters in the upper stream to further improve the effect of tumor targeting.  Thus, the bacteria could be used as an efficient method of tumor treatment.                                    ... learn more>>
Tumor-Targeted: tumor-targeting provides a high-performance manner in which we can treat cancer more accurately.
Salmonella: a kind of harmful bacterium may be the light to a harmful disease.
Anaerobic promoter: it can lead to the expression of some antitumor agents directly inside the tumor.
Kongfu-bacteria: the bacteria we designed is just like a Kongfu-panda,using its terrific ""Kongfu"" to kill tumors.
Auxotrophy：the inability of the Salmonella to synthesize a particular organic compound required for its growth.

Latest Update
At the Asia Jamboree, many iGEM participants played this game with fun.
However, we realized that some players were having trouble with playing, because they were not familiar with the idea of BioBricks and how to assemble them.
So, we thought the game will be more useful with some teaching material, which we have added.
Try our updated version of the BioBrick Puzzle!
Overview
""BioBrick Puzzle"" is a puzzle game for played for the purpose of learning BioBrick Standard assembly easily and enjoyably.  In this game, the challenge is to make a complex BioBrick part from several simple BioBrick parts provided.
Background
BioBrick is unique in its idempotent design for efficient assembly.  However, because of this uniqueness, if one wants to take part in iGEM and start his/her activites, it is necessary to learn about Biobricks for example by reading papers or taking tutorials on the web (iGEM's official web site).  But reading papers is tough for beginners, and although reading a static web site is rather easy it may be hard to  grasp the actual feeling of the operations and understand the value of the assembly technique.  Considering these problems, we created ""BioBrick Puzzle"", in which you can enjoy and learn about the BioBrick standard assembly process in an interactive way.  Playing with this game and experiencing the Assembly process, we think the user can understand the characteristics of BioBricks more easily.
Method
We utilized HTML5 and JavaScript to make our web-based software easy to use.  Since our software uses ""canvas"" of HTML5, any computer with modern internet browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari) can run it without any preparation.  This is quite convenient considering that most software requires installing or compiling.
Future
As stated above, we created a user-friendly software with web-based technology, but some problems remain in the comprehensiveness of the content.  In the future, we would"

A.Yes
B.No
5.Yeast prions can not infect human beings because there is no protein corresponding to them in our bodies. Furthermore, researchers are trying to employ them to know more about bovine spongiform enceohalopathy(mad cow disease) and Alzheimer's disease. Are you worried any more after we tell you these facts?
A.I'm not worried but we should use it carefully.
B.It can be used for scientific research but should be forbidden from industry.
C.We should prohibit all kinds of usage of it for we haven't understood it completely.
6.Yeast prions can self-assemble and aggregate or disperse according to different temperature or drugs.Do you come up with some innovative application of them?
7.What problems or obstacles do you think could affect the application of yeast prions to industry?
We got 1269 answers from different kinds of people and thus we could make some analyzations from these valuable data.
From the question 2 and 3 we can analyze the knowledge of the public to prions and yeast prions.             Q2:
Q3:
Since most people don't major in biology, we do not expect them to be very familiar with prions. We are glad to see that a great number of people have some knowledge of it (45.31% of them have heard about it or are familiar with it). However, the percentage of people knowing yeast prions is much less (12.69% of them have heard about it or are faliliar with it). We consider that it is because people are more likely to hear something about the horrible mad cow disease in news reports or Alzheimer's disease by contacting with some senior citizens suffering from it. Thus they began to search information about the diseases because of fear and curiosity, then they may get in touch with the word ""prion"". However, when it comes to yeast prions, people might know less about them for they cause no serious diseases and have less influence on people's life.
We also try to find out whether the eduction backgroud of people can have some relationships with their knowledge about prions.
By analyzing the responders' education level and their knowledge of prions together we are surprised to find the relationships beyond our expectation.
In common sense we expect that people's knowledge about biology increases when they get more education. Yet we discover the percentage of undergraduate college students knowing prions(405 out of 559 =72.4%) is much higher than that of bachelors(75 out of"

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

STEP 5: DISTRIBUTION
STEP 6: STATISTICAL TESTS ON DATA
We standardized all team data inputs based on the average UGA M3Z1 flourescence  unit data and created a matrix of this data. We then realized outliers were present in the matrix and ran an Extreme Studentized Deviate test to identify the outliers. After this was done, we created a new matrix similar to the initial matrix, with the numbers adjusted to ignore the outliers. Our data can be seen on our Measurement page.
STEP 7: WHAT THE DATA MEANS
From the collaboration study, we’ve gained priceless information about the reliability and reproducibility of our study, and cornerstones of the scientific method. Our collaboration study not only functions as a system of support that adds validity to our findings with the work we’ve done in the lab—it also only functions as an educational teaching tool that has brought awareness of the capabilities of methanococcus to anyone that read our proposal and knowledge of the methods of reading mCherry fluorescence. In addition, we believe it helps the scientific community as a whole. By creating the logistics and protocol schedule, we’ve created a system that can be used by anyone to distribute protein samples of any kind; provided minor alterations to the protocol be made if a group were working with another type of RFP or GFP. The information we’ve gained from this collaboration effort has been priceless and we’d encourage any team to try to implement our setup into their own study.
STEP 8: THE FUTURE
As for the future of the collaboration effort, we would like to send out recombinant cells for teams to observe the archaeal cells with a fluorescence microscope. Also, we would once again like to try to create an official iGEM Archaeal InterLab study to run side-by-side with the E. coli InterLab study. We strongly believe our ‘pilot’ collaboration study to be a huge success and would like to take it to the next step."

First, mutagenesis of the RFC10 restriction sites and the ApaI restriction site in the backbone of the pRS plasmids (compare figure: 2) was necessary for the execution of the following steps.
Figure 2: Mutagenized pRS plasmid maps. Important features are shown and the important restriction sites are highlighted.
After digestion of the vector using the ApaI and the SacI restriction sites and the insertion of short annealed oligos with the RFC10 restriction sites in the correct order (compare figure 3) is possible.
Figure 3: Inserted annealed primer containing RFC10 multiple cloning site with adjacent restriction sites.
After inserting the new RFC10 MCS and thereby biobricking the vector, it is possible to digest the vector with PstI and SacI in order to integrate the alcohol dehydrogenase terminator (tADH) in the pRS vectors. The restriction sites can be added to the ADH terminator by overhang PCR amplification (compare figure 4).
Figure 4: pRS plasmid maps with integrated RFC10 MCS. Important features are shown and the important restriction sites are highlighted.
To increase versatility, future approaches will be to implement different promoters using the ApaI and EcoRI restriction sites.
Introduction
In our sensor memory system a light activatable Cre recombinase is used to save the state of the sensor in the DNA. The main challenge we had to overcome for this part of our project, was to find a way to control the activity of the Cre recombinase using light. Luckily, we found that by fusing two copies of the protein Dronpa to the N- and C-terminus of the Cre recombinase, the protein should become light activatable.
Dronpa
Dronpa is a monomeric fluorescent protein with high similarity to GFP that is derived from the multimeric wild type protein of the Pectiniidae, which is a species of coral [Ando 2004] . Compared to other fluorescent proteins Dronpa is of special interest because it shows a photoswitchable behaviour. Illumination of the protein at around 488nm leads to bleaching of the protein inducing a ‘dark state’. Furthermore this transition is reversible, because illumination of the dark state protein at around 405nm recovers almost the full fluorescence potential [Ando 2004] .
Recently a mutant version of Dronpa was engineered that did not only show photoswitchable fluorescence but also oligomerization behaviour [Zhou 2012] . This mutation is lysine"

Support for New Technical Standard
This entire project is very tied to the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) effort. This is a set of three activities related to the standardization of a number of required synthetic biology concepts with the goal of facilitating software development. We contributed in the following ways.
SBOL Visual Promoter
SBOL Visual Open Reading Frame
SBOL Semantic Proposal
SBOL Visual - We worked with Suzie Bartram and Cesar Rodriquez at Stanford to make sure that Spectacles was 100% compliant with the the SBOL Visual standard. This included support to assign functional concepts to the icons as well as providing a very smooth upgrade path in the event the images evolve.
SBOL Semantic - By revamping the Clotho data model we have enabled the internal structure of Clotho to adapt to new ideas regarding the representation of biological data. Bing Xia and Douglas Densmore participated in the SB Data Exchange working group meeting at Stanford on 7/26/2009. Clotho as a project is committed to the support of this standard.
SBOL Script - SBOL script is an effort to develop a human readable specification. Eugene has been created to be a super-set of the eventual SBOL script. A key piece that we added support for in Eugene is the exporting of Eugene as an XML description. This will lead to the manipulation of Eugene by other tools as well as translating Eugene into a more restricted form which will be SBOL script.
Human Practices
Our project has the potential change the way humans interact with lab equipment via automation, how humans share information with each other, and the ways in which data is protected. We hypothesize how we can have the most impact in those three areas below:
Automation - software automation has the potential to reduce the amount of time spent in the laboratory by reducing errors, speeding up processes, and removing manual, repetitive operations. The UC Berkeley wet lab team made over 800 parts which would not have been possible without automation. In addition, automation can remove human workers from potentially hazardous environments as well. Automation can reduce the stress researchers feel when manual process fail and can free them up to pursue more intellectually rewarding activities. We contributed to automation by:
Providing automation workflows for liquid handling robots in Kepler
Creating optimal assembly strategies with Clotho's algorithm manager
Allowing composite device permutations to be specified and created with Eugene
Sharing - by enabling the use of centralize repositories of information users can share data locally and globally. Languages like Eugene allow high level specifications to be shared easily in a human readable format. Sharing allows users to be more productive as well as"

Warwick
Following several Skype conversations with Warwick iGEM the idea was born to arrange and plan an event together. The Warwick team kindly arranged for all of us to spend a day at Newman College in Oldham where we were able to spark an interest in studying science at university and give the students an introduction to synthetic biology and both of our projects.
We collaborated extensively on planning and designing two presentations which we presented together in five lessons over the course of the day. These presentations not only gave us the chance to convey our passion for science and Synthetic Biology but also allowed us to get an insight into each others iGEM projects.
It was a great experience to speak to teenagers and show them how many things they learn at school are applied in the real world. The feedback we received from both teachers and the students themselves was very positive and confirmed the importance of outreach activites as part of our project. We found it to be especially valulable to plan this event together with Warwick iGEM as it allowed us to share both of our iGEM experiences with the students as well as with each other.

pCOLD (BBa_K1949000) new characterization
Our collaboration started on August the 28th. One of our team members went to Japan for holidays and met the Tokyo Tech team. They presented their projects and due to the high similarity between their last project “SnowWhite” and our project, they proposed to do a lab & model collaboration. They sent us their BioBrick pCOLD, we performed new characterizations to improve their part registry, and gave them our model handbook preview to use for their iGEM project.                       Working with the Tokyo team was an amazing adventure and allowed us to fulfil one of the Silver medal criteria.
Thank you Tokyo Tech team, it was a pleasure to work with you!

Protein expression by OD measurements & kinetics and the establishment of the program SimRNA
Our collaboration started in August.The iGEM Bettencourt kindly provided us with awesome devices to measure fluorescence so we could characterize the expression of our proteins at different temperatures the best way! As we were not familiar with such methods, they explained and advised us very greatly. Without them we would have relied only on colorimetric measurements and could not have improved the characterization of the iGEM Tokyo part which relies on GFP.                        For their project, they needed to model their RNA organelle strands. We helped them for the establishment of the program “simRNA” and gave"
NUS_Singapore,2017,Team:NUS Singapore#Model P_-_-_TEXT.html," model serves as a proof of concept and acts as a target for achieving the ideal performance of the genetic circuit. To generate the functional model for the Simple Circuit, we reduced the expression of toxin E2 by 20% and increased the binding affinity of the temperature promoter. The effect of these changes allows for us to generate the functional model.
Figure 5 The functional model illustrates the ideal performance of the Simple Circuit in all timing states. This serves as a proof of a concept that the Simple Circuit can successfully be used as a kill switch for engineered probiotics!
How can we aid the experimenter?
We first applied a sensitivity analysis to determine which kinetic values had the largest effect on the output response. Our sensitivity analysis determined that the binding affinity, and promoter strength of the temperature promoter, and the promoter strength of phosphate promoter were the most sensitive parts of the circuit. As a result, because the phosphate sensor by NYMU Taipei in 2008 (which we intended to use) was very weak, we decided to improve this part by increasing its expression level and range (more details at improvement page ).
Need to be mindful about phosphate sensor expression level
Figure 6 Low phopshate promoter strength delays the killing time and hence, renders the kill switch ineffective.
Figure 7 Decreasing the promoter strength of the phosphate promoter reduces the effect that leaky TlpA has on the output response, anti-toxin IM2
Figure 6 shows that if the Km of the temperature sensor is high (more repressors are required to repress the sensor), the circuit will not work if the phosphate sensor is weak (i.e., IM2 will not be repressed). This also suggests that we need to improve the phosphate sensor expression by NYMU Taipei in 2008. Further analysis using the model also revealed that we need to be mindful about not having too strong a phosphate promoter (figure 7) which might result in unintended leakiness and causing the circuit to malfunction, assuming that the temperature promoter has a low binding affinity.
Dealing with a Strong Toxin
Figure 8 If E2 toxin is too strong, we recommend increasing the strength of pTlpA. Increasing pTlpA increases IM2 expression. However, if IM2 is produced in excess, this can cause increased metabolic stress for the host.
Figure 9 Ideal promoter strength for effective and reliable killing.
Another potential problem that can be elucidated during the construction of the circuit is the balancing of toxin and antitoxin expressions. In the genetic circuit, the toxin E2, is controlled by a constitutive promoter while the antitoxin"

Better Biobrick Characterization
Characterization of the Efficiency of the ATF1 Enzyme
The ATF1 enzyme converts isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate, which gives off a strong banana odor. The conversion of isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate can be monitored using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Thus, the efficiency of the ATF1 enzyme can be characterized.
We have constructed two different biobricks that include the ATF1 gene. The first biobrick, BBa_K1423006 , contains a heavy metal iducible promoter (BBa_J33201) ,and a construct consisting of a ribosome binding site, the ATF1 gene, and a double terminator (BBa_J45199) .The second biobrick, BBa_K1423007 , consists of a high strength constitutive promoter (BBa_J23100) , a ribosome binding site, the ATF1 gene, and the double terminator (BBa_J45199) .
BBa_K1243007: Inducible Banana Odor Generator
BBa_K1243008: Constitutive Banana Odor Generator
Quantification of ATF1 through Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy
Before we could quantify our results through gas chromatography, we had to make sure that the liquid LB agar that cells were grown would not interfere with our ability to read the presence of isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate. Included below is a chromatograph showing both of these compounds injected into LB form cell growth until at 5mM concentration. To ensure they were correct, we simultaneously performed a mass spectroscopy of this sample, whose results verified that these compounds were correct, as their molecular makeups were analogous to isoamyl alcohol and isoam"
KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Details_-_-_TEXT.html," as a response to lactose or IPTG uptake by E.D. Frosti from the medium. Lactose/IPTG will interact with the pLac-Lux promoter, so that transcription of CI repressor, CrtEBI and INP can occur. As discussed above, the CI repressor protein will act as an inhibitor of the pLux-CI promoter. The CrtEBI operon encodes the three last enzymes of the cartenoid pathway, that are needed to produce lycopene. E. coli itself is able to produce farnesyl pyrophosphate, which is converted to geranyl geranyl-PP by CrtE, which is transformed to pytoene by CrtB, which finally is modified to a lycopene molecule by CrtI. Lycopene production results in a bright red color, so that we can clearly see that CrtEBI as well as INP are expressed. Many different INPs exist in different organisms and we used the InaZ form from the Pseudomonas syringae. INP already contains a transmembrane domain and its active site is located extracellularly to induce ice nucleation in the environment. Therefore, we do not have to add an extracellular anchor. In fact, in previous iGEM competitions, the Berkeley_wetlab_2009 team has created a biobrick in which they specifically use only the (extracellular) INP-repeats as a cell-surface displayer spacer part, to improve the display of passenger domains: BBa_K197026 . If you like to learn more about INP , feel free to click here !
3. Cell death mechanism
We want E.D. Frosti to be coated with one of the two proteins, but we also want E.D. Frosti to die when we release it into the environment. Therefore, we created a suicide mechanism that is regulated by an AND-gate system. First, E.D. Frosti needs to respond to one of the stimuli, so that the pLac-Lux or the pLux-CI promoter is activated resulting in transcriptional activation.
The second part of the cell death mechanism works via a ribokey-ribolock system. The ribokey is under the control of the HybB cold-sensitive promoter ( BBa_J45503 ), which will only be switched on when E.D. Frosti senses a dramatic drop of the temperature. So when the ribokey isn’t transcribed, the ribolock mRNA will form a hairpin structure, so that the ribosomes cannot"

The major differences between the results and our theoretical values was the later maximum GFP concentration and the difference between the measured maximum and the theoretical maximum for 9×10-9moles/dm-3 of miRNA. In order to delay the peak in GFP concentration the rate of RNA decay had to be decreased. We also introduced a term for GFP degradation, to account for the peak in fluorescence. We then tried to fit the data by changing the parameters with these ideas in mind. The new values for these parameters were:

Together with Matilda, we drew conclusions of our testing and further developed the product. I contacted and visited the Urlinski cosmetics production line manufacturer in Poland in order to learn more about the large-scale production of cosmetics. I was responsible for analyzing the results of the survey with Jenny. To the wiki, I wrote about patents, viscosity and contamination tests as well as market research.

I was one of our main lab persons. Thus, I did a lot of background research on our topic, and designed and planned our experiments together with Usha and Meryem. Together with Meryem, we designed our constructs. I taught Jenny how to use Geneious so she could design primers for our BioBricks. Since I was more experienced with genetics I could offer my expertise when it was needed in the lab. I spent most of my time in the lab performing experiments, but I also took part in some of our human practice activities and visits, as well as collaborations related to the lab work. I was one of the presenters in the Nordic iGEM Conference and have contributed a lot to the text in our first poster. I also communicated the lab results to the rest of the team.
Science first! Then comes other things.

During our project I was mainly taking care of application design and branding our project. I shared visual design responsibilities with Jenny and created designs for banners, flyers, photos and final poster. Wiki layout is also designed by me and together with Meo we created the structure. I have taken all the background photos for wiki. I took care and scheduled meetings with experts and interviewed people, contacted media and built up human outreach activities. For example, I had a huge role in organizing, designing and preparing the Heureka Science Center activities. I’ve written many articles about our project to different publishing outlets. I also learned lots of new skills for example writing html. Because of my background in design I was also taking care that our project is clear and understandable for people outside scientific fields. To the wiki I wrote the pages Story, The Concept, Applied Design and hugely contributed to Integrated Human Practices and Silver pages. A lot of the wiki illustrations, especially on the Human Practices were done by me. I took care of most of the steps in product development and material decisions regarding the consistency and components of the gel. The package design for the final product and our team sweaters and t-shirts were designed by me.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#asoMain#Project#Background-Problem_-_-_TEXT.html," the heart cells in the territory of the occluded coronary artery die (chiefly through necrosis) and do not grow back. A collagen scar forms in their place which also puts the patient at risk for potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, and may result in the formation of a ventricular aneurysm that can rupture with catastrophic consequences. A heart attack requires immediate medical attention. Treatment attempts to save as much viable heart muscle as possible and to prevent further complications, hence the phrase ""time is muscle”.
Although the main symptoms of heart attack are well-known and described, some of these attacks can be mild and unrecognized. This results in the weakening and the loss of heart tissue which may pave the way of more dangerous heart attacks that can end up with death. In many cases, in some estimates as high as 64%, the person does not have chest pain or other symptoms. These heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks (3). At least one-fourth of all heart attacks are silent, without chest pain or other symptoms. These cases can be discovered later on electrocardiograms, using blood enzyme tests or at autopsy without a prior history of related complaints, which all of these are late for an effective treatment. This latency nature of heart attacks obliges us to find a more effective prevention or solution that can initiate the healing process instantly.

Of course, the treatment of ischemia includes the removal of the blockage. However, the real problem is only beginning here. So far, we are able to dissolve the clot ingredients with specific medications. However the hypoxic tissue have adapted to this new hard conditions in order to survive by accelerating and multiplying energy providing pathways and oxygen dependent reactants. The absence of oxygen and nutrients from blood during the ischemic period creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in inflammation and oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress rather than restoration of normal function.
These oxygen consuming reactions may cause some leakages that can produce some toxic chemicals called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are some oxygen intermediate products that have a lack of electron in their covalent bonds, which makes them ultimately undetermined. By means of this, ROS can disrupt almost every cation and anion structures in cell media.
The removal of clot brings fresh blood with high oxygen concentration to hypoxic tissue. This restoration of blood supply to ischemic tissues can cause additional damage known as reperfusion injury that can be more damaging than the initial ischemia. (5) Reintroduction of blood flow brings oxygen back to the tissues, causing a"

Still not much luck getting any drag and drop things to work
Things to look into:
Me:
Dig through BioJADE source to see what they did -> hard to pinpoint the useful pieces
AWT canvas (in Java) -> nope, it's just a rectangular area to paint stuff on
Icons in Swing -> maybe: icons can be inserted into labels, labels can be moved by writing handling code for mouse actions, labels not moving as I want them to though, also seems like it would be tedious to write an entire GUI this way
Richard:
Jython Tk
JavaFX -> might work
QT with Java
Group meeting
Friday
Trying some more things with moving icons in labels
Using JavaFX in Java demo that Richard found online runs successfully
Trying to modify to work as a Clotho plugin to see if we would be able to use JavaFX with Clotho
Not successful yet, Richard and I are still trying to track down the source of the problem(s)
Some key piece may be missing or somehow Clotho can't access it

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#HumanPractice#NRP59_-_-_TEXT.html," with GMPs, on the other hand it is not known if further experiments will be done in Switzerland if the moratorium on commercially used plants is extended further and further [7].
In a way, that was a victory for the opponents of GMP, as illustrated by the quote by Dieter Imboden, president of the National Research Council of the Swiss National funds: 'I do not think that there will be more outdoor tests in Switzerland' . [7] Yet outdoor experiments are important since the result from green houses can be reverted in outdoor experiments or the positive effects can be lower in a less controlled environment such as nature. Without a testing infrastructure the tests are way too expensive.
A similar argument can be found in the interview with Prof. Potrykus , who states:” The series of moratoriums decisively contributed to the fact that research with GMP makes no more sense in Switzerland, with all consequences. Switzerland bows out of the development of a technology that is regarded as  ‘strategic future technology’ in many other countries. Switzerland once had a leading position on this field (see golden rice project)' , when asked for the consequences of the moratorium. About the consequences, he thinks ‘One must let the Swiss carry the can of their decision. They will realize when it is too late […]’ .
Mr. Markus Ritter says on the topic: ‘My position there is to keep the research safe and wait for the breakthrough. Cultivation experiments however, the ones that are prohibited, should be done in big agricultural states not here in Switzerland. But the research is important and we want to preserve it.’ .
He gives another reason to preserve the research in this technology : ‘We are currently running towards many big challenges, like climate change und increasing population. We may in the future be in need of plants that can grow in dry conditions.’
As a response on the final results, the article ‘science has spoken’ was published in ‘Wochenzeitung’ [6]:
It quotes again Dieter Imboden who warns: “programs as NRP 59 raises the expectation that science can decide about such polarizing questions. Science cannot render such help” . Even though ‘science’ gave a positive answer as a result of NRP, this does not mean there is all of a sudden great acceptance for a technology that raises many fears and doubts in population. Furthermore, scientists do not all agree to the estimated costs and benefits of GMPs, so there is a lot of room for discussion left. Despite of the fact that disagreement is an integral part of research and almost a prerequisite of progress"

Trouble in the Lab
9.6.2014
The backbones didn't seem to be working right and the negative control kept growing. Not good.
The reason seemed to be that we hadn’t gel purified the backbone and it kept religating with itself.
The Ligation Calculator
5.6.2014
We made a ligation calculator to help us estimate the amounts of different plasmids to be digested. The calculator calculates how many microliters of miniprepped plasmid is needed to be digested in order to pipet 4 ul of each digestion mix to the ligation mix. Insert-plasmid ratio as well as vector mass fields could be changed if needed. Taking these two variables into account, the appropriate molar amount and then the mass amount of inserts are calculated using the information of their lengths. This tiny little excel tool really saved time in the lab during the summer.

Applications to other disease
There many other diseases where screening has the potential to be effective - and miRNAs can be used as biomarkers to achieve this. MiRNAs, and their links to diseases, are still being researched. However, new relationships are constantly being discovered, and they have the potential to be applied to a myriad of cancers - and potentially other diseases in a point of care setting.
Pancreatic Cancer
Elevated levels of miR-196a and 196b can act as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. These could be used for the screening of high risk individuals, for example those with familial pancreatic cancer. Current imaging methods used for screening are often unable to detect early cancers and high grade precursor lesions in high risk individuals [18] . The main reason mass population screening cannot be done is that there is no suitably accurate test. [19] Early detection could increase survival rates, as it allows curative pancreatic resection surgery. [18] Similar to NSCLC, late detection is a primary reason why mortality rates are so low - pancreatic cancer is asymptomatic in early stages, and symptoms usually only present themeselves in later stages where it is far more difficult to treat. [20] At stage 3 there is a median survival rate of 6-11 months and at stage 4 it is 2-6 months, [21] whereas surgically resectable pancreatic cancer has survival rates of 11-20 months [22] . Currently only 8% of people diagnosed are able to have surgery due to late diagnosis. [23] MiRNA as a target for screening could allow early detection and thus reduce mortality rates.

His work on these proteins formed the foundation of our project. We spent a lot of time in the lab together and Phil has spent countless hours supervising and guiding us in and outside of the lab. We got to know Phil as a creative scientist with many innovative ideas. A more detailed description can be found here. Click to read his biography.
I performed my PhD research under the guidance of Prof. Peter Davies At Queen’s University in Canada. My research focused on determining the structure of a giant 1.5-MDa protein that facilitates the bacterial biofilm formation. My postdoctoral research in the Voets' group involves the use of protein engineering and synthetic biology approaches to study ice-nucleation/ antifreeze proteins/materials. In addition, I am also conducting research related to bacterial adhesins which are required for the formation of bacterial biofilms. Biofilms cause over 80% of the chronic bacterial infections. I am using a structure-guided approach to rationally design small molecules to block biofilms formed by these pathogens.

Therefore, we aim to develop an ideal food-safe grade microorganism with enhanced acid and cold tolerance.
    Genome mutagenesis combined with high-throughput technologies was performed on Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 to screen acid tolerance strain. Next, comparative transcriptomics analysis was performed on mutant and parent strain to investigate the response mechanisms of microbial cells during acid stress. Based on the proposed acid tolerance mechanisms, one new anti-acid component—msmK was discovered. Also, an anti-cold gene cspD2 was selected. The constructed recombinant strain Lactococcus lactis NZ3900/pNZ 8149-msmK-cspD2 shows a significant survival advantage compared with Lactococcus lactis NZ3900/pNZ 8149, which means our product exhibited enhanced acid and cold tolerance.
    This study provides valuable insight into the development of robust industrial strains.

We have considered tuning pLuxR promoter instead of adding ABR and antisense RNA. However, we predicted                     that there will be a tradeoff. If the promoter is tuned to express low level of LuxI, that will minimize                     AHL production. Thus, the leakiness will be reduced. However, that means the impact of AHL diffusing                     across cell membrane will be impeded given that AHL concentration inside the cell affects the diffusion                     rate across cell membrane.
The adjustment of pLuxR promoter should satisfy the criteria that:
It will not constitutively express until LuxR:AHL complex induces
It can produce high LuxI product which catalyzes high concentration of AHL once induced.
Apparently, mutation of promoter to lower the leakiness cannot compensate the second criterion. Thus, the                     second suggestion for improvement is to use Gram-positive bacteria as a chassis.
CUHK's characterization
We sent our parts to CUHK to characterize and validate our sensing module’s constructs for the effect of                     antisense RNA on the basal expression level. However, their results are not consistent with our results.                     Because there was no increase in fluorescence/OD600 for our positive control I, we omit their results                     in our data processing and interpretation.

MIT,2013,Team:MIT#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Mammalian cells can be engineered through a variety of methods – the use of viral vectors that integrate into the genome, exogenous introduction of proteins or other factors, or transient transfection of non-replicating DNA. The use of viral vectors, while common in laboratory settings, would be a certain critical risk in containment and safety of our undergrad researchers due to the ability of some classes of viruses to infect humans in addition to test tubes of cells. The use of proteins or external cues did not afford the possibility to manipulate our mammalian cells in the necessary fashion and thus we chose to only use transient transfection. Because transient transfection does not use replicating DNA, it represents a negligible risk to users when decontaminated and disposed according to MIT Environmental Health and Safety regulations https://ehs.mit.edu/site/. We used similar risk matrices to arrive on decisions of what cell lines to engineer, the use of various reagents in our work, and the policy on necessary personal protective equipment during experiments.
Outreach to the Non-Technical Community
As part of an ongoing thrust to introduce synthetic biology to the community at large outside of research universities, we pursued a partnership with the Museum of Science in Boston. A teammate’s friend was an intern at the Museum and we were able to secure a meeting between one of the outreach coordinators, Miriam Ledley, and our team on introducing a display into the Theater of Electricity on applying circuit design into the biological sciences. Miriam lead us through the specifications required of an exhibit – the educational content required, the build quality of an apparatus, the age-group of participants, and procedural aspects for biocontainment. For instance, initial ideas involved students streaking out rapidly dividing fluorescent bacteria on solid agar plates and visualizing their bacteria under a black light in the afternoon as well as assembling circuits using physical block abstractions. While we were able to design a unified lesson plan for inclusion in the exhibit, the balance between engaging children with biological material in a safe manner has become a much harder than anticipated challenge. The lack of a contained lab environment in the museum as well as the infrastructure necessary to house bacterial stocks, plates, and project supplies were above and beyond what our team could provide to the museum. We have since followed up with the MIT Center for Environmental Health and Safety (CEHS) to build off some of their experience using Lego DNA Kits in the Cambridge Science Festival and apply a similar LEGO model approach to synthetic biology as an activity. Tentatively, we are slated to assemble and deliver our first prototype kit for feedback from users in the Synthetic Biology Center in mid-November of this year.

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. The economic burden of these parasites is forecasted to increase, since these worms are rapidly gaining resistance to most drugs used to combat them. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these small strongyles. Our vision has been to apply synthetic biology to the untouched field of veterinary diagnostics by developing a better tool for detection, thus decreasing the growth of resistance among small strongyles. While working towards the goal of creating a reprogramed smart bacteria (nicknamed the worm buster) to detect and report the presence of the small strongyles, we discovered new useful applications of existing techniques along the way. This has made our vision about the worm buster more realistic, which in the future will provide the tools necessary to help farmers make a decisions whether to treat their animals or not.
Our work has laid the foundation for our idea to someday potentially come to fruition. Our novel applications of cutting edge techniques such as phage display and transcriptomics using third generation sequencing provide groundwork for further expansions in the field of veterinary diagnostics.
The Targets
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 8].
Figure 1: Small strongyles.
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the"

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," Switch
We choose toehold switch as our miRNA detector. The structure of toehold switch is similar to hairpin, except it has a loop at the top as ‘toehold’. Toehold switch functions as riboregulator through linear-linear interaction between RNAs. When target RNA appears, it will bind one of the toehold switch stems and open the loop, exposing the RBS.
Toehold switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the switch and trigger. The switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. Upstream of this coding sequence is a hairpin-based processing module containing both a strong RBS and a start codon that is followed by a common 21 nt linker sequence coding for low-molecular-weight amino acids added to the N terminus of the gene of interest. A single-stranded toehold sequence at the 50 end of the hairpin module provides the initial binding site for the trigger RNA strand. This trigger molecule contains an extended single-stranded region that completes a branch migration process with the hairpin to expose the RBS and start codon, thereby initiating translation of the gene of interest.
Our Circuit to Detect miRNA-144
There are 3 parts in our circuit in total.
Part 1 includes toehold switch for miRNA-144 and GFP coding sequence. When miRNA-144 exists, the switch is on and mRNA for GFP is transcribed.
Part 2 contains toehold switch for GFP mRNA and T3 RNA polymerase coding sequence (BBa_K346000). Note that, since the maximum length of trigger RNA for toehold switch is about 25nt, so we analyzed GFP mRNA’s structure and choose a small piece from it which ensures binding specificity and stability.
Part 3 is simply a GFP generator (BBa_E0840), with T3 promoter. As we know, T3 promoter can only function when bound with T3 RNA polymerase.
So now it’s clear that, part 2 and part 3 are designed for amplification. They form a positive feedback loop. So the whole process is as follow: when miRNA-144 exists, it triggers part 1 and GFP mRNAs are transcribed. These mRNA on the one hand can be directly translated to GFP and show green fluorescence, on the other hand, can trigger part 2 and T3 RNA polymerase is transcribed and translated, which enables part 3 to work, thus transcribe more GFP mRNAs. And these GFP mRNAs can also be used to active more part"

Fionn said a lot of technologies promised to solve the world's environmental problems. He asked what the real solutions were.
Murdo said biotechnology might be useful, along with many other things. We need to reduce, reuse, recycle. Humanity is living beyond its means. Biotechnology might be one tool we use to ameliorate these problems.
Yassen asked what advice they would give to people considering synthetic biology as a career.

Nicolas Peyret; Scottish Enterprise
Scottish Enterprise works with the Scottish government to encourage economic development in Scotland.
Nicolas is a technology and market analyst for Scottish Enterprise, focusing on the life sciences. He was interviewed in person, by our team members Fionn Tynan-O'Mahony and Yassen Abbas.
Fionn asked Nicolas to explain his role.
His role has been to find new technologies with good potential, and help them become commercialised. Recently he has been focusing on bottlenecks in the industry, especially DNA Assembly. [Note: Scottish Enterprise recently completed a £2.5 million development of the ""Genome Segment Assembly"" technique in collaboration with Gingko Bioworks.]
Fionn asked whether his work involved other fields outside the life sciences. Nicolas said work in synthetic biology naturally involved other fields, because of the range of applications, for example energy and chemicals.
Yassen asked Nicolas about what the term ""synthetic biology"" means to him.
Nicolas said it was a new field born of a new way of looking at biology, from an engineering perspective, using engineering concepts such as reusable parts, e.g. systems that can be put in different organisms.
Yassen said that many people considered synthetic biology an engineering field. But Nicolas sees it more as a combination of both.
Fionn asked about the role of biotechnology in the future.
Nicolas said it would be enormous in the future. We can already see some applications; synthetic biology is already very important. He quoted a report that projected a $4.5 billion market by 2015. And it will continue to grow, due to the wide range of applications; for example many companies and academic"

Scientists
During the proceedings of our experiments, we contacted variety of scientists to discuss the contents of our project and question its safety. Prof. Dr. Aladin Szalay, founder of genelux corperation is a scientist who spent many years performing researches using the Nissle 1917 bacteria. Initially we gathered some questions on Nissle and e-mailed Prof. Szalay in which he offered to make a skype chat for a more in-depth talk. The one hour long conversation was based on iGEM following with our project in which we informed Prof. Szalay on our project and questioned him on how safe it is to use Nissle as our choice of bacteria. Prof. Szalay kindly answered each of our questions and also explained his current promising researches which enabled us to think on a larger scale and improve our project. We have also been invited for a two week training in his science research centre.
On the other hand, our faculty’s immunology specialist Prof. Dr. Bulent Bozkurt spared some time off his deadly full schedule to listen to our project where he asked questions that forced us to think deeper and seek answers for the unanswered questions; this enabled us to strengthen our weak points.
University
Three sets of presentations were held in our university where iGEM and our project was explained. Our intention was to enable each individual studying in our university to discover the intriguing contents of iGEM and what it feels like to be a member of such a rewarding organisation. In total, approximately 400 people including 1st, 2nd and 3rd year medical students listened to us. Many students then asked the following questions: What is"

Fig.10, on the other hand, showed fatty acids content in sedimentation also went up by 40%, up to 5.02mg/(L·OD). The result is still within our expectation since fatty acyl-ACP has been removed from the reaction system to form free fatty acids. As a result, the chemical equilibrium shifts and more fatty acids would be accumulated.
We also witnessed a slight decrease in E.coli expressing free TesA compared with the wildtype, which testifies the statement in a previous study that high levels of TesA inhibits fatty acids synthesis activity but could enhance the activity at low concentrations.
Assay of the Refinement of Interaction
We have tried to facilitate exportation of fatty acids by linking TesA to membrane protein. In this way, we accelerated the reaction and increased the turnover per unit time and finally make it possible to efficiently produce fatty acids with longer carbon chains which are much more preferable biofuel precursors. The result verifies one privilege of Membrane Scaffold: Priority to Exportation. Actually another privilege that Membrane Scaffold enjoys is that protein interaction is improved and stabilized due to the spatial restriction. Thus we could more easily assemble different enzymes together to decrease the distance that intermediates need to travel between each enzyme. In this way biochemical reaction should be accelerated sharply.
FabG, FabI, FabZ play significant roles in the elongation of carbon chain of fatty acyl-ACP. To optimize the productivity of the system we established, we tried to combine these two privileges (Priority to Exportation and Refinement of Interaction) together, gathering TesA, FabG, FabI and FabZ on membrane through protein interaction. Notable increase in both diversity and amount of fatty acids was detected compared to control group, which lends strong support to our hypothesis.
The construction detail of experimental group is shown in Fig.5. Control group is E.coli expressing the same amount of diffusing cytoplasmic TesA, FabG, FabI and FabZ.
Fig.11 shows fatty acid content in supernatant of three groups to evaluate the advantages of membrane anchored TesA，FabG,FabZ and FabI. A indicates C16/C18 fatty acids content. B stands for the total amount of fatty acids. C shows the changes in products diversity.

Parts Overview CRISPRi Light Sensor
Overview
This year we made the components of CRISPRi system into parts and submitted to the iGEM Registry. With continuously increasing interest in work relevant to CRISPRi system, we believe these 2 parts will provide lots of convenience to users. Since in our project we hope that light could be the only parameter that we directly adjust, we did some improvements to the pre-existing parts: inserting them into a constant expressing operon.
All of our parts can be divided into 2 categories, the CRISPRi system and the light sensing system.
CRISPRi
Original Components: dCas9 protein(BBa_K1026001) and sgRNA(BBa_K1026003)
Constitutive Expressing Components: dCas9 protein(BBa_K1026000) and sgRNA(BBa_K1026002)
We have tested CRISPRi system though the following experiment: After successful transformation, the control group expressed dCas9 and mRFP constitutively while the case group expressed dCas9, sgRNA and mRFP. The color of these two groups should be different due to the knock down effect of CRISPRi system.
The result is in consistent with our expectation:
Additionally, the base-pairing region can be changed according to different people's needs. Inverted PCR will provide an easy way to replace this region and make it a universal and convenient regulating tool.
We also built the part that combines a promoter regulated by light sensor with sgRNA(BBa_K1026004), if used together with light sensing system, the red light will negatively control the expression amount of sgRNA, thus affecting the reporter genes or functional genes.
Light Sensor
After careful discussion and selection, we chose three light-controlled gene expression systems induced by red, green, and blue respectively. Main parts of these 3 sensing systems all have been used by 2011_Uppsala Team.
From"
Lund,2018,Team:Lund#Design#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," conditions. However, when the vgb gene was instead carried on a plasmid, both PHB production and cell growth were far lower than with no VHb at all [21]. They theorized that the negative effect might be due to the burden of carrying an additional or a larger plasmid to accommodate the vgb gene. However, it has been shown that integrating vgb on the chromosome of the E. coli strain in question lowers the expression level compared to when a multicopy plasmid is used [22], again suggesting that a lower expression level may be more beneficial than a high one.
In both the studies described above, VHb was shown to only be beneficial when expressed at a low level, with higher VHb expression leading to a poorer outcome than with no VHb at all. This is in contrast to a study done in 1996 by Tsai et al., who by modulating the concentration of the inducer Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) showed that increasing levels of VHb expression was associated with increasing final cell density (up to 2.7-fold compared to the VHb- strain) and a reduction in fermentation byproducts such as acetate and lactate [18]. However, as opposed to the other two groups above, they did not study the formation of any specific industrially relevant product.
The three studies described above all employed different methods to obtain variation in the VHb expression level - changing the IPTG concentration [18], inserting the vgb gene into different plasmids [20] and chromosomal integration [21]. However, we have not found any articles studying the effect on yield or productivity where the only variable in the expression system is the strength of the promoter under which VHb is expressed. In addition, VHb seems underutilized, especially within iGEM. We wanted to investigate its relevance in the synthetic biology community.
Previous iGEM teams
Until now, only two previous iGEM teams have to our knowledge adopted VHb technology in their projects. Imperial college 2014 co-expressed vgb in Gluconacetobacter xylinus to promote the production of cellulose. By doing so, they achieved an almost twofold increase in cell density using the G. xylinus iGEM strain. SCU-China 2016 used the same gene in E. coli to enhance growth in oxygen limited environments. It was shown that by expressing vgb, an improvement of both growth and protein production was obtained in the early stage of cell cultivation. However"

The factors that affect the peroxidase functionality, however, are not in correlation with the factors that affect catalase activity, thus the hydrogen peroxide degradation. The hydrogen peroxide degradation is usually at maximum levels for the enzymatic activity. The entalphy values for these enzymatic are as follows:
Wild-type katG Coded HPI Catalase Entalphy: +17 kJ mol-1 13
Wild-type katA Coded HPC Catalase Entalphy: +100.4 kJ mol-1 14
These values show that both reactions have very high exothermic values per each mole. The H. pylori strains, however, are significantly higher, showing the efficiency of the reaction mechanism of HPC catalase. H. pylori produces catalase to maintain its life functions and it would be understandable that its catalase would be functioning at such levels of efficiency.

Our outreach to other iGEM teams included attending a Mini Jamboree, conducting an iGEM-wide survey, producing a pamphlet on biocontainment for iGEM teams, and designing a widget to help teams choose a biocontainment method.
First, we needed to assess the biocontainment knowledge of iGEM teams. We wanted to find out what people knew, and more importantly didn’t know, about biocontainment. We accomplished this first on a small scale, by attending the Mid-Atlantic Mini Jamboree, hosted by the University of Maryland. We exchanged project ideas with other teams. We also hosted a biocontainment forum with the other attending teams. This forum inspired us to create electronic tools and expand our outreach to other teams. We created an online biocontainment survey to gauge understanding of biocontainment across iGEM teams. Using the results of this survey, we developed a comprehensive pamphlet. We also created an interactive web widget that allows iGEM teams to customize biocontainment that fits their project. Do teams need something robust, something quick, or a method that fulfills other criteria? With our widget (see below), they can find the perfect solution.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the test to high risk individuals for whom the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of their cancer could lead to an increase in the rate of survival: in the case of NSCLC, this could be carried out by offering the test to those with a certain smoking history. To determine which individuals had a sufficiently high risk of developing NSCLC, for our sensor to be cost effective, we have designed a cost model - take a look below.
He also proposed that if the concept of our test were to be proven and a variety of miRNAs could be detected as biomarkers for a range of cancers, then our test could be used as a screening tool for anyone over a certain age, due to the increase in cancer prevalence with age. His comments led us to research the required criteria below for our sensor to be used as a screening tool. His advice on the high sensitivity and specificity required fed into our need to create a second series of switches.
Dr Sujal Desai
We discussed the use of our sensor for high risk population screening with Dr Desai, a consultant chest radiologist. He informed us that lung cancer rarely presents before age 40, and to maximize the test’s value it should be offered to those aged 55 and above, with a smoking history - so that we would not waste money offering the test to too many people who were very unlikely to have cancer.
To integrate their advice, we worked with our our modeling team to work out who would we should screen. Tammegami et al.’s probability score is the probability of an individual getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. [2]
Using our model which combined this with the data for our project and standard NSCLC treatment, we worked out for what probabilities it would be cost effective for us to screen. The model showed that our tool could be cost effective at cost per QALY - saving lives and saving the NHS money. It shows that even if our sensitivity was lower than we expect, our sensor would be extremely cost effective.
