BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," NhaB.  NhaB is not effected by pH, and can assist NhaA to regulate alkaline environment. Here we assumed that initial pH was 9.0 and NhaB had already been activated.
Fig.4 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance device led by NhaA.  NhaA will be induced at pH 7.0 ~ 8.2, while NhaB will function when NhaA cannot function normally. Here we assumed that initial pH was 8.0 and NhaA had already been activated.
○ Regulation Model
As for regulation subsystem model, pH-responsive promoters are combined with functional genes.      The acid regulation device consists of acid-responsive promoter P-asr and alkali-synthesis gene gadA (Fig.5). gadA catalyzes the proton-consuming conversion of glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and GABA can be excreted outside and neutralize the micro-environment.
The alkali regulation device is made up of alkali-responsive promoter P-atp2 and functional gene ldhA (Fig.6). ldhA encodes a lactate dehydrogenase which converts pyruvate to lactate. Lactate will be secreted outside the cell and neutralize the OH-.
We assumed that the H+ or OH- was straightly contacted with the promoters and induced the transcription process. For functional genes, their translation, degradation and catalysis processes are mainly analyzed in this model because the products of these two genes are both enzymes.
The final simulation results are shown below (Fig.7). In acidic condition, the regulation subsystem will produce GABA and reduce the extracellular pH. When environmental pH becomes alkaline, regulation subsystem will make lactate to neutralize the outside pH. Eventually the environmental pH will be constrained between the pH range where two promoters are both repressed (but with fluctuation).
Fig.7 Extracellular pH regulated by basic regulation subsystem. In normal fermentation environment, pH will tend to decrease and enter acidic level. Basing on this phenomenon, we assumed that the initial pH was 4.0, and our device was functioning.
Fine-regulation circuits models
Overview of Fine-regulation Circuits Model
Three fine regulation circuits are designed so that we can apply different regulation circuits according to different fermentation situations. The external environment can be sensed by the pH-responsive promoters. We ligated different kinds of recombinase down pH-responsive promoters. The recombinase can invert downstream constitutive promoter. This function is applied for conversion between acid and alk"

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) iGEM 2013 team has built a fatty acid inducible system that enable inducible glyoxylate shunt to serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cells to ultimately increase energy expenditure responding to high circulating fatty acid levels. This can help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. To express this futile cycle, genes necessary for the inducible glyoxylate shunt need to be introduced into a human body. Because introducing genes into the human body is currently not a common therapeutic method, we thought it would be necessary to research on the details of how our project could be actually applied. Even though the application of our project may not occur in the near future, we thought it was necessary to evaluate our project’s application as a potential biotechnology product. We have investigated a possible method that is under serious research in the science community: gene therapy. In this article, we will introduce the approach in more detail; examine the bio-safety and bio-ethical issues; and lastly inspect if our project could be applied using this method.

Our first result, shown in Figure 3, is the confirmation of non-orthogonal behavior as deduced by a higher expression of GFP in comparison to RFP in cotransformed XL1-Blue cultures. There is four to five times more expression of GFP in comparison to RFP (Fig 3D).  These results are similar to those we previously obtained by fluorimetry (with younger cultures, 5 h), in which an imbalanced GFP:RFP rate of about 2:1 was detected.             It has to be stressed that, unexpectedly, only a fraction (around 10%) of the cells exhibited activity of both reporter proteins, indicating that the fluorescence of a culture as it is usually measured (fluorimetry) represents in fact and average of a very diverse pool of individual outputs, including mono-active cells.              We plan to repeat the assay using the reverse conditions: GFP in a Kan resistant plasmid, and RFP in an Amp resistant plasmid.
Figure 3. Dot plots of XL1-Blue reveal a non-orthogonal behavior. Dot plots obtained by flow cytometry. A, B, C & D correspond to wild type, GFP transformant, RFP transformant and cotransformed cells, respectively.  FITC-A, or X axis, indicates green fluorescence (505 nm), whereas PE-A, or Y axis, indicates red fluorescence (592 nm).
Orthogonality changes in time
Figure 4 shows a clear correlation of fluorescense and time in mono-transformants.  Fluorescence is very low for all samples at 5h (approximately 30% of cells transformed with Bb1 express GFP but only 1% of cells transformed with Bb2 express RFP); moderate at 10h for GFP mono-transformants (41% and 1.5% respectively); and maximum after 20h, when GFP is expressed by 80% of the cells, and RFP is expressed by approximately 45% of the cells. Regarding co-transformants, fluorescence also increased with time but even after 20h only a fraction (10%) of doubly fluorescent cells were detected.
Figure 4. XL1-Blue dot plots indicating an increase of fluorescent protein expression with time. Samples of the four variations (wild type, GFP transformants, RFP transformants, and cotransformed cells) are taken at 5, 10 and 20 hours.  FITC-A, or X axis, represents green fluorescence (505 nm).  PE-A, or Y axis, represents red fluorescence ("

Validation
Experiment:
05/10/16 Grown cultures of E. coli Top10 with the key sequence in BBa_K823023 were used for making the (see Mini prep protocol) . Firstly, concentration of the plasmids obtained was measured on Nanodrop. Secondly, plasmids were sent for sequencing and then stored at -20°C.

Message sequence in pDR111
The message sequence was ordered as a gBlock from IDT to construct the message B.   subtilis strain. In a first approach this was done with the pDR111 B.   subtilis integration plasmid, which can also be amplified by E. coli.   Therefore the first step was to clone the message sequence into the pDR111 in E. coli. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be integrated into the B. subtilis genome.   By double cross-over it replaces amyE gene, which is necessary for production of alpha-amylase   (see Subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de )       with desired insert which is located between amyE front flanking region and amyE back flanking region. See the plasmid map below. We used this plasmid for integration of our message sequence into the B. subtilis 168 sub+. The other approach made use of the BioBrick integration plasmid BBa_K823023 (Message sequence in BBa_K823023) .

1.Optical part
Introduction
On the one hand, our chip is the carrier of biological reactions, on the other hand, the chip is also our optical detection platform.The object we are going to detect is GFP and RFP.
The detection principle is using a certain wavelength of light through the chip to stimulate the GFP and RFP in the chamber and detecting the light intensity emitted by GFP and RFP.In this way,we can characterize the amount of fluorescent protein produced by engineering bacteria.Thus the relationship between the reaction of engineering bacteria and the light intensity was established.
So the upper part of the chip will not only through the instrument from the excitation light, but also through the emission light from the engineering bacteria. If the chip has a poor transmittance, both the excitation light and light will be seriously attenuated.Thus it will affect the detection accuracy.
 
Experiments
We used NOA81 as the material of our chip. In order to characterize the light transmittance of this material, we used fluorescent microglobulin as the source of fluorescence and observed the fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy to characterize the chip transmittance.

Human Practices
To improve the feasibility of our project and stimulate public interests in our work, we did the following human practices. First, we held meetings with experts in cancer-therapy research to get academic advices on our project. After finishing a sketch of our project plan, we made surveys among faculties in cancer research and attend a cancer summit in Changchun to get suggestions and comment about the feasibility and safety of our plan.  Next, we discussed with some professors in law to understand better the potential biosafety issues of our project. All these work helped us make great improvement of our project. To help people understand more about cancer therapies and our project, we attended a HUST-Cheering meeting, did a TED presentation and were interviewed by some local TV programs, including the Jilin University Television. Furthermore, we made online games, established a public Wechat platform and a twitter account to get feedback from the general public on the internet. To stimulate the interests in science among high school students, we gave a seminar on synthetic biology and our project in a local high school.

Professor Xu, got a bachelor's and master's degree from Jilin University in 1982 and 1985 respectively, and received a doctor's degree from the department of Computer Science at the university of Colorado in 1991. Now he is in the board of University of Georgia and a famous scholar in science and technology, the director of the center for systems biology research at the University of Georgia. In 2009 he was awarded as a ""Changjiang Scholar"", the chair professor at Jilin University. In 2012, he was recruited as a Jilin university professor in ""one thousand plan"". Professor Xu is a world-class expert in computational biologist, bioinformatics, cancer research and so on.

Global computational studies can be used to evaluate immense numbers of possible input and output combinations.  One new method of weighting can be added by assigning price values.  This could be used to determine what the most economically valuable metabolic transformation is.  Another improvement is picking the right host organism, which contains the highest fraction of the enzymes needed to conduct a transformation.  Enzymes from other organisms can also be added to the initial host organism in order to add the desired functionality (considering from which sources the enzyme engineering challenge in the host is likely to be minimized).
Moreover, some other helpful features that can be added are assigning price values to all compounds and genes used, and then provide a feature that enables users to calculate the total expenses for ordering the compounds needed for a pathway, and also to order biobricks to carry out the pathway reactions in lab.
These are some of the additional features that could be added to enhance the project.  Other ideas that will also be considered are; adding a tutorial that shows users how to create a biobrick if it does not already exist, and a way to favor reactions and pathways that have been genetically altered over time to create a specific product.  Another tool that could be added is a flux balance analysis, to balance all the inputs and the outputs of the reaction.  Thus, there are several options that are being looked into, for next summer’s team to work on, in order to enhance the current project.

Blood Experiment Considerations
Aside from safety considerations, there are also other aspects to look at when working with blood. For example, we had to add the anticoagulant heparin to the blood we obtained from a local butcher shop, The Mad Butcher. This was done in order to prevent the natural coagulation process from occurring as much as possible before we could work with the blood in the lab. This is another factor to consider when looking at the results from our experiments. Depending on when we could get the blood or if there was any issues in transporting it, there may have already been a substantial amount of natural clotting that had taken place. Another factor to consider when working with blood is what source you are getting the blood from. It is important to ask if the supplier puts anything into the blood before you receive it. We were ensured by our suppliers that there were no additives that we were not aware of.

Ethics
1. Sepsis and the ethics behind this as this potentially could relate directly to the consequences of using our product on a human: (Acacia) There are already some possible ethical concerns around the use of snake venom as a clotting agent. Though the topical application of venom has benefits, there is a chance for sepsis to occur, especially if it’s being applied to an open wound. We know the consequences of snake venom being injected directly into the bloodstream. These would be the same consequences if sepsis through a wound were to occur. The idea around this project is fascinating, but in this aspect, it would be negligent and unethical not to recognize the possible dangers that accompany the chances of natural occurrences such as sepsis.  The specifics of intended procedures will have to be further elaborated beyond the intent that is listed above.

Module 3: Genome Deletion Overview
Restriction Enzymes
Restriction enzymes will cleave DNA at particular recognition sites. This leads to multiple double-stranded breakages in DNA, which are unlikely to be repaired in time and will subsequently result in cell death.  Restriction enzymes are therefore highly toxic to the cell, where even minute amounts can induce destruction of the genome.
In our system, we have made use of these properties of restriction enzymes.  The restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI are produced. These serve to effectively remove the genetic material from our E.ncapsulator.
DpnII and TaqI are 4 base cutters, specifically targetting and cutting the sequences GATC and TCGA respectively.
4 base cutters were chosen as they have a higher frequency of cleavage.  Assuming equal distribution of nucleotides, each nucleotide has an equal probabiliy of occurring at any site.
The probability of cleavage for a 4-base long sequence is :
1/4 x 1/4 x 1/4 x 1/4 = (1/4)4
This means that on average the four cutter will cut every 256 base pairs.  Given that the genome of E.coli is around 4 million base pairs, it will become totally digested.
This ensures that the genetic material contained within the cell will all be destroyed, including any inserted DNA.
Having 2 different restriction enzymes is part of a failsafe engineering design.  These restriction enzymes have similar recognition sequences, allowing for an overlap in cleavage capabilities.  When both restriction enzymes are expressed, there is comprehensive cutting, but when one enzyme becomes mutated and dysfunctional, the other restriction enzyme still works well by itself. Therefore, by using two restriction enzymes, we can be more certain that our DNA has been digested.
A distinct advantage of using restriction enzymes for our 'killing' mechanism is that the the genetic material is removed, but the cell membrane is left intact.  Therefore, the protein of interest will still be protected by the encapsulated cell.  This renders the bacterium no more than an inanimate shell loaded with our protein drug of interest.

Achievements
We have:
Developed a brand new instrument: LCC (Liquid Culture Calorimeter) for real-time, high precision measurement of the internal temperature of a thermically isolated liquid culture. This instrument is a new technical standard that supports the characterization of other temperature-related BioBricks Parts or Devices.
Demonstrated, for the first time, that UCP-1 (termogenin) is, as expected, able to produce a significant increase in temperature in recombinant UCP-expressing yeasts.
Characterized four new biobricks (a UCP-expressing yeast, a control strain and two mutant strains with enhanced uncoupling activity) through temperature measurements with the LCC, as well as from relative growth data of the yeast cultures.
Outlined a new approach to Human Practices in Synthetic Biology by writing a Proposal for a Code , that includes a novel concept: concentric ethical units, that might be very useful not only for the Hot Yeast Project but also for any Synthetic Biology research.
Developed an effective model to characterize the kinetic behavior of thermogenin. This model describes UCP1 functionality in terms of heat production. In future, the obtained values for the parameters can be used by other groups which intend to incorporate this part in their constructions.
Provided help to the community as much as our knowledge permitted. Bearing in mind that this was our third participation on the iGEM competition, we felt that it was our responsibility to help other teams as much as we could. At beginning of September, we mailed the team of Bologna , EPF-Lausanne and Paris regarding a fluorescent phenomenon known as FRET that could give problems in experimental results interpretation. We knew of that phenomenon from our project in iGEM 2007 , and since then are very cautious in designing systems that have two fluorescent proteins on the same cell.
      
Further work:
Regulation of the thermogenin-associated thermal increase could be performed using heat and/or cold shock protein promoters. These promoters, controlling genes responsible of activation or inhibition of thermogenin or another protein involved in the proton gradient might be used to mantain the temperature of the cultures within a given range.

Human Practices (Gold & Integrated)
Aims and Rationale
Sensynova was a project founded in Human Practices. Each branch of our project is rooted in a barrier to biosensor implementation identified by in-depth conversations with stakeholders. We identified not only technical issues, but also societal issues, as these are equally important in ensuring successful implementation of biosensor projects. The aims of our human practices were to: 1 - Determine how current biosensor developers design, produce and implement biosensor projects 2 - Use these talks to determine the common barriers to biosensor development and implementation 3 - Create novel solutions to identified problems, producing frameworks and guidelines to aid future researchers To achieve these aims, we emailed, skyped and attended conferences to speak to stakeholders in biosensor development, from the early research stage to the end-user.
Introduction
Synthetic Biology biosensors have a number of advantages over traditional methods. They are cost-effective (after the research stages, production of the biosensor relies only on the maintenance of a population of cells expressing an engineered system); can produce a variety of sophisticated behaviours, such as signal amplification and logic gates; and often have no reliance on additional equipment and therefore are ideal for onsite diagnosis. Each year a plethora of useful biosensors are developed, both by iGEM researchers and in the broader synthetic biology community. We now have access to biosensors for applications ranging from water contamination to fruit ripeness. In fact, we had originally decided on the development of a biosensor for herbicides as our iGEM project. However, our research for this project unearthed an"

TEAM: Together Everyone Achieves More.
Yale University and University of La Verne
As iGEM grows, the interest in non-model organisms (organisms other than ""E. coli"") has started to increase. Since our team decided to work with ""Lactococcus lactis"" this year, we were one of a few teams that were working with a non-model organism. Because of this, Yale and ULV reached out to us to find out about our experiences with this particular organism, as they wanted to create a handbook for other teams interested in these organisms. In conjunction with Yale, University of La Verne, Concordia University, Cornell University, Northeastern University, and University of British Columbia, a guidebook has been created (courtesy of the Yale and ULV teams) that contains a set of considerations for those teams that are interested in working with non-model organisms. As a team, we felt that it was really important for other teams to have this resource, thus this collaboration should be very beneficial for the iGEM community. Check out the guidebook here!
Stanford-Brown
Members of our team were asked for advice from the 2015 Stanford-Brown iGEM team because of our reputation working with bioplastics, specifically polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Fortunately, we were able to arrange an in-person meeting with their team over the summer. We provided help by answering questions regarding the feasibility of their project, troubleshooting issues with low yields of bioplastic, as well as proposing routes to take in order to achieve their goals. The Stanford-Brown students were very receptive and went one step further by inquiring about our project, bringing up key points that allowed us to see an outside perspective on how our project would be received. This meeting proved to be mutually beneficial and we look forward to seeing how their project has progressed at the Jamboree!

Getting to know the Paris Bettencourt team
On the weekend that English ferry ports ground to a halt, and travellers faced 14-hour delays, members of the iGEM Cambridge-JIC team defied these odds to reach Paris in the name of science. Rather, in the name of NightScience, an annual conference hosted by the CRI (Center de Recherches Interdisciplinaires) at the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industries which brought together synthetic biologists and innovative thinkers from around the world for two days of fascinating talks and workshops.
The event follows the philosophy of Night Science from the French biologist François Jacob, winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his joint discovery of transcriptional regulation of enzyme level expression by the lac operon in E.coli. He proposed the concept of Night Science in his 1988  memoir “The Statue Within”, writing:
“Science has in fact two aspects. Day science involves reasoning as articulated as gears, results that have the strength of certainty…
Night Science, on the contrary, wanders in the dark. It hesitates, stumbles, falls. Questioning everything... Nothing guarantees its successes, its ability to survive the tests of logic and experiments, but sometimes thanks to intuition, instinct and the will to discover, as a lightning it illuminates more than a thousand suns…”.
Given the opportunity to present our project at the conference along with this year’s Paris Bettencourt iGEM team, the resonance of this idea with the iGEM philosophy and experimental process was clear (though we can only hope our project “illuminates” the plant science community with the light of at least a few suns). It also applied to the projects of many participants we met during the conference from interdisciplinary labs, such as the CRI and the Waag Society in Amsterdam, and the Bio Makespace community.

Undergraduate
Hi! I’m Kristi and I am a fifth year student at the University of Lethbridge. I am currently in my last year of my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry. This is my first year as a advisor for the High school team and my second with iGEM. I love working in the lab and passing on experimental and theoretical knowledge. I hope to continue on with a masters in the upcoming year. A random fact about me is that my favorite scientific discovery to date is CRISPR-Cas9.
Dr. Laura Keffer-Wilkes

Hello! I am super pumped to be a part of the Lethbridge High School team this year. I am the Primary Investigator and it has been amazing working with all these awesome young people. I studied RNA modification enzymes in graduate school and love STEM outreach. This year’s iGEM team has continuously impressed me with their dedication, knowledge and creativity. I especially loved the music recital they organized. I hope you enjoyed learning about our project!
Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden
Secondary PI
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

In prioritizing our work for the next two weeks, we decided to focus on three main experiments:
Preparing the oligo pool from the chip using Sri's protocol (using qPCR to amplify the pools equally)
Continuing the experiment of picking out a positive hit amongst negative signal
Biobricking our expression plasmids
Eventually, the first two experiments will come together in terms of actually using the chip and figuring out how to pull out and select the positive binders.
On average we expect about three students working at a time, so we'll have these three experiments running in parallel by each student.  So this means our previous teams will have to be dissolved, also since TolC will no longer be used :'(.
Each experiment in more detail:
We need to work out the protocol with Sri in order to prepare the oligo pools for ligation into our target plasmid backbones.  This will involve running a qPCR to monitor the amount of amplification so that the oligos in each pool will be amplified in equal amounts (so that we get a representative pool of oligos that is not biased to one side or the other).  We will need to do this with each subpool.  Futhermore, we will have to confirm that the primers that Sri provided are indeed specific enough to pull out their target subpools only and not other subpools.  This is important for the tweaking of our selection system, since we will need to know whether our selection system needs to be specific enough to pick out signal from 1:10,000 or 1:100,000.
We will need to assemble a control practice library from the 18 practice plate oligos.  We will basically formulate a"

Under natural conditions, protein folding is facilitated by chaperone proteins. This ability of molecular chaperones has also been taken advantage of for research purposes, for example in the case of the protein Cryj2 which gained stability if coexpressed with certain sets of chaperones [5]. Therefore, we decided to use the TaKaRa Clontech Chaperone Plasmid Set and coexpress the contained chaperones with the MMO subunits. This kit has previously been used in combination with the E. coli strains JM109 and BL21(DE3) for the expression of a different monooxygenase [6].
Expression of the chaperone plasmids (designated C1-C5, Table 2) in these two strains was tested via SDS-PAGE (Figure 4).

Expression of chaperones in E. coli JM109 resulted in more distinct bands corresponding to the expected molecular weights in comparison to strain BL21(DE3) (figure 4, cf. table 2). However, in some cases the expression levels differed substantially even if the same chaperone protein was encoded on the plasmid. In the case of plasmid C2 in E. coli JM109 the two expected bands at about 10 and 60 kDa were clearly visible, but in the case of C3 the band at 60 kDa was much less distinct.
We continued working with both strains and cotransformed them with the different chaperone plasmids and the different subunits (except MMOC which had already been expressed without the aid of chaperones, see figure 3). With E. coli BL21(DE3) no cell growth occurred which might be"

We begin settling in and setting ourselves up in the lab. The adventure starts now! Plenty of paperwork to do and people to check in with before beginning. Safety comes first, and with it safety courses to teach us what to watch out for when working in the synthetic biology lab.
Tuesday
We spend some time discovering the equipment at our disposal, how it works and what it can and can't do. We have access to a microplate reader (absorbance and fluorescence), a spectrophotometer (absorbance), an inverted fluorescence microscope, a PCR machine an, multiple centrifuges and electrophoresis machines, and plenty of pipetmans, plastic disposables and gloves. I'm sure there's a couple of things I've forgotten on the list, but at least we know we have what's necessary to start on great footing.
We have transformed fresh cells with a GFP gene controlled by a PBad promoter using the TSS method
Wednesday
Experimental work begins in earnest!
We have a GFP gene controlled by a PBad promoter, and we want to test this promoter to see if it will be useful in our later experiments with KillerRed, one of the key proteins in our project. We can use the GFP Tristar microplate reader. Production is induced with arabinose, a kind of sugar.

The panel was a great success. Based on many positive feedbacks, we felt that a lot of people were inspired by the field and by our project. We were happy to share our thoughts with a multi-background diverse audience and professional speakers.
Spreading the Word of Synthetic Biology in Ben-Gurion University
Although the iGEM competition exists since 2003, last year was the first time Ben-Gurion University has sent a team to participate, which eventually was the first team from Israel to ever reach the World Championships at MIT. We, the iGEM BGU 2014 team, are setting a goal to continue the great work of the 2013 team in promoting the iGEM competition among university leaders. Our vision is to create an iGEM tradition in Ben Gurion University, establishing a foundation for teams to compete every year and help implementing this important field of synthetic. Therefore, we have met with Ben-Gurion University president Prof. Rivka Carmi, presented our 2014 iGEM project and discussed the importance of iGEM for both the university and the students. We were thrilled as the president was deeply interested and provided us with a significant support.
For the same cause we met with the university Rector, Prof. Zvi Hacohen; Dean of students, Prof. Moshe Kaspi; Dean of Natural Sciences Faculty, Prof. Jiwchar Ganor; Dean of Engineering Sciences Faculty, Prof. Joseph Kost and Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, Prof. David Newman. We also met with the Spokesman of the university Mr Amir Rozenblit, and the Director of Donor and Associate Affairs Mrs. Jill Ben Dor, they all were very impressed and supportive.

Washington,2009,Team:Washington#Project#Display_-_-_TEXT.html,"avidin-biotin binding we incubated the biotinylated fluorophore with streptavidin-coated beads that were roughly the same size (with respect to volume) as our cells (except spherical) (see Notebook page for protocols).
Data
Positive Control
Negative Control
These images were analyzed using imageJ10. The image on the left shows an image of the beads with fluorophore added to them. These beads were diluted and spun diluted and spun down until the background level of fluorescence was low enough to get an accurate reading. We then used imageJ to analyze the intensity of a line going through the bead, which is demonstrated by the above schematic. On the positive control the edges of the streptavidin-coated beads show spikes in fluorescence, indicating binding of the biotinylated fluorophore to the beads. The negative control (beads without fluorophore) showed no such increase. This meant that our biotinylated fluorophore binds to streptavidin in a detectable manner.  When our cells were examined in the same manner, no difference could be seen in biotinylated fluorophore binding between cells that had induced expression of surface streptavidin (left) and uninduced cells which should not express the surface display protein (right).  This was evidence that the streptavidin surface display part binding to biotin was very low / nonexistent.  In order to verify this, we measured the binding of the biotinylated fluorophore to entire populations of streptavidin-expressing cells by flow cytometry.
Induced Cells
Uninduced Cells
Streptavidin-Biotin Binding Is Not Visualized By Flow Cytometry
The goal of this experiment was to visualize biotin binding to streptavidin over a whole population of cells.  Whereas the Microscope experiment looked at a few localized cells, we set the cytometer to look 50,000 streptavidin-expressing cells after incubation (and washing) with the biotinylated fluorophore and read the resulting fluorescence ( see Notebook page for protocols ). Like in the microscopy assay, we used streptavidin-coated beads as a positive control. The cytometer reads the fluorescence of each individual particle (cell or bead) passing through it, which allows for accurate readings, and monitoring of a much larger sample size than we visualized under the microscope. The results of this experiment are described below.

NCTU_Formosa: Disease Occurrence Model
Prediction Modeling
     In order to cure the fungal diseases in reality, we used the method called Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to catch the weather patterns that was hard to be recognized by humans. With this disease occurrence model, we can get the daily possibility of disease occurrences. Also, we set up a warning and auto-spraying system by combining the model with the IoTtalk to apply peptides into farmlands.

Protein A binds with moderate affinity to human IgM, IgA and IgE as well as to mouse IgG3 and IgG1.[1] It does not react with human IgG3 or IgD, nor will it react to mouse IgM, IgA or IgE.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_A
Johan: See if the antibody in excess in vitiligo hopefully is IgG1/IgG2
Nina: The other antibodies are not in any excess so we do not need to put much research on them, instead learn more about IgG.
“... possesses several properties which makes it suitable as a partner in fusion proteins: (a) SpA enables purification of the fusion protein by affinity chromatography due to its specific binding to the Fc part of immunoglobulins, (b) it is competent for secretion in E. coli, (c) it is monomeric and relatively small, (d) it has been reported to be extremely soluble in water solutions (Samuels- son et al., 1991), (e) it is proteolytically very stable intracellularly (Nilsson et al., 1985a) and in the periplasm of E. coli (Nilsson and Abrahms6n, 1990). Fusions to the IgG-binding domains of SpA have successfully been applied for high-level production of peptide hormones (Abrahms6n et al., 1986; Moks et al., 1987a, b; Nilsson et al., 1991, 1985b) and as a tool for the production of specific antibodies against gene products (L6wenadler et al., 1987, 1986).” - Fusions to the 5' end of a gene encoding a two-domain analogue of staphylococcal protein A, pp 270-271
Nina: This information is very good and gives a lot of hope on this protein.
Johan: There are shortened versions of protein A. These might have some advantages. E.g. they dont have the domain that normally binds to the cell membrane, instead they are secreted extracellularly.
Nina: Also it is very good that it is has become very small. :D

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#Inclusivity_-_-_TEXT.html," the American National Academy of Science has shown that diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams on problem-solving tasks. [1]The creation of homogeneous teams is thus an obstacle to success, but few people set out to create teams that are intentionally non-diverse. A phenomenon called “homosocial reproduction” leads individuals to judge people more similar to themselves more favourably. [2] Homosocial reproduction can lead the people in charge of recruiting and evaluating applicants to unintentionally build a team that looks a lot like themselves. In the 2018 paper “Stemming Implicit Bias in High-Tech STEM,” Lisa Fisher provides self-evaluation for STEM companies that can be modified for use by iGEM teams to evaluate their team-building process:
- How is “fit” bias present in our applicant screening processes? Who is conducting interviews? - How can we better train interviewers to reduce bias in the process?  - How can we design interview questions to reduce bias in the process?  Having a panel of multiple people rather than one individual evaluate applications also helps to lessen the biasing effect of homosocial reproduction. The more diverse the application panel is, the less likely it is that a homogenous team will be created.
Encourage more diverse groups to apply
One way to make your team more diverse and inclusive is by getting people from all walks of life to apply. Try to target communities that might not typically apply to iGEM, may not have access to iGEM, or may not feel that iGEM is the space for them. This means actively asking people to apply that aren't the standard under status quo.
Your team can do this is by giving recruitment presentations, or partnering with groups that are focused on diversity. Some strategies you could use are recruiting from courses outside of STEM, getting in contact with sororities, talking to LGBTQ+ groups on campus, or speaking with groups of people of colour to get them to talk about and promote iGEM. This means that you will just have more people of different backgrounds applying, and will inevitably have a more diverse group of people chosen for your team.
An equity team
An equity team is a great way to create a more inclusive space. Equity teams are usually composed of individuals that have made a commitment to remain impartial and maintain confidentiality. This is group that members of the iGEM team could bring complaints to about things like sexism, racism, sexual predation, or just general concern caused my iGEM or something outside of it. Often groups make their own equity policy and establish an equity team based on what best suits them. Here are some resources"

Although S2 is not as good as the other three, it still shows higher resistance to cadmium ions than the control groups do. Wild-type yeast strains BY4741 and BY4743 can barely grow on this growth media, while synX cannot grow, which means that synX is unable to survive such high concentration of cadmium ions. The results clearly demonstrate that these mutated yeast strains have an improved phenotype-increased resistance to cadmium ions.
Another assay was conducted on SC solid media containing 4.8 mM copper ions. Results are shown in the picture below.
Fig.3-3 Experimental groups: S5, S6, S7, and S8; control groups: synX, BY4741, and BY4743. Yeast cells were picked up from single colonies on solid growth media and diluted by 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 times.
The experimental groups also have a survival advantage over control groups. From this picture, S5, S6, and S8 are able to develop a large single colony after diluted to 100000 times on SC solid media containing 4.8 mM copper ions. S7 is not as tough as the other three experimental groups, but it still shows higher resistance to copper ions compared with BY4741 when diluted to 100 times. BY4743 can hardly grow on this media, while synX cannot grow, which means that synX is unable to tolerate such high concentration of copper ions. The results clearly showcase that the mutated yeast strains have an improved phenotype-increased resistance to copper ions.
Survival Rate Experiments
This experiment aims to quantify mutated yeast strains’ ability to survive in copper or cadmium ions solution. Same amount of yeast cells are added to the copper or cadmium ions solution at the beginning; after that, a certain amount of this solution is taken out at regular intervals, namely 10min, 30min, 1h, and 2h, then diluted and plated on YPD solid media. After yeast colonies emerge from the growth media, the number of the colonies are counted and recorded to calculate the survival rate of this strain in this solution.
We choose the seemingly best strain, S1, as the experimental strain to test its ability to survive high concentration of cadmium compared with the control strain, synX. Results are shown in the pictures and tables below.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#drugdel_-_-_TEXT.html,", but to smaller areas within the gut, resulting in far lower collateral damage to symbiotic bacteria.  The bacterial ability to move to the site of drug delivery may result in a more effective drug absorbance by the area in need, and less damage to the rest of the body, resulting in a more effective treatment.
E. coli may seem like somewhat of an unimpressive example, as pills release their drug into the same area as E. coli’s colonization specificity: the gut.  But other bacteria with different niche specificity could open up entirely new areas of drug absorption. Haemophilus influenzae, whose genome was sequenced in 1995, has adapted niche specificity for the upper respiratory tract (Levine, 1996).  Another bacteria of interest, Staphylococcus aureus, is known to colonize mucous membranes (VDH, 2011).  Both of these bacteria offer different biospecificities than may be utilized by individual drugs treating different areas of the body, but any non-pathogenic bacteria with a strong affinity for an internal area could be utilized.  Site-specific drug delivery in previously inaccessible locations within the body may even lead to changes in molecular drug design.  This new accessibility may lead to drugs being further detailed to match their exact site of release, rather than simple absorption through the stomach, with serious potential for increased drug effectiveness.
It is also important to mention that the AMPs providing the functionality of our kill switch could themselves be the “drug” that must be delivered.  If the drug needed were for attacking other invasive prokaryotic bacteria in the body, redesigning the promoter and ribosome-binding site of our kill switch would lead to a higher PoPS output, resulting in faster AMP production.  In theory, if enough AMPs could be produced before complete membrane disruption, intracellular non-membrane bound AMPs (and, perhaps, membrane-bound AMPs as well) would also be exported from the cell upon pore formation.  Using peptides instead of antibiotics to fight other bacterial infections reduces the odds of creating antibiotic resistance.  AMPs attack the membrane, the structure of which is highly conserved within evolution; the number of mutations required in a single replication to completely re-structure the bacterial membrane makes the odds of developing AMP resistance near impossible.  Not only that, but the AMPs would not attack host eukaryotic cells due to the structure of their membrane (as described in our Kill Switch page), instead binding to only prokaryotic cell membranes, nullifying any potential negative interaction between the drug and the host (Hancock and Sahl"
Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#Game Discovery_-_-_TEXT.html," enemies. Only in this way can warriors fight againstenemies efficiently.
    During World War II, France was badly attacked by Germany. French placed its main military force on the east, but Germans attacked from the North. From this famous event, we can see how important strategies are.
     (2) In this case, side A owns 5 farmers and 5 warriors, while side B owns 8 farmers. B loses the war because of insufficient warriors.In the following movie, if one sides increase the ratio of warriors, he can easily win.
Discovery
The strength of military force is important
    The number of warriors is obviously important .It can be seen that the winning of a war relies a lot on the number of our our warriors. Even though the farmers from A side is fewer, the warriors from side A can help “robbing” the nutrients from side B.
    In human society, remember the military force is always the first place a ruler should consider. The Song Dynasty of China was a comparatively wealthy country. However, because the military force of the Song Dynasty was relatively weak, it was turned over by nomads whose military force was stronger. Although the nomads were not wealthy or even had not enough food to eat, they could get all of these from the Song Dynasty.
    Anyway, military force should always be put in the first place.
III Establish Lots of Bases
    In this case, both sides own the same amount of bacteria, but side A has two bases while side B has only one. The following movie shows that side A wins because of one more bacteria base.
Discovery
Don’t put all the eggs in one basket
    In this case, it is smarter to establish distributed bases rather than concentrated bases. More bases are needed as they can bring more space for the growth of bacteria.
    Many people feel that the best strategy is to concentrate the military force and rout the enemy forces one by one. However, this is not always the case. Contrary to our intuition, sometimes it works better if we scatter the military forces wisely. Chairman Mao, the founding father of China, knows this very well and used it a lot in many guerilla warfares.
IV  Plant Undercover
    In this case, both sides own the same amount of bacteria. But side A sets some warriors and farmers as “undercover agents” around B’s bacteria. The following movie shows this process. A’s “undercover agents” quickly surround and eliminate B’s bacteria.
Discovery
The easiest way to capture a fortress is from within

Q: Before the end of today’s interview, I want to ask a not-so-academic question. If you are asked to summarize biologist using one word/phrase, which one will you choose?
Dr.H: I think it is persistence.
Dr.F: Actually, for all of the scientists “curious” is definitely a vital disposition. Unlike commercializing professional techniques, doing scientific research should start off from the origin of hunger and curiosity instead of materialism.
Introductory Guide for new iGEMers
At the beginning of our iGEM journey, we found our that there isn’t such a suitable introductory guide book or series of courses designed for new, high school iGEMers. Being inspired by this, we decided to write a “dummies guide”, compiling useful information from textbooks, lab manuals and previous iGEM experiences, for the fledgelings biologists.
The brochure is separated into several sections:
General introduction to synthetic biology and iGEM competition
Basic knowledge about genes
Central dogma
Introduction to important synthetic biology experiments
Thanks to the artists in our team, we have accompanied each different knowledge point with adorable illustrations to help understanding. Considering our limited preparation time and the urgent need for such a guide in China, unfortunately, we wrote this guide in Chinese only. However, we are ready to compose another one next year with more details and deeper knowledge, in both English and Chinese to make it more internationally influential and useful. With the help of this introductory brochure, we are aiming to make these knowledge of synthetic biology easily accessible for fledgling iGEMers from all over China, or even the world, so that more people will get to know about this amazing realm of synthetic biology.

Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year on iGEM and I have been working with TALEs, which involved alternative cloning strategies and lots of fun time doing protein work over the Summer. When I am not pippeting in the lab to the sound of Backstreet Boys, I spend my time working out, exploring Canada and catching up with family and friends who are all the way back in Brazil. Even though I still have a couple months here in Calgary, I can't wait to come back as a graduate student!
Julie Osgood
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM and I have spent my summer focusing on the TALE aspect of our project. I devoted my time to designing the E. coli target sequences and putting together our TALE constructs. When I’m not redoing all my experiments that didn’t work, I enjoy dancing, reading, and watching Battestar Galactica. I have spent my past couple summers working in research labs, but I loved having the opportunity to join a student driven research team. In the future I hope to be a professional Quidditch player or a geneticist.
Ali Honarmand
Biological Sciences (4th Year)
This is my 2nd year of iGEM and I am leading the TALEs part of the project. That is how I got nicknamed ""TALI."". I really like how iGEM is completely student driven and how it is not just about the science. It has really broadened my perspectives about all the different components that need to go into a project to make it successful and useful to the society. When I'm not in the lab serving dinner to E. coli or sitting in front of my computer staring at ATCGs, you can find me appreciating the gravity in the mountains either on my bike or snowboard, reading a book, or trying something completely random.

Step 7.  Public education
A significant number of infections can be prevented if the local population knows how to recognize symptoms of a certain disease and what to look out for. Mosquito-borne illnesses, with emphasis on Zika, dengue and chikungunya, are generally known by the locals, yet barely any of them was able to correctly assign symptoms to the respective disease [1]. For example, dengue hospitalizes about 500,000 people a year of which 12,500 die as a consequence [2]. This lack of insight should be addressed as soon as possible.
How to increase awareness
Educational activities related to the relevant pathogens in the area should start as early as school begins for children. Both public health authorities and schools should join efforts to provide a basic and coherent model of how the disease in question affects the individual, how it spreads and what people can do to reduce their risk of getting infected. This includes, for example, wearing long-sleeved clothing at night, using anti-insect sprays and removing still water as much as possible. This should decrease the transmission rate and spread of the pathogen. The potential roles and responsibilities of school administrators will provide school districts with information for planning school-related activities for public health actions, pertaining to viral or parasitic infections. In turn, the provided information to children can be brought home by instructing the pupils to talk about the issue with their parents, which has had moderate, but effective results [1]. Child care, camp and higher educational institutions are also considered for applying this model in the future.
In conclusion, the guidance we made will give an overview of the potential responsibilities and roles of both schools and public health authorities regarding prevention measures that schools could implement in order to raise awareness of infectious diseases. Zika virus is used as a placeholder here. To reach the community, infographic tools could be implemented and used as a tool to inform students about current (Zika) concerns (Figure 1).

Stelios' main contribution in the project was the production and maintenance of the team's web profile, excluding social media management. He designed the website that was deployed in the domain of the School of Chemical Engineering, NTUA, and subsequently, took on the creation of this Wiki page. On the side, Stelios dealt extensively with Image Editing, as well as occasionally helping in Dry Lab by troubleshooting with Linux-based tools that we initially used. Lastly, he embarked on some Android Development following our plans for accompanying our kit with a smartphone application; a concept that eventually didn't come into fruition due to time limitations.
Elena Kostadima
Elena’s contribution included initially participating in the InterLab Study. Later on, she participated in the wet lab experiments at both the National Technical University of Athens (School of Chemical Engineering) and the Hellenic Pasteur Institute, where she provided valuable help in bench work and troubleshooting. She was also responsible for the Social Media management and for the communication with other iGEM Teams for collaborations.

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," (Marcet-Palacios et al., 2014) compared the amino acid sequence between the extracellular mouse inhibitor Serpina3n and human ACT, and identified three amino acids that would transform ACT into a GzmB-binding protein (Figure 2). They found that these mutations successfully retained the extracellular nature of ACT, while allowing it to bind and inhibit GzmB. To follow their protocol and perform the same mutations, we again sent the part out for mutagenesis (Mission Biotech). We confirmed the mutated sequence (sequenced by Tri-I Biotech).
Figure 2. ACT Amino Acid Mutations: Researchers from the paper selected three amino acid (boxed in red) mutations to perform on human ACT in order to mimic the GzmB-binding ability of mouse inhibitor Serpina3n (Ser3n). Figure adapted from (Marcet-Palacios et al., 2014).
Assembly into a BioBrick Backbone
Next, to insert this part in front of a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ), we designed primers to add on the BioBrick prefix (including E and X sites) and suffix (including S and P sites) to either side of ACT3m. The primer designs were sent to Tri-I Biotech for oligo synthesis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was set up.
Motor Protein (YebF)
We wanted our chassis (E. coli) to express and secrete the desired inhibitor so it can be used as part of our topical prototype. For this reason, we inserted YebF in front of ACT3m. YebF is a motor protein that can secrete attached proteins out of the E. coli membrane. Thus, in our final construct, the resulting YebF-ACT3m fusion protein can be separated from the bacterial cells.
Assembly into Final Device
We asked the National Yang Ming University iGEM team (NYMU-Taipei) for a device containing YebF ( BBa_K1510009 ) and received the part promptly. Since YebF was given to us on a composite part device, we also needed to design primers to add restrictive enzyme cutting sites. Following the same method used for ACT, we designed primers, which were synthesized by Tri-I Biotech, and performed PCR. Figure 3 shows YebF successfully inserted into a device behind our promoter (discussed below) and RBS.

Backyard Biology @ Emory University: Project JBroth
Low Cost LB and Competent Cells!
Our interest in our topic began when we were researching possible projects. What we found most interesting was a research paper from the Journal of Pakistan Medical Association that tested the efficacy of microwaving LB rather than autoclaving.  Also, a project that inspired us was the project from the University of  Calgary (2014) that tested the efficacy of a homemade wash for competent cells. From these projects, we asked ourselves: Could one conduct a synthetic biology project without access to a professional laboratory?
This summer, we created a cost effective alternative to lab grade Luria Broth (LB). To compare our homemade broth, J-Broth, and lab grade LB we compared optical densities of liquid cultures and transformation efficiency of competent cells. For each method of testing, we compared autoclaved LB, microwaved LB, and microwaved J-Broth.
Materials/Methods
We grew XL1-Blue E. coli cells in liquid culture of lab grade luria broth and J-broth. The media was either autoclaved or microwaved for 8 minutes at 650 Watts before the cells were added.
We then made competent cells using XL1-Blue e. coli cells that were grown in each type of media following the Inoue method (Inoue, 1990) and calculated the transformation efficiency for comparison.

The core method to treat IBD in our project is utilizing the peptide EGF secreted by our engineered bacteria to repair colons of patients. In order to prove the effect of this potent peptide, we collaborated with another 2016 IGEM team, SYSU-Medicine, who decided to apply MSCs therapy to cure IBD.
During the competition, we sent our purified EGF peptide expressed by our engineered bacteria to them, and they use them mice model of IBD to help us prove its validity.
They referred to the article(Modeling method reference: Chemically induced mouse models of intestinal inflammation Stefan Wirtz, Clemens Neufert, Benno Weigmann & Markus F Neurath  Laboratory of Immunology, I Medical Clinic, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany. Correspondence should be addressed to M.F.N. Published online 15 March 2007; doi:10.1038/nprot.2007.41 ) and designed the following experiment:
1. Select several similar mice and weight them on the second day of fasting.
2. Choose half of them for EGF solution enema as an experiment group, and the rest of them are dealt with normal saline as the control group.
3. Weight each of them at the same time every day.
4. After the fifth day, kill all of them and measure the length of colons.

2. We reconsidered the possible application of our test paper, and eventually decided to change our targeting market from the common    people to the hospitals.
3. We realized that it’s vital to make the HCV more well-known to the public if we really want to promote our test paper. We should    also control the price in order to make it more acceptable for the public.
                
                        
The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital
    We went to The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital for a survey in August 28th. Doctor Xing and Docimaster Li entertained us patiently. We consulted about the control line of the test paper, sample taking and evaluation of the outcome. The doctors drew some charts in order to clarify the explanation.
    Through the discussion, we acquired the following points:
1.General design of the control area;
2.The use of gingival crevicular fluid has not been standardized, and the HCV RNA in gingival crevicular fluid is much less than that of serum.
    Based on these points, we decide to make some changes to our project. We finally decide to use serum as sample, and set different concentration ranges of HCV virus as the parameter of result.

Patent Application
    Despite the fact that thousands of genome is patented over the few decades, the heated debate about gene patenting in legal and ethical fields remains. Concerning about intellectual property matter of our project, our team started consulting about patent acquisition in June. Discussing Mr. Zhao from CSS, we gained knowledge of three types of patent in China and the procedure needed to apply one patent. We planned to begin applying a designing patent for our project as soon as we finish our experimental work. The subsequent figure is a patent certification and a photo of us with Mr.Zhao.

To summarize, if we find a path with improved NADPH yield, we could get more products in other relevant paths.
In the same context, if the NADH yield is increased, the efficiency of the path using the NADH will also be enhanced. In addition, cells grown aerobically may possibly use the extra NADH for ATP generation through the electron transport system. According to the research on the availability of intracellular NADH (Berríos-Rivera SJ., Bennett GN, San KY 2002), the higher NADH availability dramatically increased the ethanol to acetate (Et/Ac) ratio by 27-fold. The cause of this amazing increase is proven by an experiment comparing BS1 (pSBF2), which is inactivated by the native FDH (formate dehydrogenase) that regenerates NADH, with GJT001 (pDHK29), the control, under anaerobic conditions.
For these reasons, our program suggests the paths in the order of the amount of NADPH and NADH production. Users will be able to get efficient and productive paths with the information provided by our program, with less effort.
② ATP
Another scoring factor which the program ‘Gil’ provides is the ATP quantity. This function is expected to be useful for synthetic biologists to design reaction pathway necessary for their experiments which are designed to have higher efficiency when there is increased ATP level. For instance, according to the research that used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to generate ATP from adenosine in the process of glucose breakdown into ethanol and carbon dioxide (Murata K, et al.. 1981), the ATP-generating reaction enhances the biosynthesis of Escherichia coli which synthesizes glutathione and Brevibacterium ammoniagenes which produces NADP. Therefore, substituting the biological reaction with the ones that have higher ATP yield, designed by the program ‘Gil’, will possibly increase the productivity of both organisms. The following KEGG compound number order is the examples of the reaction pathway: C00031 (glucose), C00394, C00035, C00144, C00044, C04895, C00084, C00469 (ethanol).

Oligo Pre-Treatment
We recently received the initiator, terminator, and capping oligos.
We ultimately decided to order doubly biotinylated initiator since it could provide higher yield.
Each oligo was made into 100 uM stock.
According to the ICA Paper (Briggs et al., 2012) we prepared the oligos as follows:
Double stranded oligos were mixed together with 100 uM of each.
Single stranded oligos were diluted to 5 uM each.
All oligos were treated heat treated at 95 C for 1 min, the ramped down to 25 C at 0.1 C/s.
After heat treatment, the oligos are called working oligos.
ICA oligo characterization
We tested each BsaI digested fragment with each capping oligo, and tested the initiator and terminator with AB and CA respectively.
We used 50 ng of each fragment generated yesterday .
Oligos were used as follows (copied from (Briggs et al.):
Initiator and terminator: 1 uL of 50 nM working solution
Caps: 1 uL of 5 uM working solution
0.5 uL of T7 Ligase.

4.1 Background Information
The rapid sequencing kit from ONT consists in two enzymatic steps to prepare DNA to be sequenced. Figure 13 represents the molecular principle behind library preparation of Rapid sequencing from ONT. The first step consists of an enzymatic fragmentation with transposase that integrates sequencing adapters (shown with a red box). These adapter sequences contain a motif that is later ligated to a second sequencing adapter that contains a motor protein (needed to assist DNA to difuse through the nanopore).
Figure 13. Rapid Sequencing from ONT: molecular principle of library preparation (gDNA refers to genomic DNA) (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 2018).
Our approach uses the same fragmentation principle, but instead of a random transposition, we target this event to specific DNA sequences by our fusion protein. We designed adapters to be compatible with ONT fragmentation procedure figure 13, with the addition of the specific Mosaic End (ME) sequence that Tn5 needs to load and later integrate. The sequences of these adapters are depicted in figure 14.
Figure 14. Adapter DNA used for the integration by Tn5 for targeted sequencing with ONT Rapid sequencing.
The 3’ end of the forward strand has an adenine overhang that will anneal to the second sequencing adapters that carry motor protein. We ordered two types of adapters, with the difference of a phosphate group on the 5’ end of the reverse strand.     The two specified adapters were ordered as forward and reverse primers and tested for integration to intronless EPO cDNA, directed by sgRNA 001 .
4.2 sgRNA Array Determination for Gene Doping Sequences
Aim: Generate a computational model that will output sgRNA sequences required by dxCas9 to target gene doping sequences.
Approach: The design of sgRNAs for the detection of gene doping will guide the integration of adapter sequences to only possible gene doping sequences. The sgRNAs are designed to target sequences near the junctions between exons (not present in natural genes). For this, we developed a model that screens through an entire genetic coding sequence (potential gene used for enhancement) and identifies all possible sgRNA molecules at specific exon-exon junctions.
The possibility of modifying the DNA sequence used for gene doping with synonymous mutations is an immediate threat to our detection method. For this reason, this model screens through all the possible synonymous modifications identified close to PAM sequences near exon-exon junctions,"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," G. sulfurreducens as the model organism for our MFC.
It was then decided to work on optimisation of the G. sulfurreducens by increasing the electrical conductivity of its endogenous nanowires. To achieve this, synthesis of the pilA genes from G. metallireducens was ordered, which was used to create a BioBrick. Using the same approach for homologous recombination as in the dormancy system, a DNA fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistance cassette of the pSB1C3 backbone, was made for later selection of recombinant G. sulfurreducens. The PCR product was ligated with fragments retrieved from the 500 bp upstream and downstream regions of the chromosomal pilA genes of the G. sulfurreducens PCA strain, creating the fragment seen in Figure 15.

Project Overview
Determination of Noise Levels in Constitutive Promoter Family Members
Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry revealed that a strong constitutive promoter was suitable for the expression of the photocontrol device.
To assess which of the constitutive promoters would be suitable for a uniform expression of the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , and the antitoxin RelB, BBa_K2449028 , the expression levels and the noise of four different members of the Anderson promoter collection and their RFP reporter systems, were studied by fluorescence microscopy. These were, in increasing promoter strength, BBa_J23114 , BBa_J23110 , BBa_J23106 , and BBa_J23102 .
Additionally, the change in RFP expression levels and noise during growth were tested for the promoters with the highest and lowest relative promoter strength by flow cytometry and qualitative analysis by fluorescence microscopy. Combining these two techniques, the expression and noise levels for the promoters were determined as follows:
The weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , exhibited a relatively low expression of RFP, indicating low gene expression and an increasing high level of noise throughout growth.
Both medium strength promoters, BBa_J23110 and BBa_J23106 , displayed a moderate level of both noise and protein expression of the RFP reporter.
The strong promoter, BBa_J23102 , exhibited a comparatively high expression of the reporter RFP and an"

We will gather  and compare results from around the world and find out if our system diminishes  interlaboratory variations caused by differences in plasmid copy number.
In addition, we have created a survey about synthetic biology, laboratory work,  safety and ethics that is addressed to experienced scientists working on the  synthetic biology field . We would appreciate it if you could forward this  survey to your PIs, instructors and advisors. You can find the survey here: https://goo.gl/forms/xigcfX3wmFpywlMo2

Dear iGEM Team Ecuador,
I’m a member of this year’s iGEM Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec (Germany) and we have a  little favor to ask. We prepared a survey on the topics Dual Use and Dual Use  Research of Concern for which we need your help! We already have many German  respondents and would be very happy to get a more international view - that’s  why we would be pleased if as many of you as possible could participate! If we  can also do something for you, please do not hesitate to contact us
See you in Boston & best wishes!

Dear team Ecuador
Are you interested in contributing to the well being and prosperity for future  iGEM participants? All we need is your attention for 1 minute
We’re the team from Lund University in Sweden. After talking with previous and  current iGEM students we’ve come to the conclusion that iGEM can be a very  stressful and frustrating experience for many.
iGEM is multifaceted and challenges its participants in many ways. For many  individuals, it can become an overwhelming experience which in turn can cause  mental health complications such as stress, anxiety and depression. Others  members, such as the team leaders, might also face problems with managing the  team and ensuring that the project progresses in the right direction.
We strongly believe that this can be changed with the proper tools and  guidance.
As a part of our human practices initiative this year, we will be conducting a  world-wide survey to map out self-fulfillment, motivation, stress, organization  and management, and group dynamics within the iG"

I plan to pursue a science-based career and I hope that it will be, taking into account challenges associated with this type of work, a rewarding path with hopefully relevant consequences.

Contrary to popular belief, studying Arts and Sciences does not mean that I’m drawing human bodies. Focusing mainly on science communication, my role in the team is to primarily put our topic into a wider context of the society. Having just finished my second year, I am keen on putting into practice what I have learned over the past few months. Besides studying, I am an avid reader of anything that was words, but most of the time I emerge myself in sci-fi or fantasy genre, which explains my addiction to manga. I also really enjoy playing sports, having run Floorball Club at UCL throughout the year.

Aging is an inevitable part of life, ask Dorian Gray…. My name is Chinyere Ihuegbu (Chichi). I am finishing up my Masters in Biosciences. I enjoy life sciences, smiles and all things fun. When not in a lab coat, I try to learn the violin. I addition to science, I enjoy working with kids.

I am an MRes Synthetic Biology student, so joining the UCL iGEM team made sense, do not worry, there is not much sense left in my life.  Among my uncountable passions are colourful socks, good spoons and maps.  iGEM is one of them too, as it is the best chance to show, beyond a bunch of proud freaks, what Synthetic Biology is about, and at the same time participate in an ambitious and responsible project. Our amazing project is about aging and wellbeing, or how to stop the first and extend the later. Aging is a fascinating topic for me since my younger years; I used to punch the wall of my bedroom as a kid because I did not tolerate death as an unavoidable thing.  Maybe my approach has changed but not the energy. As a kid and even today I would never give a glance to a map of the world that does not include Utopia.

Full time MRes Synthetic Biology student and entrepreneur. Science and Technology are part of my life passions, alongside arts, films, martial arts, learning languages and travelling (There are too many, I know).

Expression
Performed PCR to the 3α-HSD gBlock with all the new primers but saw no bands in the gel.  Therefore, we decided to try a new direction to stop using our gBlock and try using the gBlock of 3α-HSD with the original (non-optimized) sequence.
We ordered new primers for the gBlock of 3α-HSD with the original sequence.  We planned them based on cloning with restriction enzymes.
Active team members this week: Alexey and Adi
Cofactor
Repeated transformation of the pSB1C3 plasmid containing the zwf gene, this time using newly prepared plates and heat shock instead of electroporation.  The colonies grew! We prepared glycerol stocks of each strain.
Ordered primers containing KpnI and XbaI restriction sites for cloning the zwf gene into the plasmid containing the rhlR operon.
Active team members this week: Yael and Roni
Comb
We designed a new version of the comb, changing the channel structure based on the advice we received during the meeting with Prof. Moran Bercovici.
We also added a handle to the comb for more comfortable use, a larger place for the syringe, and thinner teeth for better brushing.
Active team members this week: Maayan and Sagi
Week 10: July 4-10
Secretion
We cut the pDR111 plasmid we received from Tel Aviv University with restriction enzymes SalI and NheI.  We sent it to sequencing.
Meanwhile, after cleaning from the restriction enzyme reaction, we performed a CIP reaction and cleaned.  We performed a ligation reaction with the cleaned plasmid and pre-cut mCherry and 3α-HSD gBlock.
We did a heat shock transformation into competent E. coli DH5α we got from Prof. Ilana Kolodkin Gal’s laboratory at Weizmann Institute.
We performed a colony PCR for both transformations: we got 3 positive colonies out of 9 for the pDR111 and mCherry reaction, but no positive colonies for the pDR111 and 3α-HSD gBlock reaction (out of 9).        Therefore, we repeated the ligation step, but this time incubated overnight with a self-ligation control. We also made a starter for one of these colonies for glycerol stock and miniprep.
We transformed the pDR111 and mCherry into B.subtilis PY79 according to a protocol we"

Félix Reyes Martín (Biotechnology)
Probably, i'm the laziest member of the team, at least that's what my friends usually say. However, when it comes to working in the lab, i always intent to give the best of myself. This is my second year in UPO sevilla team and although last year I worked really hard on it, I'm feeling even more eager this year. I belong to the V's subteam (a little group inside wet lab workers) and we will try to set up some improvements in the classic toggle switch.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer."

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blogtest_-_-_TEXT.html," AHLs to the cultures we analyzed the raise in sfGFP production using a microtiterplate reader. In a first step we measured the dose response of constructs with different ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) and with or without riboregulator. We could observe differences not only in sensitivity, but also in leakiness; some strains expressed GFP even without AHL induction. To give an example: we evaluated the sensitivity of the siG0024 strain to different concentrations of 3OC6-HSL (LuxI product) and compared its characteristics to  those of other constructs. Additionally, we measured the sensitivity of siG0024 to 3OC12-HSL (LasI product) and C4-HSL (RhlI product). Indeed, we could observe the induction of sfGFP transcription by comparably low levels of 3OC12-HSL. Crosstalk can be observed between the Las and the Lux system. To simulate a situation most similar to the final experiment, we added the diluted supernatant of AHL producer cells to the test cultures. However, we could not detect any GFP production as reaction to the supernatant. We assume that the AHL concentration is not high enough to induce transcription. By constructing stronger RBSs on the producer plasmids we aim at increasing the AHL production. All these informations we will use to design a system tailored to our plans.
Summary of cross-talk experiments results
The figure shows the dose response of xxx to 3OC12-HSL, 3OC6-HSL and C4-HSL. Both 3OC12-HSL and 3OC6-HSL induce production of GFP, although at different concentrations. This is an example for cross talk between the lux and the las system.

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," low permeability of coelenterazine through the cell wall. However, due to time constraints we were unable to further investigate this.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate the expression of eYFP::CheY (BBa_K2736101 ). However, we were not able to measure BRET activity due to lack of bioluminescence from Renilla luciferase. We suspect that this is due to an inability of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine to penetrate into E. coli, as coelenterazine is known to have low penetration of bacterial cells. Solving this issue is the key next experiment to be performed, followed by detection of BRET signal in the presence and absence of the ligand Aspartate.
Aim 3: Adjusting the dynamic range of the chemotaxis system to enable detection of a broad range of contaminant concentrations.
Approach
To facilitate the measurement of multiple ranges of concentrations, we adjusted the sensitivity of the receptor. This approach is based on the methylation state of the Tar receptor, which influences its sensitivity to ligands. In the unmethylated state, the receptor efficiently transduces the ligand binding signal to the downstream pathway ( see project design ). Upon receptor methylation, the conformational change required to transduce the signal, is energetically less favorable. Therefore, when the same amount of ligand is present, the level of signal transduction is lower than in the unmethylated receptor state. The Tar receptor has four acidic residues that can be methylated (Q295, E302, Q309, E491). The methylation of glutamine (Q) or glutamic acid (E) residues can be mimicked by mutating these residues to alanine (A) (Krembel et al. 2015).
Results and discussion
Our computational modeling indicated that the mutation of the methylation sites should indeed result in altered sensitivity of the receptor. We therefore chose to generate three different methylation state Tar variants:
The wild type state, the unmethylated Tar receptor (QEQE, most sensitive);
A Tar receptor with one mimicked methylation site (QEAE, average sensitivity);
A Tar receptor with two mimicked methylation sites (QEAA, least sensitive).
We received the wild-type Tar receptor from a collaboration with iGEM team Groningen . We next used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the Q309A and E491A mutations, resulting in BioBrick parts BBa_K2736108 and BBa_K2736106 respectively. Sequencing confirmed the successful generation of these components. However,"

brief introduction
Search result group includes six members. The main goal of this group is to create an interface to accept the result(part name) of bio-brick searching (which is sent by the SE group),showing the details of this part.
In this part, database was the most important thing and five members were successively working on it.
Our members used a database of an iGEM software team （求网址）at first. Though the database consist of 13 tables, it still cannot include all the data of the website. Also since its different structure, the utility of the whole database is with doubt. After days of struggle, our group succeeded in loading data from xml which was provided by partsregistry.org and saved as sql file.
We chose MYSQL as our database management system for its search functions.
7.18
Once the division on the whole project was decided, the team in charge of the database started to analyse the mysql files and collect all the titles. By comparing the database and the website, we found that the database was incomplete, which didn't contain the description written by different authors, and the structure was totally different from the website. In order to build a part-name-based search result, we needed to search the whole database again when SE returned us the part name and collected the result.
7.19
Considering there were a lot of data titles and some of them contained few data, we tried to pick only necessary parts out. This day we devoted ourselves to select data from several tables, save it in a mutable array and show the result as table form.
7.20
Database part:Our instructor Dr. He gave us the xml form data which was provided by partsregistry.org itself. Therefore our focus of work changed to ""analyzing the xml file and saving it as a sql file"".We tested two methods: used Excel to load the xml file, saved as xls file"

Aim of the experiment: pGADT7 and pGBKT7 are plasmids containing the transcriptional activation domain or the DNA binding domain of the transcription activator Gal4. pGADT7 contains the transcriptional activation domain of gal4; we want to clone the the first 100 residues of Pif3 (BBa_K365000) into this plasmid. As a result we have a fusion contruct of Gal4 and Pif3, which is nescassary for the light-switchable promoter system. pGBKT7 is for backup, if the ordered biobricks are not working.
Operational sequence:
E. coli XL1-Blue are transformed with pGADT7 and pGBKT7 seperately after standard protocol of our lab.

Wisconsin-Madison,2012,Team:Wisconsin-Madison#lemon_-_-_TEXT.html,"c-ispA. Since ispA is native to E. coli , it should be translated more efficiently than the other enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, including GPPS. To further pursue this hypothesis it would be beneficial to insert GPPS and ispA into the Translation Coupling Cassette (TCC) and compare their translation efficiency. We are focusing on GPPS as the issue as our TCC research shows that the codon-optimized limonene synthase is being translated (See TCC page for further explanation). However, successful translation does not show that it is functional in the cell. This will be be assessed by in vitro assay, as described on the TCC project page. With this additional data we can work to further improve the production capacity of our strain.

Components of Auto-Lysis Device
Overview
How The System Works
Inducible Promoter
We used Arabinose to induce the pBAD promoter on PVJ4.
In order to test the efficacy of the “lysis cassette,” our team first took advantage of the well-characterized pBAD promoter.  We obtained the lysis cassette from the Mekalanos lab at Harvard Medical School on the pBAD18 plasmid.
In the future, the team would like to test the ability of lead, mercury, arsenic, and xylene inducible promoters to induce the lysis cassette in the presence of the respective toxins.
Lysis Cassette
The lysis cassette consists of the S,R, and Rz genes under the control of a single promoter.  These genes occur naturally in the lytic bacteriophage in an overlapping cluster downstream of the promoter P’r and lead to a specifically timed lytic event in the phage’s infective cycle.  In bacteriophages, both the S105 and the S107 proteins are created, the S107 protein being an “anti-holin” that disrupts the activity of the S105 protein, the “lethal lysis effector.” The S107 gene has been deleted from the gene cassette used in experimentation.
The S protein (S105 gene) is a holin protein that inserts an unspecific inner membrane channel (M[r]= 8,500) in the cell membrane of the bacteria.  The S proteins accumulate within the cell and cause membrane lesions simultaneously some time after translation.  The lesion halts respiration, enables small molecules to leave the cell, and causes the cell to die (not lyse), even in the absence of an endolysin protein.
The R gene (endolysin)encodes for a soluble transglycosylase.  The S105 channels permeabilize the cell membrane to these proteins, allowing R proteins access to the periplasm.  The protein attacks the peptid"
Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," claimed to not be very comfortable interpreting scientific news publications.
Most of our surveyed population, who identified as having an university education, claimed to trust scientific reports with dramatic and opinionated language to some extent.
More than half of our surveyed population, who identified as having an university education, claimed that half the time they would not verify new scientific claims with a credible source.
A small portion of our surveyed population, who identified as having an university education, claimed to share scientific news articles on social media based solely on the title.
Interviews and Questionnaires The interviewees are as follows:
Science Sam : PhD Candidate at University of Toronto studying Cell Biology and Neuroscience who blogs about lab science on Instagram
Bob McDonald : Canadian author and science journalist, currently hosing the CBC radio program - Quirks and Quarks
Dan Falk : Canadian science journalist, broadcaster and author (most recent publication: The Science of Shakespeare: A Look at the Playwright's Universe, 2014)
Dr. Catherine Reeve : Psychology and Neuroscience professor at Dalhousie University
University of Toronto iGEM team : one of our collaborators
Olivia Roberts : member of the general public, with a post-secondary degree in music
Interview Response Conclusions
Journalists and scientists who write articles are sometimes biased or exaggerate the results to grab the attention of the public.
People often assume that science-based news articles are credible because they are “science.”
Having a post-secondary education does not mean the person has all the skills required to assess and interpret a scientific article properly. Depending on the degree, and the  quality of their education, the person might interpret science in a different way.
Infographic Summary Our final initiative was to summarize all of our science communication and literacy findings into a brief infographic . This informational material is going to be distributed to the greater Halifax community, as well as online, to raise awareness about to appropriately interpret science-based news articles. Limitations
Our sample size was not big enough to represent the entire global community.
Most of our respondents were university students or members of other iGEM teams.
We did not analyze our results based on the types of post-secondary degrees.
Conversations with Communicators
How can Scientists do a Better Job at Communicating Science?
“Science is lacking in trendiness. Our goal is to bring people into science and change mindsets as much as possible. If we want to do that we need to target younger people, and if we want to target younger people we need to be cooler.” Sam believes communicating science involves all platforms, “why aren’t more people live streaming, why aren’t more people snapchatting from"

Clostridium difficile Significance, Symptoms and Cause
Clostridium difficile infections are the dominant cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea in the Western world. Outbreaks of hyper-virulent strains are also increasing, due to the high rates at which bacterial pathogens are developing antibiotic resistance [1]. More than 250,000 people require hospitalisation every year in the United States for treatment of C. difficile infections [2]. Additionally, in the US, a meta-analysis estimated that roughly 6.3 billion U.S dollars are spent annually on C. difficile attributable costs [3]. Consequently, our project focuses on a novel approach to curtail mortality and costs of treating C. difficile in the future.
C. difficile strains form spores which are released into the environment. These spores are highly resistant to environmental stresses such as ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, chloroform and heat [4], making contamination much harder to control in healthcare settings. This means outbreaks in institutions with high numbers of immunocompromised patients, whom are already at higher risk of suffering from infection, are now more likely to be exposed to the bacterium. As such, finding an alternative treatment for C. difficile infections is critical to properly managing a potential pandemic in the future.
Symptoms of a C. difficile infection can range from dehydration, fever, colonic inflammation, toxic megacolon, and in more severe cases sepsis and death [5]. Immunocompromised patients who have undergone broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen. This is because their gut microbiota is more likely to exist in a dysbiotic (unbalanced) state meaning fewer commensal bacteria are available to fend off pathogens or take up space in the gastrointestinal tract, increasing the likelihood of a C. difficile infection.

we have only made a deep research on genetic engineered bacteria with copper bio-senso coupling ribB which can produce riboflavin when added copper in MFC anode medium. As for parts with other ion sensor, we just made them to be the formation of Biobrick.
3.
In our study, we've designed a novel MFC system. For anode strain, we've cloned a copper sensor sequence coupling with ribB into E.coli BL 21. The genetically modified bacteria is able to detect Cu 2+ and produce riboflavin to boost electrical generation. As a result, MFC peak voltage can reflect Cu2+ concentration. Phosphate Buffer£¨PBS£©with 100 mmol/L potassium ferricyanide was packed into cathode chamber.
We aimed to build a quantitative monitor system of Cu2+ via measuring peak voltage, and finally found the interralationship between peak voltage and Cu2+ concentration. We concluded an empirical formula for our devices:
Peak voltage in MFC as genetically modified E.coli were treated with different amount of Cu2+.
We can deduce the concentration of Cu2+ in water by measuring peak voltage in MFC.
In a range of copper's low-concentration, the peak voltage rose with the increase of concentration of Cu2+. However, because of toxic effects of heavy metal to bacterium, when the copper content in water is over a certain concentration (about 2 mg/L) the peak voltage decreased as the concentration rises.

Overview
The model
Simulations
Assumptions
In the standard model of enzymatic reaction, 3 sets of assumptions are made.
Enzymatic assumptions
The enzyme is specific only for the substrate and not for any other chemicals.
Only one enzyme, our enzyme of interest is present and participating in the reaction.
There is negligible formation of product without the enzyme.
The rate of enzymatic activity remains constant over time because there is:
no co-operativity of the system. Binding of substrate to one enzyme binding site doesn't influence the affinity or activity of an adjacent site.
no allosteric regulations from either the product or the substrate.
no product inhibition of the enzyme.
The enzymatic reaction can be modelled by the following set of reactions (in particular the catalysed reaction is irreversible)
ie:
Degradation assumptions
All proteins are very stable and thus their degradation can be neglected over the course of the experiments
If there is no creation of substrate during the experiment (which is the most common case), we thus have [S0]=[S]+[ES]+[P] at all time
Likewise if there is no creation of enzyme during the experiment (which is the most common case), we have [E0] =[E]+[ES] at all time
Law of mass action assumptions
Free diffusion ; Free unrestricted thermodynamically driven random molecular motion
The reagents are in thermal equilibrium at a constant absolute temperature
The reagents are well mixed. [2]
Michaelis-Menten assumption:
The Michaelis-Menten (MM)[4] assumption is a simplifying assumption that is commonly made with enzymatic reactions. It says that since substrate binding is very fast compared to catalysis, the enzyme complex ES is always at quasi-steady state, ie:
, during the time of the experiment.
It is straightforward to prove that combining the MM assumption
with the conservation equation [E0]=[E]+[ES] yields a new form for the fourth equation
, where  KM is the Michaelis-Menten constant.
From the above assumptions, we know that
Properties of a Standard Enzymatic Reaction
1) When substrate concentration is large, the enzyme concentration is the limiting factor, hence rate of reaction is directly proportional to [E].
2) At very low [E], the reaction rate measured will be negligible as very low amounts of product will be produced"

Experimental setup
Experimental setup
Microfluidic experiments were conducted on a platform already established by the Georgiev lab . The laboratory is equipped with a precise microfluidic syringe system (neMESYS Low Pressure Syringe Pumps) and a microscopic station enabling fluorescence imaging and live cell microscopy (Olympus IX83, CellSens software).
Microfluidic experiments
On-chip signal transmission characterization
Example filling of microfluidic channel.
Microfluidic devices were designed and fabricated to characterize the signal transmission in the developed IOD band system. The signal transmission was characterized using spatially separated cell cultures inside a single microfluidic channel in conjunction with live fluorescence microscopy by characterisation of the yeast pheromone pathway activation. Fluorescent reporter proteins were connected to specific functional products to show activation of the yeast pheromone pathway. Details on the synthesis and function of the used reporter plasmids are provided by Module 1 . Synthesized reporter plasmids were transformed into specific yeast strains to enable characterization of the signal transmission between yeast cells using set of orthogonal signals designed and synthesized by Module 2 .
Fluorescence microscopy image showing activation gradient of MATa cells yeast pheromone pathway with pFUS1 reporter by MATa cells producing synthetic alpha factor in the microfluidics.
Level of fluorescence and its dependence on the distance from transmitting cells. Performed on Saccharomyces cerevisiae wildtype pheromone signaling molecules and receptors.
Simple microfluidic devices with T-shaped microchannels were used to characterise the signal transmission between selected yeast strains. Two cell types were selected for each experiment. One cell type transmits the signal in the form of pheromone molecules. Cell with complementary receptors produce the green fluorescent protein (GFP) if the pheromone level reaches certain activation threshold. The individual cell types are introduced to the microfluidic device in parallel through separated inlets. Due to the laminar nature of the flow, the individual cell types remain spatially separated inside the microfluidic device for the whole experiment. The flow is stopped when the microfluidic device is filled with cells. The rest of the experiment is performed statically. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is used to dynamically measure levels of GFP expression in the cells that receive the signal.
