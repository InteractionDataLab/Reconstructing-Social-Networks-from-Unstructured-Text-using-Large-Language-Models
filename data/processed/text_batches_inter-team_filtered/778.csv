To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

We need to explicitly mention that our bacteria are genetically engineered and explain how and why they are safe. Avoiding references to previous health scares implicitly such as the recent bad publicity of E. coli is needed to prevent association with illness.
Perceived trustworthiness of sources
It has been asserted that “GM promoters (e.g. industrial and governmental) are not particularly well trusted”. [19] As our campaign is currently hypothetical, it does not fall into either of these categories, instead being a part of a scientific research project. If we were to release our leaflet as an information campaign, it would be worth considering endorsement from more trusted organisations to gain credibility and trust. According to Costa-Font et al [20] , many studies have broadly classified the following sources into being more trustworthy than the biotechnology industry and government:
Consumer organisations;
Environmental groups;
Scientists;
with Europeans’ most trusted stakeholders being:
doctors
university scientists
consumer organisations and patients’ organisations
scientists working in industry
newspapers and magazines
environmental groups
shops
farmers
the EU
Our response
It will be important to consider the presentation of promotional materials so they are not dismissed as untrustworthy. It could be beneficial to identify environmental groups concerned with emissions and in favour of public debate about GM and synthetic biology to support the campaign. Quotes from university staff could be considered.
Conclusion
As part of our new approach to human practices, we have collected conclusions made by previous iGEM teams using surveys of people from around the world in order to build on the work that has been done before. The surveys have been revealing, highlighting areas for us to focus on when creating our materials. These issues will be considered in turn and justified with the presentation of our leaflet on the next page.
As human practices gains momentum - participation having been growing the past few years - there will be more information to guide the production of publicity materials, building a stronger foundation from which to address public uncertainty.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," enhanced biological phosphorus removal.
Operation & Maintenance Costs (O&M) are by far the highest when using chemical precipitation as the amount of chemicals used in the process is enormous (Tanyi, 2006). In addition, sludge that results from the treatment has to be processed further to ensure safety for public. This is the major reason behind the gradual shift towards EBPR, which has the lowest O&M costs (Tanyi, 2006). EBPR employs naturally occurring phosphate-accumulating organisms which filter incoming wastewater in a series of different stages. As of now, Phosphostore would lose on the O&M costs to EBPR as our technology employs genetically modified organisms which require additional machinery operation costs to minimise direct contact with the wastewater. In addition, our GMOs would have to be cultured in a separate vessel through a continuous culture system to avoid contact with other bacterial species. As a solution, we have discussed and thought of alternative synthetic biology strategies that may help to reduce the cost of Phosphostore.
We have modelled a rough estimation for the production cost of our system. The estimation only accounts for the substrate and medium used to grow the bacteria. From our calculations, it costs $1.33 to produce 1 kg of bacteria and $0.76 to treat wastewater containing 7.3g of phosphate in 48 hours. To estimate the cost to treat wastewater for a year, we used Davyhulme Treatment Works, the biggest wastewater treatment works in North West England, as a case study. We found that it would cost £550 million to treat the amount of wastewater that goes through Davyhulme which is about 30,000 litres of wastewater per second.
Additionally, capital investment of the major equipment, processing cost, and utility construction of 5 stainless steel fermenters with a volume of 177,000 L is equivalent to $27 million (Maiorella, Blanch and Wilke, 1984). These values are obtained from an estimated cost of a simple continuous fermentation for ethanol production. Maintenance cost is 3% of capital at around $810,000. Therefore, it will cost roughly $28 million to set up the system during the first year in addition to the annual cost to treat wastewater.
Phosphorus recovered from our bacteria can be reused as fertilizer for agriculture usage. Assuming that the fertilizer is sold at the same average market cost of Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), the most widely used phosphate fertilizer, the recovered material can provide revenue of $2.4 million, which is about 8.6% of initial capital investment.

Our Project
We have developed a multicellular, modular biosensor development platform to usher in a new era of biosensors. The platform aims to ease the design, implementation, and characterisation/optimisation stages of biosensor development: Click NEXT on the diagram below for an overview of the project.

What is a Biosensor?
Biosensors can be thought of as any device which is capable of sensing an analyte (e.g. a molecule or compound) or certain condition (e.g. pH or temperature) through the use of a biological component (Turner, 2013). One example of this would be a canary in a coal mine, where in the presence of carbon monoxide, the canary dies. A perhaps less morbid and more advanced biosensor example are those which have been developed by synthetic biologists. All organisms use native biosensing devices to monitor molecules of interest and initiate cell responses. For example, maintenance of cell homeostasis requires the sensitive detection and subsequent regulation of many molecules, such as metals, fatty acids and hydrogen peroxide (Rensing & Grass, 2003, Zhang & Rock, 2009 and Marinho et al., 2014). Two-component systems are common biosensing systems in bacteria. These systems allow bacteria to respond to extracellular signals by the phosphorylation of a sensor kinase in the presence of a target molecule, which subsequently phosphorylates further response regulator proteins. These response regulators can alter cell behaviour through protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, or RNA binding (Gao et al., 2007). In recent years,"
NortheasternU-Boston,2017,Team:NortheasternU-Boston#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," (Hancock et al. 2006, Pardee et al. 2016, Wu et al. 2014). There is a broad database of AMPs from a myriad of organisms which target broadly and specifically organisms from E. coli to P. falciparum (Wang et al. 2016).The diversity of this class of peptide made it attractive as a model because we could investigate factors like length, class of AMP, and predicted or known secondary structure. Producing AMPs across a complexity spectrum would give us some hint as to the capability of our cell-free system. AMPs also offered a key opportunity as a model in that many of them do not begin with a methionine as part of their peptide sequence. In our E. coli extract based system of cell-free expression we needed our expressed peptides to begin with a methionine start codon. For AMPs which do not have a canonical N-terminal methionine this residue would have to be removed in a post-translational reaction. We searched the literature for a way to achieve this and found work by Liao et al. (2004) working on optimizing mutants of methionine aminopeptidase isolated from E. coli. They presented findings of a GTG triple mutant methionine aminopeptidase with improved ability to cleave N-terminal methionines from peptides with bulky penultimate N-terminal residues. We now had our model system: Pick AMPs across a complexity gradient, with and without canonical N-terminal methionines and then test these for function against bacteria with and without the presence of methionine aminopeptidase.
Cell Free Reactions
Working with the limitations of our lab space and set up, and with the idea in mind to create the most economically viable cell-free reactions possible we decided to work with a system based off of crude E. coli extract. We adapted methodologies from various sources to the tools that were available to us (Kwon et al. 2015, Pardee et al. 2016, Sun et al 2013). CF reactions were made by growing up T7 Express E. coli induced to express the T7 polymerase. Homogenizing these cells and collecting a supernatant allowed to undergo a run-off reaction to digest endogenous RNA and DNA and then the subsequent combination of this crude extract with the supplementary buffers, tRNAs, and other compounds found in Sun et al. 2013, according to their protocol. The resulting expression mixture was then aliquoted onto paper strips in microcentrifuge tubes,"
Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest AdhesionTest_-_-_TEXT.html,"ocolitica and the Bactissile
While creating a biological machine that can efficiently kill specific pathogens without disturbing other cells in its environment, an adhesion system could play a vital role. Getting our Bactissile to attach to its target, in our case Yersinia enterocolitica , could give important advantages in target specificity and delivering medicine in a way that ensures it reaches Y. enterocolitica in a concentration as high as possible.
Technical Approach
The idea was to manipulate our Bactissiles bonding to any of Y. enterocoliticas surface structures and thus preventing the pathogen from ever attaching to the gut wall. This could be done with a DNA construct coding for a membrane protein that either resembles the bonding that Y. enterocolitica makes to our cells or one that itself binds to Y. enterocolitica.
We studied the ways of infection of Y. enterocolitica and could determine that its main strategies of entering through the gut wall is by using its diverse membrane proteins YadA, invasin and Ail. YadA and invasin work together to bind to our cell membranes. While YadA binds to collagen, invasin structurally resembles fibronectin, that is present in the extracellular matrix, which is recognized by the fibronectin binding membrane protein integrin alpha-5-beta-1 in our cell membranes. [1] Y. enterocolitica uses our own cell-to-cell binding mechanism to find a target cell and trick it to endocytose by binding to the integrin and to the collagen outside and in between the cells. [2] At first glance we thought of manipulating our probiotics to also use the same bioorganic systems. That could be done by expressing collagen-like proteins and fusing them with an anchor protein that could transport the whole construct to the outer membrane and keep the collagen attached to the probiotic surface. [3]
By using collagen, and especially putting it on the surface of a bacterial outer membrane that is meant to enter the human body, is an extremely risky procedure. “As antibodies would be produced to target the collagen and anchor protein complex this could lead to an autoimmune reaction as they would also react on the collagen naturally present in our body” says Lars Hellman, a professor in immunology at Uppsala University. More about problems with Y. enterocolitica-adhesion and the development of autoimmune  disease can be found in this text .
Instead we took inspiration from our teams killing system which secretes a bacteriocin, CFY, which specifically binds to and ruptures the outer cell membrane"

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," S.H.I.E.L.D. are specifically designed to lure mosquitoes, reducing the chance other animals might fly into the trap.
Under normal operating conditions, the GMOs are entrapped in our device. A nanofilter with pores small enough to prevent the E. coli from exiting and other microorganisms from entering the S.H.I.E.L.D. is placed between the hydrogel the mosquitoes land on and the dextran-based one from iGEM Eindhoven 2018 which contains E.coli. Nevertheless, there is a chance of exposure, for example in the case of severe damage, and escape safety needs to be considered. The bacteria we use are almost as fit as normal bacteria and they can sustain themselves over a long period of time. However, our implemented growth inhibition module is not only controlling cell size but also suppressing cell division, making it impossible for the bacteria to proliferate and spread even under ideal circumstances.  An additional suggestion was the introduction of a separate kill switch before using the S.H.I.E.L.D. in the field, such as the Amber substitution kill switch introduced by iGEM Darmstadt 2016. In this strain, a stop codon called Amber codon is introduced into a transcription factor which inhibits the expression of a lethal gene. In the S.H.I.E.L.D. the amino acid that corresponds to the Amber codon and does not naturally occur in E. coli would be provided by the cyanobacteria. In the absence of the amino acid the transcription factor would no longer be produced, causing the activation of the lethal gene.
Lecture towards biosafety and biosecurity by Dr. Mirko Himmel.
Another important topic was the selection of the insecticide used in the S.H.I.E.L.D. The data for the toxin we originally chose were not sufficient to ensure safe usage in the lab or the trap itself. Not only could the toxin be potentially harmful to off-target organisms in case of damage to the trap, but it might pose a health risk to people working with it in the lab. Dr. Himmel stressed that we would always have to assume higher concentrations of toxins when produced in the lab than could be observed in nature. Given that information, we were not able to state with certainty that working with the toxin would be in accordance with the safety regulations of a biosafety level 1 laboratory.
As a consequence, we decided on an alternative insecticide, namely BjalT. It is a neurotoxic polypeptide derived from the Judean Black Scorpion which acts on voltage-gated sodium channels and most importantly, proven to be harmless to mammals"

BioFactory
Modular Terpenoid BioFactory
Ever since the potential of genetic engineering became apparent, we have seen a rise in the use of synthetic biology to develop full-fledged systems working for the very interests of mankind. The idea that a basic system could potentially be used in the production of a whole range of molecules suggests that this kind of multi-directed manufacturing could be designed to optimally synthesize any given product at a given time. This is when the idea of a modular biofactory comes up, and the proper strategies for its design and execution were the focus of the project.
Starting from the assumption that a synthetic biology project is founded on the design of the proper genetic construct being transformed into an organism, it follows that most of the versatility of the project rests on the proper planning strategies applied to the DNA molecule. This would allow for distinct parts of the construct to be exchanged, added, or eliminated, depending on the development and focus that is ultimately given to the entire project.
Considering restriction enzymes as the basic tool for molecular cloning, it is possible to strategically locate the proper restriction sites in a genetic construct for the entire cloning process to be optimized. The proper design can come up with a master molecule from which a great number of sequence combinations can be derived using a limited number of enzymes. If certain restriction site pairs are assigned to each specific module, it would enable the future manipulation of each of these specific parts separately in the most efficient way possible.
The ability to manipulate specific portions of the genetic constructs opens up possibilities in the project execution that allow it to be more dynamic and adaptable. When working with a synthesized construct, one of the barriers for its proper realization is the high costs of producing long nucleotide sequences by oligonucleotide synthesis. This modular design strategy, by allowing to make multiple sequence combinations of the already synthesized construct, enables to study different sequence setups without having to synthesize each specific iteration separately, thus cutting a great amount of costs from the project.
Obviously, this can and has been achieved by working with digestion and ligation reactions, but multiple reactions convey an additional expense on reactants, mostly enzymes. Because a desired sequence exchange could be done by a single digestion and ligation, the modular strategy also promises a reduction on costs in this area. Even further, oligonucleotide synthesis has a limited sequence length that can be reached without errors, so larger constructs require the use of subcloning, which further expands the"

Abstract
In order to combine the sensing device with synthetic biotechnology, first of all, we us Simbiology software to built a theoretical model for our promoter PyeaR and describing the whole mechanism and reaction.
Then we found out the concentration of each substance varied with time by Matlab, and approximate method was applied for choosing a proper model fitting with GFP fluorescence variation curve.
To improve our sensing detection, we built a statistical model by nonlinear regression and calibration. Furthermore, we created analysis method for sensing data by our empirical model constructed with data from more than 150 experiments;           this model is able to divide nitrate concentration into 5 sections.
Motivation of Improving PyeaR Model
After taking a look to the result of previous teams, we found out that it’s not enough if we only describe the sensing reaction of PyeaR with NsrR; so to realize the mechanism, the paper, Activation of yeaR-yoaG Operon Transcription by the Nitrate-Responsive Regulator NarL Is Independent of Oxygen-Responsive Regulator Fnr in Escherichia coli K-12,           was referred. From figure 1. in the paper, no matter with or without O2, the influence of NsrR and NarL to NO3- had not much difference.
Instead, from Figure 2. the influence of NsrR and NarL to PyeaR promoter was significant, which was the reason for us to consider the effects of both NsrR and NarL while building a more complete model.
Figure 1.
Figure 2.
PyeaR Mechanism
There are Nap and NirK enzymes that can catalyze NO3- to NO2- and NO2- to NO separately in our E. coli system. After paper searching, we found that the promoter's reaction           was controlled by two gene representing two binding sites, one of which was NarL, and the other was NsrR. NarL is able to sense both nitrate and nitrite, promoting PyeaR to produce GFP further. On the other hand, NsrR has the ability           to block RNA polymerase from binding with PyeaR promoter, but nitric oxide will release NsrR from the binding site, therefore allow transcription process to start.

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

InterLab Study
Fluorescence measurement is a method abundant in all major labs.
Following up on the past years’ success, the iGEM HQ again challenged teams to take part in the InterLab study.
Measuring the fluorescence of various gene constructs becomes more and more important during everyday lab work. However, the comparability in different labs is still under debate. Using the fact that teams all over the world participate in iGEM, this offers the perfect opportunity to see how results of the same experiment performed all over the world compare. This year’s aim was to compare the fluorescence yield of five different constructs containing GFP under control of different RBS and promoters. By using a FITC standard curve and LUDOX to correct for errors in OD600 measurements, the results of all teams can be easily compared.
Materials and Methods
The following five constructs from the InterLab kit were used to transform E. coli DH10beta:
Positive Control
Negative control
Device 1: J23101+I13504
Device 2: J23106+I13504
Device 3: J23117+I13504
FITC and LUDOX standards were measured in a TECAN plate reader, using 96-well plates with transparent bottoms. LUDOX was measured at 600nm with a bandwidth of 9 nm and 25 flashes. FITC was excited at 488 nm (bandwidth 9 nm) and emission was recorded at 520 nm (bandwidth 20nm) with a fixed gain of 50 and 25 flashes. Identical settings were used for measurement of the devices.
All measurements were done as described in the Interlab plate reader protocol (see Methods ). Transformations were performed as described here Figure 1 shows the FITC standard curve used for the following calculations.
FITC emission standard curve
Fluorescence and OD600 are measured over time.
After transformation and overnight culture, all cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.2. Fluorescence and OD600 were measured over time. All cultures except"

We settled on a kind of popularization event that would bring us a maximal visibility, but that would also allow us to interact with each person individually and collect feedback. It would enable us to ensure that our message was not be misunderstood or oversimplified in the popularization process. We found just that opportunity in the Brussels Game festival .
Furthermore, we had the opportunity to participate to the Synbio Hours , a popularization event organised by the iGEM team Uppsala, in Sweden. We thus seized this occasion of explaining our project and of helping the Team Uppsala to explain to students and academics of Uppsala University the perspectives of synthetic biology.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," We also examined the intracellular calcium response to various combination of frequency and intensity of sound.We discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell are very sensitive to 15khz sound and not to 10khz, which indicate the previous identified touching sensing Piezo1 channel could detect sound wave of particular frequency range.  Finally, we engineered CHO cell with a GFP gene under the control of NFAT promoter to detect chronic  calcium signal). With which, we further developed tools for direct evolution of TRPC5 towarding mutants with high sensitivity to specific sound parameters. All in all, our project is well organized. Each procedure is indispensable. We not only implemented audiogenetics with synthetic biology to sense mechanical stress and sound, but only use it as a research tool for discover novel mechanical properties of Piezo1. The whole project can strongly prove the possibility of using sound wave energy as the extracellular input signal to induce intracellular downstream signal.
1. PiggyBac System Test
In order to quantitatively test the function of PiggyBac system, we did two groups of transfection using Lipofectamine® 3000. One was a group of CHO-K1 cells transfected with R-GECO, and the other group was the cells transfected with R-GECO and PiggyBac.

a) Bright field image of the cells transfected with R-GECO. b) Fluorescence of the cells transfected with R-GECO. c) Bright field image of the cells transfected with R-GECO and PiggyBac. d) Fluorescence of the cells transfected with R-GECO and PiggyBac.All figures was captured by Nikon microscope (Nikon TS100) 24 hours after transfection.
Comparing the fluorescence image of R-GECO (Fig. 1b) with R-GECO + PiggyBac transfected cells (Fig. 1d), we can observe that the group with PiggyBac has more fluorescent cells. It’s proved that PiggyBac transposon system can help the insertion of R-GECO gene into CHO-K1 genomes.
2. R-GECO Function Examination
To quantitatively test the function of R-GECO, two experiments, potassium chloride (KCl) induced calcium influx and ionomycin induced calcium influx, were conducted under the live cell imaging.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Notebook#September2011_-_-_TEXT.html," The samples that had been sent in for sequencing had primers that seemed to amplify the backbone, instead of the lysis cassette. While this does not necessarily mean that the lysis is not there, it does suggest that all the PCRS and gels used to verify the presence of lysis were only showing the existence of the backbone.
Alina ran a PCR with different primers from Douglas' first attempts at putting together the 2700 bp cassette that amplify select regions of the cassette.
Lilia tested the expression of the TetR mutants with the T7 promoter. The expression mix contained the Green Lysine and the gel fluorescence was imaged and is shown on the next picture.
The BP2col2 does not express, what explains the failure of the protein pool down at the MITOMI made on Wednesday.
Friday, September 2 2011
Alina wanted to try a new extension PCR of the T4-lysis and a Gibson of the exteneded-lysis into the K1 backbone. The transformation was successful with tons of colonies. A colony PCR will be run on Monday.
Nadine came back in the lab and cotransformed pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR with J61002 Plac-RFP since the sequencing results were concluent, in order to perform IPTG and ATC platereader experiments. We had a lot of contaminated bottles, so she also made new SOC bottles.
Monday, September 5 2011
Alina ran a colony PCR on the K1-T7-lysis Gibson assembly.
After having set liquid cultures on Saturday, Nadine set up the platereader experiment as follows:
J61002 Plac-RFP with increasing concentrations of IPTG
pSB3K1 TetR-LacI + J61002 Plac-RFP with increasing concentrations of IPTG
pSB3K1 TetR-LacI + J61002 Plac-RFP with increasing concentrations of ATC
She had also prepared co-transformations with pSB3K1 TetR-LacI + J61002 Plac-lysis, but the sequencing results indicated that the lysis cassette was wrong.
Tuesday, 6 September 2011
The results from the platereader experiment came back and they look good!
J6 Plac-RFP: The level of RFP expression doesn't rise much with high doses of IPTG, showing that DH5alpha cells don't express much LacI and that Plac is a quite weak  promoter.

Figure 1: Oscillations in AraC concentrations.
Figure 2: change in time period vs IPTG concentrations.
Our model predicts that we will still get oscllations if the plasmid copy number is same for $n_a = n_r = 50$. However, their Amplitude is less compared to the case of $n_a = 50, n_r = 25$. Specifically, the amplitude in AraC concentration is $1.7 \times 10^3$ molecules per cell as compared to $1.3 \times 10^4$ molecules in case of 1:2 copy number ratio.
When we change the RBS efficiency to 5:3, our model gives oscillations with the amplitude of $0.95 \times 10^4$ molecules
Figure 3:Equal copy number dampens the oscillations. Change in RBS efficiency restores the high amplitude
We obtained oscillations in GFP concentration as well.

Intro
Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school                     and                     collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to                     receive theirs.
RDFZ-China
We provided lab resources to team RDFZ-China for two times. In the first time, we provided Kit Plate                     4 N4                     L12 and Kit Plate 3 G6 I6 F22 to their team. In the second time we provided bacteria solution of PSB                     1c3                     with designed restriction enzyme cutting site. Since high school teams do not usually have the                     financial                     support from school, most of the lab materials used by RDFZ are purchased by their team members. We                     are                     very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project                     come                     true.
Shipment Coordination
Because of the fact that the person responsible for receiving part in Genescript has recently                     resigned                     from his position, so there was a period of confusion where all the teams in China didn’t know who                     to                     send their parts too. One of our team leader Ruohong Wang actively communicated with the Genescript                     company and after rounds of negotiation finally got to know the new recipient of all the team’s                     parts.                     After knowing this piece of information, Ruohong spread the news the all the teams in China and                     helped                     all of them with this shipping problem.

Ethics
A pinch of philosophy
“A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world.” - Albert Camus
The topic of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) often lead to dramatically different feelings and opinions among people - some also very negative. Public debates often link genetic modification and designer babies while pop culture movies such as “The Island” show cloning being horribly misused to create unconsenting organ donors. Our fantasy is free to imagine all kinds of scenarios. Such concerns may be labeled public risk perception and are a layman’s input to public discourse (For a thorough evaluation of safety, see our Safety page ).
Our project doesn’t present major ethical dilemmas, mainly because the modified bacteria are not meant to come into contact with humans. The bacteria are non-pathogenic and the genes we introduce do not give them advantages that can be passed on to more dangerous bacteria (the exception being antibiotic resistances). On the contrary, some of the genes we introduce pose a disadvantage: the bacteria are unable to regulate the dxs gene from B. subtilis and the prenyltransferase catalyses the formation of a cytotoxic substance. Furthermore, the transcription and translation"

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner"

A TOUR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY iGEM TEAM
We have reached the seventh and final stop of our tour of the the University of Calgary iGEM team wiki.  Human practices this year took on the challenge of interacting with all different levels and groups of the local Calgary community.  Through fundraising we were able to target both local and national corporate networks.  Ethics introduced a novel approach to examining ethical implications of Synthetic Biology.  Meanwhile marketing raised the visibility of iGEM as a premiere education program through our media coverage and outreach activities.  Additionally our educational outreach activities were instrumental in promoting synthetic biology to the next generation of potential researchers!
So now that you've seen the multiple facets of our project, please click HERE to see what we've been up to recently!
THE OUTREACH, FUNDRAISING, AND ETHICS PROJECTS
HUMAN PRACTICES: An Overview
In order to form a synthetic biology community, it is very important to involve certain segments that would play a significant role in community formation. These segments include the large Corporate Sector (interest lies in funding and thus more research and innovations) and the Education Sector (involvement encourages more research and development in the field). Both segments play a critical role in sustaining the future of synthetic biology.
However, attracting interest from these two sectors of our community is not an easy task. The majority of the population in these segments probably have never heard"

Tsinghua-A team 2013 have done some promotion of iGEM HS in China with the help of ITCCC (International Teenager Competition and Communication Center), a Chinese organization devoted to the promotion of science and technology competitions for young people. We went to Haidian foreign language experimental school and had a lecture about synthetic biology and iGEM, which had attracted nearly 300 students, and through this lecture we got some helpful and beneficial communication and interaction with those students. After that, we give some guidance towards their iGEM HS team’s experiment, project and competition. And in the iGEM HS 2013 competition the Haidian Foreign Language Experimental School team got an Individual Awards.
Our team member Lei Wei participate the Synthetic Biology and IGEM Exchanging Meet, held by Nanjing University, on April 26th, 2013. As our team leader in the last year, he shared his experience in doing research of synthetic biology and his feelings about participating the iGEM competition. Also, as a non-biotechnology-major student, whose major is Automation, he shared his experience and feelings standing on the Automation field, which would give students attending the meet some different inspirations.
We also collaborate with Nanjing-china team. As a team coming from Department of Biology, they were not so good at building model and coding, so they asked for our help to build model and code for them. They sent their circuit to us, and through our hardworking we finally sent the equations and codes back to them. They did some more work basing on our code and got the result meeting expects.

TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,", multidrug resistant bacteria have emerged and posed great threat to public health, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so on. To know about the exact situation of antibiotic resistance in the hospital, we visited Doctor Gong Yali, who works at the burn department in the Southwest Hospital. She did a lot of researches related to antibiotic resistance. She introduce that currently antibiotic resistance is a really urgent issue that needed to be treated seriously. For example, one of her researches demonstrated that the Acinetobacter baumannii was resistant to many antibiotics. We introduced our project and explained our goal of establishing a markerless integration visual selection system. She agreed with our idea and praised us for concerning antibiotics resistance. She compared the counter selection with our visual selection system and discussed with us about their value, on the basis of which she gave her advice. Thanks to her guidance, we had a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and we were enlightened to do more.
Collaborations
SCU-China:The project of SCU-China focused on the antibacterial deodorant insole. However, they met some trouble in microbes. Therefore, using our advantages, we helped them verify the antimicrobial effect of the insole. At the same time, we found our mathematical modeling unsatisfactory, so we invited their talented group members to provide technical guidance for us.
UESTC-software:UESTC-software encountered problems when synthesizing DNA primers,so we helped them. Additionally, considering that we had several models, we hoped to achieve visualization of the models by using software. UESTC-software kindly helped us, and the result was satisfying and helpful for our further work.
Conferences
Southwest Union:After five months of experiments, our project began to take shape. Meanwhile, we have just received a meet-up invitation from the Southwest Union (iGEM meet-up in southwest China). Simulating the final round, this meeting set up presentation, poster exhibition and free discussion. Together with the SCU-China, UESTC-China, UESTC-software and SICAU-China, we knew much detailed information about the competition, such as the progress and the judging criteria. All the teams exchanged suggestions with each other and build up deep friendship.
CCiC Conference:As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams"

FAFU
As a new team of iGem, we do not have much experience in gene cloning. We got struck in one important step of our project— We could not add the promoter of NO sensing to the target plasmid. We tried several times using different methods but none was successful.
Fortunately, FAFU (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou,Fujian,China) team from China is proficient in gene cloning and they were willing to help us. So we asked them for help and sent the DNA fragment of pNorV ( promoter of NO sensing) and our backbone to FAFU team. After two weeks, FAFU gave us a pleasant surprise—the promoter pNorV was inserted into the target plasmid. The work FAFU done was great news to us.
During the cooperation, we kept communicating with each other about the iGem competition. In their project, they transformed the Cry11Aa gene into Chlamydomonas reinhardti to kill the larvae of mosquitoes. They co-expressed Cry and Cyt by 2A-peptide system. cyt1 is a protein coding gene that codes for cytochrome c1 in Chlamydomonas reinhardti. Heme-containing component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that generates an electrochemical potential coupled to ATP synthesis. They wanted to get purified cytochrome c1 protein to study the property of it. But it is very difficult to purified a protein in Chlamydomonas reinhardti. They turned to our team because we can easily transform the gene into E. coli and purify the protein they need.  They constructed a plasmid that contains cyt1 gene.

Part Two: Effector System
Ideally, our effector system should only begin to produce the effectors once a threshold density of E.coli cells is reached at the plaque site. Since the system is in a prokaryotic chassis, signal transduction via the VLA-4/VCAM binding is not a realistic approach. Instead, we choose to employ the highly characterized LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system in bacteria. Briefly, the effector proteins to be released at the site of plaque are placed under the control of pLux promoter, activated by a threshold concentration of AHL. AHL is constitutively produced by our cells and it will reach the threshold concentration once a sufficient amount of E.coli cells is bound to the plaque.
In terms of treatment options we explored a number of routes; however, the following three proved to be the most feasible and advantageous choices. While we are not medical professionals and have not addressed the concept of dosage, the effectors we have chosen are such that mild overdoses would not be of great concern (i.e. beneficial effects far outweigh negative effects). We have also chosen these effectors for having minimal side effects.
1. Serum Amyloid A
SAA converts cholesterol stored in plaques into a form more accessible by High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), which is the body’s natural mechanism for returning cholesterol to the liver for packaging, metabolism and/or excretion. It is our hope that this effector, when released specifically at the site of atherosclerosis, will induce plaque regression.
However, the clinical effectiveness of SAA is still in doubt for several reasons:
* Not all atherosclerotic plaques are associated with cholesterol.     * The body can naturally produce SAA at an astoundingly high rate, given the correct signals.     * We are unsure if the molecule will reach the area of the plaque it is effective in.     * We are unsure if the body produces enough HDL to clear atherosclerotic plaques.
2. Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1)
The HO-1 effector system involves the production of heme and HO-1. HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme into carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin (BV), and free iron (Fe++), all of which have therapeutically beneficial effects on atherosclerotic plaques. CO acts as a local vasodilator, which may minimize chances of plaque rupture, as well as retard plaque growth. BV inhibits the proliferation"

We PCR verified our 10 colonies and only colony A had the CRO insert we were looking for. We set up overnights of colony A to do a plasmid prep and then sequence, and we also set up overnights of our three lambda strains to plate tomorrow as a lawn. Once we do that, we hope to be induce lambda to go lytic by plating our E.Coli with CRO.

Yesterday I came in and did a plasmid prep of colonies A and W, which looked promising for having CRO+pIG11 on our PCR readout. Today we confirmed on the spectrophotometer the concentrations of the plasmids. The plasmid from A was present at a concentration of 158 ng/microL, and that of W had a concentration of 62 ng/microL. Yesterday we also plated our three strains of lambda-infected E.Coli, TT9901, TT9907, and TT23281, so today we were ready to trasform the plasmid into these three plasmids using electrophoration. Dr. Grose showed us how to use the electrophorator. We shocked each strain with plasmid from colony A and then a control plasmid separately, for a total of 6 electrophorations. After letting the cells recover for 30 minutes at 37 degrees celsius, we plated about 1 mL of each on LB/Amp plates. Tomorrow, hopefully, we will see a few colonies indicating that they took up our plasmid! Also, we submitted plasmids from A and W for sequencing.

KK, KP Our electrophoration worked on 2 of the 3 strains - on TT9901, and TT9907, but not on TT23281. Yesterday we went ahead and set up overnights to plate the two successful transformed strains on Amp/Arabinose, but our Amp/Arabinose plates are no longer good, so we need to make more. We redid the electroporation today so that hopefully by next wednesday all three strains should be ready and we should have plates. We'll be testing to see if TT9901, TT9907, and TT23281 with Lambda's CRO gene cloned into them can induce the integrated prophage out of lysogeny and into the lytic cycle.

Accidental breakage of the patch while attached to skin may cause infections if the area is not disinfected properly. The risk is increased if there are open wounds on the skin near the application area.
Patch may cause severe harm if swallowed.
Potential skin irritation may occur. However, our initial mouse trials have shown no signs of inflammation.
in vivo Mouse Trials
With the mentorship of Dr. Jenne, the team wrote and submitted an extensive ethics application to the Health Sciences Animal Care Committee (HSACC) at the University of Calgary. The application was evaluated on multiple grounds such as feasibility, morality, and precautions of the testing of our transdermal patch on mice models. The project idea, protocols, and the scientific significance of our transdermal patch were also reviewed. HSACC approved our project under the above mentioned parameters, as our protocols and procedures were deemed moral. The testing of our transdermal patch was carried out based on the approved flowcharts below:
Since no member on the team had completed the Institutional Animal User Training Program (IAUTP) on mice handling and registered with the Institutional Research Information Services Soluion (IRISS), the mice handling work was completed by Dr. Jenne and members of his lab who had previous training and certification. Members of our iGEM team were present at all times during the testing of the transdermal patch in mice models but only as observers.
Containment
Contamination is an issue both on earth and in space, as the bacteria in the patch may be able to infect users of the patch or colonize foreign planets should they be released. To prevent the bacteria from escaping from the patch, there are several engineering controls in place, such as the protective physical barriers that prevent bacteria from diffusing out of the patch, including the backing layer and the selective membrane. Although our initial diffusion assays have shown that bacteria can diffuse through our semipermeable membrane, we have begun testing with other smaller filters including peptide dialysis membranes and 0.2 micron size filters. We have also had success with membranes used to filter-sterilize liquids.
See pages 15 - 16 of the Device Applied Design Manual to tackle contamination issues.
Future Considerations for Patch Design
If we can determine a better membrane that prevents the diffusion of the bacteria, we can use a two layer semi permeable system where the first layer prevents the diffusion of the bacteria and a second layer which further filters BBI for diffusion.
Safe disposal:
See pages 11 and 12 of the Device Applied Design Manual for disposal information.

This cross-borderness as governance strategy entails not only bridging nations through transnational action, but most of all, bridging the trust gap through public engagement initiatives and bridging disciplines through interdisciplinarity. We now examine how the Goodbye AzoDye Project exhibits these cross-border properties as a way of demonstrating how the iGEM competition acts as an incentive and model for governance strategies.
Implications for Governance Measures
Both the scientific uncertainty and the cross-borderness are indicative of three specific challenges for the (inter)national governance of synthetic biology: Governing knowledge and non-knowing, cultivating external accountability, and the fragmentation of social authorities. The uncertainty and cross-borderness are “only one thread in a tangled and mutually constituent web of scientific practices” which also means that their effect on these governance challenges are not manifestly evident (Zhang et al. 2011).

Source: Zhang et al. (2011: 15)
The aspect of scientific uncertainty challenges synthetic biology governance in relation to the salience of knowledge and non-knowing. This has, for instance, led to the growing importance of the precautionary principle in governing emerging technologies. This principle states that regulation should intervene in the further development of a technology when there is good reason to think that it may be dangerous. Precaution should then be the guiding principle until there is sufficient scientific evidence or knowledge to prove that it is not, or ways can be found to assure safe use. So, in other words, regulating scientific uncertainty becomes a matter of gaining more knowledge. However, as is the case with modern technologies such as synthetic biology, more knowledge generally means more uncertainties coming from the newly acquired knowledge. Therefore, a policy of precaution may not be as effective as would have been thought intuitively when considering the scientific trajectory. Furthermore, the technologies of hubris tend to leave out uncertainty when setting up policies, and instead narrowly focus on what can be managed as a risk. Hence, the implications for governance will rather be about including non-knowing as an essential governance aspect of synthetic biology so that uncertainty can ‘open up’ the ways we think about science policy. In the end, governance of uncertainty is about the negotiation of ambiguity in knowledge, where evidence can be discussed in relation to the acknowledgement of the complexities causing the uncertainty. Therefore, opening up governance measures also means that compromises will"

Democratic Biology
Biotechnology is the fastest growing technology sector and probably also one of the most controversial topics in today’s society. We believe that biology should be democratized, in order to give everyone the possibility to not only discuss our future, but to also shape it. Our overall goal in the Public Engagement and Education part of Human Practices was to get one step closer to establishing democratized biology.
We wanted to use the possibility within Human Practices in the iGEM competition to bring the topic of synthetic biology to the public. Although GMOs hold many possibilities in, for an example, future medication and fuels, we are also aware of  the concerns regarding the negative sides of synthetic biology. We understand those concerns and want to give the public the possibility to understand how to engineer bacteria and design DNA. The public should be given the possibility to be part of the discussion, understand the facts, what there is to be concerned about regarding synthetic biology. We want to give every mindset the opportunity - no matter the experience - to create the future together.
Because of this, within our Public Engagement and Education work, we tried to reach out to all ages and groups in the society, such as children, high school students, academia, organisations and everyday people.

Chemoinduction
Overview
Our system is 'kick started' by the addition of a compound, IPTG, which activates protein production (module 1) of our system. This is achieved by putting the genes for protein production (module 1) under control of a chemically inducible genetic part called a promoter.
Rationale
In designing our system, we chose to use an inducible (switchable) promoter rather than a constitutive (always ON) promoter. This is to allow the cells to grow to a certain cell density before forcing them to produce protein. The production of protein can be a burden on the cell's resources, especially at the early stages of cell growth. Therefore, the culture should only be induced by the addition of IPTG once it has reached a critical cell density.
 
About our reasons for choosing chemical induction
Theory
The Lac Operon
The Lac Operon is a prime example of a genetic operon (several genes under control of one promoter), and has been widely studied in the field of genetics.
The Lac Operon is a set of genes found in E. Coli that control lactose metabolism in times when preferable sugars (ie. glucose) are scarce. When glucose levels are high, the E.coli feed on the glucose. However, when glucose is not available, E.coli has a set of genes coding for the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of the secondary carbon source, in this case, lactose.
In order to control the activation of Module 1, the team is using the same promoter as that found in the lac operon.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"2006). Like ArsR, it is a regulator protein which can be relieved from binding to the DNA by being bound to by metal ions – these include zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and cadmium (Cd) (Moore. C.M and Helmann. J.D; 2005). This can be summarised in the table below:
Metal Sensor
Metals Sensed
czrA
Zn
Co
Ni
Cd
AND Gating
If the two ion selectivity tables are put together, it can be seen that the metal common to both sensors is cadmium:
Metal Sensor
Metals Sensed
ArsR
As(III)
Ag(I)
Cu
Cd
CzrA
Zn
Co
Ni
Cd
This means that if the two repressors can act on a single promoter or binding site by AND gating, cadmium can be detected and a biological response can be triggered.
The presence of cadmium ions releases both ArsR and CzrA binding proteins from the DNA allowing transcription to occur.
Cadmium sequestration by metallothionein
So the cadmium has made its way into the cell; and the cadmium has been detected by the metal sensors arsR and czrA. The question is: what happens to the cadmium now?
In our project, we hope to soak up the intracellular cadmium with a metallothionein known as smtA. Metallothioneins are proteins which have great tendencies to bind to cationic metal ions; examples of which include copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) (Creti. P., et al; 2009). This property is due to the richness of cysteine residues in its structure (Creti. P., et al; 2009).
In the cell, metallothioneins generally have two important roles: to remove non-essential metals via sequestration and to control levels of essential metals (Creti. P., et al; 2009). It is the first role with which we are concentrating on.
smtA encodes a metallothionein of the same name – this protein, which is described as a class II metallothionein seems to be synthesized in response to metals such as zinc and cadmium (Morby. A.P., et al; 1993). This suggests it has a role in cadmium sequestration.

(10:30 am) A few members of the group also tried plating out the 10g M.A. plate then sprinkling polystyrene ""sugar"" onto the surface rather than mixing it into the agar. This produced good results as the sugar made a layer just under the surface of the agar rather than sinking to the bottom, making it easier and more cost effective as less of the resources are needed.
Step one: measure out 0.5g of the polystyrene ""sugar"" on a zeroed balance using a measuring paper receptical. Step two: make sure the agar is molten, and your petri dish is slightly warmed in the hybridiser so the small amount of agar used does not set strait away. Step three: place the empty pre labelled petri dish onto the balance and zero. After this poor 9.50g of the heated M.A Agar into the petri dish and remove from the balance to a level table.
Setp four: sprinkle the polystyrene ""sugar"" onto the agar making sure there is an even spread, replace the lid and allow to cool. Once set turn the plate over so condensation doesn't drip onto the agar.
We noticed after the sprinkling, then agar set quickly, resulting in a thin layer of the polystyrene at the surface of the dish, which was the aim of the process.
11:00 am) Another step the group wanted to try was to gently heat the polystyrene ""sugar"" to see if it can be formed into more of a liquid to work with, as this could be easily spread into a thin layer.
(15:00 pm) After the group had lunch and finished up some work in the lab, we went to the Pseudomonas lab to see what had happened with the plates, and if it had grown or not. Unfortunately it had grown on the minimal media without polystyrene purely on the tiny amount of agar to make the gel set. With this new complication, the group headed back to the lab to decide on the next course of action, before stopping for the day.

We want a workflow that interfaces with fabrication protocols that are low cost, such that even DIY hobbyists could make new chips. We wanted a workflow whose hardware could be fabricated with a 3D printer, and whose software is open source so that the entire synthetic biology community can contribute to new features in Neptune. Further, we wanted to ensure our workflow completely and cleanly integrates with current fabrication methods, so that we are still following current standards.
Open Source Software
While this is already an iGEM requirement, we are proud to say our source code for Neptune is licensed as open under a BSD-II license. Further, we are very proud to say that Neptune is public on GitHub, and we encourage developers to fork the repo.
Neptune is free to download from GitHub too, and very soon NONA will provide a distribution method.
GITHUB REPOSITORY

Simple Design Process
Accessibility means ease of use. Ease of use means simplicity; it means a no-brainer user interface and powerful code to help you design microfluidics with ease. Indeed, the biggest setback to designing microfluidics before Neptune was the tedious, long, and difficult process of hand-specifying all features in the microfluidic device. In Neptune, simple english-language descriptions allow you to specify complex microfluidic designs.
Tutorials, Wiki's, Documentation
Not knowing how to use a new tool can dissuade researchers from ever bothering to learn; poor documentation, lack of support for new users, confusing or nonexistent tutorials- all of these add up to a big headache to a researcher who wants to get into microfluidics.
We targeted this issue by creating a tutorial video for our software and hardware workflow. This tutorial is a complete “Hello World” walkthrough that will guide new researchers step-by-step through the microfluidic creation process. We hope that this will encourage anyone who had been intimidated by microfluidic design to come forward and give it a shot.
A  tutorial video is good, but not complete. We followed up by starting a extensive written tutorial to writing LFR and MINT files (to design microfluidics,) and written tutorials on how to setup the hardware components. We also added wiki into to the GitHub repositories for Neptune and our hardware, providing yet another resource for new users to try.
Integrated, Low Cost Fabrication Protocols

Gibson fragments for the reporter plasmid, PCR'd with HifiPLUS enzyme. Good yield, but some unexpected product sizes, especially for the backbone.
Alessandro ran the Gel on Friday's PCR - that made Gibson fragments for the reporter plasmid, using the HifiPLUS enzyme. There is definitely some product (whereas iProof yields nothing at all). LacI and RFP seem to have worked properly. The lysis fragment is possibly a little short, and the backbone band is way too small. Overall, except for the backbone, it worked well.
In conclusion: our iProof enzyme seems not to work , either because it degraded, or it is just not suitable for this type of experiment. We should now use another enzyme. We ordered some High Fidelity PLUS for the next PCRs.
To investigate the lack of backbone product, Douglas ran a gradient PCR for the backbone fragment and the T4Lysis fragment. Five annealing temperatures were tested for each.

Alessandro made PCR to amplify pSB3K1 backbone to use for a gibson assembly to make the Pconst-TetR plasmid. We can't do the assembly now since we are waiting for primers for TetR. The PCR gave good result for one colony (on two) as we can see a big band of the expected size (3.1 kb). This time the purification will be performed not from the gel but directly from PCR with a commercial kit.
pSB3K1 successfully amplified by PCR
Alessandro send the Vincent's plasmid (J6001-Ptet-RFP) to be sequenced (as the primer arrived).
All the mutagenesis primers have been delivered, so Douglas diluted them. They are now all at "

Yan-Kay Ho
BBSRC LiDO PhD student
MSc Natural Sciences Graduate, University College London
Yan-Kay has always had a keen interest in science: from genetics and evolution, to developmental biology, and animal behaviour. She's even dabbled a bit into palaeontology, ecology, and systems biology. Now, through the BBSRC London Interdisciplinary Biosciences PhD LiDO Consortium programme, she is seguing* into the exciting field of synthetic biology. That is, having first taken this turn in the road via iGEM on the UCL Team 2014. Of course, the road continues further, and this is why she finds herself advising a new cohort of iGEM students, both on the Birkbeck (and UCL) 2015 Teams.
(*An appreciative nod to all the lovely people at the LiDO 2015 Retreat.)

JUDGING FORM
UC_San_Diego
★  ALERT!
This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the medal criterion or award listed above .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!"

Resuspend the pellet in freezing medium with pipette. Use 20% FBS, 70% DMEM, and 10% DMSO.
Dispense 1 ml aliquots into sterile cryovials and place vials in Nalgene frezing containers, and freeze at –80°C overnight.
The next day, remove the vials from the container, and place in liquid nitrogen storage for storage.
Result
After we place vials into container we forget to put container into -80°C, instead we place it at -20°C overnight. Experiment failed.
We have left a little fraction of cells seeding in T-25 flask. So we passage them to 10cm petri dish for expand and next freezing.
Pick monoclones
Clones on the plate for pick monoclones have grown into a big monoclone. So we pick up those clones and passage to 24-well-plate. Culture those monoclones and do experiment. Because monoclones have better stability.

PYREX™ Cloning Cylinders
Procedures
Procedure
Examine the culture dish containing well-isolated clones with a microscope. Locate those with a good condition considerable population.
Once satisfactory colonies have been located, draw a circle around them on the bottom of the dish with a marking pen. Select colonies that are of bigger size (bigger represent quicker growth rate) and well isolated from other colonies.
Remove and discard the growth medium. Rinse the plate twice with PBS to remove any floating cells and wash out all medium.
Using sterile tweezer pick up a cloning cylinder. Gently press the flat bottom of the cylinder into the sterile vaseline and remove with a sudden vertical motion. If done properly, this will give even distribution of grease on the bottom of the cylinder. Set the cylinder over a colony. Gently press the cylinder down evenly with the tweezer. Uneven pressure will cause the grease seal to leak. Be very careful not to slide the cylinder across the colony. This will smear the silicone grease over the cells and prevent the trypsin from contacting them.
Verify positioning of the cylinder over the colony with the microscope. Make sure there are no other colonies within the sealed area in the cylinder.
Add about 20μL of the 0.25% trypsin to the cloning cylinder.
Incubate the dish at 37°C for "

Judd_UK,2017,Team:Judd UK#Pages#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". Issues such as the global food shortage and energy crisis. We  also talked about the ethics of synthetic biology and why the public has been so opposed to its use in the past. Examples such as the burning of GM crops in the early 1990s and 2000s shows how synthetic biology, if badly managed, can result in a public and media backlash. However, we explained how the current applications of synthetic biology, which are numerous, are only the tip of the iceberg. This led onto an explanation of our project and the IGEM competition which hopefully encouraged younger students to start their own teams in the senior part of the school.
Modelling Presentation: Chemistry Society
In another talk given in Chemistry society, the modelling team went through the derivation of our mathematical model to the upper school. This explained the benefits of using a mathematical model in chemical processes and how we it in our project and was an opportunity to educate our peers about a specific aspect of our iGEM work.
Website
<img src=""
"" style=""width:30%"" class="""">
While our project was still in its infancy, we began constructing a website on our school system (which is called frog). It gives information covering what the IGEM competition entails as well as all aspects of our project. Each part of the project, for example human practices, has its own page which we began filling with content as a log of the team’s progress.  The website had a number of functions.

In one of the school's biology labs, the team has been filling in a number of posters on the wall. It shows the brainstorming that went into forming our project idea, a timeline of deadlines for the IGEM competition and has been used during virtually all of our teams weekly meetings. Not only has it been extremely helpful for us throughout the last 7 months, the students who use the lab on a day to day basis can see our work and its progression over time. The intention of the posters is to engage anyone who takes the time to read them with its attractive presentation and hopefully make them interested in synthetic biology and IGEM. The team"

My name is Matthew Curry and I am going into my second-year of Microbiology and Immunology at Dalhousie University. After hearing about iGEM I became fascinated with synthetic biology. As a student I enjoy broadening my horizons through bioinformatics and simulations however, the Dalhousie iGEM team has let me take my interests further and apply aspects of our project in the lab. I'm excited to be a part of the iGEM team this year!

Francis is a second-year neuroscience student. She decided to join iGEM at Dalhousie because of her interests in synthetic biology and her previous experience working on two iGEM projects in high school. iGEM has allowed Francis to experience the problem solving and lab setting that microbiology and genetic engineering bring to the table - both of which differ in many ways from her main area of study. Francis plans to continue with her neuroscience degree and a certificate in neurotechnology innovation and hopes to study abroad in the near future!

A Brief Introduction
to Allergy Testing Master
Histamine increases significantly in blood when allergy happens. So, we modifidied the pheromone pathway in the yeast to test histamine release in blood sample under one specific allergen. The pheromone receptor ste2 in original pathway is replaced by human histamine receptor H3 or H4. In order to reinforce the coupling between H3/H4 and yeast G-protein, C-terminal of α subunit of G-protein is modified by replacing several amino acids from the homologous protein in human. EGFP is pludged afterward the  promoter Fus1 as a reporter gene. Sufficient works substantiate our modifications. Then We construct models describing the relationship between histamine and EGFP intensity, which make contributions to the analysis of diagnosis credence.Besides, we design an integrated kit for the whole process of the blood collection, testing reaction and dignosis.Diagnosis result, after being calculated on our server, will be sent to terminals as smart phones, which makes our project possible for domestic uses.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#ProteinGAN_-_-_TEXT.html," The resulting dataset was relatively sparse for our purpose, therefore we decided to upsample using the NCBI RefSeq non-redundant protein database (nrDB). We used MMseqs2 (Steinegger et al. 2017) to cluster our selected enzyme database using 90% sequence identity threshold and over 80% sequence coverage, which resulted in a total of 77,686 representative sequences. This step was taken to reduce the redundancy of sequence database which was used as a query database for the MMseqs2 search workflow. To upsample, we searched our clustered database against nrDB using these parameters: 30% sequence identity threshold, 80% sequence coverage, 7.5 sensitivity level; and afterwards extracted 98% identity representatives. The resulting database consisted of 409900 sequences, which were used to assemble training and test sets for ProteinGAN.
Building the ProteinGAN
ProteinGAN - generative adversarial network architecture that we developed and optimized to generate de novo proteins. Once trained, it outputs a desirable amount of proteins with the confidence level of sequences belonging to a functional class it was trained for.
A Sub-neural network called discriminator learns how proteins look like by trying to distinguish between real and fake (generated) sequences. At the same time, another Sub-neural network called generator tries to fool it, by providing realistically looking generated protein sequences. Yet, the generator never actually sees any of the protein sequences.
Over time, generator becomes so good that generated examples satisfy rules by which discriminator currently judges proteins. In order to, keep up with generator, discriminator needs to discover more sophisticated patterns in real data to able to distinguish real from fake. In turn, the generator will adjust generation of sequences to match those patterns in order to stay in competition with the discriminator.
By the end of this competition, the generator will have learned how to generate proteins that share same patterns as real ones.
Figure 1: High-level design of ProteinGAN. Generator learns to create realistic sequence embeddings (digital sequence representations) from random noise, which then are compared to real sequence embedding by the Discriminator. The learning process of such a neural network is a never-ending competition between the Generator and Discriminator.
ProteinGAN results
Using the architecture described below, we have successfully trained a generative network to create enzyme sequences belonging to the DNA helicase class. After the training we asked the ProteinGAN to generate us a DNA helicase enzyme and that is what we got:

On Saturday, leading international scientists in Synthetic Biology gave talks about the newest trends in the dicipline; Michael Hecht (Princeton University) and Kathrin Lang (Technische Universität München). In the afternoon, we had a poster session, where all iGEM teams presented their project and we had an opportunity to share our ideas with other teams. We almost managed to discuss to all European teams and talked to the American iGEM team from University of Delaware. Also, in the afternoon we participated to the workshop “in and outside of Synthetic Biology and Science” giving us clues about team building and fundraising.
In summary, general opinions of people about our project were enthousiastic as we could thoroughly discuss about our idea and its potential fallout. But still, there's a lot of issues were left to be resolved such as the photobioreactor and the environmental concerns about our project. The graphic design of our poster had success. Although some modifications and corrections would be important to improve the poster, for it to be finally ready for the final event, the Giant Jamboree!

To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi"

Patent keepers need to pay tax  for the patent they hold in each country, so sometimes it is not beneficious to have a patent-right in each country.   Once a company/institute has patent on a specific invention, it has rights to exploit this product economically for 20 years. People can buy the patent or ask for a license, in which case part of the profit is directly transferred to the company who owns the patent.  Ir. Van Dongen doesn’t foresee much problems in our research. He could tell us that there is an exception to the patent law when it comes to the use of a product for scientific research. Only if we were to introduce our device to the market we would encounter patent regulation.
Ir. Annika van Rosmalen - Responsible at HollandBio for communication about bio-based technologies
Goal: Get some insights into regulation involved in bio-based technologies like ours.
Approach: We talked to Ir. Van Rosmalen about the potential of our device. Since Ir. Van Rosmalen works at HollandBio, a Dutch association for companies involved in the production of bio-based technologies, she could tell us more about policies and opportunities within this field of research. We explained her about our project and asked if she could foresee any difficulties in practical, but also in the legal perspective.
Result: Ir. Van Rosmalen was quite enthousiastic about the idea of a quick and easy detection device. She advised us to further emphasize the advantages of using bacteria in order to avoid a lot of ethical complaints.
About patent regulation she could tell us that the 20 years of patent rights usually only give the patent holder only 15 years to earn back his/her expenses. This is because an application for patents on different aspects of the design is made at the beginning of the research. However usually it takes at least 5 more years for the research to be published.  One other important aspect is that the patent-holders themselves are responsible to keep check of any illegal use of their product. This is not supported by any other agency. Therefore it takes quite some work to keep your patented product safe.
Patentpunt - Mr. R. (René) de Torbal – Consultant in patentdistribution working for Patentpunt

Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the sensing part
In bacteria quorum sensing is an important mechanism for monitoring the state of the population. S. aureus uses its quorum sensing system to regulate a large part of its virulence genes, as having a large population is beneficial for S. aureus during infection [1] . In this project we hijack the native S. aureus system and implement that in the antimicrobial peptide expression host E.coli.
We used the quorum sensing system of S. aureus in our peptidor in order to make sure the antimicrobial peptides will only be produced when S. aureus is present. This way there is less chance of other microbes becoming resistant against the peptides and therefore indirectly, through horizontal gene transfer, preventing S. aureus becoming resistant.
The system is composed out of the transmembrane receptor protein AgrC and the cytoplasmic protein AgrA. AgrA is phosphorylated by AgrC upon induction with auto-inducing peptide (AIP), after which it will act as a transcription factor positively acting on the promoter P2. AIP is made from the precursor peptide AgrD, which is circularized and secreted by AgrB (Figure 1). In the final construct used in Peptidor, pP2 will not be in front of GFP, but in front of the SUMO-peptides as explained here .
AIP Sensing Experiment:
The construct BBa_K1022100 ,pBAD AIP Receiver GFP, (fig. 2) is the test construct for the first module of the project in order to sense the auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) produced by S. aureus.

Hyperflagellation (Part K343000)
General use
This BioBrick poses no treat to the welfare of people working with it, as long as this is done in at least a level 1 safety lab by trained people and in non-pathogenic hosts such as E. coli TOP10 or MG1655. No special care is needed when working with this BioBrick.
Potential pathogenicity
This BioBrick increases the potential of its host to move. Increased motility has been associated to the bacteria’s ability to invade humans ( 5 ); on the other hand it has also been shown that bacteria that lose the function of the FlhDC operon, are considerably better at colonizing the intestine ( 6 ), and so an increased expression might decrease a host's ability to colonize and invade humans. It is impossible to ensure, that this plasmid is not transferred to pathogenic bacteria since the FlhDC operons is used in a wide array of other bacteria that are known to be pathogenic.
A number of effector cells in the human immune system react specifically to bacteria’s flagella, and so a hyperflagellated host will most likely induce a stronger immune response.
These different considerations lead us to conclude that we do not recommend using this BioBrick in humans.
Environmental impact
The BioBrick might increase its host's ability to find foods, but we do not think it will be able to outmatch naturally occurring bacteria. It will not increase the host's ability to replicate, but will increase its ability to spread, which might increase its ability to survive.
The BioBrick itself will most likely not make an environmental impact, since it only regulates internal systems of the bacteria.
Possible malign use
There is no reason to believe this BioBrick could be used for malign uses; it does not increase the host’s ability to vaporize, create spores or ability to survive under storage conditions. The fact that this BioBrick will likely increase the immune systems response to hosts carrying it makes it a bad candidate for malign use.

After transformation of the ligation product pSMF2.1-has2-UDP-glcDH into competent E. coli cells and selection on ampicillin agar plates, the plasmid DNA of resulting transformants was checked by control digestion. Figure 9 shows the result for one representative E. coli transformant.
Figure 9: Control digestion with MluⅠ,SacⅠ andSphⅠ of plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli cells that were transformed with pSMF2.1-has2-UDP-glcDH plasmid. Apparently the transformant did absorb the pSMF2.1-has2-UDP-glcDH plasmid and shows two additional bands of UDP-glcDH insert DNA at 1382 bp and has2 insert DNA at 1693 bp below the restricted pSMF2.1 plasmid at 6510 bp. Both negative controls with only one or no restriction enzyme did not show the specific insert bands.

Lane 2: pSMF2.1-has2-UDP-glcDH (MluⅠ/SacⅠ/SphⅠ)

Obviously the pSMF2.1-has2-UDP-glcDH plasmid was successfully absorbed by the E. coli transformant as all three digestion products representing the pSMF2.1 plasmid at 6510 bp, the has2 insert DNA at 1693 bp and the UDP-glcDH insert DNA at 1382 bp are visible after digestion with MluⅠ,SacⅠand SphⅠ.

Overview
In 1933, Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1927, exhibited his ‘germ paintings’. It was the origin of “BioArt” that represents a crossover of art and the biological sciences with genes, proteins, cells and animals. Fleming’s early works were reductively evaluated as the terms of its aesthetic criteria, beauty. In this year, our project consists of two interrelated themes. First, we try to create a new tool for “germ paintings” by integrating cell-to-cell communication with motility, color and other behavior such as fragrance. Second, using this tool, we try to draw not only patterns but also paintings. BioArt is still at the threshold of definition because of the lack of interdisciplinary work. Given such current condition, we will consider significance and prospect of BioArt through doing works and discussion with artist.

A3 Assembly
Diagram Explaination
The above diagram is an example of the A3 Assembly that we used to combine to basic parts into a composite part.  This one shows the creation of K675004 that has the ArsR-regulated promoter coupled to the GFP generator.  Both parts assemble in the right order because of the way that they are cut with restriction enzymes.  They only have one plasmid that they can go into and that one is tetracycline resistant so we selected for the transformed bacteria with tetracycline.  After a while we chose large colonies and grew them in LB-AMP because they could grow quicker and we could extract more DNA.  We ran the parts that we made on argarose gel electrophoresis to check the sizes.

Alternative selectable and counter-selectable markers:
Haloalkane dehalogenase (dhlA)
Background
DhlA is haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 (Keuning, Janssen, & Witholt, 1985) . It converts 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) into the more toxic 2-chloroethanol and is successfully used as a counterselectable marker in plants (Naested, Fennema, Hao, Andersen, Janssen, & Mundy, 1999) . This is why we decided to assess its suitability as a counter-selectable marker in bacteria.
Cloning
PCR amplification of BS-dhlA with these primers resulted in no product.

Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Project#insertion of motifs into surface-exposed loops_-_-_TEXT.html," determine the amount of encapsidated vector plasmids, the so-called DRP (DNAse-resistant particle) titer (see figure 2C). Comparison reveals that both assays yielded a peak signal around the Äkta fraction 8. The qPCR data indicated that all samples contain approximately 2 x 10^9 copies of the vector plasmid per milliliter. Assuming equal packaging efficiencies for the vector plasmids, all three loop insertion approaches contain comparable amounts of viral capsids. The sandwich-ELISA yielded a peak around fraction eight for all three loop-insertion approaches. Since the signal strength for the 587KO-Z34C samples is significantly higher, it can be assumed that additionally to the affinity of the A20 antibody for assembled viral capsids, the Z34C-containing viral particles add a high affinity for the Fc-part of the detection antibody. Hence the qPCR-titration only depends on the number of encapsidated AAV-vector plasmids and not on the viral capsid and its degree of modification, it is the more quantitative method of particle titration which proved equal for all three loop insertion approaches.
Summarizing, the insertion of a 34/39 amino acid functional motif into the two most promising integration sites of the AAV-2 capsid (see figure 3) revealed no integration of modified viral capsid proteins (VP1-3) into assembled viral capsids for the 453 integration site. As also seen by the data obtained for the linker-containing insertion, the 587 region tolerates insertions of at least 39 amino acids. For the 453 integration site, either the inserted Z34C motif loses its ability to bind IgG molecules or the influence of the inserted motif causes strong structural changes that disturb the ability of the modified VP proteins to be integrated into the virus capsid.

Prof. Ng is the mother of NCKU-iGEM team. Since the                                                 establishment of NCKU-iGEM in 2016, Prof. Ng has brought synthetic biology as well as iGEM to the spotlight  of NCKU campus. Prof. Ng                                                 always inspires team members by asking us some critical questions                                                 without telling us the answer directly. She gave us advice from                                                 different aspects. She initially gave us many critical suggestions                                                 during the brainstorming. Except for teaching us knowledges about                                                 synthetic biology, she always reminds us to think more about the                                                 real application of our project.
Various useful advice was given by her. She emphasized                                                 the                                                 advantage of protein production by E. coli, she also suggested                                                 us                                                 to study more on high cell density fermentation. Without her timely                                                 advice, our team cannot improve our project.

His major field is Bacteriology, Bacteria Genetics, and                                                 Molecular Biology.
We invited Prof. Huang to attend our first presentation.                                                 During our first                                                 presentation, he provided us a lot of useful feedback and we could feel                                                 the intention of Prof. Huang. So, our team thought that Prof. Huang could                                                 guide us for all our project and we wanted to invite him as our PI.                                                 Luckily, we have succeeded!
Since the day Prof. Huang joined us, he                                                 provided us all the resources that we needed or could make it more                                                 convenient. Secondly, he gave us many ideas when we had met                                                 difficulties or junctions in our progress whether it was"

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," this channel but rather      designed a separate mutant called NAKT. Therefore, we integrated the channel in the plasma membrane of a mutant with ENA1 already knocked out. We did this, because the gene not only mediates      efflux of sodium but also transports potassium back into the extracellular room.
Fig.9: The NAKT mutant: NHA1 and ENA1 are knocked out since they are also increase potassium efflux. AtAKT1 is integrated into the plasma membrane to actively import potassium into the cytosol. AtAKT1 consumes ATP.

Why Saccharomyces cerervisiae?
Why did we choose S. cerevisiae as the organism to work with? There are a few very striking arguments:
1. Our project aims to remove salts from industrial process water. It is therefore crucial that our organism can survive and be cultivated in liquid media. Since we rely on a eukaryotic organism      (see 2) and plants are unable to grow in pure water, we decided to work with a yeast.
2. We intend to accumulate as much NaCl inside the cell as possible. Sodium is toxic and at higher concentrations becomes lethal [16].  It substitutes potassium as a cofactor in      enzymes and inhibits specific cellular targets [17]. That is why it is essential to remove sodium from the cytosol, making storage compartments like the vacuole of S. cerevisiae      irreplaceable for our project.
3. Since we expose our mutants to a variation of significantly increased concentrations of salts, a certain native salt tolerance is necessary. S.cerevisiae is able to grow in a      wide range of environments conditions and can tolerate high external concentrations of potassium and sodium [16]. Additionally, S.cerervisiae does not struggle to grow at      concentrations found in industrial process water where we see the application of our project.
4. S.cerevisiae is a well described model organism in general. Fast growth and a broad range of genetic tools to prepare mutants enable the fast progress in laboratory work, which is necessary for iGEM. Being the first eukaryotic organism with a fully annotated and sequenced genome [18] it also became the model organism to study alkali metal      cation homeostasis and lead to identification of most transporters included in this complexly regulated system. All these transporters have been predicted in silico [19],      which helped us in modelling our system.
