TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#HP#Determine_-_-_TEXT.html,"wing to its unique nano-scale three-dimensional network structure, BC has a high water retention, high mechanical strength, and outstanding biocompatibility, which enable it to serve as a natural scaffold material for the regeneration of a wide variety of tissues. For most wound-repairing materials, important characteristics are their ability to lock exudate during the dressing process, as well as their removal from wound surface after recovery. BC’s potential lies in the unique properties (such as the high mechanical strength) of the never-dried BC membrane; on the other hand, its high liquid absorbency, biocompatibility and hygienic nature perfectly cater to the specific demands for skin tissue repairing. Thus, considering the properties of BC as well as its clinical performance, the commercialization of BC for wound caring is very promising.
We inquired about LEE'S PHARM and collected data related to Hemicelluose Dressing — Veloderm.
Seminar with Tianjin University
In early March 2017, our project was in the initial design stage. We went to Tianjin university and communicated with team iGEM-Tianjin. We introduced our projects and give suggestions to each other. Everyone  was involved, and this allowed members to discuss and ask questions.
We all got new inspiration for the project. We are also had a meeting with SynBioBeta founder John Cumbers, Vice President of Tianjin University Yuan Yingjin, John Hugh snyder, Director of the Beijing Institute of Life Sciences, Wu Feng, Associate Professor of Beijing Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Ma Rui, Investor of FreesVC, etc. We asked questions about synthetic biology and iGEM, and John Cumbers responded patiently to the questions.
Questionnaire
Our questionnaire shows that most people use the mask 1-3 times a                             week, many of whom are young people. This proves that the mask is a                             very promising commodity, the development of new mask material also                             has a good prospect. In addition, 70 percent of people think that                             moisturizing is the most important effect for a mask , which also proved                             that BC to be a mask with superiority.

Figure 4: Variation of activity with temperature of a system that has 5 proteins, using 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mRNA.
Summary
- Stability decreases with increasing modules number. In case of many modules, stability is larger when one of the modules is the limiting step.
- Stability grows with decreasing number of mRNA at lower temperatures.  On the other hand, higher temperatures and lower number of mRNA show higher activity.
Application to other iGEM projects
Team Slovenia 2010 (DNA CODING BEYOND TRIPLETS) developed a system to use a DNA sequence as a scaffold for enzymes, in order to optimize a metabolic pathway ( TS10 ). We apply our model as follows:
$$ \begin{equation} \frac{A_{c}}{A^0_{c}}  = {(\frac{r_P}{r^0_P} )^n}{({\frac{r_P}{r^0_P}}{\frac{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_F}{RT } } }}{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_F}{RT^0 } } }}}{\frac{e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT } }}{e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT^0 } }}})^m}{({{\frac{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_Z}{RT } } }}{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_Z}{RT^0 } } }}}}{{\frac{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_I}{RT } } }}{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_I}{RT^0 } } }}}})^z}{{\frac{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_D}{RT } } }}{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_D}{RT^0 } } }}}} \end{equation} $$ where n is the number of required transcripts, m is the number of required translated proteins, z is the number of required zinc-finger—DNA interactions,  E$_a$ is the activation energy, $\Delta$G$_F$ is the folding energy of any enzyme required for the pathway, $\Delta$G$_Z$ is the  folding energy of every zinc-finger domain [17], $\Delta$"

Adventures in Human Practices: Integration from Day 1
4/1- First Meeting! We began to consider the steps necessary to make a food dye, such as looking into GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe by FDA) vectors for our machine and how we could classify the project as natural, even though it seemed processed. When considering making a food product, we also thought the foundational problem of whether the public would ever buy into bioengineered dye.
4/7- Team dinner, and going through basic literature. Read Luis Campos “Follow the BioBrick Road.”
5/2- Offer for Monsanto Sponsorship. This was very exciting—our team, like many others, was concerned about being able to finance the project. However, we were not comfortable immediately accepting as we pondered whether this association could have effects in terms of our project’s public acceptance later on.
5/10- FDA Request for Comments regarding “Natural” food labelling deadline. We discussed the call for comments as a group. On the one hand, we really wanted to participate, and felt strongly at the time that we wanted to make a dye that would be categorized as natural in order to be marketed to large food companies that were seeking a natural dye that could precisely fit aesthetic concerns. Here was the opportunity to at least try and sway national policy in our favor. However, we needed to take time to really consider whether it was ethical to try and alter the legal framework surrounding our potential product. In light of the offer for Monsanto sponsorship and growing concerns of whether this sort of action might be a conflict of interest, we determined it was too early in our research to really offer the kind of guidance to the FDA that would be morally sound, and in the best interest of the American people. We opted to obstain.

The pSB3C5 plasmid BBa_K2201032 containing five sgRNAs and mRFP-sacB was linearized with the primers 17tx and 17we and assembled with UBP_target via Gibson Assembly. 10 μL of the Gibson Assembly was transformed into chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the pSB1K3-plasmid BBa_K2201027 . After the heat shock, the cells were recovered in 850 μL liquid recovery media (2xYT media supplemented with 50 mM K2HPO4, 0.5 mM IPTG, 100 μM isoCmTP, and 100 μM isoGTP) and shaked at 200 rpm and 37 °C in a 12-well plate in the VWR – Incubation Microplate Shaker for 1 h. Then, the recovery media was filled up with liquid growth media (2xYT media added with 50 mM K2HPO4, 0.5 mM IPTG, 100 μM isoCmTP, 100 μM isoGTP, 3 μg μL-1 chloramphenicol, and 50 μg μL-1 kanamycin for final concentrations) up to 1 mL and shaked at 600 rpm and 37 °C in a 12-well plate in the VWR – Incubation Microplate Shaker for 48 h. Plasmid isolations were performed for single 1 mL cultures. The high-copy plasmid pSB1K3 BBa_K2201027 was digested by the restriction enzymes PvuI, NsiI und BamHI. The remaining low-copy plasmid pSB3C5 containing the UBP was then prepared for the Oxford Nanopore Sequencing.
With the help of Oxford Nanopore Sequencing we were able to detect the UBP after the in vivo cultivation. Therefore we assume that the retention system is functional. Further replicates would need to be done for a statistical aproved analysis. This experimental seems to be a very promising set-up for the UBP retention in vivo.

Decarboxylation
<p>This week, we were pleased to find ample Nocardia iowensis growth on our BHI plate. We performed a PCR with our constructed CAR and NPT BioBrick primers to attempt to amplify these genes, so that we could insert them into BioBricks. This PCR utilized primers specific to our genes of interest. After running the gel, we found that we had ample amplification of both of these genes, as shown in the picture below:
</html>
In the above gel, lanes 4-5, 7, and 9-12 represent successfully amplifed NPT (669 bp). Lanes 14-16 and 18-20 show that CAR (4690 bp) has been successfully amplifed. Following this, we performed a Cycle-Pure Spin Protocol to purify the amplified CAR and NPT DNA. The resulting concentration of CAR was 171.6 ng/ul, while NPT was 20.8 ng/ul. Using a restriction digest, the CAR gene was cut with AscI and HindIII, while NPT was cut with both XbaI and PstI, as well as with EcorI and PstI. Using these same enzymes, the PET vector was cut to be ligated with CAR, and the PSB1C3 vector was cut to be ligated with both NPT digests. Following incubation, the inserts were ligated together with their vectors. Transformations were then performed, with the CAR/PET ligation transformed on a Kan plate, and the NPT/PSB1C3 E/P and X/P ligations transformed on chloramphenicol plates. Transformations were successful, but there were not a great deal of colonies on the CAR plate, and both NPT plates revealled a very high proportion of red colonies, indicating that our desired NPT gene had not been successfully ligated and transformed. Nonetheless, colony PCRs were run in order to test for successful transformations of the ligations the following week. Meanwhile, the results of the ADC gene sequencing came in, but unfortunately it was found that this gene did not correspond well to its theoretical sequence on PartsRegistry. It therefore could not be used with our AAR gene to produce a PetroBrick. The Washington iGEM team agreed to send us a plasmid stock of their PetroBrick and ADC.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Synthetic Biology_-_-_TEXT.html," the organism.
Let’s begin with the importance of this risk. Mycobacterium avium is sometimes responsible for serious infections in humans. But, as noted by Willy Rozenbaum, ""it is a bacterium that is ubiquitous, it is found in tap water, we are almost all contaminated"" but this contamination has rarely consequential effects. The cases reported involved immunodepressed patients, for example. We also planned to analyze the effects of infection on tumors. Anyway, Willy Rozenbaum believes that ""all that is not very annoying”. In addition to numerous tests and simulations that have to be conducted before the use of our treatment, this statement is justified by the fact that bacteria are lysed when there is a release of the phage, it does not persist in the body.
Francois Le Fevre has legitimately questioned about the possibility that the phage infect other bacteria already present in the organism. We have therefore explained to him that our cell vector encapsidate only the therapeutic plasmid, not its genome. If it infects bacteria of the commensal flora of the organism (which may be limited by changes in protein internalization), the bacteria will receive just the therapeutic plasmid, and the phage will not be able to multiply We can also worry about the drifts, and abuses of the transgene integration, as the risk of homologous recombination or risky integration. Lluis M. Mir supported us about this idea, that our phage is a prokaryote, but cells of human body are eukaryotes. It can therefore be no risk of homologous recombination or integration between its genome and our cells genome, as they do not belong to the same ""world"": ""there is no possible integration. That's the real advantage of being at the crossroads between eukaryotic and prokaryotic.
Furthermore, Willy Rozenbaum reminded ""this type of subject is very well controlled today in terms of security"": the product would obviously not be marketed until being subjected to numerous tests to check its innocuousness. Organizations as Afssaps, in France manage the safety of  health products. If we consider that the risk is not negligible, we must ask whether it is worthwhile to be taken into account. Thierry Magnin gave a translation of the principle of responsibility made by Hans Jonas: ""Before trying to estimate the risk, I'll try to work up on the most serious risk."" Does the targeted disease justify it? According to Bernard Baertschi, ""Cancer is an extremely serious disease, for which we accept to take"

The biggest problem of this design is the salt bridge connecting both chambers. After being submerged in liquid for a while, it tends to become loose and glide out of the centrifugation tube. Furthermore, the construction does not allow for anaerobic operating of the fuel cell.

Connecting single batteries in series can be used to increase the output voltage. Likewise, the film canister stack consists of five film canister cells connected with copper wires in series. Because of the higher voltage generated, it was possible to operate a single low power light-emitting diode, using a high concentrated baker's yeast suspension and the exogenous mediator methylene blue in the anode chamber.

The Second Generation Fuel Cell
This cell was designed with anaerobic operation in mind. The plastic parts needed were ordered from the workshop of the Faculty of Biology at Bielefeld University. The overall design is inspired by the fuel cell proposed by Benetto (Bennetto, 1990). Two frames make up the anode and cathode chamber. They are enclosed by two flat plates, each containing four bores. Threaded rods are put through the bores. The construction is held together by these rods, which have tightly fastened nuts on their ends.
All plastic parts are separated by thin rubber gaskets. A Nafion N117 membrane is placed between the two frames to allow cations to travel between the chambers. The two electrodes were initially cut out of the same carbon tissue as the ones used in the film canister cells. The rims were sown together with extra durable yarn to prevent the material from frazzling. These electrodes were held in place by two plastic parts plugged in each chamber. The copper wire connecting the electrode runs through two holes on the top of each plastic frame.
Initial testing revealed that the carbon cloth electrodes did not seem to be as conductive as expected. For this reason, they were replaced with electrodes made from another kind of carbon material, which were obtained from"

NCOC
NCOC is the main offshore oil and gas developer in Kazakhstan. Their estimated oil production for 2018 is 370,000 barrels per day, which is more than their expected 75,000 barrels per day in 2016 [1]. They have five main fields on the Caspian Sea about 80km from Atyrau city. NCOC faces many safety, logistical and engineering obstacles due to its location. The oil from these fields has high hydrogen sulfide content as well as carbon dioxide. The principle system used for the sour gas treatment is the raw gas re-injection. Their shareholders (KazMunayGas, Eni, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total S.A., China National Petroleum Corporation, Inpex) have been practicing raw gas re-injection in many different environments. This technique has been invented in Canada in 1989 and practiced in 39 projects in the world, including the Karachaganak and Tengiz fields in Kazakhstan. With this process, 80% of sour gas from crude oil is returned to the reservoir, while the rest 20% is generated to produce elemental sulfur. They estimated that 3800 tonnes of sulfur per day will be produced in their project [1].
Our team representatives visited the NCOC head office in Atyrau. During the meeting, we introduced them to iGEM, synthetic biology and we explained our project. They were very responsive as they were interested in our new approach to the bioremediation of sour crude oil wastewater. Even though they were hesitant about the risks of genetically modified organisms, they assured that it has good potential to turn into a commercialized project that they can apply in their wastewater treatments.
Firstly, they were interested in a specific design where our cyanobacteria can carry out the bioremediation of sour crude oil wastewater. We approached this comment by offering an approach that includes keeping the cyanobacteria in a gel-like reservoir, where the wastewater can be pumped in.
Secondly, they were concerned with what will happen to cyanobacteria after it has taken up hydrogen sulfide from the wastewater. We replied that as part of our risk management, we will be using the SuperNova, a variant of KillerRed, which uses Chromophore Assisted Light Inactivation that will lead to self-destruction of the cells at specific wavelengths of light.
For companies like NCOC, the elemental sulfur produced after the treatment of hydrogen sulfide is sold to overseas companies. We proposed a different"

STEM
In November 2015, we helped a fellow colleague organize and run an educational session for high school girls for the Young Women’s STEM Program. This program exposed high school girls to college level cell biology lab activities, current cell biology research, and study strategies. They were introduced to an area of science that has only been touched on briefly in their high school classes. Additionally, they were able to see what someone in the science field does and have female role models demonstrate just that. Each month, girls from high schools in the Milwaukee area had the opportunity to learn about a different scientific subject ranging from Chemistry and Biology to Mathematics and Computer Science. The idea was to push them farther than their high school classes are able and to present them with women who are in that field doing the work. For three hours once a month, these girls did hands-on activities, learned about current research, and met women working in a specific field of science with the field changing at each session. The final activity gave the girls tips and study strategies in order to succeed in the classes that would be necessary for them to pursue these careers for themselves.
WELS Church Poster
Throughout the summer, the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) churches were emailed posters for their bulletin boards that explained the essence of our project and how to register for our summer bioengineering camp. We included our contact information and encouraged questions to be emailed to us. Since we come from a Christian-based college, we strive to educate our fellow Christians on the topics of bioengineering and biotechnology, in such a way as to dispel misunderstandings that are commonly found in the church community.
Homeschool Teacher Surveys
In an effort to reach out to a variety of teachers to help the expansion of biotechnology knowledge, we sent out surveys to homeschool teachers around Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan. After hearing the responses to the surveys, we realized that it is important to make sure that homeschool children have opportunities to experience biotechnology and have access to lab procedures. These opportunities at a young age could ignite an interest in these kids that may determine the path they take when they enter college. Therefore, when we advertised for our Bioengineering Summer Camp we made sure to market our camp to homeschool"
Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Modeling#ParameterEstimation_-_-_TEXT.html," base induction level seem reasonable as it yields plausible expression levels. In addition,             the estimated transcription rate of the GFP1-9 transcript conforms with the other transcription rate constants. Finally, the model managed to fit             the sigmoidal shape indicating that the reaction scheme proposed describe the system well.
h) In a paper from 2013, a tripartite split GFP-association was studied by complementing GFP1-9 with GFP10-SR-GFP11 (SR = sulfite reductase)             fusion protein [6]. The construct was studied in vitro under equimolar amounts of GFP1-9 and GFP10-SR-GFP11 to yield a time-intensity             fluorescence plot. We chose to estimate the association and dissociation rate parameters from the experiments carried out. Since the reactions were             carried out in vitro, we assume that the time frame in which the measurement was carried out (12 hours)  is too short for the proteins to             decompose. In addition, we assume that once a GFP has been associated, it cannot dissociate back into it's respective fragments (this is reasonable             as one does not expect a GFP under mild conditions to spontaneously dissociate into three parts). Also assuming that no side reactions occur and             that everything that can react eventually reacts, the following relation for the concentration $c(t)$ of the complemented protein was derived (see appendix ),              $$c(t) = \begin{cases} G_0  - \frac{G_0}{1 + G_0kt}, & \mbox{if } G_0=E_0 \\             \frac{G_0E_0 - G_0E_0e^{k(G_0-E_0)t}}{E_0 - G_0e^{k(G_0-E_0)t}}, & \mbox{if } G_0\ne E_0 \end{cases} \tag{1}$$              where $G_0$ and $E_0$ are the concentrations of GFP1-9 and GFP10-SR-GFP11 at time $t=0$. At figure 3 in the article, a steady state defined as 95 %             of the asymptotic concentration is reached after approximately 9 hours. As equimolar amounts of proteins were used in the paper ($G_0 = E_0 = 3.5$ µM), we get the expression              $$0.95G_0 = G_0  - \frac{G_0}{1 + 9G_0k}\tag{"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulated promoter is reduced when cloned into a low copy vector compared to a high copy vector.
Proper regulation of the OmpR-dependent promoter, BBa_R0082 , is necessary for the implementation of a functional dormancy system, as the balance between RelE and RelB is imperative. To verify that the OmpR-regulated promoter is up to the task, a reporter system containing RFP under control of the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_M30011 , was cloned into E. coli strain SØ928 ΔOmpR, lacking the OmpR transcription factor, on a high copy vector. By using a ΔOmpR strain, the background generated by stimulation of the intrinsic OmpR system is removed, and the strain functions as a negative control.
RFP expression was assessed by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera, with exposure time for RFP at 200 ms. Assessing the RFP expression by fluorescence microscopy, it was discovered that the OmpR-regulated promoter mediated gene expression even in the absence of its transcription factor, see Figure 17. This observation was confirmed by going through the literature Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Nature. 2005;438(7067):441-2. .
Figure 17. Fluorescence microscopy of RFP controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter on a high copy vector in E. coli strain SØ928 ΔOmpR.
On the basis of this finding, the relE gene controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter required a low copy plasmid or insertion into the chromosome. Protein expression of RFP in pSB1C3 with a copy number of 100-300 plasmids per cell, and pSB3K3 with a copy number of 10-12 plasmids per cell, was studied by flow cytometry. As for the determination of noise levels in the weak, BBa_J23114 , and strong BBa_J23102 constitutive promoters, , the experiment was carried out in both LB medium and M9 minimal medium, the latter supplemented with 0.2% glycerol. In the LB medium, selection was carried out by the addition of 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 30 µg/mL kanamycin, or 50 µg/mL ampicillin, depending on the resistance, and for M9"

Cooperation with Trieste
Like us, Trieste's team this year are using the BioBrick BBa_K392008 . This part by Osaka 2010 encodes a cellulase, β-glucosidase, from the bacterium Cellulomonas fimi. It is known to work in the lab of Chris French (Edinburgh's supervisor).
Chris French sent Trieste a copy of the plasmid, however they reported some sequence errors and asked us for comments. We sequenced the gene independently and discovered that an apparent frameshift is present near the start of the BioBrick. This very same ""frameshift"" was seen in Trieste's sequencing results.
Since a part with an early frameshift cannot possibly work, but the part does work, we looked for an explanation. Some 220 bases into the part, a second ATG codon is found. This codon is in-frame and there is a plausible ribosome binding site (containing ""gaagga"") just upstream of it. We therefore believe that this second ATG is the true start codon. The RBS would explain why the part can be expressed and work.
Here is the start of the sequence, with these features highlighted:

[rest omitted]
In agreement with this hypothesis, a recently published sequence of C. fimi β-glucosidase (labelled as such by Expasy though NCBI calls it a β-galactosidase) starts at the 2nd ATG codon of K392008. This is in contrast to an older published sequence .
We passed this information on to the Trieste team, who agreed that it is a likely explanation.
In addition to this, at the request of the Trieste team we sent details of an assay that can be used to test for activity of this β-glucosidase"

Okay, I admit it! I have no clue what this synthetic biology is all about. I don’t know what RNA is, and I can’t tell you what protein has to do with it. But, what I do know, is how to redesign a wiki page, and how to present complicated academical stuff in a way that is easy to understand. And the fact that I don’t have any kind of biotech knowledge actually just made this task a lot easier.

UNIPV-Pavia,2010,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Pavia#Past_-_-_TEXT.html," Papia, combining both Latin names.
Under the Goths, Pavia became a fortified citadel and their last bulwark in the war against Belisarius. After the Lombards' conquest, Pavia became the capital of their kingdom (AD. 568-774). During the Rule of the Dukes, it was ruled by Zaban. It continued to function as the administrative centre of the kingdom, but by the reign of Desiderius, it had deteriorated as a first-rate defensive work and Charlemagne took it in the Siege of Pavia (June, 774) assuming the kingship of the Lombards. Pavia remained the capital of the Italian Kingdom and the centre of royal coronations until the diminution of imperial authority there in the twelfth century. In 1004 Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor bloodily suppressed a revolt of the citizens of Pavia, who disputed his recent crowning as King of Italy.
In the 12th century Pavia acquired the status of a self-governing commune. In the political division between Guelphs and Ghibellines that characterizes the Italian Middle Ages, Pavia was traditionally Ghibelline, a position that was as much supported by the rivalry with Milan as it was a mark of the defiance of the Emperor that led the Lombard League against the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who was attempting to reassert long-dormant Imperial influence over Italy.
Visconti Castle
In the following centuries Pavia was an important and active town. Under the Treaty of Pavia, Emperor Louis IV granted during his stay in Italy the Palatinate to his brother Duke Rudolph's descendants. Pavia held out against the domination of Milan, finally yielding to the Visconti family, rulers of that city in 1359; under the Visconti Pavia became an intellectual and artistic centre, being the seat from 1361 of the University of Pavia founded around the nucleus of the old school of law, which attracted students from many countries.
The Battle of Pavia (1525) marks a watershed in the city's fortunes, since by that time, the former cleavage between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party (allied with the Pope) and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain Charles V. Thus during the Valois-Habsburg Italian Wars, Pavia was naturally on the Imperial (and Spanish) side. The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713"

Acid Resistance
The main goal of this part of our project is to enable our E. Coli we used to eradicate H. Pylori to become acid resistant in order to live in gastric juice's low pH (pH:2) microenvironment. Wild-type E. coli already have couple systems to show acid resistance up to a certain pH level (pH: 5). Among those systems, the most stable-working and efficient one is known as Glutamate Dependent Acid Resistance(GDAR) system. The most important protein of Gad system is GadE, which controls the synthesis of all other proteins. By overexpressing this protein, we aim to have our bacteria resistant enough to live in gastric juice for a while.
Background
Escherchia coli Natural Acid Resistance System
E. coli possesses four phenotypically distinct systems of acid resistance. These systems:
1. Glutamate dependent acid resistance system (GDAR)
2. Arginine dependent acid resistance system (ADAR)
3. Lysine dependent acid resistance system (LDAR)
4. Ornithine dependent acid resistance system (ODAR)
The most effective one of these systems is the glutamate dependent system so we decided to focus on glutamate dependent system (GDAR).
The GDAR system has in the acid resistance complex pathways. We decided to do the certain pathways that how to do acid resistance with our results of research.
EvgA is the most effective positive regulator of GDAR. (Efficiency: evgA>ydeO>gadE) But evgA takes part in countless number different genes regulation and cellular processes (2,6,7) and also most of this cellular processes are unclear. We cannot predict the results of the overexpression of evgA so we chose gadE and using by overexpression of gadE we can induce glutamate depended acid resistance system.
Briefly talk about the impact of the GadE on the mechanism.
The central activator is the LuxR-family member GadE (formerly known as YhiE). GadE binds"

Monday 9th – Tuesday 10th
SULSA! The week kicked off with the two day SULSA conference held here in Edinburgh. This was a really great experience. We got to meet the other three Scottish iGEM teams [LINKS], Kim de Mora from iGEM HQ, and lots of professionals in the field of Synthetic Biology who presented their work on the second day. We also got to present our idea to the world for the first time.
Wednesday 11th
Today we focused mainly on filling out the kind of overdue safety form, and also started handing out official roles within the group. The wiki was begun today, though nothing was uploaded yet, and we got to see our lab for the very first time.
Thursday 12th
Our first meeting of any real organisation was today, thanks to Chiara. The main outcome of this meeting was the role allocation. Philip is the ‘Trello man,’ Sam and Rikki are responsible for the wiki, Carrie and Charlotte are safety officers, Sam and Charlotte are the tweetsters, Chiara is the secretary, Philip and Elize are in charge of organising collaborations, Yuma is the Google Drive organiser.
We also started looking at organising the scientific aspects of the project. The Biologists broke into three teams to look at finding metabolic wires, creating IPD circuits, and looking at the population control aspect.
Finally, Philip also worked on trying to get funding for the iGEM meetup in Oxford later this month – we may be able to get SULSA funding (is there anything they can’t do?).
Friday 13th
We were given a tour of our lab by Jon today, who wisely advised us not to injure ourselves whilst in the lab. We also continued with experiment plans and started looking into wiki design.
We had two excellent pieces of input from actual professionals today also. First of all, Maryia Trubitsyna came to explain how her now paperclip method of parts assembly works and left us really excellent notes. And secondly, Yuma and Cesar attended an Informatics forum and gave a surprise presentation of the project.

After taking of the spotting mask and washing with PBS, slides were kept in fridge (4°) under wet conditions.
Measuring: No specific antigen/antibody binding could be detected (see graph of the binding curves). Anti-GFP signal (positive control) was good. Strep-Cy5 signal (which bound to the biotinylated a-GFP aswell) was good. Yet, the presents of the (not His-tagged) bBSA –> unspecific binding. Anti-His binding revealed that at least Tetanus and Salmonella antigen (or something with a His-Tag) are present on the slide.  Unfortunately, the monoclonal antibodies do not bind to the expressed and spotted antigens. In case of HIV and HCV also the concentration of the antigen might be limiting.

For each antigen, 330 µl of antibody solution was run over the slide during the measurement. To assure good binding, an excess of antibody was used (20 µg/ml instead of the normally sufficient 5 µg/ml)

Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me. The carriage held but just ourselves and immortality.
What’s the connection between porcelain and STEP? We came to a workshop and made a STEP plate with our own hands. As a traditional Chinese art, it contains philosophy from our ancestor. Round and smooth, the porcelain plate serves people as a container, while it would easily hurt us when broken into pieces. Just like our system, it’s never easy to create one and make it serve the public for the right purpose.
Ethical, Social and Political Considerations
When developing a therapeutic project for cancer, it’s not only the technical issues that need to concern about, but also ethical and political issues. Though China have earned a large number of research achievements in the field of cellular immunotherapy, till now, none has been approved or applied in clinical treatment.  The question stays on in our mind- why there is a lack of ethical and political considerations in China, regarding this new therapy? What can we do to make a change? For this purpose, we stepped out of the lab, contacting professionals in the field of ethic and policy, to find out the answer. Also, Dr. Xu, an oncologist of Fudan Univ. Cancer Hospital, explained the approving process of current clinical trial of cellular immunotherapy to us. What’s more, we received a phone call from National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, after contacting them by e-mail, which explains the regulations we concerned about.   In our meeting with Dr. Jie Yin(link), an expert in medical ethic, she admitted that the main issue concerned with our project is safety, considering its high cost and risk. Thus the government will give top priority to its approval. For the particularity of cancer patients who are at the end of their life, cellular immunotherapy served as a last resort. Patients flooded into it, striving for a chance to survive. We were reminded that there are certain clinical indications that need to be satisfied before a clinical trial, which made us reflect on a fairer distribution of medical resources.   In China, collective consciousness always plays the leading role on the historical and social stage, covering the light of Spirituality Concern on the value of individual life. Compared with the unprecedented hot market, the lack of ethical consciousness should receive more attention. We called for the existence of humanity in this “technology & market first” society, truly benefiting every single patient.
Just in early October, we received an official phone call from National Health Commission , answering our concerns in the e-mail. Its official firmly declared"

We are invited to test the front end of the project of the team HFUT-China for finding bugs and fix them.                     We found six bugs and design flaws.
We found that the wrong email domain name is passed while registering, and we were unable to log out                         after login. Besides, the error message is not obvious.
The page is unable to save the login cookies. When we logged in and open a new window, however, still                         showed no login.
Search algorithms need to be optimized. For instance, when we search the team USTC, XMU is on the top                         list, and there was even no USTC-Software.
The Brand button on the search page didn’t work.
There is no search engine in the Gene Relationship page.
In the Gene info interface, Gene Relationship button should be active (green), but it's actually red.
Team USTC
USTC has been one of our traditional collaborators.
Focusing on the establishment and improvement of a online synthetic biology community this year, USTC, as                     potential users of our bio-hub, offered us opinions and needs in application design and homepage design.                     For example, they suggested adding an online forum named ""iGEMers' Notebook"" in which iGEMers can exchange                     important information and ideas concerning this competition .They also helped us with biological problems                     we came across, such as the biological background of comparative sequence analysis.
In return, we share them with some useful tricks. And we also help them in website making and modeling, which                     speed their work greatly. Besides, we held the annual Science and Technology Week and Science and Technology                     Exhibition, which spread the synthetic knowledge to the public.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Parts#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,"P expression test by western blot. The two PCR products were digested with Nde I / BamH I, or BamH I / Xho I and cloned into Nde I / Xho I -digested pET 21a, which contains a region encoding six histines, in one step to construct pET 21a – mbp , which was verified by DNA sequencing.
Expression Experiment and Function Test:
To test the function of this part, both expression experiment and function test is necessary. We have verified the size of the expressed proteins with SDS-page and Western blot. Besides, to test the efficiency of mercury binding, we also carried out the function test with ICP-AES with the mercury gradient from 10^-8M to 10^-6M.
Results:
Expression of proteins
The plasmid PET21a-mbp is transferred to E.coli strain BL21, which can generate T7polyerase when induced with IPTG. Both induced cells and uninduced cells(as control) are centrifuged to get the cytosol, the periplasm and the membrane separated. The SDS-page and Western blot of the expressed proteins show that induced cells expressed an identical IPTG-inducible protein at the proper place with the size of ~12kD which consists with the predicted size, indicating that the engineered MBP can be expressed in the cytosol.
The specific band in western blot for his-tag fused MBP of about 12 kD confirmed that the MBP is expressed as expected. Considerable amount of MBP expressed in cytosol can be indicated from the result of SDS-PAGE.
Function test
Having made sure that the protein can express normally in the cytosol, the function tests experiment are carried out with ICP-AES. To test the efficiency of mercury absorption of MBP in different concentration of mercury, the concentration gradient of lead is set from 10^-7M to 10^-5M （the results are not shown in the following figure). The results of the efficiency of different parts containing MBP(lead) is shown here. It is apparent that under the concentration of 10^-5M,there is a notable absorption of lead compared to the control. What's more, the device containing three parts are more efficient than the parts alone.

First, he questioned about the efficiency of using cell-free system to complete a series of reactions and the extremely low concentration of ctDNA in patient’s blood. Then, he also concerned about applying our design onto a screening chip instead of other product forms such as a detection kit. After that, we exchanged our opinions on those questions with Dr. Fang Zhengyu. It is greatl to have others opinion on our project. Dr. Fang’s suggestions helped us improve the design of our product and we decided to carry out further experiments to teat the efficiency of the screening paper.
Product portfolio
Abstract
According to our investigation above, there are already all kinds of ctDNA detecting services existed in the market. Therefore, it is hard to compete with those developed products. Our well designed paper chip has its own unique selling points which can open up a new small market. It is aiming to provide a fast and efficient method to detect ctDNA in individuals, leading to an early diagnosis of lung cancer or a monitor on cancer recurrence.

Toulouse,2014,Team:Toulouse#Result#experimental-results_-_-_TEXT.html," the sequencing results for these constructs showed several discrepancies with the original designed sequence.
Inhibition halos are not visible with supernatants, probably because of either low concentrations or of instability in the extracellular medium.  Another effect was noted with the same strains expressing D4E1 and GAFP-1 + D4E1 on another fungus, Aspergillus brasiliensis (figure 22). This effect is comparable to the one previously noted with a low concentration of copper sulfate  (figure 21).
Figure 22: Results with transformed bacteria.
After this set of experiments, the strains expressing D4E1 or GAFP-1 + D4E1 have been shown to be the best candidates to play a major role in the fight against fungal diseases such as Canker stain. Keeping in mind our objective, we decided to tests these strains in model plants: Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. These tests were performed in association with Sylvain Raffaële and Marielle Barascud in the National Institute for the Agronomic Research.
3. In planta tests with SubtiTree
Figure 23: Injection of antifungal Bacillus subtilis in a model plant
The goal of the project is to introduce the transformed bacteria in a diseased tree. So it is necessary to perform preliminary in planta tests to judge the fungus-killing abilities of the two strains selected after the previous sets of experiments. The strain expressing fungicides was first inoculated in two model plants (Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana). After this step, a phytopathogenic fungus (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) was placed on the leaves.
Twenty-four hours after SubtiTree inoculation, no phenotypic modification of the leaves could be detected. We can conclude that our bacterium, its introduction and the fungicides production in plants do not have deleterious effects. Without proper treatment, the drop of the phytopathogenic fungus on Nicotiana benthamiana leaves caused a necrosis halo which could be measured after 40 h. The  number of necrotic sites and the lesion sizes appeared reduced by B. subtilis expressing DE41 or GAFP1-D4E1, unlike the WT bacterium. Two independant replicate of this experiments were performed successfully
We did not observe any significant results for Arabidopsis thaliana because of the use of two plants batches with different ages. We can therefore conclude that when SubtiTree is in plant's physiological conditions, it is harmless to the plant"

The star peptide- model results
The resulting relationship suggested that diffusion rate (defined as 1⁄t_end ) was proportional to 1⁄r^2 . In addition to this, we predict that the relative likelihood of a substrate colliding will an enzyme will decrease as the distance between the enzymes’ active sites increase. This will likely follow a 1⁄r^2  relationship if we consider the fact the likelihood of collision is inversely proportional to the fraction of the surface area of a sphere of the distance r that the enzyme occupies. Thus, we predict that the overall rate-distance relationship will take the form:
reaction rate ∝  1⁄(peptide length)^4
Thus, the smaller the distance of separation, the higher we expect the rate of reaction to be. However, we must note that this model does not take into consideration stearic hindrances and instabilities that set in when the peptide is made too small. Furthermore, the model is only valid for a minimum radius which is defined as the sum of the two enzyme radii.
The normalized rate against star protein length results yielded by the model imply that reaction rate is proportional to peptide length^-4.

Calibrating the stochastic diffusion model
To make our stochastic model realistic, we had to calibrate it against known diffusion distributions from Fick’s Law. The exact solution to Fick’s law suggests that the concentration spread will follow a Gaussian (Normal) distribution such that:
Calculation of the diffusion constant of formaldehyde in cytoplasm proved difficult to find through literature. Thus, a theoretical value had to be substituted. From standard databases, the diffusion constant of formaldehyde in water is given as 2*(10^-5) cm^2 s^(-1).
Through comparison with this Gaussian, we could then calibrate our stochastic model to achieve maximum closeness of fit defined by:
The parameter being varied in the stochastic models is defined as ‘w0’- the relative likelihood of a molecule staying still within a certain time period, dt, rather than diffusing a pre-defined distance h. By varying w0 and calculating the median accuracy, we have identified the variable set [w0, h, dt] as [29, 0.25nm, 0.25ns] gives the closest resemblance to deterministic laws and"

We tried to construct the TetR without the LVA-tag, 3 PCRs were made.
PCR 1 consisted of template 2:2P, primer yellow#5 and yellow#6.
PCR 2 consisted of template from previous made PCR2 and primers yellow#5 and yellow#7.
PCR 3 consisted of template 2:24D, primer yellow#8 and yellow#9.
Standard operating procedure was used for creating the 3 reactions with 50µL. Our gel was odd, which turned out to be caused by mixing two different gel mixs. However, we were still able to cut out the bands anyhow , and they seemed to be okay. The gels were purified as the SOPs described. We had to stop our work here, since we lacked enzymes and were therefore not able to digest the PCR products.

Other E. coli strains also have same gene, but this K-12 strain’s Ag43 cause the most rapid aggregation compared with other strain’s Ag43 [2]. Typical auto-transporter domains: signal peptides, N-proximal passenger domain (α43 : processing sites), autochaperon domain and C-terminal β-barrel domain (β43 : translocation unit) are found in the protein. These domains promote cell-to-cell auto-aggregation through the intermediate function.
Fig. 4  Structure of Ag43 domain. This image is referenced from [1]. 5 motifs: RGD (orange), aspartyl protease (green), leucine zipper (pink), P-loop (blue) and another RGD (purple) exist in Ag43 complex.
Signal peptide is present at the N-terminus of this protein and translated with α43 and β43. In the presence of this signal, polypeptides consisted of other domains can cross from inner membrane to outer membrane. β43 is mainly composed of β-barrel structure. Some of membrane protein, particularly auto-transporter family has this domain which inserts into the outer membrane to work as anchor for passenger domain, and as pathway that allows passenger domain to cross from periplasm to outer membrane. Another domain which exists in the β43, the auto-chaperon domain stabilizes in near the outer pore of β-barrel then the domain associates folding of secreted passenger domain. α43 has β-helical structure and some identified motifs, e.g., aspartyl protease site, a leucine zipper motif and RGD motif. But none of the motifs are conserved in all agn43 alleles.(Fig. 4) That means the motifs does not play a functional role but plays a role in the structural integrity [2].

The actual secretional function of Ag43 is not still known. But about AIDA-I, One of the auto-transporter protein belonging to same group as Ag43, it is said that the AIDA-I passenger domain is auto-catalytically cleaved from complex with β-barrel and autochaperon after secreted, then remain on the outside of cell membrane with non-covalently bound to translocator β-barrel structure.

Preface
This page comprehensively discusses the various aspects of our initial therapeutic delivery design idea, the AlgiBeads. Our subsequent and final delivery idea, the microbiome-modification design, can be found here , along with its safety considerations here .
Introduction
Following on from all of the safety research we conducted, we put that knowledge into designing a catheter in order to get our proteins (DNase and DspB) into the urinary tract where we want them.
Designing a novel method of getting our bacteria into the urinary tract was a major consideration during the beginning stages of our project. The most effective approach would probably be to deliver our bacteria directly through the catheter into the bladder. However, we found that the biofilm also forms on the outside of the catheter, so in our design we attempted to fight the biofilm from both outside and within.
The ability to disperse biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant bacteria adds a major new weapon to the limited arsenal of therapies available today.
Neville Kallenbach
Professor of Chemistry at New York University NYC
While our bacteria could potentially be applied industrially in various pipes to tackle a growing world problem with biofilms, we instead decide to focus our efforts on a medical application for them. We chose to tackle the problem of urinary tract infections as a member of our team, George Driscoll, had seen first hand the extreme impact it can have on people’s lives – especially women.
Our catheter would have a three-pronged attack on the biofilm. Firstly it would be able to eliminate the biofilm forming in the lining of the bladder, then prevent biofilm from forming on the outside of the catheter itself, and finally by attacking the biofilm trying to form on the inside walls of the catheter.
Our initial research into the current designs of catheter began online, where we began to get a better understanding of the scale we were working with. We looked into the problems of insertion, removal and general life with having a catheter in place. Throughout the design process we constantly kept these issues in mind"

Site-directed mutagenisis using overlapping primers
This protocol consists of a tw-step PCR reaction. Mutagenic primers were designed as for the stratagene method. Additionally, forward and reverse primers contining the biobrick prefix and suffix were designed.
PCR reactions using Pfupolymerase was set up. For PCR- A, primers consisted on the forward/prifix primer and the reverse/mutagenic primer. PCR-B consisted of forward/mutagenic primer and reverse/suffix primer. Thus, PCR-A amplified the part upstreamof the mutation site and PCR-B the downstream part of the mutation site f the gene.
The PCR reaction was then run on a gel and the DNA gel extracted. For the second PCR, 2µl of each PCR was added to a mastermix without primers and PCR amplified for 10 cycles. The DNA templates contain overlapping regions which self-prime allowing for extension of the full length of the gene, creating tempate DNA.
After the 10 cycles, primers for the outer regions are added. This ensures amplification of the full gene.

Background on Last Year's Project
The following diagram summarizes the process used to synthesize a DNA sequence using the Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT).  TdT is an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the three prime end of a DNA molecule.  The idea of creating a DNA synthesizer using this enzyme was originally conceived by Ud-Dean et al. in the paper a theoretical model for template-free synthesis of long DNA sequence[1].  Our project builds off of and improves this idea in a number of ways.  One such improvement was the idea of using heat-labile nucleotides.  Heat-labile nucleotides are nucleotides with a blocking group on their three prime end that prevents polymerases like TdT from adding to them.  Conveniently, this blocking group falls off of the nucleotide when it is heated, thus the name heat-labile.  By using heat-labile nucleotides, TdT can add a single base pair at a time.  By cycling the heating, washing, and addition of different nucleotides in the proper order any sequence can be created.
Project Description for Biological Components
The biology component of our project focused on two main concepts crucial to the functioning of the complete device.  The first of these was to test the idea of bonding DNA to a glass microscope slide as a means of preventing it from being lost in wash steps.  We also sought to characterize different variants of Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) to find one best suited for the synthesizer.  A third but less pursued topic of study was the possibility of making a heat stable TdT variant using an intein system to circularize the enzyme.
We considered a number of chemical means by which one can bind DNA to glass [2].  The system we chose involved bonding DNA with a five prime thiol modified group to a silanized glass slide.  This method was chosen because the silanization process could be carried out in-house and adding a modified thiol group to the five prime end of DNA is a relatively inexpensive modification.  The methodology was based on a paper by Rogers et al. at Johns Hopkins [3].  After the reaction is complete, the DNA should"

Competitors
Currently, monitoring in the oil and gas industry is performed through both short- and long-term collection methods with samples then being shipped to an external lab for testing. This process requires transportation costs, sample processing, and wait times in which the composition of a sample can change dramatically. In addition, trained technicians are required who can operate expensive analytical lab equipment. Traditional Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can cost upwards of $500 a sample to prepare and run on the equipment. Intensive sample preparation is also required, increasing both cost and testing time. Current testing regimes require multiple sample collections and tests per site to allow for proper analysis. Though these analytical technologies are highly rigorous, their cost, need for highly trained personnel, as well as sample transport make it unrealistic to meet the changing regulatory market for increased spot-test monitoring sites planned by recent legislation. We do not wish to, nor can we compete directly with this highly analytical technology, however our system provides an advantage in that sites can be pre-screened. This allows samples to be screened for toxicity both rapidly and on-site, following which samples containing toxins or some level of significant change from baseline can then be sent for further processing if highly analytical data is needed.
Biosensor technology does exist in the industry to provide a faster alternative to these traditional analytical detection methods when a simple output as to the presence of a toxin in the sample is required. The major system used by the industry currently is a technology known as Microtox®. This system uses a naturally luminescent bacteria to which an environmental sample is added. If the sample contains a toxin, the bacteria will slow in growth or die, causing a decrease in luminescence which can then be read on a spectrophotometer or luminometer.
Figure 7: The Microtox® system uses a luminescent bacteria.  When a toxic water sample is added into the device, bacterial death occurs and the luminosity of the solution is reduced.  This allows the user to determine toxicity based on the rate of death in the sample.
This test is mainly done in a laboratory environment. Although a portable version does exist and can provide results within a 30 minute time window, there are numerous concerns associated with its reliability. A similar test, ToxTrak™, is also available in both a laboratory and portable version, though bacterial survival and respiration is measured by addition of a chemical that is utilized during respiration"

In our case, the linear program was solved in COBRA, which uses a simplex algorithm by default. 8 The objective function and constraints were based on the most recent SBML model of Y. lipolytica. 5 REFERENCE Further mathematical details are omitted.
Using Phenotype Phase Planes to Explore Growth and Production in Different Environments
The Phenotype Phase Plane is a great way to explore target flux (e.g. growth rate or product secretion rate), as a function of two fluxes, in our case, carbon source uptake rate and oxygen uptake rate. This allows us to predict how Y. lipolytica grows using different Carbon(C) sources and different availability of the C source and oxygen. This kind of dual-variable (C and O2) flux investigation  is called Phenotype Phase Plane(PHPP) analysis, it predicts the growth rate (or product fluxes, depending on your goal) in different cultivation environments 2 . We can then find clues on how environment affects fluxes, and identify what conditions are favoured by Y. lipolytica. If we change the substrates in the medium to wastes, we can see how much growth behaviour changes.
There are multiple feasible solutions to a FBA problem, Not all of these solution have a biological counterpart. However, there are regions in the solution space over which the rate of shadow prices are constant. These regions or phases have been shown to resemble real phenotypes 2 . For some uptake rate combinations, we have infeasible phenotype, this means this combination of uptake rates cannot satisfy the constraints, this maybe due to inability to satisfy ATP maintenance energy.
We produced phenotype phase planes for Y. lipolytica using different carbon sources. This allow us to see what substrates paired with what oxygen level makes better growth.

XMU-China interviewed a dean of a hospital who told us some valuable knowledge of clinical medicine and analysed the practicability of our project. Also, we interviewed some professors, students, passers-by and so on. Some simple questions were asked and their answers helped us to have a clearer understanding of what the most citizens have known. People who were interviewed knew new things in return.

Class
XMU-China had a class at Hengcuo Primary school, which made us kind of amazed of what a good basic knowledge children already had. We believed that this phenomenon stood for China being in a right way for primary education. We asked ten questions about basic health knowledge, if kids answered right, they would be awarded. What’s more, we created a scene play which is about an ill girl and bacteria in her body. This class was a success, which was enjoyed by the students very much. We borrowed costumes and gained help from Fenghuanghua student community, with whom we enjoyed that afternoon.

Gel Extraction of 3kb band #2
Experimentor : Liz Geum
Aim : To run and extract at 3kb band in order to acquire a purified insert and improve efficiency of ligation into X/S-cut vector. This is our second attempt.
Results : There were three bands present: brightest at 1.1kb and faint bands at 2kb and 3kb. 3kb band was gel extracted and spun down at maximum rpm for 10 minutes in purification columns acquired from Ray. The insert was quantified at 7.0ng/ul.

Aim : To amplify the region between VF2 and VR to confirm the presence of 3kb insert in the vector.
Results : 20 white colonies were picked after GFP screening. All colonies showed small bands of ~200 base pairs, and no 3kb band was present. Also, the no-insert control plate showed just as many white colonies as the other plate. We concluded that there was a very high self-ligation at X and S cutsites in the vector, which outruns the 3kb stitched part to be inserted into the vector. Therefore, we decided to design new primers that will add the additional PstI cutsite at 3' end of our PCR 2 products.

UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#The Game_-_-_TEXT.html," contained inside the plasmids pCOL and controlled by the promoter PSOS that responds to a variety of agents such as UV-light, physical agents and stress.
Team Heidelberg tells in its webpage:
“The immunity gene is under the regulation of two promoters, the PSOS of the colicin operon, and its own constitutive promoter that allows a constitutive production of the immunity protein. This ensures that there is no free colicin inside the cytoplasm, which would kill the host cell. The separated constitutive promoter is located within the structural gene of nuclease colicins. There is no immunity gene in operons encoding pore-forming (ionophoric) colicins: It is located on the opposite DNA strand of the intergenetic space between the colicin and the lysis structural gene and is transcribed from its own promoter under constitutive regulation. The last gene of the colicin operon encodes for the lysis protein, which is controlled by the same promoter as the colicin production. Due to the terminator localized downstream of the colicin gene, the lysis protein is expressed in lower amounts than the colicins. After reaching a certain threshold of lysis protein the host cell is lysed which leads to the release of colicins into the medium.”
Next figures shows the biobrick made by Team Heidelberg.
Colicin E1 operon which contains a colicin with pore-forming activity.
Colicin E9 operon which contains a colicin with nuclease activity.
In Research, you need to gather the pieces of DNA that will form the recombinant plasmid, and all this while you are learning about synthetic biology.
The final structure of the plasmid is:
An inducible promoter  (Para) is needed in order to liberate the colicins inside the termite and no before. Tnos is the terminator. T7 is a strong constitutive promoter that is needed to express the immunity protein, in order to protect the host from the toxin while is producing it. The RBS used, the Ribosome Binding Site, belongs to the Anderson RBS family of partregistry (8) . This is a constitutive RBS family that is suitable for prokaryotes, specially for E. coli. It could be chosen, for example, BBa_J61100.
To maximize the effectiveness of the process, a High copy plasmid is used.To get a fast response, you have to work with Escherichia coli: the model bacteria. It also is"
Michigan,2017,Team:Michigan#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", these bacteria could escape into the outside environment and cause infection among civilians. More concerning is the possibility that environmental bacteria may obtain the methicillin resistance gene by horizontal gene transfer. If these bacteria contained our proposed kill switch, they would perish soon after leaving the temperature-controlled environment, greatly reducing the chance of infection or resistance plasmid transfer.
Parts
Our proposed switch design uses a temperature sensitive genetic circuit that relies on the temperature dependent repressor TlpA36, and three proteins isolated from the T4 bacteriophage; T4 endolysin, T4 holin, and T4 antiholin.
TlpA36
It is a temperature-dependent promoter/repressor system first created and characterized in Tunable thermal bioswitches for in vivo control of microbial therapeutics (Piraner et. al. 2016). It is a mutant version of a repressor found naturally in Salmonella typhlmurium. The TlpA36 protein will strongly repress any gene downstream of the TlpA promoter, but will undergo a drastic deformation in the narrow temperature range of 37C to 45C. Within this range, the gene downstream of the promoter will be expressed since it is not being repressed by the deformed TlpA36. The repressor protein itself is under the control of a sigma 70 constitutive promoter making its expression independent of temperature.
T4 Endolysin
It is a lysozyme that lyses a bacterial cell from the inside. It does this by degrading the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, exposing the bacteria to the extracellular environment and killing it. Its activity can be improved by the presence of T4 holin, a protein that opens pores in the cell membrane and wall, allowing lysozymes such as endolysin to degrade the cell wall faster. T4 holin is repressed in the presence of T4 antiholin, which binds to T4 holin’s soluble domain. This in turn reduces T4 endolysin’s potency.
T4 Holin
It is a protein isolated from the T4 bacteriophage that lyses a bacterial cell from the inside. T4 holin opens pores in the cell membrane and wall, allowing lysozymes to degrade the cell.
T4 Antiholin
It is a protein isolated from the T4 bacteriophage that prevents cell lysis due to T4 holin by binding to T4 holin’s soluble domain. In nature T-even phages produce T4 antiholin to delay the destruction of"

We would be lying, if we stated everything worked the first time. We made hundreds of agar plates, replica plated thousands of plates, and we ran the same PCR many times before finding the right annealing temperature. But that being said, we have learned from our mistakes and  it has helped us connect as a team. We are therefore proud to say:
We established a platform for MAGE in Bacillus subtilis.
We engineered a NRPS using MAGE in Bacillus subtilis to make a new product.
We tested the first generation of our high throughput screening.
We improved characterization of a BioBrick and explored uses of inteins for production of short synthetic peptides.

Fig. 1 Post-elution primer amplification of Magnabind beads with the 3-mer construct consisting of Initiator-AB-BC-CA-Terminator. The expected product is ~400 bp long. No band is present at 400 bp.
The smear at 100 bp likely corresponds to primer dimers.
Perhaps we should conduct one more test with more controls.
This might be a bead problem, where the beads are not binding to the DNA.
Tomorrow, test binding entire IABCT construct onto beads, then amplifying."
Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," this idea, the iGEM Team KU Leuven started a translation center and asked all teams to participate. Each team uploaded its project description and translated other project descriptions into their mother tongue. This is a first step towards simplification and easier communication with the general public because one barrier, namely the language barrier, can be overcome with the translation center. We translated several project descriptions into German and could thereby hopefully contribute to a better communication between scientists and a broad public.
Postcards
Participating in the Postcard campaign of Duesseldorf-Cologne was a real success. Thanks to the inspiring and eye-catching designs of all postcards we started talks about synthetic biology, GMOs and other issues addressed by over 36 postcards we received.
No Science without Tolerance
Respect is an essential iGEM value and tolerance an important aspect of it. We were thus very happy to support the tolerance campaign by iGEM Team Technion (Israel). All our creativity was used to draw this lab-associated tolerance lettering and we can hopefully contribute to draw more attention to the fundamental value of tolerance in the scientific community and in public.

Team Newcastle '17 Presents...
Biosensor genetic networks are typically encoded on a single plasmid within a single chassis. However, this configuration can create stress on the host organism as they have to express the entire network, and the biosensor can not be easily modified or re-purposed for new applications.
To alleviate these problems, we propose that biosensor networks are split into three whole-cell modules; a detector, a processor, and a reporter.
With this in mind, we have created the 'Sensynova Biosensor Development Framework'. This framework separates each module into individual cells which communicate via quorum sensing molecules. This separation creates an off-the-shelf set of cellular modules that can be mixed to form new biosensor applications and configurations. This approach also enables biosensor variants to be made and tested without the need for long and tedious genetic cloning steps.
We have also included an optional 'adapter' module. To learn more about our framework, go to our project description page!

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Webster highlighted that farmers may consider the time taken to inoculate the plants more costly than applying fertiliser and recommended we consider using our product as a seed coating.
This influenced our wetware as from here our focus switched to coating sterile seeds with our bacteria in order to inoculate the seedling as it grows.
Endophyte Isolation:
Talks with Tom Webster (CTO at GrowUp Urban Farms) highlighted concerns about the localisation of the endophyte within the plant. We had not considered the issues with the GMO being present in the leaves/fruit of the plant.
This impacted our wetware in that we no longer attempted to re-isolate endophytes from just the roots, from this point we cut roots and leaves separately to re-isolate endophytes. In the event of the endophyte being present in the fruit it is possible for future work to engineer the bacterium to remain localised in the root.
Safety Considerations
We had a Skype meeting with Chris Tapsall, Research Director at KWS Seeds . KWS are one of the top 5 biggest seed producers in the world. The meeting was eye-opening, we discussed consumers views towards the use of GMOs in crop production and how some markets may be more accepting of our product than others. We also talked about the importance of transparency when it comes to marketing a product in relation to the use of genetically modified material.
We learnt about certain EU regulations and alternative applications for our bacteria (i.e. methods in which a manufacturer could apply our bacteria to a seed). Chris was passionate about our project and forwarded our information to other researchers in KWS.
Please see our Safety Page for more information on how we designed our urban farm to comply with safety standards.
Consumer Views
When eating at a local restaurant, one of our team members noticed the small print at the bottom of the menu (see below). The small print assures customers that none of their food products contain ‘genetically modified materials.’ This made us question whether consumers would want to eat food grown with our bacteria.
Products grown within our proposed urban farm would be different to the traditional genetically modified crops in the sense that our crops wouldn’t be genetically modified at all – but the bacteria that colonise the roots would be. As a result, we think that this would make consumers more comfortable about eating products grown in this way.
To further our understanding about consumer views and how best to market our product we invited Food Nation to visit us at the University. Food Nation is a social enterprise based in Newcastle with a vision to inspire people about good food, they have extensive knowledge about consumers views"

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," sigma factor and a series of promoters for completing the feedback loop (P_(σ^W )) and for recognising the inducer (P_bad). P_tet is an optional component that adds another layer of regulation and makes their circuit even more tunable. In Figure 3 (right), the bifurcation plot shows transition between the states that is tuned by two inducer species (aTc and arabinose).
We aim to design a switch that is well regulated, tunable and robust. It must be bistable to synchronize current generation by the mtrABC complex with gold mineralization by the peptides, as well as to manage resource allocation with respect to fitness of the whole population. Quorum sensing came to us as a plausible solution. It is already a bistable switch as demonstrated by experiments (13). In addition, it has components that are transcriptional and enzymatic, so it could become tunable by multiple inducers with some extensions.
We plan to assemble a genetic circuit from  Biobricks that have the same properties as the bistable switch in Figure 3. In theory, LuxI could form an indirect positive feedback loop through interactions with LuxR which is expressed by the constitutive promoter.  Upon gold induction, AiiA is expressed and degrade the quorum sensing signal AHL. In the other word, AiiA could disrupt the feedback loop. When gold is absent and population density is high, taR12 which is downstream of the Plux/lac is upregulated. In our project, taR12 is to transactivate the translation of mtrA upon binding to the crR12.

Gold sensing device (BBa_K1127008)
This device is constructed to recognize gold (HAuCl4) in its environment. GolS is a transcriptional activator of the promoter P(golTS). Upon binding with the gold, it dimerizes and binds to the recognition site within the promoter. We also include LacZ alpha that is useful for quantification of the device activity via Beta-galactosidase assay. The mechanism is simplified and shown in Figure 1.
To determine activity of the gold sensing device, beta-galactosidase assays were run in triplicates using PNPG as the substrate. In all experiments, untransformed E. coli strain"

On August 19, 2018, we jointly organized the “ShengXi” Science and Technology Festival with Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Science and Technology Association in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum. Zhejiang University was the organizer. We jointly planned this activity. The theme of the activity was Popularizing synthetic biology and stimulating primary school students' interests in biology. Hundreds of people including children and their parents attended this activity. The activity was comprised of three links—— playing small games, giving small speeches and asking questions. In these processes, many children showed their strong interests and enthusiasm. We also prepared gifts as rewards for the children who answered the questions correctly.       We worked with Zhejiang University and we overcame many difficulties together. Thanks to Zhejiang University for creating such a wonderful experience with us. We gained a lot and had fun in this activity!

Enzyme for isobutanol
According to the previous study, we use four enzymes to catalyze pyruvate to produce isobutanol. The genes are cloned from different bacteria and encode four enzymes─ AlsS, ilvC, ilvD, KivD.Figure 1 shows the overall pathway. As glucose can be catalyzed into pyruvate by glycolysis, we chose glucose as the starting point of our biosynthetic pathway. Then, pyruvate will be converted into isobutanol by the enzymes shown in Figure 2.
Figure 1.Isobutanol synthesis pathway.
Figure 2.We cloned four gene, ilvC, ilvD, AlsS, kivd. The figure above are the names, strains, length and point mutation of four genes.
Temperature control system
To allow E.coli to produce isobutanol efficiently,we introduced the low temperature releasing system (Figure 3.) in to our circuit (BBa_K887002) . The low temperature system could allow E.coli to produce the optimum production of isobutanol before being poisoned by isobutyaldehyde. The following picture is our system.
Figure 3.The idea of our low temperature release system.
First, we incubated E.coli in 37°C environment. After accumulating enough 2-ketoisovalerate , we move E.coli into 30°C environment. The accumulated non-toxic intermediate would be converted into the final product , isobutanol. Therefore, producing an efficient method to obtain the excellent bio"

Spinach/mCherry Dual flourescence Reporter
Background
In an effort to improve both efficiency, ease, and quality of promoter and RBS strength measurements, we focused on developing a dual fluorescence reporter for simultaneous monitoring both transcription and translation. To measure both processes separately, two fluorescent reporters, the Spinach aptamer and mCherry red fluorescent protein, were assembled into a single construct. The Spinach-mCherry dual reporter is a unique concept; Spinach is a short RNA aptamer that binds to its ligand, DFHBI, and allows it to emit green fluorescence similar to GFP. This gives insight into the direct production of the mCherry-encoding mRNA without the need to wait for protein folding and maturation of the fluorophore. This technique attempted to expand upon current efforts to measure promoter strength relative to a reference standard used by the iGEM community.
Design
The reporter was designed in two ways:  constructs with the mCherry gene 5' of the spinach aptamer, and with the mCherry gene 3' of the spinach aptamer. The construct was assembled in a pET plasmid, with the spinach aptamer containing a small, stabilzing tRNA scaffold on both sides of aptamer. (original Spinach pET plasmid was obtained from Xi Chen of the Ellington Lab, UT Austin) The plasmid containing mCherry, pAAV-miniCMV-mCherry was obtained from Addgene (Addgene plasmid 27970, Church lab Harvard University.) Through the use of gibson assembly, the the mCherry fluorescent protein gene was inserted into the spinach pET plasmid, at both 5' and 3' locations of the spinach aptamer. Little troubleshooting was needed as the gibson worked after one attempt. However, many errors were encountered when using various fluorescent plate readers, often wasting whole"

Java
Java is a general purpose programming language. Developed by Sun Microsystems.
The Newcastle team used Java for their Gold award winning project last year, so we have decided to once again use this technology. Java is the main programming language taught at Newcastle University.
Development of the population model took place in various IDEs including IntelliJ, Eclipse and NetBeans. For managing databases we also used PostgreSQL.
See also: Microbase .
JSim
To bridge the gap between agent based models (Java) and cellular models (CellML), the Newcastle team are using a software product called JSim, developed by the University of Washington.
Graphics
For the graphical output of the population model, we have also used the Java3D technology and the Autodesk 3ds Max application to produce 3D animated graphics.
Models developed
The following are models which we have developed using Java:

3.2 Iron Homeostasis, E. coli Nissle and Knockouts
As an essential element for almost all life iron is often necessary for the activity of certain proteins but can also be problematic because of its toxicity and poor solubility. Organisms have evolved to regulate their iron effectively and as iron in an organism is usually supplied in a limited condition pathogens evolved iron aquisation systems to outcompete other microorganism.                A very efficient iron aquisition system, which bacteria inlcuding E. coli use are siderophore mediated transport pathways.                  [Simon C. Andrews, Andrea K. Robinson, Francisco Rodriguez-Quinones; School of Animal and Microbial Sciences, University of Reading, Reading RG6 6AJ, UK; 2003]                Iron E.coli Link
3.3 Ferritin Strategy
Ferritins as scaffolds for magnetic nanoparticle synthesis
In order to protect themselves against radical stress as well as the lack of co-factors, organisms evolved a high regulated and stable iron acquisition system, also known as iron homeostasis. [Iron Homeostasis of E. coli] To put it in a nutshell iron is taken up by iron transporters or siderophore mediated mechanism and is transporters through the outer membrane into the periplasm, in the periplasm it “changes” transporters and is transported through the inner membrane into the cytoplasm. It always gets released as Fe2+ into the cytoplasm.       In order to protect themselves against superoxide formation by the Fenton-Reaction a lot of organisms evolved iron storage proteins. One of the superfamily of these proteins is called ferritin. These ferritins are highly symmertrical protein nanocages synthesizing iron concentrates required for cells to make cofactors of iron proteins. Through their ability to cage in biominerals they were the first and most obvious scaffolds for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles. These natural metal storage homomers form solid particles inside of their protein shell. Ferritins are ubiquitous in nature and protect the cell from redox stress through iron overload and from iron deficiency. They consist of 24 protein subunits which can consists of a heavy (catalytical active) and light chain (catalytical inactive but stabilizing). Caged ferritin minerals can  have diameters as larg as 8-12 nm with thousands of iron and oxygen atoms. Between species ferritins have different affinity for phosphate. Phosphate is low in animal ferritin iron minerals (Fe:P = 8"

Week 1
Had a call with a beekeeper (Johan Calis) and based on that call found articles regarding sugar water transport in the hive. Started working on alternative application method using bee bread.
Week 2
Added in degradation for BeeT in the patch and the hive. Started adding in code to handle bee bread. Unclear how to determine how much ends up at the larvae.
Week 3
Realised that consumption of pollen and sugar water is included in BEEHAVE. Proceed to couple BeeT transport in the hive to consumption patterns of bees and larvae. Fixing more bugs.
Week 4
Finish up final version of BeeT module, include reporters to make sure everything works correctly. General cleanup of code. Get access to server and start figuring out how parallel works.

Back to Top
Lox71 is a site specific recombination cassette. It belongs to the loxP family frequently used in genetics, particularly in mouse genetics. lox site recombination is catalysed by a Site specific recombinase, Cre. lox sequences are composed of an 8 bp Core sequence surrounded by two Arms. The particularity of lox66 is that it has an altered sequence at the end of it's left arm compared to loxP. This sequence variation reduces affinity of the Cre recombinase for the arm. As a consequence, after a recombination between a lox71 and a lox66 (altered right arm sequence), one of the two resulting generated lox sites has very low recombination potential as it inherited both mutated arms. Use of lox71 & lox66 sites is potentially interesting when the recombination reaction must be ""irreversible"".

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Choice of Protein_-_-_TEXT.html," production. Jørgen Sauer further believed that Human Growth Hormone would be a very good candidate for production with our system.
Based on the experts input (listed above), we made our list of useful proteins that we theoretically should be able to produce with our Protein Printer system (below).
Proteins of interest for space exploration
IgG stan
IgG stan is a collection of IgG antibodies from human donors. The IgG stan is therefore a collection of antibodies with different specificity. IgG is very useful for presenting antigens to the immune system and can therefore function as a booster of the activity of the immune system of the host. Data shows that the immune system is dysregulated under microgravity which might result in an altered immune function [1]. Therefore, it might be interesting to produce proteins that help improve the activity of the immune system. We were pointed in this direction when speaking with Virginia Wotring. Having IgG stan onboard would help boost the immune system of the astronauts.
Immune modulators
As mentioned above the immune system is believed to be dysregulated during microgravity [1]. Therefore, other proteins that affect the immune system could be interesting to produce with our system, in order to reduce this dysregulation. This could both be cytokines, interleukines and other immune regulatory proteins (signal molecules).  We were also pointed in this direction by Virginia Wotring. Being able to produce these immune regulatory proteins might make it possible to relieve the different immune system abnormalities that is experienced by astronauts such as allergy, eczema and hypersensitivity.
Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)
Radiation in space is markedly higher and a part of acute radiation syndrome is hematopoietic syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by a reduction in the number of neutrophils. Neutrophils are an important part of the innate immune system and as the number of neutrophils decrease the probability of infections increase. G-CSF promote the differentiation of neutrophils and can therefore be a possible countermeasure to low neutrophil cell count [2][3].   We were also pointed in this direction by Virginia Wotring. Having G-CSF onboard might potentially help the astronauts recover after high levels of radiations.
Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
IGF has previously been addressed as a potential therapeutic protein to prevent muscle atrophy [4]. The idea being that IGF-1 acts directly on the target tissue promoting growth. We had thought about producing IGF-1 ourself and discussed this with Jon Scott who thought that it"

There are some natural nitric oxide sensors in E. coli, in which the enhancer binding protein NorR                     is specific and can only react with nitric oxide and cannot interact with other nitrogen forms [3].                     NorR binds to three conserved sites on the NorV promoter (PnorV) via the C-terminal HTH domain.                     When nitric oxide is absent, the N-terminal domain- GAF of NorR blocks the central domain-AAA+ to                     inhibit its binding to the transcription factor - σ 54, and thereby prevent transcription of the                     nitric oxide reductase - NorV. When nitric oxide binds to the GAF domain of NorR, it will release                     the AAA+ domain, allowing σ 54 to initiate transcription of NorV [4].
Figure 1. Engineered bacteria with inflammation sensor.
In our inflammation sensor, we used two parts which are NorR and PnorV. GFP and amilCP were selected                     as our reporter genes. Although the E. coli host has native NorR expression, increasing its                     expression facilitates the elimination of stoichiometric imbalances between NorR in the genome and                     PnorV on the foreign plasmid, avoiding interference with the host's release of nitric oxide [5]. We                     used the double expression plasmid pCDFDuet-1 to construct our sensor module. Placing NorR under the control of the first T7 promoter, we are able to regulate its expression by IPTG induction. We                     also replaced the second promoter with PnorV and added the reporter gene downstream which allows us                     to activate the expression of the reporter gene by adding nitric oxide. In addition, during our                     participation in the 5th CCiC, we communicated with the team of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. We                     learned that they detected colorectal cancer through the gene expression initiated by nitric oxide-inducible promoter PyeaR, when we were having trouble detecting the expression of the reporter gene GFP after using nitric oxide to drive PnorV. Meanwhile, we also tested the effect of PyeaR in response to nitric oxide.

Statistical derivation of the Hill's function
In this section we will derive the Hill's function from statistical mechanics calculations of ligand-receptor binding. The following discussion is strongly based on Ref. [1].
In biology we are often confronted with systems containing large number of interacting particles (small molecules, proteins, DNA and RNA fragments, ...). It is often impossible to describe the system by describing each particle individually but this is not a major problem if we are interested in the average behavior of the system; the mathematical tool which allows such description is statistical mechanics. Statistical mechanics rely on the concept of microstate which is one particular realization of the microscopic arrangement of the constituents for the problem of interest [1].
In order to simplify we will consider a lattice model for particles in solution, i.e. we imagine the solution as a series of tiny boxes amongst which we can distribute the ligands [1]. To model a ligand-receptor binding, where there is one receptor and \(L\) ligands. The number of microstates \(W\) for this system is given by the number of ways \(W_f\) of arranging the \(L\) ligands inside the lattice with a free receptor plus the number of ways \(W_o\) of arranging the \(L-1\) ligands inside the lattice with an occupied receptor:               \[                 W = W_f + W_o = \frac{\Omega!}{L!(\Omega-L)!} + \frac{\Omega!}{(L-1)!(\Omega-L+1)!},               \]           where \(\Omega\) is the total number of available lattice sites.
Each microstate has a weight, which is given by the Boltzmann factor (if you are not at ease with the concepts of statistical mechanics, we encourage you to consult Ref. [1] for a very clear and biology-friendly introduction to the subject). We suppose that the energy of one ligand in the solution is \(\epsilon_\text{sol}\) while the energy of a ligand bound to the receptor is \(\epsilon_\text{b}\). We con now write the partition function, which is               \[                 Z = W_f e^{-\beta L\epsilon_\text{sol}} + W_o e^{-\beta [(L-1)\epsilon_\text{sol} + \epsilon_{"

(1991) and Shrader et al. (1993). This N-end rule states that if the N-terminal residue is arginine, lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan, the protein will have a half-life of only 2 minutes. These amino acids are called primary destabilizing residues. On the other hand, amino terminal arginine and lysine are secondary destabilizing residues in E. coli. These residues conjugate to primary destabilizing residues, which again results in a half-life of only 2 minutes (Tobias et al., 1991).  If the N-terminal residue is neither a primary nor a secondary destabilizing residue, the half-life of the proteins exceeds 10 hours. We applied this rule to the proteins of our interest, with the results displayed in Table 2.

Table 2: The resulting half-lifes after using the N-end rule.
According to the N-End rule the half-life of our proteins exceeds 10 hours. If we compare this value with the generation time of a single E. coli cell, we can conclude that these proteins live far longer than the cell itself . Therefore we will take this generation time as a value for our “protein degradation”. On the Bionumbers website , we found that a good rule of thumb for this generation time is around 3000s, which is 50 min.

The limiting step (associated with the most uncertainty) in the kinetic parameter model is the transcription rate. We hoped to improve this aspect by using wetlab derived mRNA levels, obtained via qPCR studies. Due to the unforeseen circumstances with the qPCR we unfortunately were not able to integrate these wet-lab data for each protein in our system. More about this qPCR story"

Characterization of Promoter Strengths
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Before going on to the oscillations, we wanted to characterize the promoter strengths of our newly submitted promoters, since a proper characterization for these parts did not exist. Therefore, we set up experiments in a plate reader, for the 5 promoters used in the Murray et al 5n1 system, of which 2 were also a part of the square wave generating oscillator.
Parts containing the fluorescent GFP reporter (BBa_E0040) under the 5 repressible promoters (pLac, pTet, pCI, pPhlF, pSrpR) were cloned and created, and grown overnight in LB. The cultures were then diluted 1:50 and 1:200 in LB, and put into a plate reader, with 4 replicates. Growth was observed via absorbance at 600 nm, and fluorescence was observed by excitation at 485 nm and emission at 511 nm.
We see in Fig. 1 that the decreasing order of strengths for the five repressible promoters is pLac, pcI, pPhlF, pTet and pSrpR. This is also evident in Fig. 2 when all the 5 promoters settle to a steady state. Fig. 3 depicts the protein production rates for the promoters.  pLac has the largest production rate reaffirming its highest strength. However, despite dominating completely in terms of protein production rate, we see in Figs. 2 and 4 that in the initial transient phase, pLac has lower relative strength compared to pTet and pcI. This is due to the highest dilution rate for pLac in this regime"
