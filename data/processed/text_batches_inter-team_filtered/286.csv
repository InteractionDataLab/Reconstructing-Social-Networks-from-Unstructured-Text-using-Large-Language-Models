Helping others by collaborating
A very big part of iGEM is collaborating with and helping other teams. The amount of great iGEM projects through time shows how important it is to work together and use previous projects and ideas to make new projects. This is exactly why it is a gold medal requirement to help another iGEM team, and why we have talked to a lot to other iGEM teams about our own and their ideas. On this side of things we have chosen to help two other iGEM teams with their projects.
Since we are high school students we looked for the ability to help other teams, however, this ability was limited when facing university teams. We decided to share our knowledge we have accumulated with the teams about how to link the scientific idea with social needs.
Paris Team Name: Paris Bettencourt
The Skype conversation we had with the Team from Paris was very special. Both teams do not speak English as their mother tongue and this made the conversation extra special. Team members spoke about the way they got organized for working in the laboratory and described how they overcame challenges in the lab, between team members and so on. Team Paris generously offered their assistance concerning the modeling of the kit and even explained to us the general guidelines of building a mathematical model system.
In addition, Team Paris gave us a few tips on how to raise funds. Surprisingly , during the conversation we realized that we have a lot in common, both Teams are working in the food field and thus it is possible to turn to charity organizations dealing in agriculture to request funding the team. Our team explained how it is possible to implement the science field as a pure social goal that comes forward to help a specific population group.

The Skype conversation with Team Sydney was done late at night due to time differences. Their team representative who contacted us through Skype was extremely nice and patient meeting 23 students. After introductions and sharing information about the projects, we explained the essence of our"

Additionally to this badge we ruffled a typical bavarian present among all participants of our survey.
Interpretation and conclusion from the survey
This interpretation summarizes the results of our survey and explains why we believe that a standardized part description will benefit the usability of the Parts Registry.
iGEM TU Munich's survey on standardization of BioBrick part descriptions contained 8 questions. The first two were intended to track and get in contact with the participants of the survey. This information enabled us to identify how many different teams took part in the survey. A multitude of participating teams is a prerequisite for reliable results. The third question asked how many BioBricks are used in the current project of the participant’s iGEM team. The fourth question aimed at the perceived quality level of the part description encountered during the project. Question five targeted the participant’s opinion on whether a standardization of the part description could increase the usability of the parts registry. The sixth question introduced a draft of the new standardized BioBrick part description and asked for the participant’s willingness to apply this standard. The last two questions (question 7 and 8) were intended to collect useful ideas how to improve our draft.
During the period from September 14th until September 20th, 2012, 147 people started the survey; thereof 78,9% (116 participants) completed the survey. The participants came from 55 different iGEM teams. That corresponds to more than one quarter of this year’s registered iGEM teams .
The answers to question three indicate that the vast majority of teams is using the parts registry. As the parts registry is the integral part of the iGEM competition this results is not surprising. However, about half of the participants state that less than half of their BioBricks are not taken from the parts registry. While designing new BioBrick and thereby extending the parts registry is one goal of iGEM, participants might avoid the registry intentionally as the answers to the subsequent question reveal.
Asked for the perceived quality level of the part descriptions (question four) in the registry only one quarter of the respondents replied that the descriptions were always or mostly satisfactory. The remaining 75 percent of the participants believed that part descriptions were not satisfactory to a decent degree. This result indicates that there is a potential for improvement concerning the part descriptions.
The answers to question five paint a similar picture. 73 percent of the respondents stated that a standardization of the part descriptions could improve the usability of the parts registry. Only one percent declared that a standardization would not improve the usability. To our understanding an improved"

The team managed to gather sequences in the registry and modified them in order to improve a) purification and b) could be used in Lactobacillus rhamnosus species; since the registry contains mainly E. coli parts, it might be useful as well, to design and obtain sequences that can be expressed on one or the other but both.                       The following sequences were codon optimized for use in the previous microorganisms mentioned.
We managed to test some of these pieces when characterizing our signal peptide for secretion of                     recombinant proteins collection Parts and we obtained the following results:

Information
AP1 binding site
AP1 binding site is promoter site where Activation Protein 1 binds to regulate gene expression.
The known sequence referenced from Wikipedia is TGAGTCA. This site is known as an essential part
for regulation of COL1A2 promoter activity by transforming growth factor 2.  Due to property of AP1, only expressed naturally in human, interacts directly with DNA in nucleus,
and well known promoter sequence, our team decided to use it as core regulator in DiscoverY project.
Regardless of orginal biological function of AP1 and its binding site, this region is now used to activate its own promoter, which is linked to GFP gene. When AP1 is expressed and activated, this protein initiates gene expression
and linked gene, GFP in our case, is expressed with fluorescent signal which means detection of and antigen.
Malaria
To eradicate malaria, humanity has been making its vaccine to inactivate malaria parasite.
But, it is failed because it is very ineffective although it is possible theoretically.
Todays research, they find antigen which make antibody attached parasite membrane or surface protein.
Aerobic bacteria
Some bacteria react the magnetic field. These bacteria, in magnetic field, stand in a line.
Not only these but also many animals have some mechanisms which recognize magnetic area.
In addition, aerobic or anaerobic microbes line when they are stimulted by oxygen.
DDS system using HNMT
Drug Delivery System(DDS) using virus has tissue specificity. For example, Coronavirus usually infect Upper respiratory tracts.
HNMT(histamine N-methylatransferase) is a enzyme used in metabolic of histamine and inactivate histamine to deliver methyl.
There are two kinds of enzyme, one is DAO, the other is HNMT.
Because DAO has a copper on its sturucture, so it is hard to sythesize it.
Fortunately, HNMT is a single strand protein which is composed just 290 anmino acid.

Dr. Aleksandar Necakov
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Brock University who received training in Biochemistry (BSc, McGill University), Molecular Genetics (PhD, University of Toronto), and developmental cell biology through a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).  I am a molecular cell biologist who applies a combination of genetic engineering, high-resolution live imaging, and Optogenetics to precisely visualize and control components of cell signalling pathways with light. I have volunteered my time to organize a group of undergraduate and graduate student research enthusiasts to participate annually in the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (igem.org) through the Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
My goal is to use this competition as an opportunity to train students in advanced molecular genetic techniques, to increase science literacy in the student population, and to ultimately provide students with direct hands-on research experience in preparation for both academic and industrial research positions.
Taylor Lidster
I am a first year Masters student studying Molecular and Cellular Biology at Brock University. I completed my Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry at the University of Guelph. I am currently investigating the role of stress-induced cellular senescence in the Drosophila midgut.
​
I began participating in science events as early as elementary school. Science has undoubtedly been a passion of mine from a young age and has since been a major creative outlet. I also enjoy outdoor activities, fitness and spending time with friends and family.
​
I am thrilled to be a part of such a multidisciplinary team of Brock students who enjoy scientific research as much as myself. iGEM is a great opportunity to showcase innovative ideas and to interact with other young scientists who share common interests and goals. With the guidance of our fantastic supervisor Dr. Necakov, I am confident that our team will succeed in bringing to life a project that incorporates synthetic biology, enzyme function and optogenetics.
Devin Ward
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Biological Sciences at Brock University. My project involves investigating the role of endocytic trafficking in the Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila. Specifically, I am using optogenetics to control endocytic trafficking with precise spatio-temporal precision to observe the effects of Notch signaling when this trafficking is activated and inactivated. I hope to continue this type of research in"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

We drew some interesting conclusions from all of the 544 questionnaires. There are three main conclusions:
1. Water pollution is much serious and of concern: 97.06 % respondents think water pollution is widespread (Fig1) and 88.24% of them care about the impact of water pollution on fish, holding that it is urgent and need to be resolved(Fig2). At the same time, as we asked their opinion about the study on the contaminated water and fish,only 0.74% think it’s meaningless and others all consider it to be important to health, environment and manufacture(Fig3). These results show that it is high time to put efforts on these worrying problems which is the goal and meaning of our project.
As we asked people’s opinion on introducing the gene which encodes the protein (or polypeptide) into the microorganism in order to produce the protein (or polypeptide) that can remove heavy metal. Although 66.18% think it’s feasible and encourage us to have a try(Fig4), 90.62% show their concerns to a certain extent(Fig5). So it’s possible for us to promote our device to the public. Meanwhile, since there are still many people who are unfamiliar with biological treatment, it’simportant for us to spread related knowledge to the public.
3. There are 67.83% of the respondents haven’t heard about iGEM before our questionnaire(Fig6). So we still have much work to do to promote the concepts of iGEM, making public learn more about it.

Shaking Flask Cultivations
The first trials to produce ECOL were produced in shaking flask with various designs (from 100 mL-1 to 1 L flasks, with and without baffles) and under different conditions. The  parameters tested during our screening experiments were temperature (27 °C,30 °C and 37 °C), concentrations of chloramphenicol (20-170 µg mL-1), various induction strategies ( autoinduction and manual induction) and cultivation time (6 - 24 h). Furthermore it was cultivated with and without 0.25 mM CuCl2 to provide a sufficient amount of copper, which is needed for the active center of the laccase. Based on the screening experiments we identified the best conditions under which ECOL was expressed. The addition of CuCl2 did not increase the activity, so it was omitted.

Laccases
High insolubility of indigo in water (990 µg/L) was causing majority of our indigo degradation experiments to fail due to either precipitation of the indigo in negative controls or undetectably low concentration of the dye. Eventually, the indigo solubility in our buffer was increased to a detectable level by adding 0.5% Tween 80.
To insure fully copper-loaded enzyme needed for our degradation experiments, cells were grown for 20h in LB with 0.1 mM IPTG, and 0.25 mM CuCl2, at 25oC without shaking (Reiss et al. 2011). Later, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and the protein extraction was performed by B-PER, protein extraction reagent from Thermo Fisher. The cell extracts were stored in 0.5mL aliquots at -80oC.

How we worked
We were glad to be hosted at the LIBST, Louvain Institute of Biomolecular Science and Technologies, more precisely in the BBGM (Biochemistry, Biophysics and Genetics of Microorganisms) lab of our home university: a leading lab in research           in           Belgium with high safety standards and professional personnel that was alware ready to help us throughout our adventure!           The lab is under the supervision of our 3 PIs: Bernard Hallet, Patrice Soumillion and Charles Hachez.

Respecting safety standards when working in a laboratory is very important to protect us and the others workers too. During our project, we worked in a L2 safety laboratory. Each team member who worked in the lab received a guided tour by           a           lab technician and a training to safety standards to follow in a L2 biosafety laboratory.
This level covers laboratories that use sometimes with pathogenic or infections organisms which pose a moderate health hazard. As we worked with biological materials, we learned all we needed to know about waste management, sterilization,           personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves…), hand washing, how to work with BET (ethidium bromide) and all the lab's internal facilities put in place for workers safety such as laminar flow hoods, emergency exits, fire safety, eye           showers, pictograms, containment doors… This lab has a room only for centrifuges too and another room only for BET.

Comparison of the fluorescence adjusted for OD of I20260, B0015 and K1319014
The expressed fusion protein K1319014 exhibits a fluorescence more than nearly 25-fold smaller as the positive control of I20260.
This experiments shows that the fluorescence of the fusion protein GFP-REACh2 is nearly 25-fold lower than normal GFP expression under identical circumstances (same backbone, promoter, RBS, terminator and cultivation circumstances). This demonstrates a quenching percentage of GFP of ~96 %!
To prove that the measured constructs were the same as assumed the plasmids were tested with specially designed Check PCRs with one primer binding upstream on the plasmid backbone and one primer binding specifically inside the insert. The following results were obtained for K1319014.
Check PCR for K1319014
The length of the PCR product matches the length of the control plasmid.
The PCR clearly shows that the used plasmid had the correct insert. After a positive identification of K1319014 the double plasmid system was also checked for the correct TEV protease plasmid K1319008.
Check PCR for K1319008
The length of the PCR product matches the length of the control plasmid.
This PCR also positively identified K1319008. Additionally both parts were sequenced. The sequencing data for K1319008 and K1319014 can be found in the parts registry.

Overview
 
 
    We are a team from Jiangnan University in Wuxi, China. As the first team to participate in iGEM, we are learning and exploring with a sincere heart.
    Our team is named Jiangnan_China, composed of students from different grades in different schools. We have studied from multiple perspectives and adopted biosynthetic methods to solve the problems of Lactococcus lactis in the human intestine, which is not resistant to acids and freezing during transportation and storage. There are still many problems in the work waiting for us, but we humbly ask for advice, and strive to find more opportunities to find and solve in order to improve the work.
    Jiangnan University was established in 1958 and has 60 years of history this year. It is located on the bank of Taihu Lake and is known as ""the pearl of higher education in light industry"". Our university has 5 national research bases, 14 provincial and ministerial level scientific research bases, and 7 bases of other platform. The university encourages students to enter the laboratory as soon as possible to observe and learn, stimulate interests, and provides us with a good scientific research platform. The proportion of senior titles in our school is 69%, and doctoral degree is"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the unique order of the chain list. However, it is not always so: equal chains in the above sorting may be equivalent or not. It is due to the assumption that two bound parts are taken as equal if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those parts: the details are hidden in the nodes of all trees. Hence, similar to the chain sorting, we need to find another strategy to sort nodes as well as trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bound state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of nodes' weight of trees makes it possible to sort all children of each node, which is a prerequisite for generating Huffman codes (see below). And then the tree order in the forest could be uniquely determined by sorting the root node of each tree.
Exchange of the first and second chain. The tree structures are different before and after exchange: the two chains are not equivalent.
Back to the question above, if two chains are equal in the first stage sorting, which should be arranged in front of the other? The answer could be obtained by exchanging them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees and subsequently the tree and forest structure. If the forest structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by"

Week 4-5: Swap out basic PcpcG2 in PBJ003 with our hybrid promoter and test for increased Fluorescence of EYFP.
Week 6-8: Swap out tetR/ptet with CRISPRi mechanism with dCas9 and sgRNA plasmids. If things go as planned, swap out EYFP with nif cluster in hybrid promoter driven plasmid.
Week 9-10: Analyze data, comparing fluorescence in different intensities of light, wavelengths, time intervals, etc.
Methods
Our general workflow for each plasmid cloning is as follows:
a. Primer design for backbone and pieces
b. PCR pieces for amplification
c. Run a gel extraction
d. Gel DNA Recovery
Treat with DpnI and purify if necessary
e. Digestion/Ligation (Golden Gate or Blunt End)
f. Transformation (Electroporation)
g. Plate and grow overnight
h. Pick colonies and start liquid culture overnight
i. Freeze and Miniprep cultures
j. Run sequencing PCR to check junctions
k. Run visualization gel for sequencing PCR
l. Send for sequencing
m. Verify sequence products are as intended
With every step there is a chance that things could go wrong, and we would troubleshoot in order to determine the best course of action going forward.
Data
Our experimental setup is fairly straight forward:
Co-transform cultures with Chromophore, and plate on appropriate antibiotic resistance.
Wrap culture tubes in foil.
Start liquid cultures overnight in the dark.
Measure the OD600 and dilute to OD0.1
Grow cultures for 2 hours in light and dark conditions respectively.
Induce with light and aTc in deep well plates.
Let cultures grow for 7 hours.
Spin down cultures in centrifuge.
Resuspend in 1 x Phosphate Buffered Saline.
Measure Fluorescence in Tecan.
Absorbance:600nm
Gain: 90
Excitation:485nm
Emission: 528nm
Normalize to OD by calculating Fluorescence/Absorbance.
Figure above: Original Light induction experiment. No fluorescence seen.
After all our cloning mishaps we finally were able to test our light induction system. However, nothing worked as expected. The data represented above is the fluorescence normalized to the absorbance, or OD of the strains we grew. We essentially had the same fluorescence as our negative control, and even when we induced with 250ng/mL of ATC we saw no fluorescence."

Tsinghua-E,2013,Team:Tsinghua-E#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  After that, we measure the performance of our sweet pressure part strain 3-4 in a tryptophan addition fashion. The colony from LB agar plate was picked up and cultured in M9 medium with 8g/L glucose for overnight. On the next day, seed medium was transferred to fresh M9 medium in 24 well plate with 2, 4, 6 and 8g/L maltose as single carbon source, respectively. Initial OD600 was set as 0.16. when OD600 of the medium reached 0.6, 0, 0.5 and 1g/L L-arabinose, 0 and 1mM was added as induction. The growth curve was measured and shown in the figure below.
It could be found that for conditions of 4 or 6g/L maltose in M9 medium, when inducer arabinose was added as 1g/L, strains induced by 1mM tryptophan obtained much better growth after 12h than the corresponding negative control without tryptophan addition. In other conditions, this trend was not so significant, which inferred that the condition for our sweet pressure part to work must be finely tuned. What is more, we have proved that in the in vitro tryptophan induction measurement for tetA pathway that tryptophan addition greatly inhibited growth of cells. Therefore, the trend of better growth induced by tryptophan addition was very strong proof to the successful construction of our sweet pressure part. It worked in this particular condition.
Week9(8.22-8.29)
To overcome the inhibition and kinetics problem during the test for our pressure system, we turned to in vivo system in this week. Fortunately, our lab has constructed before some engineered E.coli BL21(DE3) with different tryptophan productivity in fermentation (unpublished data). They were achieved by the combination deletion of several important regulation genes or branch pathway, also the overexpression of engineered tryptophan pathway (also induced by IPTG). After 48h fermentation in 24 well plate with each fermentation volumn as 1.5mL, three strains with the overall productivity as 0, 0.07, 0.15g/L were named after trp000, trp007, trp015, respectively. Thus, we transformed our bitter pressure part 30, 32 and ori into them by chemical transformation, respectively. Hence, engineered strains trp000-30, trp000-32, trp000-ori, trp"

ASSESSING TOOLS WITH RICE UNIVERSITY AND FLORIDA STATE
WLC MILWAUKEE
Overview
Our team recognizes that the innovation of synthetic biology and science don’t emerge from just one source. Interdisciplinary work and collaborations play a huge part in the advancement of our field. This year, we developed an exciting new biology teaching tool, our Plasmid Learning Kit, to engage and support a new generation of synthetic biology students. In order to utilize different resources and gain insights that cannot simply be done by one team, we formed partnerships with other iGEM teams to produce the best Plasmid Learning Kit possible. By sending our Plasmid Learning Kits to other teams, we hope they were able to utilize them in new and innovative ways during their outreach and education events, and provide us with valuable feedback on how to improve this biology teaching tool.
Additionally, we pride ourselves on our independence and our ability to operate our organization as a high-performing team. We are approaching our seventh year as a team, and we realized that we’ve built up a lot of knowledge that we hoped to share with other iGEM teams. To this end, we helped provide advice to the iGEM team from WLC Milwaukee.
Assessing Tools with Rice University and Florida State
We sent our plasmid kit to two iGEM teams: Rice University and Florida State University. They were given instructions as well as extra parts to the kit. We wanted them to test our kit to see if it was helpful for teaching synthetic biology and to see what improvements we could make.
From Rice University, we heard mixed results. They found that it was helpful when introducing the concept of plasmids. It was a great visual aid as well as a hands-on activity for the children. It reinforced their learning and helped them retain it. However, they found issues with the quality of the kit. The magnets placed on the back were not large or strong enough, so the"

COLLABORATION
During the summer time, we helped a new high school iGEM team, SKLBC-GDSYZX, with their project. We invited members of SKLBC-GDSYZX to our laboratory for a three-day experimental training to help them gain a better understanding of synthetic biology. We completed a part for their project. In addition, we tested the software they designed and provide them with feedbacks to improve it. At the meantime, we received suggestions about our project from Dr. Zhang Simin, one of the instructors of SKLBC-GDSYZX.
The Collaborations track of team SKLBC-GDSYZX can be found as follows:

Meetup    2015 July 14th
During the day, members of three software teams, i.e. SKLBC-China, SYSU-Software and SKLBC-GDSYZX, and three laboratory teams, i.e. SCUT, SCUT-China and our team, gathered in the conference room of our institute. We discussed and exchanged thoughts about the relationships and interactions between the “wet” and “dry” work of synthetic biology. At this meet-up, we also shared our previous experience attending iGEM with two new teams, SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX.
Experiment train   2015 August 7th- 9th
Team SKLBC-GDSYZX’s project was to develop an online panel app, with which iGEMers can easily paint their gene circuits. As we know, a good product must meet the needs of customers. However, as a new high school team, members of SKLBC-GDSYZX were not familiar with the iGEMers’ demand when designing the app. In order to help them to get a better understanding of synthetic biology, we organized a series of basic genetic circuit constructing experiments during August 7th- 9th.

KLAS
KLAS (Knowledge Link through Art and Science) is an interdisciplinary Artist in Residence program focused on creating a connection between synthetic biology and art. It was founded at the Max-Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam-Golm near our campus.
The project aims at informing the public about advancements and ethics questions in synthetic biology whilst combining these topics with arts installations in regular workshops and panels. We got in contact with Dr. Rodrigo Perez-Garcia, member of the organisational team for KLAS and also talked with one of the artists residing at the MPI at that time (he’s from Brazil and plans on storing music via DNA in E.coli!).
There will be a workshop at the 27th and 28th of November, where we will be holding a short talk about our view about synthetic biology and how we experienced working in science for the first time and how that differs from the general public’s view on how science works.

These results correlate perfectly to the standard (not in droplet) measurement results. Based on this fact, it can be concluded that CAT-Seq activity sequencing method can be utilized as a precise and accurate way to screen and assign the activity and orthogonality of regulatory sequences in a high throughput manner.
Using CAT-Seq
We truly believe that Catalytic Activity Sequencing will be a valuable and frequently used tool by future iGEM teams, Scientists and Engineers. That is why we have created a detailed “Using Cat-Seq” protocol guide that allows users of range of background and skill level to start exploring the vast space of sequence and activity relationships right away!"

Figure 12: Comparison of fumarate consumption and succinate production in anaerobic cultivation of the Escherichia coli KRX wildtype and Escherichia coli KRX wildtype with strong expression of frd ( BBa_1465102 ) in M9 minimal medium with 50 mM xylose and 50 mM fumarate. Induction occurred after 72 h with 0.1% rhamnose and 500 μM IPTG. Fumarate and succinate concentration were measured duplicated via HPLC.
As expected figure 9 shows the production of succinate by the Escherichia coli KRX wildtype under anaerobic condition with 50 mM xylose and 50 mM fumarate as sole carbon sources. Under anaerobic conditions fumarate respiration takes place. Growth displayed via OD600 shows rise in the first three days of anaerobic cultivation . After that cells were induced via 0.1% rhamnose and 500 μM IPTG. This leads to  a reduction in growth because of the expression load and the toxic effect of IPTG. Cultivation of the E. coli wildtype also should be induced because of better comparability. The same effect could be observed in cultivation of E. coli with BBa_1465102 , as shown in figure 10. There is also a drop in growth detectable. Comparison of both growth characteristics are shown in figure 11. It could be proven that there are no distinct differences in growth betweenE. coli KRX wildtype and E"

2nd, Aug
Everyone works hard to find the new plasmid. Where there's a will, there's a way. We successfully outcrop a new plasmid named I13453 which proves to be a workable plasmid. Then we quickly complete the transformation of it.
3rd, Aug
We succeed in doing the transformation of I13453.And then we pick the right colonies from the medium (including K081009,E0430 and I13453), and put the tubes into shaker.
4th, Aug
Today, our task is to finish the plasmid extraction of K081009, E0430 and I13453. After the practice we have done before, we find that it is not too difficult to make it. We only spend one hour extracting the plasmid.
8th, Aug
Ms. Yang teaches us the protocol of agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared with plasmid extraction, electrophoresis is easier. But we need to make the gel and grasp the method to use microwave oven.
9th, Aug
Today, we do the agarose gel electrophoresis of B0034, C0079, B0015, R0079, J23116 and J37034. Unfortunately, we find that our plasmid extraction of C0079, R0079 and J23116 fails. It proves that our chosen colonies are not target bacteria colonies. Therefore, we take out our medium and repick the other colonies and put the tubes into shaker.
10th, Aug
We complete the plasmid extraction of C0079, R0079, J23116.
11th, Aug
The plasmid extraction is successful. We observe the plasmid in the agarose gel (including C0079, R0079, J23116). And then we do the agarose gel electrophoresis of K145270, R0062, P0440 and E0420. We find that we have to redo the plasmid extraction of K145270, R0062. Therefore, we take out our medium and repick the other colonies and put the tubes into shaker.

Weeks 22-28th and 29th August – 4th September
During these two weeks we performed the Golden Gate to get our several plasmids.
It took us longer than we had originally expected because we run into some problems regarding the construction of the plasmids.
Luckily, we were able to figure the mistakes out. There were no mistakes in our designing of the cloning (uffff, we are happy about that, it would have been a disaster). There were nonetheless mistakes in the way we performed the protocol for Golden Gate.
We used the NEB Golden Gate Mix throughout all the attempts.
We started first by amplifying the fragments for the Golden Gate (as said already in the past week). IDT says that PCR should not be performed on their GBlocks in the case of them being bigger than 1000pb, which in all of our cases they are. Nonetheless, we needed to perform the PCR on the fragments because we needed different tails added to them.
The first Golden Gate protocol that we did was the one that is proposed by NEB for Golden Gates with up to 5 fragments (which is our case).
Total volume of reaction is 20uL. We added 2uL of the NEB Golden Gate Buffer, 75ng of plasmid (in our case 1.39uL), we kept a 2:1 molar ratio for each of the inserts, added 1uL of the Golden Gate Assembly Mix and added water up to the final volume.
We performed the proposed protocol of 1h at 37ºC an 5 min at 55ºC, and transformed the results into E. coli DH5alfa.
The following day we had a high number of colonies in our plates,"

2. Increasing the maximal expression rate of TetR in warrior I
Change beta_(1AHL_1t ) from 6e3 to 6e5
From the results of the model, we are delight to see that warrior I just respond when there is warrior II. So the orthogonality of gene circuit is satisfied!
However, if the level of TetR is too high (like when beta1ahl1t=6e7), we will see that warrior I cannot respond with or without warrior II.
In conclusion, the core is that we can make the gene circuit orthometric by regulating the TetR level to a moderate level. This can be easily achieved by change the RBS after Prhl of TetR in warrior I.
According to the results obtained from our model, it is clear what we should do in the experiment to achieve the goal.

These amounts were meant to reduce the uncertainty in the model. Rather than running our model with unrealistic values (eg. the transcription rate formula described in section 1) and add uncertainty to the data, we opted to not use this model at this point.
However, we think that our extensive literature study has been very instructive, and hope that other iGEM teams could use this study (for example the RBS calculator) as a basis for their model. We also want to emphasise the importance of the qPCR approach. Providing we can circumvent the problems associated with high copy number plasmids, wetlab data will offer more realistic values than currently used, modelled transcription values.

Use a shorter time if the amplicon is a relatively short segment of DNA, and a longer time if it is a relatively long piece of DNA. Annealing X°C 15-30 secs 
This is the most crucial step of the thermocycle! Your annealing temperature will be determined by the melting temperature of your primers. As a general rule, your annealing temperature should be about 5° lower than the lowest melting temperature of your primer pair. Additionally, if you are trying to add tails to you amplicon (e.g. you are trying to add restriction sites to the ends of your DNA template), you may need to drop the annealing temperature down even more. I have had primers with melting temperatures above 65° that needed to be annealed at 42°.
Additionally, if a primer may be difficult to anneal to the template, you can increase the annealing time for better results.
Extension 72° X seconds. Taq extension runs at 1kb per minute. Therefore, allow the extension step enough time to fully copy your entire amplicon. Repeat steps 2-4 32X. Final Extension 72°C 5 min. Hold 4°C forever.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," legislation has changed this so that shared parental leave is an option, according to Gov.uk parents can
take the rest of the 52 weeks of maternity or adoption leave as Shared Parental Leave
. Questions should be asked however, about whether the government is doing enough to promote shared parental leave as opposed to individual maternity or paternity leave.
Perhaps we should try to promote paternity leave allowing flexibility for men to look after the children so the burden doesn’t fall on women all the time.
Dr Griffiths further emphasised that one of the factors for fewer women at levels after post-doctorate, might be because of the burden Britain places on maternity leave and how unstable jobs in academia might dissuade women from taking positions higher up. We identified this as an issue to look further into as it is something that is theoretically, relatively easy for the government and governing science bodies to address, considering countries like Sweden are setting the example of equal maternity and paternity leave.
Dr Griffiths acts as a lead for Bioscience in the Athena Swan group, and he emphasised the kind of difference Athena Swan has made for improving gender equality at the university. One of the key impacts of the group is that it has provided junior academics mentors and role models that give them more confidence to put themselves up for promotion. He highlighted how this is a difficult issue to address as a man, without sounding patronising, but it is an important one.
From this meeting we were able to narrow down a few areas to discuss:
A potential lack of confidence in women and how that might affect their decision to apply for more senior roles and the importance of role models on encouraging confidence
The issue of maternity and paternity leave and how that might affect women’s decisions to take fixed term post-doctorate positions
How to ensure there is flexibility in the workplace to accommodate all

Implementation
Cell free extract preparation procedures were based on methods reported in literature previously (Kwon & Jewett, 2015). Cell free extracts were prepared from Escherichia coli BL21 and Bacillus subtilis 168. Cells were streak plated out from glycerol stocks on LB agar (15 mg/mL agar, 10 mg/mL tryptone, 5 mg/mL yeast extract, 0.17 M sodium chloride) and incubated overnight at 37oC. A single colony was used to inoculate 10 mL LB broth (10 mg mL-1 tryptone, 5 mg mL-1 yeast extract, 0.17 M sodium chloride) before shake-incubation at 37oC for approximately 16 hours overnight. 2 mL of overnight liquid culture was used to inoculate 200 mL LB broth in a 2 L flask and shake-incubated at 37oC until late exponential phase was reached (OD600 nm of approximately 2.5 for E. coli BL21 cells). The culture was split in half and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 RPM and 4oC for 20 minutes in pre-weighed falcon tubes. The wet cell pellet weight was determined before storage at -20oC. Cells were defrosted on ice for approximately 1.5 hours and resuspended in approximately 10 mL of ice-cold CFPS wash buffer (60 mM potassium glutamate, 14 mM magnesium glutamate, 10 mM TRIS (pH 8.2 with acetic acid); autoclave sterilised; supplemented with 2 mM DTT immediately before use) per gram of wet cell pellet. Resuspended cells were centrifuged at 4,500 RPM and 4oC for 20 mins. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were resuspended and centrifuged in CFPS wash buffer twice more. The washed pellets were then resuspended in 1 mL CFPS wash buffer per gram of wet cell pellet and aliquoted to 1 mL in 2 mL tubes. Cells were lysed by sonication (20% amplitude, cycles of 40 seconds"

Cloning
Cinnamaldehyde
Based on the assays done on pure chemicals, cinnamaldehyde is a repellent while phenylpyruvic acid is an attractant. Hence, it would be more convenient for us to choose parts that are registered on the iGEM. We found a synthesis pathway of cinnamaldehyde with genes in the iGEM parts library, given by the 2013 UBC team [1] . The pathway is constructed with 3 genes, where the starting substrate is phenylalanine, an amino acid. With the sequence of the three genes provided, we designed and ordered the 3 oligo DNA from IDT, the Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc..
Each ordered oligo DNA sequence encloses a constitutive promoter J23100 [2] , medium strength RBS B0034 [3] , a gene in the cinnamaldehyde synthesis pathway and a double terminator B0015 [4] , with iGEM prefix and suffix [5] for a more convenient use in 3A assembly cloning steps.
We were supposed to sub-cloned these genes into 3 separate plasmid backbones then clone the 3 parts into one plasmid backbone. And lastly transform the plasmid into bacteria. Unfortunately, we were not successful in doing it.
Phenylpyruvic acid
Phenylpyruvic acid is an attractant. However, we had difficulties find a protein sequence that enables the production of phenylpyruvic acid in the iGEM community. As such, we decided to synthesize it ourselves. We discovered a protein sequence for producing phenylpyruvic acid [6] on NCBI website. We again ordered the oligo DNA from IDT. The ordered sequence also encloses a constitutive promoter J23100 [7] , medium strength RBS B0034 [8] , the target gene and a double terminator B0015 [9] , with iGEM prefix and suffix [10] . Our new gene is an amino acid deaminase gene [11] .
After successful cloning bacteria with phenylpyruvic acid producing gene, we used this composite part to perform our assays.

It consists of two fluorescent domains connected through a linker sequence containing an amber stop. When induced with IPTG, a the fluorescence can be measured. A red fluorescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated in response to the recoded amber stop codon, a green fluorescence intensity is also measurable. Fidelty and efficiency of the incorporation can be determined by comparison of fluorescent levels. This experiment is performed in order to obtain fluorescence spectra of mRFP1 and sfGFP. GFP formation is measured as a result of successful amino acid incorporation via amber supression. Excitation and emission spectra of mRFP1, and sfGFP were obtained through measurements with a modified Biolector set-up. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

This synthetase has Y32 mutated to glycine and is therefore a template for further mutations for the purpose of changing amino acid specificity. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of ncAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC).

Figure 13. Three different ways to transfer electrons from microorganisms to an anode. a) Transfer of electrons to the anode using a redox shuttle.Two different types of redox shuttles exit: One going through the membrane and another receiving electrons from membrane proteins. b) Transfer of electrons to the anode by direct contact. c) Electrons are carried from the inside the cell, directly to the anode through nanowires.
The redox shuttles use extracellular electron mediators, which hold the advantage of not being limited by the surface area of the anode, although it is restricted by the slow diffusion of the extracellular mediators. The direct contact electron transfer is, in contrast to the redox shuttles, strongly limited by the surface area of the anode, but the membrane bound cytochromes that are in direct contact with the anode, rapidly deliver the electrons. Bacterial nanowires are known to efficiently transfer electrons, as for the direct contact electron transfer. However, bacterial nanowires are not as strictly limited by the surface area of the anode as the direct contact electron transfer. This is due to the ability of bacterial nanowires to form complex networks of interacting nanowires in biofilm, thereby efficiently transferring electrons from distant microbes to the anode Khanal YLaSK.

Figure 3. (A) Concentrated protein sample from the Ni2+-Sepharose column applied to a Sephacryl S400 size exclusion chromatography column at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/minute. The absorbance of the eluting solution was measured at 280nm. (B) Magnified view of chromatogram of the two peaks seen in (A).
Conclusion
Figure 2 shows that with each wash proteins of a similar size were eluted off the resin. These proteins run at the expected molecular weight of enhanced lumazine synthase monomers (18.5 kD).
The chromatogram (Figure 3) from the chromatography experiment displays two regions of increased absorbance at 280 nm, between 82 and 135 mL of buffer eluted. These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Purified samples of enhanced lumazine synthase from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy. We viewed samples of each of the two peaks from the SEC; however only one sample contained microcompartments.
Materials and Methods
Purified Samples in solution were placed on a carbon grid and negatively stained using uranyl acetate. Carbon grids containing the samples were then viewed with a Hitachi H-7500 Transmission Electron Microscope. 
Results
Figure 4. Transmission electron microscopy of Enhanced Lumazine Synthase microcompartments.  Microcompartments of approximately 40 nm can be seen at x 20K magnification.
Figure 5. Transmission electron microscopy of Enhanced Lumazine Synthase microcompartments.  Microcompartments of approximately 40 nm can be seen at x 100K magnification.
Conclusion
As expected, TEM micrographs show polyhedral particles of approximately 40 nm, corresponding to the size described by Wörsdörfer et al. (2011). This confirms that E. coli is capable of producing enhanced lumazine synthase.

1.  Education
    With the intention to involve children in bioscience, our team organized a theme activity aiming to raise the young-generation's interest in science.
On June 22th The first station: Tian-E-Hu kindergarten
I. Science speech
    In this section, we introduced probiotics to children, and talked to them about the relationship between probiotics and our daily food, including yogurt, pickle and others. We also explained how probiotics work in our intestines. They showed great curiosity and asked us lots of questions about probiotics. We answered them patiently in an understanding way.
 
II. Drawing bacteria
     In this section, we asked the children to image how bacteria look like and draw them down. What they have drawn showed their rich imagination and understanding about our introduction.
     In summary, what we have done in Tian-E-Hu kindergarten enabled these children to understand the probiotics, and inspired their interest in science.
 
On July 8th The second station: the youth palace
     This section was meant for adults and teenagers. We made some display boards, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents whose children was engaged with our other activities can come and listen. We got great feedback from them. They asked many questions and learned a lot in this section. This is also a mutual understanding between our project and its potential consumers.
 
iGEM propaganda
     In order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for the students came from all faculties in Jiangnan University. At the meeting, we had a total of three parts. The first part was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second part was brainstorm, which let students think about our project's innovative points and flash points based on our project's background. The third part was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us about things related to our project and team. After this meeting, the innovation of our project is sublimated further.

Rutgers,2011,Team:Rutgers#EAS1_-_-_TEXT.html," Speed, and Noise
Light - Our light response depends entirely on LovTAP. If it proves ineffectual, we will either need to introduce mutations that will help its function, or switch to a different system.
Sensitivity - The amount of time necessary to keep the laser pointer on the bacteria should be related to the time it takes for the locking switch to flip to the activated state and the length of time LovTAP remains in its activated state once illuminated. The former should be small by design of the switch. The latter may be improved by mutations or changing to a different light response system, if necessary.
Selectivity - The circuit should respond to only to wavelengths and intensities of light that can flip LovTAP from the dark state to the light state. Since LovTAP responds primarily to blue light, we may need to work in red ambient lighting.
Speed - The delay from the moment the locking switch is activated to the appearance of color will be related to the time it takes for the bacteria to synthesize mRFP1. This will hopefully be minimized as transcription from T7 promoters is very high when T7 polymerase is present.
Noise - Unwanted splotches will be created if there is unwanted transcription from the T7 promoter or if the locking switch is accidentally turned on by unwanted transcription from the pRM promoter. The former should be minimal as the T7 promoter is very specific to T7 polymerase. The latter should be reduced by placing the locking switch on a low-copy plasmid.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," at least unknown, secondary effects. This was one of the reasons we settled on our SMITe project.
With SMITe, the same concern exists but is comparably smaller - the thick layer of biofilm will effectively shield the healthy tissue from the action of the enzymes and the fact that circulation is normally impeded in chronic wounds decrease the risk of spreading our combat proteins to healthy tissue [5] .
Additionally, the fixation of our combat proteins to the spider silk via Sortase A is based on the formation of a peptide bond. This covalent linkage is very stable and should withstand the conditions in the chronic wound without undergoing degradation [6] . In one of our own experiments, it can be seen that even the heating process and reducing conditions of an SDS-Page sample preparation did not detach the peptides from the spider silk.
Unspecific Effects
Unfortunately, designing a treatment without side effects is close to unachievable but measures can be taken to minimise them. In our case, unspecific action of two of our combat enzymes is the major issue in terms of side effects. One of those enzymes, Nuc, does not show strong specificity for either eukaryotic or prokaryotic DNA, indicating that it might not just degrade extracellular bacterial DNA but also Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), DNA secreted by Neutrophils that constitutes a major part of the immune defense in wounds [7] [8] .
In order to avoid those unspecific effects, we considered several alternative enzymes for SMITe which would show specificity for bacterial DNA, based on its different methylation pattern. There are interesting candidates with such specificities such as SmaI but due to time constraints we decided to focus on Nuc for our SMITe project [9] . If SMITe or a similar concept would be adapted for use in the clinics, the role of neutrophils in chronic wounds would have to be further evaluated since it is unclear at this point whether they overall aid or further disturb the healing process [1] . If neutrophils were found to contribute significantly to wound healing and pathogen defense during the stages our dressing is intended to be applied, more measures would have to be taken. One of those could be attaching Nuc only at specific parts of the dressing where the biofilm has a considerable thickness and Nuc would be unlikely to reach NETs.
Esp is a second enzyme that might show undesirable effects since it is a serine protease with not entirely clear specificity [10] . However, Esp is usually secreted by S.epidermidis colonising the skin"

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#REGObricks#ISRU_-_-_TEXT.html,"The Case for In situ Resource Utilization
The principle of in situ resource utilization (ISRU) comes from the basic idea to bring as little as possible when visiting other planets. We want to decrease our dependence on home-grown supplies and instead increase our capacity to use the native resources available. Potential benefits of ISRU include significant mass and cost reduction, lowering the barrier for space missions; risk mitigation, as astronauts have more options to deal with emergencies; expansion of the duration and scope of our explorations; and most strikingly, preparation of our eventual capacity to terraform other planets.
Of course, NASA can say it better than we can- see the side for a summary from the ISRU Capability Roadmap published in 2005, outlining four potential areas of benefit for ISRU, as well as 7 elements that would allow these to become possible.  The highlighted parts deal with areas that we sought to address in our project. (Color Code: Bright Green: Powercell Yellow: Biocementation 3 .
Methods and Benefits of ISRU 3
In the case of Mars, after investigating with the resources available, we decided on two essential building blocks: Food and shelter. For the former, we have Project Powercell which sought to imbue new life into the precious carbon building blocks in the atmosphere ]. The long term implications are not only the harnessing for sunlight for organic energy consumption, but a revolutionary way to power heterotrophic biological machines: Nutrient Secretion .
What kind of machines are there to power? As a case in point of the power of synthetic biology as the ultimate compact swiss-army knife for the space-farer, we looked at the ability of little known bacteria Sporosarcina pasteurii, and its amazing potential to create literal bricks from nothing more than sand, calcium and nitrogenous metabolic waste*....

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Human Containment_-_-_TEXT.html," project, we recognised that containment of genetic information is an issue that has to be taken very seriously. We discussed many different ways in which we could ensure that the DNA we engineer into our bacteria does not spread to other microorganisms or adjacent ecosystems. We consulted our advisors in the synthetic biology centre at Imperial who informed us about already existing ""kill switches"". Most of these are based on killing bacteria in response to a specific stimulus. However, many of the compounds that cause activation of these switches could not be applied to soil without side effects. In addition, we could never ensure that all bacteria in the soil would be eradicated through application of these compounds. Switches that kill bacteria after a certain number of replication cycles are also not necessarily applicable as the lysed bacteria leave behind genetic information that can be taken up by other soil microorganisms.
3. Result
We took a novel approach and, instead of designing a kill switch, we designed a containment device that is able to contain genetic information in our bacteria at the same time as preventing horizontal gene transfer to other microorganisms. Gene Guard is based on a toxin/anti-toxin system taken from the lysis cassette made by the Berkeley 2008 team containing, holin, endolysin and anti-holin.
Chassis choice
Figure 1. Our reasons for choosing E. coli as our chassis (graphic by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
1. Goal
In chassis choice, we had to consider several aspects. We wanted to choose a chassis that we would be able to transport to arid areas, preferably already enveloped inside a solid seed coat. In addition, we want the bacteria to be able to persist in the soil long enough to carry out their function. On the other hand, we also wanted to prevent spread of the bacteria into far-away ecosystems where they are more likely to have a detrimental effect on the ecological balance.
2. Action
We consulted two ecologists who are experts in above/below ground interactions and soil microbial ecology. They both advised us that while it may be more obvious to use naturally occurring soil bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli is less likely to survive in soil and may ensure better containment. Dr Alexandru Milcu pointed out that this is especially important considering that very high auxin secretion may skew plant populations. While this is not an issue in areas where the ecosystem is already badly affected, spread to other ecosystems, especially via spores, is a big issue. Dr Robert Griffiths also advised us that while engineering naturally occurring soil bacteria might lead to better persistence and cause our project to"

I think that GMOs still have so many uncertainties. However I don’t learn about GMOs by myself very much, I want to know the opinions of both good and bad aspects of GM Foods.
Age: 50`s / Sex: F
I have a bad impression to GM Foods because it’s artificial. And I’ll not select GM Foods because we can’t conclude that GM Foods are perfectly safe only by the fact that we have never heard any health damages.
However because the bias by the lack of information is surely presented, I think that the opportunities for general people to learn about GM Foods are necessary and we must understand it.
Age: 50`s / Sex: F
Because the lack of the information about GMOs, it’s difficult for me to understand it.

Trust between the stakeholders: can opposing parties in (ethical) discussions on scientific topics come to terms and on which bases?
Public or consumer freedom of choice in using this technology and related products: do consumers wish to buy products made with synthetic biology (genetic engineering)?
Naturalness or artificialness issues: when does a natural system become a mechanical structure?
Religion and genetic engineering technology: what are the religious boundaries for applying genetic engineering techniques?
Traditional production methods and related employment: is technological development also appreciated in artisanal production of e.g. food products?
Risk perception and related gut-feelings of safety: to what extent are gut-feelings of safety (“is it really, really safe?”) playing a role in ethical considerations of certain stakeholders?
Industrialisation and globalisation and related intellectual property rights: will scientific development lead to abuse of third world countries by large multinationals?
Digging into these ethical issues a little deeper shows that what people may really be concerned about, is autonomy, security and safety (of self and nature, for now and for the future): these are the underlying considerations of the ethical issues enlisted directly above. These are exactly the four issues raised in synthetic biology, as stated at the beginning of this paragraph, but these four are on a higher level and much more abstract. The moral values, that people may want satisfaction on before these higher issues can be discussed, are the more superficial issues listed directly above.
3.5 The “banner” implications: a pragmatic point of view.
Yet implicitly it seems that in synthetic biology research, these issues are not considered. Scientists probably know about the issues raised in synthetic biology. However, by working in synthetic biology research, it may seem that the scientists  do not consider ethical issues related to the public, religion, trust, tradition, globalisation, industrialisation, naturalness, freedom of choice, etc. Does this mean that under the “banner” or flag of synthetic biology, more is or should be allowed than is the case for genetic modification in metabolic engineering? Let’s elaborate.
With the term “genetic modification” the focus is on the used technology and hence there is a focus on practicing recombinant DNA techniques. Therefore the focus is on changing DNA and hence the autonomy of an organism is much more prominently present in discussions on ethics of genetic engineering. Discussions about the possibilities (technical and theoretical) and regulations (legal framework and enforcement) of genetic engineering techniques therefore are much more logical to be discussed by the parties that in some way or another are in"

Yes, exactly. And it's such bad lighting too! All the good lighting is exposed [in the lab], that’s why I do a lot of stuff at night. At the end of the day we need to show our faces. I can justify why I’m taking a selfie. I’m not a narcissist, I’m actually pretty self conscious, like most people...I don’t think I’m hot shit. But people want to see your face to know your real and genuine. So I know I have to do that. I justify it but people will make fun of me if they see it. Most of my lab is super supportive though, and they’ll even be like “Hey want me to take a picture of you?” and I’ll be like “Yes please! I need pictures!” and they’ll let me take pictures of them and they’re in my stories. One time my supervisor, we were at a conference and I was doing a selfie video to explain the session I was just in for Instagram story. He walked by and he didn’t even know the word for selfie because he’s so old and he said “Are you taking pictures of yourself?” and he laughed and walked away and I was like “He doesn’t know that I’m [on Instagram]”. Does he know about your Instagram account? I don’t think so but I think he’d be supportive. He is very much about outreach, communicating and storytelling. I actually learned so much from him...he is soo.…like you need to hear him talk, he’s amazing. He’s always giving us feed back for our presentations.

Human Practice
Project
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we attempt to apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically.

MoDeL
A new language called MoDeL (Standard Biological Parts Modeling Database Language) is proposed for automatic modeling of biological systems. Due to introducing of novel concepts of species and reaction templates, which are two main components in MoDeL, interactions between species need not to be completely provided and thus making automation possible.

Demo
To show results of our program, some classical genetic regulatory networks are provided as demos, including toggle switch, repressilator as well as quorum-sensing oscillator. Each selected demo, representing a certain pattern of reaction network in biological process, is carefully designed to cover all our features as much as possible.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

InterLab
    Synthetic biology is based on biology, chemistry, physics, computing, engineering and other multi-disciplinary cross, for organisms to redesign in the form of engineering and even from scratch, to overcome the limitations of natural evolution, create ability beyond the natural life of synthetic biology. With the development of synthetic biology technology, the application of synthetic biology is becoming more and more widely. How to protect the biological safety of synthetic biology has become a very important and key problem to be solved. Our experiments are in strict accordance with the laboratory biosafety code and protection regulations. Our lab is level 1 with low risk. And our work area is open bench. Although we all have experimental experience, we still have carried out corresponding experimental safety education and skills training to ensure the safe operation of the experiments.
Training:
    Our PI Guocheng Du will be responsible for the safety of our laboratory. For the L.lactis used in the project, our Secondary PI professor Juan Zhang has long-term research experience on it. Therefore, we can ensure the safety of the organisms in the project. In addition, the advicors will stay with us during the entire experiment to ensure the safety of our experiments.
    All of our experimenters have already received safety training. Training content including biological safety related laws, regulations, measures, standards, our laboratory biological safety manual, biological safety management system, emergency plan, emergency reporting and disposal process, biological safety risk assessment, biological safety operation specification, equipment use, maintenance, proper use of personal protective equipment, bacteria strains and samples of the collection, transportation, storage, use, destruction, laboratory of disinfection and sterilization, infectious waste disposal, first aid, etc.
Protection:
    1.  Safety Clothing:
    All lab members wear lab coats, nitrile gloves, closed-toe shoes, and goggles to ensure personal protection from any harmful chemicals and microbes.
    2. Equipment:
    We used a UV lamp to visualise and cut agarose gels. We had to ensure we had no exposed skin on our hands/arms and had to wear a visor to protect our faces and eyes. Additionally, if any accidental emergency were to happen, all members of the team knew"

Ptet: R0040 from Registry ""R0040"" (sequence copied into our primers)
LacI: amplified from Repressilator plasmid ""LacI sequence"" - The sequence lacks a stop codon, so we added one (TAA) with our primers.
This Inverter plasmid now contains a cascade reaction consisting of TetR constitutively expressed that represses LacI. It still contains p15A origin and a kanamycin resistance marker, making it compatible for cotransformations with the J61002 plasmids.
The Inverter plasmid is used in combination with the Reporter plasmid in our second reporter system. To see the experimental results of this system, please go on this page.
Sequence of the plasmid: This plasmid was sequence-verified. While Pconst, TetR and LacI were OK, Ptet has been mutated.

EMW_Street_Bio,2016,Team:EMW Street Bio#Wetware_-_-_TEXT.html," dipping a                     cotton                     end into the water, the swabs were rubbed 1) under the tongue, 2) around both armpits, 3) inside the                     belly button, and 4) between two toes of the foot, leaving the 5th area (either one slice, or the                     innermost ring) empty as a control. The swabs were carefully dragged across the entire surface area                     of                     the exposed medium.
Initial Experiments
Alternative mediums to LB agar were tested- gelatine, pectin, and combinations of the two. However,                     they                     did not maintain a solid consistency at 37C so were abandoned.
Prior to plating our records with cultures from our bodies, an initial set of tests in standard petri                     dishes of LB agar were conducted. A variety of sites from the body were swabbed and plated into                     separate                     petri dishes to examine for visual variability, including color, size, and quantity. This was done                     first                     to determine that cultures from our body could live in LB agar and to determine which sites on the                     body                     to use. Images from this process are below.
Standard protocol listed above was used; an unswabbed plate was a control. It should be noted that on                     October 10th, we forgot to photograph the control plate, but there was no growth present, the                     desired                     result.
From the initial experiments it was known that growth from the mouth and toes occurred within 24                     hours,                     which was desirable for the purpose of quick prototyping. The collarbone, armpits, and belly button                     did                     not show growth as quickly, but the armpit and belly button were kept for great contrast to the fast growing body regions.
Initial experiments of bacterial growth on standard petri dishes from body parts listed clockwise from                 upper left corner: (control on far left) chest, behind ears, collar bone, nose, belly button, anus,                 between toes, genitalia, armpit.

Figure 2: BV-2 cells, transfected with 5 μg pAc-GFP, captured under the microscope with a green fluorescent filter.
Discussion:
As we didn’t manage to observe the GFP in the cells that were transfected with our vector, there was no reason to continue to the next step of the experiment. However, in our discussion, we arrived to an alternative explanation of No GFP result. We suggested that maybe the cells were successfully transfected and had the plasmids in them but maybe the F4/80 promoter was too weakly expressed so that a GFP was below our detection limit.
Conclusion:
The experiment with our plasmid px601-f4/80-g2 (and the rest of our plasmids with the same goal but with different guide sequences) failed. We concluded that continuing with the attempted method and plasmid would be time consuming and we would have to check for many different reasons as of why did the transfection failed. Therefore we made a change in our course of action and decided to try to accomplish the inhibition of the NFκB pathway with a different approach using Lentiviral vectors.

Title: Transfection of the C8-D30 astrocytes and BV-2 microglia cell lines with PUC-GFP vector.
Conducted by:Liat Tsoran and Ori Tulchinsky
Date:
Aim: In this experiment we have tried to use jetPEI-Macrophage and jetPRIME     transfection reagent in order to transfect microglia cells (BV2) and     astrocyte cells (C8-D30), respectively, while using HEK-cell as a positive     control. The use of HEK cell-line as a positive control, is due to its     transfectability by the various techniques.
Importance: This experiment was carried out in parallel with experiments using     different methods of transfection (different reagents, calcium phosphate     and electrophoresis) in order to find an efficient way of inserting our plasmids into microglia for the continuation of the project.

The samples were again centrifuged at 16,000 × g for two minutes and the supernatant containing excess CV was discarded. The pelleted biofilm was then washed with 800 µL of 95% EtOH without resuspension, centrifuged for 30 seconds, and the EtOH was discarded. The EtOH wash was repeated twice more for a total of three washes. The samples were then resuspended in 200 µL EtOH, transferred to a 96-well plate, and incubated for five minutes. The plate was then shaken for ten seconds and absorbance readings were taken for each sample at 540 nm.
In visually inspecting the samples before transferring them to the plate for the reading, several of the samples showed significant differences from the rest of the samples. The pelleted biofilm in samples 1,2,5,6,8,10,11, and 12 were not retaining any of the stain. Each of these samples was treated in a different style eppendorf than the rest, and it is believed that the different eppendorf style was enough to cause the washes to affect the biofilms differently. After discussion, it was decided that these samples would not be read as there was an obvious difference in the way that they reacted to the treatment.
The data from the plate reading is shown below:
This data from the plate reading was then transferred to a spreadsheet and analyzed to correct for the baseline, determine the average reading for each treatment, and determine standard deviations. Data is shown below:
From this data we graphed the averge absorbance readings for samples treated with 0, 2.5, 12.5, and 25 µL of α-Amylase treated at time T = 0, as this treatment time had the most significant impact on the biofilm growth:
There is a distinct reduction in the amount of biofilm growth between untreated and treated samples, with samples treated with 25 µL α-Amylase showing a 65.8% decrease in biofilm formation after 48 hours. We are currently rerunning the assay to confirm these results in triplicate. While this clearly shows the ability of α-Amylase to inhibit biofilm formation by V. cholerae, further characterization is needed to determine the capacity of α-Amylase to degrade preexisting biofilms.

Professor Medvedik had transformed our UV+pSB1C3 ligations over the weekend on chlor 50ug/mL and 150ug/mL plates. They both grew colonies. I picked six colonies from the 150ug/mL plate and restreaked them onto another plate and let them grow overnight.
I also took those six colonies and put them in 200μL of water, vortexed that, and then took out 20μL of each into PCR tubes. 2.5μL of iGem VF2 and 2.5μL of iGem VR 10mM primers were used. As a control, one of the pSB1A3 plasmids with an approximately 1Kb insert that the De Novo team made was also used with these primers. The PCR was run using PCR program #500. 5μL of each of these were run on a gel with a Versa ladder. See ""Gel of UV+pSB1C3 using sequencing primers""
I inoculated colonies 1 and 3 of HSP+pACYC184 in 5mL LB so we can do a midi prep on them tomorrow. 7.4μL of 34mg/mL stock concentration chlor was used to give a 50ug/mL concentration. It was put in the shaker at 3PM and left overnight.
6/26/14
Glycerol stocks of 500μL 60% glycerol and 500μL of the HSP+pACYC184 colony (one for colony #1 and one for colony #3) were made and put in the -80 freezer.
A gel was run of the digest from Monday of GFP+pBR322 and UV+pACYC184 cut with XhoI and KpnI. The results again appeared to show that the two plasmids had been mixed up. What we thought was UV+pACYC184 seemed to be GFP+pBR322 and vice versa. Since this was now the second time that this happened, we are thinking that maybe the two epindorfs were mislabled. In order to check this, we will take some of each with our amplification primers and see which ones give PCR products. This hasn't been done yet, but will be done next week.

Kyoto Institute of Technology
We are students of '''KIT'''-''Kyoto Institute of Technology''.
Our University KIT is one of the National Universities located in Matsugasaki Kyoto, Japan. Kyoto is a very famous city of Japan.It had been Japanese capital for over millenium, and its history has built up its unique, traditional culture.    KIT has ties with this traditional culture and industries in Kyoto and has been advancing knowledge in engineering, design, and textile science. By pursuing ‘human-friendly practical science,’ KIT and its two predecessors have been serving our society for over a century.   KIT has Drosophila Genetic Resource Center(DGRC). The DGRC collects Drosophila stocks from laboratories all over the world, maintains them, and provides them to researchers upon request. There are only three Drosophila resorce center in the world !  Drosophila is an essential model organism for life science research as a result of its long-term use in genetic research.  KIT has great achievements in this genetic field.  And, KIT has departments not only of science but also of arts. It is rare in Japanese national universities! So KIT has philosophy that we will develop an academic community, which aspires to the fusion of science and art cultivated from the foundation of KIT.  So it is no doubt that KIT is the best university to participate iGEM projects!    KIT encourages students to participate in internships, experience the realm where design and science converge and take part in projects with our partner universities abroad. KIT also promotes collaboration in business and research with industries. The close rapport maintained with area industries over the past 100 years has allowed us to continue to have our fingers on the pulse of Kyoto design and technology.   Finally, KIT financially supports our team.

Cellulase
Over 1 billion people in the world go hungry [1]. Each year, 3 million under-five children die because they are undernourished. For infants and young children, the effects of chronic malnutrition in the early years of life are largely irreversible. Many countries that suffer from high rates of malnourishment rely on diets high in plant sources and cereal crops. Foods such as these have a high cellulose content. Cellulose is a tough material that makes up the cell walls of plant cells. Humans lack the digestive enzymes required to break down this tough substance, and so it is commonly referred to as dietary fibre. Cellulose is made up of repeating units of glucose molecules, and as such, is a large store of energy.In addition, polysaccharides such as cellulose form viscous gel-like structures that trap starch, proteins and fats which would otherwise be accessible to the digestive enzymes and transport systems. If people in these countries could find a way to gain more nutrional value from their food, then malnutrition rates in these countries could be significantly reduced.
Ruminants survive on a diet high plant matter through the breakdown of cellulose and xylan by their gut microflora. Non-ruminants, such as humans, are unable to release much of the energy found in these compounds, and so must rely on an omnivorous diet. Of course, the transfer of energy between trophic levels is notoriously poor. If non-ruminants were able to obtain more energy from plant matter, the net effeciency of energy transfer would be raised reducing the volume of food required in a diet.
Cellulases are often added to chicken feed in order to get the maximum possible nutritional content from the food.This method is widely used in poultry farming, especially with diets high in non-starch polysaccharides. This allows the tough cellulose cell walls to be broken down, and allows the nutrious contents to be absorbed.
Our solution would be in the form of a dietary supplement to be taken alongside foods with high cellulose contents, to allow for digestion of the cellulose within the gut. This would be especially beneficial in countries with less refined and processed diets, and hopefully the additional nutrional value gained from foods would lower rates of malnutrition in these countries.
Cellulases come in a number of types, and break down cellulose in different ways to different extents."

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," that our biofilm can be strongly linked to the enamel surface, we managed to get some teeth from a cow (Bos taurus) (figure 19.).  We cut them in small pieces of similar size (~1cm3) and place them in a 96-well plate. Afterwards the well was filled with 5 mL of cell culture, induced and incubated for 40 hours at room temperature, without shaking. The strains used for the investigation are summarized in table 9:
Table 9.  Summary table of the strains used for the experiment of hydroxyapatite attachment.
Once the dental pieces had enough time to be covered with specific curli-generating cells, we designed two different protocols for measuring the efficiency of the affinity tag. In both cases, the cells were expressing RFP (red fluorescent protein) under a constitutive promoter. Thus, the number of cells that remained attached to the surface could be calculated out of the fluorescence intensity.
We tried to measure the remaining cells attached to the dental surface after submerging it in water for 2 seconds. The first approach included a direct measurement technique: measuring RFP presence using a Typhoon ® Fluorescence Scanner (figure 20).
Figure 20. Typhoon ® Fluorescence reader, used for measuring the remaining RFP signal after rinsing the tooth samples with water. This way, the differences in the attachment can be measured.
On the other hand, we also measured the cells attached to the tooth by putting the samples in an ethanol (70%) solution for 5 minutes. Consequently, the cells will detach and float in the supernatant. When we measure the fluorescence intensity of this ethanol supernatant, we will be able to discriminate if there is actually a difference in the attachment properties of tagged and untagged cells. Detailed information of the nomenclature used in the figures of this section can be found in table 10.

Results and discussion
We tested the RFP presence in the tooth samples (figure 21) with a fluorescence scanner, obtaining the following results (figure 22):

 Our Takeaways
Through our collaboration with other iGEM teams we indeed felt the sense of community in iGEM. While Singapore is a small country, our shared goals and interests have brought us together to brainstorm ideas and tackles daring problems that may be unimaginable for us, if not for this competition. As such, we feel that our journey in collaboration is indeed invaluable and a memorable one."

Week 11 : 5th of September to 11th of September
Monday
Team members are taking occasional holidays (we probably need it, given the hours we're working). By chance, it's only the men of the team in this week, and coincidentally the lab reaches the pits of untidiness and there's a team curry-night on Thursday.
Tuesday
Wednesday
The team have sent out a questionnaire to past iGEMers, to have a look at the ways they think    iGEM has affected their career, and all sorts of other interesting things. A fair few of our     respondents told us that they'd be happy to be interviewed; the day is spent filming them in     person (if they're sufficiently local) or recording skype conversations (for those who are not). iGEM seems not just to be changing peoples' career paths, but also altering peoples' scientific  mindsets from a more traditional kind, to an interdisciplinary syn-bio variety. Given that iGEM  was set up by some of the great syn-bio evangelists, this was perhaps - partly! - the purpose of the competion.
Thursday
Felix, the 'machine' of the team was either sufficiently crazy to begin with, or has been made so by iGEM that he's been working 15 hour lab shifts this week, even streamlining his lunch in an effort to squeeze more work out of the day.
Another scientific discovery emerges phoenix-like from the ashes of an amateurish blunder (perhaps we should screw up more often). A thin film is spun with less material than usual owing to a"

Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Centrifugation)
Note: All centrifugation steps are carried out at 17.900 x g (13.000 rpm) in a conventional table-top microcentrifuge
Preparation
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg gel - 100 µL). The maximum amount of gel per spin column is 400 mg. For >2 % agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2-3 minutes to help dissolve the gel. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow(similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, ad mix. The mixture turns yellow.
Binding of DNA
Add 1 volume isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube. To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min until all the samples have passed through the column. Discard the flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. For sample volumes >800 µL, load and spin again.
Washing
If DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing,

Introduction:  Today gel extraction and digestion of PCquad 3.0 will be done.  If permitting, ligation will also be done.
Procedures: Gel extraction was performed as indicated by zymo procedures.  The concentration was measured using the nanodrop.  78.78ng/uL.  260/280 = 3.23.
Since the yield was too low, another round of amplification will need to be done before digestion.
Conclusions:  There weren’t any restriction enzymes available to use, so digestion will be done next week.  PCR amplification will be done in a larger volume for PCquad 3.0 as well.
Intro: Performed a 50 uL PCR amplification of Mutant #10. PCR cleanup.

If we were to experiment with other parameters, we would also observe similar feats to the aforementioned. For instance, we may choose to use our model to predict the effects of enzyme engineering of phaA or bktB. This be in the form of modification of the turnover number or the enzyme’s catalytic capacity (kcat) or of its specificity to each of its substrates. For example, it may be possible to engineer the binding pocket of the enzyme to be less conducive for acetyl-CoA thus accentuating the preference for propionyl-CoA substrate.
Unfortunately, with the current model testing the various Michaelis constants (Km) is not possible. This is due to how the reactions producing PHB and PHV are parallel to each other (as commented on above). Thus, we decided to test a wide range of turnover rates for phaA and bktB. One of the main observations that resonates with previous simulations. The maximal predicted molar composition of PHV is shown to also be approximately 30%; the composition remains the same while the total PHBV produced increases as long as the reagents are not limiting.
Testing the dynamic model reveals its severe limitations when it does encompass the various relevant pathways for PHA biosynthesis. To optimize it would require a significant array of data. One of the main caveats in using this type of model to understand cell factory design is that it is does not account for cell growth. We represent the mixture of enzymes as a single-compartment, homogeneous system and thus cannot use it to predict growth phenotypes. For this latter purpose, it was decided to use a constraint-based modeling approach.
