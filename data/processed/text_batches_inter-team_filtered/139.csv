Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html," 9. Schematic of the total system designed to improve toxin expression through changing population dynamics of E. coli. This system combines quorum sensing and the system designed to form subpopulations. luxI, luxR and GFP, λ cI, 434 cI and mRFP represent protein-encoding genes. AHL represents acyl-homoserine lactones. LuxR-AHL represents the LuxR protein bound to acyl-homoserine lactones. Arrows between component indicate induction of expression, production or activation. Bar-headed lines denote repression.
Experimentally, we have shown the dynamics of quorum sensing with a newly constructed reporter . Quorum sensing can be used to change the expression pattern of Cry toxins in time to minimize negative effects of Cry toxin toxicity to E. coli. In addition, we propose a system for subpopulation formation to further decrease effects of Cry toxin toxicity on BeeT. Despite our efforts to test the system, we cannot draw a definite conclusion on whether the system indeed is able to induce subpopulation formation. We submitted all mentioned constructs to the registry to allow future teams to use them.
Toggle Switch
Because of the importance of controlling the toxin production, we took two different approaches towards this goal.Although quorum sensing system could be a good strategy to keep BeeT’s toxin expression in a reasonable range, it is possibly difficult to apply this system into realistic beehive conditions since BeeT may not growth to a certain density in the brood cells. Therefore, we engineered a regulatory system possibly more suitable for the beehive context as a strategy to integrate mite sensing and light-control for regulating BeeT’s toxin expression. The designed system is based on a toggle switch. It consists of two repressors and allows controlling BeeT’s toxin expression under two different stimulus, guanine or vitamin B12 and blue light. This toggle switch is based on a well-known genetic toggle switch 1 . The mutual repression of two repressor proteins results in bi-stability of the system. The two steady states are off-state and on-state. In our toggle switch, the on-state leads to the stable expression of BeeT’s toxin and it is only reached when the system detects that both BeeT is in the beehive，where light is absent, and mites are present in the brood cells, where guanine or vitamin B12 can be sensed. In conclusion, we constructed a regulatory system that could be applied into real beehive and it integrates mite sensing with light-control device, which could provide a stable output of toxin expression with fast responsiveness.

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," in the audience said that they were opposed to Synthetic Biology.
The Arguments
Synthetic Biology is hard to define, even scientist struggle with the definition. We thus began our presentation by showing what synthetic biology may be defined as. The following definition was used:  “ (a) the design and fabrication of biological components and systems that do not already exist in the natural world (b) the re-design and fabrication of existing biological systems” (source: http://syntheticbiology.org/FAQ.html).
Though to describe Synthetic Biology as engineering is a controversial matter, as Simon Munnery says “The engineering equivalent of genetic engineering is to get a bunch of concrete and steel, throw it into a river, and if you can walk across, call it a bridge”. We also thought we would briefly explain in our introduction, how the concept of Synthetic Biology worked; explaining how we use bacterial DNA to give a different function to yeast, and the basic concept of biobricks. We introduced what iGEM was, its goals and past projects, such as the arsenic biosensor.  We proceeded to discuss the influence of media and public perception in Synthetic Biology. Breakthroughs such as the organism designed from scratch by Craig Venter has lead to a lot of worry in the general public that scientists are tampering with life. It is mostly fear and lack of understanding, which will slow down the development of useful products through Synthetic Biology.
The rest of the presentation was used to explain the benefits of Synthetic Biology in more detail. Synthetic Biology is unique in it being able to design and create a product which can suit a specific need. There are many areas in which this would be useful. Synthetic Biology is applicable in renewable energy where research into bio alcohols, photosynthetic algae and hydrogen fuel is looking to solve the global dependence on fossil fuels and reducing damaging emissions. Synthetic Biology has in the past been used to create effective medicines, such recombinant DNA technology to produce human insulin from bacteria. Cheaper pharmaceuticals to treat malaria are also being designed and tested by the use of Synthetic Biology. In the future synthetic biology might be able to produce personalized medicine. The use of Synthetic Biology extends even further.  Agriculture and environment protection can be substantially improved.
Synthetic biologists are testing disease resistant and high yield plants. These can be complemented with environmentally friendly and safe micro-organism which can reduce water dependence and eliminate chemical fertilizers. They are using experiments that entail combining metabolic components from different organism to improve nutritional components in plants, like increased amounts of food grade protein. This could be a great and efficient way to help famine str"

The glucanase-pBAD construct was further used for protein expression. Protein expression was induced by adding arabinose (protocols).
Induction of protein expression
The induction of protein expression was verified after small-/or medium-scale cell culturing, followed by separation of proteins on a 12 % SDS-PAGE (Figure 3). The results show that the endo-1,3-β -glucanase expression was induced after addition of 0.1 % arabinose followed by a 3 h incubation at 30oC (protocol).

Screening for Polysaccharide Endo-Hydrolases using Insoluble Dyed Polysaccharide
Insoluble dyed substrate is used to detect enzyme activity ( protocol ).
Figure 4: 96-well plate assay to test enzyme activity (Megazyme) Absorbance of the glucanase was measured against diluted samples of a standard for enzyme activity (Zymolyase, Nordic Biosite). The glucanase activity was tested with samples from induced cell cultures (crude extract, supernatant and cell pellet). Absorbance was measured 1 h after loading the samples on the 96-well plate.
From Figure 4, it can be seen that the glucanase had an activity in between a 100x and 1.000x dilution of Zymolyase. Of the different cell samples from the induced cell culture, the glucanase from the supernatant had the highest enzymatic activity. We expect the glucanase to have a higher enzymatic activity after further experiments purifying the protein.

After seeing our transcriptional regulators react to an ampicillin regiment, a liquid benzaldehyde toxicity test was used to characterize our transcriptional regulators. Log-phase cells were inoculated at an OD=0.1 in various benzaldehyde concentrations, and optical densities were measured over 24 hours on a Thermo-Scientific Genysys30 Vis-spectrophotometer at wavelength 600 nm. This experiment was performed under the same protocol as the ampicillin assay, and a more detailed experimental protocol can be found in the methods section.

Deuxième étape : Le développement du vecteur tissulaire
Le vecteur tissulaire est injecté au patient à un temps t, proche de t2. Le Nombre de vecteurs injectés (Nbi) est de 1x10^6. Le tropisme pulmonaire du vecteur n’est pas parfait, seul un Pourcentage (Pp) va au poumon. Le nombre total de vecteurs tissulaires dans le corps augmente, car ce vecteur est de type bactérien et possède donc un Temps de Doublement (DTB).
On peut ainsi établir que le Nombre de vecteurs tissulaires dans les poumons (Nb(t)) est égal à :
Le nombre de vecteurs tissulaires augmente jusqu’à l’injection de la doxycycline, où dès lors ces derniers sont lysés pour libérer les vecteurs cellulaires dans le poumon.
Ce temps d’injection n’est pas anodin. En effet, si l’on attend suffisamment longtemps, le nombre de vecteurs tissulaires est suffisant pour éliminer la tumeur ou du moins la réduire de façon importante. A l'inverse, si l'on attend trop longtemps, une dose de doxycycline plus importante (et donc potentiellement toxique) est nécessaire pour libérer les vecteurs cellulaires .
On peut ainsi se servir de la modélisation pour déterminer le Temps optimal d’Injection de la doxycyline (Tdox).
Haut de page
Troisième étape : La libération du vecteur cellulaire
Une fois la doxycycline injectée, le vecteur cellulaire est libéré. Le nombre de vecteurs cellulaires est proportionnel au nombre de vecteurs tissulaires dans le poumon. Or, on sait que la valeur moyenne de Phages recombinants libérés par M. avium (Npl) est égale à 100.
On peut écrire que le Nombre de vecteurs cellulaires au moment de l’injection (Np(Tdox)) est égal à :
Le nombre de vecteurs cellulaires ne croit pas comme pour le vecteur tissulaire . En effet, il décroit au fur et à mesure du temps, à cause de la stabilité du phage et de son internalisation cellulaire"

During iGEM, I was carrying out a master in Synthetic and Systems Biology in Evry, but I had a background mainly in biochemistry, more precisely in the proteins study. I learnt about iGEM during my Bachelor degree and I have always wanted to participate since then, but I couldn’t make it before this year.
My motivations? I wanted to discover lots of new interesting things in biology (wet lab as well as computer science) and share a great adventure with students from various fields. My hobbies? I enjoy reading novels and watching movies. A fun fact about me? I have no sense of direction, to the point that I lost my way in the lab several times during the first month of experiments.
My ideal synthetic biology project would have an environmental angle with, for example, bioremediation or pollutant detection involved. After the Jamboree, I will start a  PhD about DNA transport through nanopores.

I truly believe in the synthetic biology idea of what you cannot construct/explain, you cannot understand! In the team, I am doing what nobody wants to do, or what I feel needed to be done... Mostly wetlab and side tasks! The best synthetic biology project is ours, for sure!
I only want my career to be interesting and I think orthogonal biology is an awesome topic!

As everyone around (meeeeeh, except Taman, maybe), Science brought me here. I surely loved the concept of iGEM, of making some good and efficient fun from interesting ideas, and eventually spreading the whole story all around. And as the French philosopher Auguste Comte (almost) said, you can’t entirely know the science when you don’t know the story. So there, was the why.
The how, now. After a technical degree in industrial biology, a BSc in population biology and a MSc in microbiology, I signed to join the thrilling army of mSSBers, discovering, let’s say, the motivating,"

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"According to him, who was influenced by Jungian Psychology[12], humans are born with a psychological construct inherited from their father’s fathers i.e. the collective subconscious[13]. Psyche can perceive the material world with its senses, but can only perceive the ideological world through words. Words, whether scientific or not, their influence has been coursing through our veins for thousands of years. As the meanings of words and stories multiply with the evolvement of human experience in time, their initial impact on human psyche has not been totally diminished. Instead, they have a very basic mode, a simple construct with perhaps not much logic, and have become metaphors in our psyche. Psyche speaks in metaphors, from which our gut-deep emotions are translated into. This has been verified by the psychoanalytic school of thought.[4]
     However, the solution to this nightmare is also present in the same story: Although God lost control of Lucifer, he designed an environment specifically to contain him, the Hell. To prevent the synthesized life from escaping control, kill switches and other kinds of repression methods are usually installed into the organism. So the organism, if its existence exceeds the intention of its master, will be disposed of quite effectively, like bringing a internalized Hell with it wherever it goes.
     However, why some people would always have an instinctual worry that something as an artificial engineered organism might end up malignant or out of control despite the initial goodwill with which scientists start their project? The safety tests are proved by independent scientists and organizations, and in some countries such as the United Kingdom, public consultation is held [iGEM Edinburgh, 2009], so why is that the skeptics always would be skeptic, despite evidence and persuasion from sources that our logic and reason would agree? Do they not listen to their reason? Are they really that scientifically illiterate as claimed by some scientific researchers? Some skeptics are also accomplished persons in other areas and their sanity and rationality are proved normal if not better than those who do not doubt.
     It’s undeniable that the most stubborn reactions of the skeptics are doubt and fear, which are usually read as a sign of weakness either of intelligence or of character and therefore despised and dismissed. Explanations of it are usually limited to the simple words of doubt or fear and just stopped there. But fear and doubt also have their origins, and since it’s deemed irrational, then perhaps its source is irrational too. If our mind is largely composed of irrationality, then is it really necessary to speak of it as a plague instead of thinking of ways to understand it?

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#dataAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"iciency virus (HIV), and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), could be prevented through behavioral changes and infection controlling. Reducing unnecessary sun exposure can also prevent skin cancer effectively. At the same time, regular physical examination can help detecting early cancer. Thereby greatly increasing the survival rate, this could also be the reason for half of the teams focus on detecting cancer. The primary modalities of cancer treatment are surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, immune therapy, and targeted therapy, so it is innovative for the iGEM teams to treat cancer with synthetic biology.
E. Antibiosis
In the statistics, we found that projects focusing on Antimicrobial accounted the largest proportion in the Health and Medicine track, which shows the public attention in this area. According to our data, the amount of antibacterial projects are increasing year by year, and maintains a high level all the time. There are 37 projects in total of which most occur in North America, Europe and Asia. Thus, we looked into this area and find some interesting things. In the survey, we found that infectious disease, such as tuberculosis, meningitis, bacterial meningitis, cholera and influenza caused by bacteria, has a great impact on human health. There is also a big difference in their level of health care that it is difficult to prevent pathogen infection effectively in some areas because of different levels of economic development among regions. As a result, some of these projects try to prevent disease by detecting specific bacteria in vitro. Besides, antibiotic resistance is also a threat to us. Since the overuse of antibiotics, some bacteria have evolved resistance characteristics. For example, there were about 480 000 new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in 2013 and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has been found in 100 countries. Antibiotic resistance greatly hinders the prevention, control and treatment of infectious diseases and therefore new treatments against pathogens have been a focus of attention. Actually most of these projects have involved the treatment of communicable disease or killing pathogens. Some of them even involve a detection module to avoid breaking the ecological balance in vivo. We assume that there will be more teams study in this area and make further exploration to fight pathogens through synthetic biology.

Synechocystis conjugation BioBricks
Carbon fixation BioBrick
Project Description
Introduction
CO2 emissions have recieved a lot of attention in modern times, due to concerns that high emission levels are facilitating global warming. Consequently, a lot of research is focused on ways of reducing CO2 emissions from industry, and ways of fixating atmospheric CO2 at a greater than normal rate.
Our project is attempting to produce a BioBrick, which when placed inside photosynthetic bacteria, increases their rate of CO2 fixation. In order to achieve this, we first need to construct a BioBrick that allows inducible expression of non native genes in our chassis; Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
Making a Synechocystis compatible vector
In order to start working with Synechocystis, we have to construct a plasmid that will allow insertion of foreign genes into the Synechocystis genome. As Synechocystis does not retain inserted plasmids, transformations must make use of conjugation in order to make the insert part its genome.
To achieve this we have constructed a plasmid with eight parts:
""Right flank"" sequence
Constitutionally active promoter + RBS
LacI repressor gene
Kanamycin resistance
LacI inducible promoter + RBS
Red fluorescent protein
""Left flank"" sequence
Plasmid backbone
The flank sequences have been chosen such that they are homologous to a pair of sequences in a neutral site of the Synechocystis genome. When this plasmid is transformed into Synechocystis, the DNA between the two flank sequences is conjugated into its genome. By growing cultures in a selection medium containing Kanamycin, the insert is kept inside the genome, allowing us to express foreign genes inside the organism.

The Jump start event: The preparation of Minds
 
 
The first of September we hosted the “Meeting of young minds” kick-off, the Preparation of Minds for the Jamboree event Friday, Sept. 30 . This day was organized in collaboration with initiator the Rathenau Instituut. This institute stimulates the research and debate on science and technology. All day long the political youth parties and all Dutch iGEM teams listened to talks about the future of synthetic biology and bio ethics. There was also a short discussion on different views towards these still developing standards.  The speakers were most Dutch iGEM teams ( Amsterdam , Wageningen , Delft ), TU Delft professor Luuk van der Wielen ( BE Basic ), Politician Chantal Gillard, Wageningen University Professor Henk van der Belt and COGEM’s bio-safety specialist Huib de Vriend.
It was a very lively evening with enthusiastic discussions amongst scientists and politicians. The guest speakers were addressing complicated issues together and the audience, young scientists and politicians, eagerly joined in. When the time for organised discussion was up it quickly resumed in the bar accompanied with some drinks. A short video compilation was made by the Rathenau Instituut to give an illustration of the evening. We would like to thank the Rathenau for the oppertunity to host this day and for the agreement that we are allowed to show the movie on our website!
The 30th of September the Rathenau Instituut will organise the “Meeting of young Minds” day in collaboration with the European iGEM Committee 2011 . As a warm-up for the jamboree iGEM participants can debate with young Dutch politicians on the future of synthetic biology based on techno-moral vignettes developed by the Rathenau Instituut in cooperation with T"

We then decided to run the miniprep products on a gel to determine if they are larger than the expected size of pOPPY-XLR2-yX. In our first attempt, we diluted the miniprep products to about 1ng/ul and saw no bands because there was not enough DNA to be visible on the gel. We then repeated with miniprep products diluted to about 50ng/ul, and saw bands for several samples above the 10kb band on the ladder. We submitted 3 of these for Sanger sequencing through Sequetech, using primers for various points on the gene cassette.
All 5 transformant populations with our new Gibson Assembly product showed growth after overnight incubation. We selected 10 isolated colonies from each plate as well as 2 from a D17 control plate to create an index plate as well as perform colony PCR. After imaging, we selected colonies 2, 16, 27, 32, 43, and 51 as likely carriers of pOPPY_GFP(1)--pOPPY_GFP(5) and D17, respectively. All continued experiments up to this point have been focused on growing cultures of these colonies, isolating their plasmids, sequencing, and transforming into our Yali cell line.

It was tested at several concentrations (OD* 0,01 and OD* 0,02). c) Construct that allows constitutive expression of luciferase under a strong promoter (35s Promoter). d) Graphic representation of luciferase expression levels after 48 hours post infiltration (blue) and 96 hours post infiltration (red). *Final Optical Density of Agrobacterium tumefaciens culture.
As Figure 8 shows, the expression of luciferase under the strong promoter (35s promoter) decreases along with time because of the high metabolic load in the cell plant. However, there is no differential luciferase expression between both different recombinase expression concentrations when the inducible reporter was already activated before adding PhiC31. Suggesting that decrease of luciferase expression observed in the aforementioned experiment was not caused by metabolic load but by the formation of PhiC31 unproductive complexes.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that metabolic load cannot explain the counter-intuitive hypothesis previously reported. That means PhiC31 unproductive complex formation hypothesis may be the correct one.
RECOMBINASE DIRECTIONALITY FACTOR (RDF) PERFORMANCE
In order to increase the genetic control over the expression of any color inducing protein through a viral vector strategy, a modular and orthogonal AND gate was designed. In normal basis, plant would be constitutively expressing PhiC31 recombinase and the stress-inducible promoter would be in OFF state (i.e. in opposite direction to the desired CDS) . In this case, PhiC31 attachment sites have been already recombined (attR and attL), being PhiC31 uncapable of inversing them back by itself. To do so a helper protein is required, so called recombinase directionality factor ( RDF ). With this approach recombinase switch becomes more robust, stable and less leaky.

Team Activity Tests:
After getting our interesting activity measurement results, we had to figure out which fraction is going to be used in the following experiments and how much laccase it contains besides other proteins. We agreed, that the most active fraction contains 90 % laccase, which is commonly used in the literature. Since we applied the same protein amount of each fraction for the activity measurements, we made sure that the results really correspond to the amount of laccase. These are the most active fractions we have chosen with their contained laccase amount:

2. Transcription level
To test the transcription level of our desired genes, we did a series of RT PCR. Besides, as birA is an endogenous gene of E.coli BL21(DE3), we didn’t test it.  From figure 5 we could draw a conclusion that accA, pccB and sfp were transcripted as expected.
Figure 5: Transcription level of accA、pccB and sfp, with 16S rRNA2 as the reference gene. ACC: accA; PCC: pccB; SFP: sfp.
3. SDS-PAGE
We detected target protein of the metabolically engineered strain of E. coli BL21(DE3) by SDS-PAGE.
Figure 6: Analysis of the cell disruption product, from which we can see accA、birA and sfp were produced. PccB was not found, but the result of mass spectrometry analysis shows that the expected product triketide lactone was produced, meaning that pccB was translated successfully in our engineered E.coli, too.
Conclusion
We constructed the chassis during August and detected whether it works as expected in the early September. From result 1 and result 2, we can safely draw a conclusion that our chassis was successfully constructed. The later MS analysis shows that it works as expected. As the first desired product triketide lactone was detected and proved our chassis does work, we will see whether it works with other polyketide synthase we transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3).

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"

 Protease-based Logic Collection
Our Protease-based Logic Collection is composed of sets of parallel, antiparallel and destabilized coiled coils in fusion with parts of split luciferase.         These constructs represent a tool for constructing logic circuits in mammalian cells operating at the post-translational level. The input signals for our         logic operations is proteolytic activity of selected orthogonal proteases, representing constitutive logic gates, or split TEV and PPV proteases on inducible         systems, representing inducible logic gates.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Implementation#methodology_-_-_TEXT.html," During the development of the L.A.S.S.O. we attempted to apply as many of the points given in the quality management standards 9001 and 13845 as we could. Standard 9001 dictates the procedures for general quality management; giving standards a company should follow when developing a product. Standard 13485 expands on 9001 to specify how a medical device should be developed. We followed these standards in the design and construction2 of the L.A.S.S.O. wherever possible.
Following ISO development criteria compels the completion of a Requirements Document - documentation to show how we were meeting the users needs, the final aims of how the L.A.S.S.O. would operate and the functionality involved. Construction of the first version3 of the Requirements Document was itself an iterative process, updated after feedback from our supervisors, patients and medical staff. This iterative authoring process was again in line with protocol dictated by ISO standards. This first version was audited by an approved Quality Manager for ISO 13845. A second revision 4 was constructed based on  feedback from the audit and again in consultation with the CF community.

Abstract

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  The gBlocks and primers have all arrived.  They will be resuspended, and the initial amplification will be done.
Procedures:
Both primers were resuspended in TE buffer to a total concentration of 100uM.  A 10uM stock was then made by diluting in ddH2O.  The gblocks were resuspended in 200uL TE buffer to a final concentration of 5ng/uL.  A working stock of 1ng/uL was then made using water.
PCR: From NEB, the annealing temperature determined was 65C, so a temperature gradient was ran for each gblock amplification at 61C, 65C, and 69C.
A master mix was created for 6 reactions with the following reagents per reaction. 5x Q5 buffer, 5uL 2mM dNTP, 2.5uL 10uM PCquad prime 3.0 primer F, 1.25uL 10uM PCquad prime 3.0 primer R, 1.25uL 0.25uL Q5 polymerase 0.25uL of 1ng/uL template Water up to 25uL.
The master mix was made without the template, and 24uL were aliquotted to 6 PCR tubes.  The template was added individually to each PCR tube.
Thermocycle conditions: Initial denaturation: 98C, 30s 25 cycles of the following: 98C, 10s; annealing temp, 15sec; 72C 30s Final extension: 72C 5min Hold: 4C

      In addition to exploration, explanation and prediction, the ultimate  goal of science is creation.  In the  field of life science, enthusiasm towards creation originates the synthetic  biology.  During the last decade, numerous  artificial biological networks had been made by rearranging the exited biological  macromolecules.  Recently, creation of the  macromolecules inside biological networks emerges as a hotspot.  Because of structural simplicity and manipulation  convenience, RNA becomes an ideal model for conducting such researches. 
      This year, in iGEM 2012 competition, the first  software that designs temperature-sensing regulatory RNA - RNAThermo is  reported by iGEM Tsinghua-D Team.   Structural and functional verifications of the designed RNATs were  made.  RNAThermo’s potential application  in the fermentation industry is discussed:   the software provides a new method for achieving controlled expression of products in the fermentation industry.

Colombia,2012,Team:Colombia#Project#Problem_-_-_TEXT.html," wilt, bacterial wilt, and brown rot of potato. Although Solanaceae (potato family) contains the greatest number of susceptible species, many other dicot and a few monocot plants are also susceptible. The important agricultural crops attack by this phytopathogen includes: Potato (Solanum tuberosum); Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum); Aubergine (egg plant) (Solanum melongena); Banana, (Musa spp); Geranium (common name) (Pelargonium); Ginger (Zingiber officinale); Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum); Sweet pepper (Capsicum spp); Olive (Olea europea) (USDA,2011). According to the USDA is considered an invasive organism and as there are no chemicals or biological agents that adequately control these bacteria. Infected plants MUST be discarded as soon as possible (Moorman B.M.,2012).
Figure 1. Tomato infection by Ralstonia (Taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralstonia_solanacearum ) .
Engineering any type of solution against Ralstonia solanacearum carries enormous potential for our country. As a matter of fact, it is the cause of Moko (Liberato & Gasparotto, 2006), one of the two most important diseases of banana and plantain crops in Colombia (the other one being the fungal black sigatoka), causing in some fields near to 100% of losses (ICA,2003).
Coffee pathogens
Coffee is the most important agricultural product in international trade. Even a small reduction in coffee yields or a modest increase in production costs caused by the rust has a huge impact on the coffee producers, the support services, and even the banking systems in those countries whose economies are absolutely dependent on coffee export (Arneson, 2000).

Coffee rust is the most economically important coffee disease in the world, and in monetary value. This fungus Hemileia vastatrix belongs to the class Basidiomycetes, the order Uredinales, and family Pucciniaceae.

Rutgers,2011,Team:Rutgers#EAS1_-_-_TEXT.html," Sensitivity, Selectivity, Speed, and Noise.
Light - In order to draw on bacteria with a laser pointer, we need the bacteria to respond to light.
Sensitivity - In order to draw naturally, we need the bacteria to respond to extremely quick pulses of light; otherwise, we would have to make very slow strokes.
Selectivity - In order to use the bacteria in ambient lighting, we need to the bacteria to be able to selectively respond to just the laser pointer.
Speed - After we make our strokes with the laser pointer, we would like to see color quickly.
Noise - We do not want random spots to appear on our canvas.                              We have prioritized Light and Sensitivity. This hopefully would result in something that works like an old camera; instant image capture but overnight image development.
 
 
 
The Bacterial Etch-a-Sketch Circuit
Overview
We have broken down the circuit into four states: Deactivated, Activation 1, Activation 2, and Activated. To recap the parts of our circuit: LovTAP represses ptrpL in the light; trpR represses ptrpL; cI434 repressed pRM; cI activates pRM; T7 polymerase (T7 P) transcribes at the T7 promoter; and mRFP1 generates a red color.
Deactivated
Figure 10.
 
In the dark, LovTAP is inactive; transcription levels from ptrpL should be high, creating a lot of cI434 which should shut down transcription from pRM.
 
Activation 1
Figure 11.
After light is applied, LovTAP is activated, repressing transcription from ptrpL. cI434 levels should begin to fall.
 
Activation 2
Figure 12.
Once cI434 levels have dropped enough so that transcription from pRM can begin, the circuit enters an irreversible positive feedback loop. trpR levels will begin to increase, preventing the creation of cI434 by repressing transcription from ptrpL. cI levels will increase, further increasing transcription from pRM. Finally, T7 polymerase levels will increase, allowing the creation of mRFP1.
 
Activated
Figure 13.
After entering the Activation 2 state, the light may be removed, and the cell will continue to produce mRFP1.

Students have used the newsletter as a platform of pursuing further cooperation in specific projects, of promoting special events and even of building friendship with people sharing similar interests.
We would call the newsletter a successful project and meaningful cooperation if iGEMers have found supports, feedbacks and networks through it. It brought us to talk to iGEMers from China, Germany and Switzerland, which we found interesting and encouraging. One of the most valuable resources in synthetic biology is the mind of people involved. Through the newsletter, we tried to maximize the contribution of such intelligent mind to benefit not only iGEM projects, but also, to provide useful feedback to the judges and to further discussion in synthetic biology in general.

Introduction to Model
Designed gene circuit in cell A and cell B
In our project, we designed a quorum-sensing oscillator which consists of two types of cells. The expression of the reporter genes (GFP of one cell type and GFP of another) of the cells of the same type can fluctuate synchronously and certain designs were made to adjust the phase and the period of oscillation. To understand the property of our system, we built a mathematical model based on ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) and DDEs (Delayed Differential Equations) to model and characterize this system. The simulation results helped us to deepen into further characteristics of the system.

Original Full Model
Firstly we described the system thoroughly without leaving out any seemingly unimportant actions and factors. As a result, the description of the system contains every possible mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the parameters were got from literature. The model was represented and simulated in the Matlab toolbox SIMBIOLOGY, but too many parameters make it difficult to do further analyses, So here we only listed all 19 ODEs  and a reletive parameter table( see attached pdf file ).

Simplified DDE
Simplified DDEs
original model contains too many factors for analyzing the general property of system. To understand the essential characters of the oscillator, we simplify the original model according to certain  appropriate assumptions, like Quasi-equilibrium for fast reactions.
After series of derivation based on those assumptions, we came  up with the following set of DDEs (Delay Differential Equations)  which contains only 6 equations, see the figure right. And it   would be much more convenient for us to do some neccessary analyses  and research into the mathematical essence of our model.
Figure shows all variables are oscillating
We coded the system by DDE description in MATLAB and did simulation analysis accordingly. The result showed that the system could oscillate under certain parameters.

To begin with, all of the required reagent solutions were prepared. LB Agar plates (protocol 1) were made using 10g tryptone digest of casein, 5g yeast extract, 5g NaCl, 15g agar and then made up to 1L using milliQ water. Ampicillin (100μg/ml) was then prepared by adding 1gram of ampicillin and 9 ml (9gram) milliQ water so that the total volume was 10ml. LB media was made using 10g tryptone, 5g yeast extract, 5g NaCl and milliQ water to make the media up to 1L.
The bacterial transformation of both BFP and GFP was completed by firstly Pre-incubating the LB-agar plates at 37°C for 2 hours prior. The Ca-competent cells were thawed on ice (4ºC).
Plasmid DNA was added and the tubes stored on ice for 30mins. The tubes were transferred to a rack placed in a preheated water bath (45ºC) and incubated for 30secs. The tubes were then transferred to ice (4ºC) and incubated on ice for 2 min. 800μl of SOC medium was added to each tube and Incubated at 37ºC with gentle shaking (no more that 50rpm) for 45min. 50μl of the transformed"

We think it could be relevant to implement this antibiotic free expression strategy in our project. This is the reason why we designed 2 bricks containing the ccdA gene. In order to carry out transformation, bacteria should be furnished with the ccdB gene in their genome (i.e. by Delphi Genetics).
Conclusions
In this report, we describe a new way to produce a strong bioadhesive. We transferred part of Caulobacter crescentus’s holdfast system in Escherichia coli which produced an adhesive and was able to stick.
We conducted a few experiments in order to characterize the glue. The glue did not show all the expected adhesive properties. However they could be improved by purifying the glue.
In addition, we designed a biological circuit that would allow us to integrate the glue synthesis into a useful application. The circuit described in this report should activate the glue synthesis only in specific spots where repairs are needed. This is achieved by attracting GluColi bacteria to the break and inducing the glue synthesis once the adequate cell density is reached (i.e. thanks to quorum sensing).
For the mathematical modeling part of our project we built a theoretical system which is able to produce the glue. However, we found two main improvements to increase the robustness of the system. Firstly, by considering the complete dynamics of the Quorum Sensing system, we showed that it is possible to controle the glue production only with the quantity of inductor. Secondly, we increased the robustness of our system by adding a toggle switch. This last improvement establishes a connection between the initial concentration of the c2 repressor and the IPTG value we put in the system to start the glue production process.
GluColi has been created, but still needs more research. In particular, further research should focus on:
the analysis of the composition of the glue,
the understanding of the differences between the characteristics of our glue and the original glue from Caulobacter crescentus,
Indeed, the glue should be resistant to water in order to repair ship’s hull without the use of toxic chemicals.
Finally, to allow a precise characterization of the system, the modeling should be refined once the theoretical circuit is implemented in E. coli.

Combing the riboswitch part and the inverter part to clone the designed construct
Out of the ribo-part and the Inv-part, the designed system B/GRInv has been assembled via a 3a-assembly. The transformation of B/GRinv out of B/Gribo and Inv-part in psB1C3 has resulted in three different types of colonies: white, pink and red ones.
Figure 5. The transformation of B/GRinv out of B/Gribo and Inv-part in psB1C3 has resulted in three different types of colonies: white, pink and red. PCR results show that only the pink colonies have the expected size of the B/GRInv
If no guanine or vitamin b12 are present, a colony containing the R/GRInv construct should have a white colour since TetR is expressed when no metabolite is present to bind to the riboswitch. TetR in its turn, will inhibit the promoter that normally expresses mRFP. However, in LB agar, small amounts of vitamin and guanine are present and therefore it is not possible to be sure which colony is the right one based on its colour: white, pink or red.  PCR results show that only the pink colonies have the expected size of the B/GRInv construct as can be seen in figure 5. Sequencing results confirm that the pink colonies contain the right construct.
05 - 20 July
To provide a basic proof of principle of the designed construct, a colony containing the B/GRinv plasmid was grown overnight in 10 mL LB medium. The concentration range of guanine to test the guanine riboswitch construct were based on the concentrations used in previous experiments with guanine riboswitches from B. Subtilis. The concentration range of vitamin b12 was based on the concentrations normally used for testing bacteria that are used to determine the amount of vitamin b12 in human blood.

BGU_Israel,2014,Team:BGU Israel#Notebook1_-_-_TEXT.html," parts of the RNA construct silencing will take place only in the presence of a  specific mRNA. This time we used only one part (part B – hairpin) that is  supposed to have a silencing effect without the presence of the specific mRNA.  We also tested our samples for silencing using RT PCR and flow cytometry (Image  Stream).
Details:
The  changes concluded from former results:
Added positive control and  used only part B hairpin:
Anti eGFP siRNA - 200 pmol
scRNA part B hairpin - 200  pmol
Seeded cells amount was  doubled, back to 100,000 cells per well.
The  rest of the protocol remained unchanged ( general  lipofectamin protocol ).
Results:
Image stream:
scRNA  part B (hairpin) only
Positive  control - anti GFP siRNA
Negative  control-
Representative  image stream pictures:
RealTime PCR:
The housekeeping genes showed unstable expression and thus could not be  used as reliable control, rendering the results of the entire experiments  unreliable.
Conclusions:
The mean intensity in the  GFP positive population of the positive control (anti GFP siRNa) is lower by 28  % of that in the negative control. However, this sequence was tested before and  resulted in much higher silencing rates. With this, and in addition to previous  results, we assume that flow cytometry, the way we use it, tests silencing in  the protein level. Therefore it is likely that the proteins (eGFP is known to  be stable) in the sample did not have enough time to degrade. Therefore, it was  decided that image stream is not efficient test for the scRNA experiments and  the appropriate test would deal with mRNA levels.
The treatment containing  scRNa part B only (hairpin silencing sequence) didn't show any lower GFP  intensity in the GFP positive population, concerning the negative control.
It was assumed that as  image stream Real Time PCR results: Since the housekeeping genes showed  unstable expression no significant result could be drawn regarding neither gene  expression nor gene silencing from the RealTime PCR this time.

POST 3 | A History of Intellectual Property, and Why it Matters to Synthetic Biology: PART 1
As we begin to delve into case studies in synthetic biology, one thing should first be made clear: Intellectual property protections, in the form of trademarks, copyrights and patents, are an old system that has served to protect many types of ideas – books, poems, manufacturing processes, tools, machines, computer programs and architecture designs – and genetic parts are just the newest addition to this list. Indeed, it would not make sense to dive into intellectual property (IP) protections in synthetic biology without first painting a picture of the IP landscape and history in the United States.
In this blog post, we will explore the history of IP protections in the United States, specifically putting emphasis on how and why these IP protection have changed and evolved over time. As you will hopefully come to see, synthetic biology IP protections are emerging as a natural next step in how IP protections adapt to meet new technologies, economies and societal changes. We can (and hopefully you will!) learn a great deal more about IP in synthetic biology simply by studying the history of IP in the United States.
While our discussion on IP law will be framed in the context of the United States, it is important to consider the history of IP laws in other nations throughout history. As will be made clear, IP laws have grown, evolved and changed significantly since their first implementation. The earliest known patent law was instated in Venice in the year 1474. This law enabled the Provveditori di Comun (an executive branch of the Venetian Republic,) to grant 10 year patents to inventors.
“Any person in this city who makes any new and ingenious contrivance, not made heretofore in our dominion, shall, as soon as it is perfected so that it can be used and exercised, give notice of the same to our office of Provved"

Country Profile
Synthetic biology is a relatively new and rapidly growing research field that is considered to hold significant technological potential. As it involves the design and production of biological systems not present in the natural world, synthetic biology resembles an engineering application of biological sciences. Development up to now has mostly been centered in the West, in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, with Japan being East Asia’s one of the early adopters.In more recent years, other East Asian countries have begun to participate on the international synthetic biology stage. But in comparison to western countries, synthetic biology in East Asian countries is still in its infancy. The result is a disparity in information available to the public about synthetic biology developments in these respective regions.
In the interests of amending this situation, we present this document as a reference for progress in synthetic biology in the four East Asian countries/regions and one South East Asian country: Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan, and Indonesia. It includes investigations into research achievements, public perception, regulations and funding that we conducted using local online search engines and our native languages that will hopefully provide with the inside story.

Problem we aim to solve
Genetic engineered bacteria which use plasmid as expression vector are widely                                 employed in many social domains and developed rapidly these years. However,                                 the plasmid segregational instability has been the limitation of scientific                                 research and large-scale industry production for plasmid-based expression system.
So, what’s the plasmid segregational instability?
It’s known that uneven cell division arises frequently which is bound to                                 produce two daughter cells with different plasmid numbers. The cell with                                 less plasmids will produce cells with much less plasmids.
In our project, those cells with not enough plasmid number are called ""Slacker"", on the contrary, ""Worker"" is the name for cells with enough plasmid.
The existence of slackers will sharply decrease the efficiency and profit due to the slacker’s                                 increasing proliferation ability while producing no target substances.
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of the slackers. Can we make                                 the bacteria themselves monitor the plasmid losing situation and eliminate these slackers?                                 In this way, we can enhance the plasmid stability,                                 stabilize the microbial population structure and finally improve the production efficiency.
Project overview
We decide to equip the bacteria with a plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer (P-SLACKiller)
In our project, the inhibitor protein’s concentration is used as a signal to indicate the                                 intracellular plasmid numbers. The sketch map of our basic circuit is shown in Fig.1.
Fig.1 The basic circuit of P-SLACKiller.
We choose a constitutive promoter to express inhibitor gene, and an ""in-promoter"" which                                 is repressed by inhibitor to express killer gene. Under normal circumstances, for                                 plasmid concentration being high enough, our killer is repressed by inhibitor whose                                 concentration is connected with plasmid numbers. However, considering the effect of                                 plasmid segregational instability, the plasmid numbers will decrease, so as the                                 intracellular inhibitor protein. The inadequate inhibitor cannot completely repress the                                 expression of downstream killer gene, and all those slackers will be killed.

- Inoculated E0030 from glycerol stock for the PCR tomorrow as well as MC4100.
6/20/2012
- Primers and RNA Scaffold are ordered.
- Will put in a pETDuet-1 subculture later today so miniprep of the plasmid and digestion/ligation can start tomorrow of BBa_K157005.
- IDT responded saying the RNA scaffold can't be synthesized through gBlock synthesis. They suggested synthesis through Ultramer Oligos.
- Miniprepped MC4100 and E0030 (stored both in the temp box of the -20).
- Performed PCR with E0030 (eYFP) as the template to make 2 tubes of control (no PUF binding site) and 2 tubes with the PUF binding site. Used the hotstart mix and diluted the primers from 30 mM to 10 mM. Gel bands of 700-800 base pairs confirmed a successful PCR. PCR cleanup was performed, and the resulting DNA put into the tem pbox of the -20.
6/21/2012
- Miniprepped the pETDuet-1.
- Digested both pETDuet-1 and BBa_K157005 with EcoRI and PstI in EcoRI buffer.
- Emailed Dr. Silver about how they synthesized their scaffold and will base decision upon her reply.
- Preliminary split-GFP/PUF tethering conceptualization done.
- Digested the 2 minipreps of control eYFP, the 2 minipreps of PUF eYFP, pBAD, and ptet.
- Ran digest and will view gel tomorrow.

Final step was prefix insertion of BBa_J00450 the original constructs.
In every steps of works, we only confirmed the insertion by colony selection in appropriate antibiotics containing LB agar plate, and purification of backbone plasmid for insertion by gel electrophoresis to completely separated small insert fragments. Thus in theory there will be no self-ligation. However for either prefix or suffix inserts, the digested samples were not purified, instead used directly for ligation reaction.
Below some representative gel electrophoresis data were shown.

Figure y E.coli BL21 pCERI and E.coli Nissle 1917 pCERI colonies streaked along Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and incubated over night at 30° C. Homoserine lactone expression by E.coli BL21 pCERI induces violacein synthesis in C. violaceum . E.coli Nissle 1917 pCERI cannot produce enough homoserine lactones to induce violacein expression. C.v.: Chromobacterium violaceum CV026
This week we inoculated colonies from TYR and CHAP in pSB1C3 which were grown over the weekend. Overnight colonies were miniprepped the next day and digested to confirm presence of insert. Gel analysis of digestion with EcoRI-HF and PstI (double and single digest) did not confirm the presence of the insert.
We also digested TYR and CHAP for insertion into their expression vectors pCDF-1b and pTrcHis2b respectively. Both vectors had already been digested and purified after digestion the previous week and digestions were confirmed via gel analysis with bands of the right sizes and linear vector fragments. TYR and CHAP were ligated into their corresponding vectors and ligations were transformed separately into 5-alpha. TYR was also transformed into BL21 and Nissle 1917 for expression trials. Colonies resulting from separate transformations were grown in LB overnight and miniprepped for double transformation into BL21 and Nissle 1917.

Lux promoter
To control the production of holin, which causes cell lysis, see full model, the lux promoter from Vibrio fischeri were used. V. fischeri lives in the light emitting organs of certain marine animals. When floating freely in the ocean, the bacteria do not produce light, however, in the light organs, the bacteria will achive high concentrations and start to luminesce [13] . Luminescense is controlled by the lux promoter that is activated by a complex of the protein LuxR and homoserine lactone (HSL).
HSL is a relatively small signalling molecule that is formed by the reaction between S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and 3-oxo-hexanoyl-CoA (hex). This reaction is catalyzed bu the LuxI enzyme. LuxI is constitutively expressed in the cells, but HSL will diffuse through the cell membrane and not reach high enough concentrations to activate the promoter if there is no HSL in the environment surrounding the cell. At high cell concentrations the amount of HSL, however, a buildup of HSL will activate the promoter. The lux promoter has been adapted as a biobrick and used successfully in E. coli [14] .
To model the production of HSL, a constant production and degradation of SAM and hex was assumed. In the presence of LuxI a complex would form and HSL would be produced, consuming the substrates. The diffusion of HSL was modelled as a first order mass action equation with HSL going to the null space.
In the cell, two LuxR proteins will form a complex with two HSL molecules. This complex will then bind to a palindromic site and activate the promoter. In the model, the reaction was described as two HSL and two proteins reacting directly and forming a complex that activated the promoter. The results are shown in the figure below. In the figure to the left, a constant production of 0.001 s⁻¹ was assumed for both LuxR and LuxI. This gave an expression of Holin, the compound that cause lysis, see full"

Under the same CV, the mean fluorescence of INP-mSA expressing E. coli (positive) is 1.5 times higher than that of E. coli with an empty plasmid (negative).Considering the wild type E. coli(empty), the fluorescent of negative control is almost zero.(the slight fluorescent of it may come from the residue of PBS)
Co-cultivation verification
We aimed to build an adhesion platform of E. coli and S.cerevisiae. Therefore, first we need to select a culture condition under which the heterogeneous cells can both grow happily. Taking into account the expression of the BAP in S.cerevisiae, galactose is required to induce protein expression. And to avoid diauxic growth of yeast when changing a new carbon source in the medium, we ultimaytely selected the YNB-CAA galactose medium. In order for the optimize expression of INP-MSA fusion protein, the in-ducing expression of BAP, and the growth rate of two heterogeneous cells, we took 28 ℃ as the culture temperature.
We characterized the growth curve of E. coli with JIM target gene and that of S.cerevisiae containing BirA & Bap under the mentioned culture condition. And the dry group wonder some parameters of the growth of E.coli and S.cerevisiae, as well as the consumption of galactose.
Fig.8 (a) the growth curve of E.coli with JIM; (b) the growth curve of S.cerevisiae containing BirA & Bap
From the image we can tell, when the yeast and E.coli grows at 28 ℃, the culture time needs to be longer than 48h in order to make the yeast take a dominant proportion. We adjust the YNB-CAA galactose medium containing S.cerevisiae initial OD600 to 1.
Meanwhile, we used HPLC to measure the consumption of galactose.
Adhesion validation
In order to illustrate that in practice, the co-culture of S.cerevisiae and E.coli can truly form the collaborating platform of heterologous cells, we will cultivate the two strains together by adding E.coli to the galactose-induced yeast. The co-cultured samples will then be dyed with rhodamine-biotin and FITC-streptavidin.
As is shown below, we can see that there are quite a few areas of overlapping red and green fluorescent in positive group"

This year, our team mainly focus on communicating with other iGEM teams and raising public awareness towards synthetic biology. Through our practice, we have learned more from each other and built sincere friendship among our team and other teams. Moreover, we promoted the public’s understanding of iGEM and our project.
1.1 Three Teams Communication Meeting 1 -- 2015.4.19
On April 19th, we went to Shanghai Jiaotong University to have a communication meeting .Three teams including SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, NJAU_China and Tongji have attended. In this meeting, we first introduced our project respectively. Then we raised some question and gave some advice on other teams projects. We not only considered these suggestions and perfected our projects but made friends with each other as well.

We were expecting a linear increase of substrate degraded with increase of enzyme. It is believed that excessive enzyme was used in the experiment. The sialic acid concentration released even at the lowest enzyme concentration is large when compared to the positive control (deglycosylation using sulfuric acid).
Figure 9. Concentrations of sialic acid digested from BSM in comparison to the concentration of sialidase used.
Hypothesis 6: Successfully expressed endo-β-galactosidase shows enzymatic activity on mucin
To determine the concentration of sugars after the EBG digestion of PGM a colorimetric assay was performed. Industrially available EBG was used firstly to test the assay. The results from the assay were inconclusive as a result of a strong response from the negative control.
Due to time restraints this part of the project was never completed. The next step after fixing the assay would have been to test the expressed EBG from E. coli.
Hypothesis 7: Glycan removal decreases mucus viscosity
Mucins are densely covered with glycans (polysaccharides) which constitute up to 80% of dry mucus weight. Therefore, we aimed to reveal information on how the glycosylation state of mucins affects mucus viscosity (Lamblin et al., 1991). For this, we degraded pig gastric mucins (PGM) with a deglycosylating reagent, as done by mucus degrading enzymes, and measured the viscoelastic properties by performing rheology measurements.
Figure 10 displays how the viscosity of native PGM is slightly higher at low shear rate (close to standstill), compared to deglycosylated PGM. However, with increasing shear rate, which approximates physiological condition, the reduction in viscosity is faster in deglycosylated (slope: -0.181) compared to native PGM (slope: -0.371). Furthermore, visual fluidity comparison of the tested samples (figure 11) strengthened the findings of the rheology testing.
Since this effect was even detectable at shear rates well below physiological conditions, we hypothesize that the viscosity of deglycosylated PGM will continue to drop faster than native PGM with increasing shear rates. If that is the case, then high shear rate events such as coughing, which causes a shear rate of 103−104 s−1 ("

EDUCATION & PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
During the Cerberus project, we had plenty of opportunities to meet the public and we have understood the crucial importance of communicating and educating. We therefore participated to scientific and non-scientific events, explained our project in the media and committed ourselves in making children aware of  the possibilities of biotechnologies. We also carried on the development of a card game, MicrobioWorld, explaining molecular biology and microbiology in a fun way. However important were these actions at a local scale, it was frustrating to not reach more people. We therefore initiated contacts with the French Ministry of Education and we helped them to develop a pedagogic wallet distributed to all the “Sciences and Techniques of Laboratory” high schools, at the national-scale. They loved Microbioworld which will be part of the wallet. So, our Best Education & Public Engagement is not done with iGEM but will be pursued for the year to come, or even longer.

SCIENCE EDUCATION: PRESS
Press and newspapers are great ways to reach the public and explain our activities. It is also a very good vector to create interest, especially among wannabe scientists and to prove even students can change things with dedicated commitment and efforts. It is also a very good way to prove to people with decision power that science is not unrelated to society and modern problems. To illustrate, we were able to reach the Toulouse city Mayor who sent us an encouragement letter after these articles! Here are the articles published about our subject when we started the communication and public engagement parts of our project. We aim to make another communication effort after the Jamboree to explain what we have achieved scientifically and the awards we obtained (well, we hope we'll obtain!).
La Dépêche du Midi is a French regional daily newspaper. It is unique in that it is published in Toulouse and has 17 different local editions for the different areas of the Occitanie region.

When there is nitrate or nitrite, the repression from the Nar system on PyeaR will be relieved due to the binding between the two. On the other hand, some nitrate will be converted into nitric oxide by nitrate reductase. Nitric oxide will bind to the NsrR protein and relieve the repression on PyeaR. As a result, any genes that are downstream of PyeaR will be expressed.

A. Characterization of PyeaR in LB.
B. Characterization of PyeaR in M9 minimal medium.
*GFP emission measurements were made using an EnVision® multilabel reader. This result was obtained by combining 3 charaterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bars were presented in SEM.
According to A, a plateau was shown starting from the 10 mM concentration point, suggesting that 10 mM nitrate concentration is the saturation point of PyeaR and the dynamic range of PyeaR is shown to be between 0-10 mM in our study. The relative fluorescence level increases 7.21 folds between 0 mM and 10 mM concentrations of nitrate.
According to B, a plateau was shown starting from the 500 μM concentration point, suggesting that 500 μM nitrate concentration is the saturation point of PyeaR and the dynamic range of PyeaR is shown to be between 0-500 μM in our study. The relative fluorescence level increases 3.12 folds from 0 μM and 500 μM nitrate concentrations.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Microbiology_-_-_TEXT.html,"onoids are structured as two phenyl rings and a heterocyclic ring. Anthocyanin itself is structured as a chromane ring with an aromatic ring on C2. Cyanindin and malvidin comprise 90% of the anthocyanins found in nature. These chemicals differ only in their cyclic B groups, and the chromane ring is well conserved in most flavonoids. Therefore, we theorized that the chromane ring itself presented an ideal target for degradation.
Based on these criteria, we chose the flavanol quercetin as our anthocyanin substitute. This molecule differs from anthocyanins only in the presence of a carbonyl group. Additionally, quercetin is present in wine, and contributes to its color. Thus, even in the case where enzymes are isolated that break down quercetin and not anthocyanin, the possibility exists of reducing the color or intensity of wine stains.
Finally, co-pigmentation chemical interactions occur between anthocyanin and quercetin, increasing wine color stability, mainly through π-π stacking between their phenolic cycles. Thus, it leads to the possibility that quercetin degradation could also impact anthocyanin stability.
Results
Anthocyanin Extraction and analysis
Anthocyanins were extracted from Vinis vitifera fruits. It skin was separated from the rest of the fruit and macerated overnight in an ethanol solution with 1% chloridric acid. After maceration, the solution was passed through with a paper filter to eliminate solid material and evaporated at 37°C at 150 rpm. We confirmed the presence of anthocyanin with HPLC and, colour variation with pH.
Collection of the soil samples
Soil samples were collected from France, Spain, Croatia, Namibia and Australia. Samples from the Paris region were collected by members of our team. Other samples were sent by friends, family members, and collaborating iGEM teams. Soil samples were declared to French customs authorities with a Facture Proforma , printed out by the sample donor and included in the shipment.
Upon arrival, samples were washed gently with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, then left to stand, allowing large particles to settle. The resulting eluate was diluted further with PBS then used directly as a source of soil microbes.

Advanced treatment methods and specialized microbial strains are needed to be employed for the removal of those persistent organic recalcitrant[3].

iGEM Stockholm
Recognising that many of our outreach objectives were aimed at engaging more young people and children in synthetic biology, we chose to work with iGEM Stockholm to test and reflect on our communication methods. We first did this by trialling iGEM Stockholm’s childrens book at a regional ‘Family Fun Day’ event where we collected qualitative feedback from families and children on their book. We then decided to deepen our collaboration by producing a guide on communicating synthetic biology to children, designed for educators and the iGEM, as well as the wider synthetic biology community, to understand some of the insights our teams jointly gained over our summers of public engagement.
Turkey HS Ankara
We mentored a Turkish High School team during the summer by skyping them regularly over the summer to answer any of their questions and taught them how to use tools such as Benchling. We were on hand to answer any of their questions about synthetic biology techniques and BioBricks and also provided general support via messaging.
Imperial College London
After holding skype calls with Imperial iGEM, we advised them on how to improve their science communication guide. We tested it out for our own purposes and used our own experiences of science communication this summer to provide them with feedback. We also trialled out Imperial’s team communication app within our team to test how the app works in an iGEM team dynamic, this feedback was again circulated back to Imperial so they could improve their app.

Assembly and Characterization
Assembly
comX and comW construct contain 3 parts that need to be assembled: BBa_K880005 which contains constitutive promoter and RBS, comX engineered with C-myc tag / comW engineered with FLAG tag, and a double terminator in pSB1C3 backbone. Promoter, RBS, comX engineered with C-myc tag, and double terminator were combined using traditional digestion and ligation method. The ligation product was confirmed by digestion check and sequencing.
Com-Box construct also contains 3 parts that need to be assembled: PcelA/PcomFA promoter, BBa_E0240 which contains RBS, GFP and double terminator, and pSB1C3 backbone. All three parts were combined using traditional digestion and ligation method. The final ligation product was confirmed by digestion check and sequencing.
Characterization
RPU (Relative promoter unit) and leakage will be measured as a characterization of 100 base pairs Com-Box promoter (PcelA), and 160 base pairs Com-Box promoter (PcomFA).

The cyclic developmental program of Caulobacter crescentus starts with a stalked cell with a polar adhesive holdfast at the tip of the stalk. The stalked cell firstly turns into S phase when it is time for DNA replication. At that time, the bacteria grow up into pre-divisional cells. Later the cell enters the G2 phase when the cell becomes incompetent for DNA replication and it keep growing until finally compartmentalizing into two cells, either of who contains stalk and flagellum in one pole. For the swarmer cell which possesses flagellum, the rotation of flagellum is activated and two pili are generated as well. The swarmer one enters G1 phase when its chromosome is different from the stalked one and it cannot reproduce itself. However, in G1 phase, the holdfast is formed predominantly in the swarmer cell stage and these swarmer cells reenter S phase like a cell differentiation process exactly simultaneously when rotating flagellum disappears and holdfast is synthesized. As the research says, the development of stalk and holdfast help C.crescentus to live in some tough surroundings and enhance its ability to absorb phosphate passively when nutrition provide is limited and swimming using flagellum waste the energy that is original manuscript for necessary metabolism. Scientists found that Pst family correlate the length of stalk. As the hypothesis contains, if it is correct, stalk elongation may function to elevate single cell away from surface thus bacteria receive much high-level nutrient flux and if C.crescentus colonize with other organisms, stalk ensures bacteria to have greater access to nutrients comparing to other nearby surface species to be superior in competition and survival. Consequently, C.crescentus is able to survive without flagellum and even much more stronger when containing holdfast.

Glyoxylate Shunt
Overview
Our artificial futile cycle is driven by the expression of two key enzymes in glyoxylate cycle. Since mammalian cells lack genes expressing glyoxylate shunt, we introduce these genes from E. coli and assemble them in a constitutive construct that will allow the expression of prokaryotic gene in eukaryotic cell. In addition to the constitutive system, we will also assemble an inducible construct which will allow tunable gene expression according to the concentration of fatty acid in the medium. We decided to introduce inducible system to prevent fatty acid deficiency in low concentration of plasma fatty acid and facilitate greater fatty acid uptake at a high circulating fatty acid levels. The inducible and constitutive system will be compared in terms of fatty acid uptake rate in a range concentration of fatty acid.
Construct
The two key enzymes of glyoxylate system are isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. These two enzymes are encoded by aceA and aceB genes, respectively. We planned to assemble aceA and aceB construct in one vector plasmid to minimize the possibility of mosaic expression of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase throughout the cell line. The mosaic expression can be caused by cell transfection with only either aceA-containing plasmid or aceB-containing plasmid. The constitutive system will be fused with a mammalian constitutive promoter, a mitochondrial leader sequence, a tagging protein and a polyadenylation sequence. Mitochondrial leader sequence is needed for protein translocation to the mitochondria. Tagging protein is essential for detecting the protein expression by means of western blot. Polyadenylation site enhances the gene expression as it is transfected into a mammalian where post-transcription modification exists. aceA and aceB construct will be assembled separately in different plasmid before being combined into one"

Introduction
All life depends on water. Our Earth, home to all species, remains the only place we know capable of sustaining life. In our search for others amongst the stars, it is water we look for first.
More than 71% of the planet is covered in this resource, but only a small proportion is suitable for human use. 97.5% percent of the world’s water is salt water and of the 2.5% freshwater, nearly 70% is locked in glaciers and the ice caps. The majority of what remains is inaccessible; either as soil moisture, permafrost or deep beneath the ground. All considered, less than 0.03% of global water is viable for human use (US Geological Survey 2014).
With the world’s population is rising at a rate of 80 million people a year, water demands are increasing proportionally (Worldometers no date). In order to sustain over seven billion people, we require more than 200 million litres of clean water per second (Waterwise no date). 67% of this is for agriculture,"

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," same TF are members of that TF's regulon.  Although methods for the prediction of regulons have been substantially improved, they are still far from perfect.
Comparative genomics tools can be used to predict regulons in bacterial genomes but the procedure can lead to incorrect regulon calling. Despite this drawback, several regulon databases are available that are based on comparative genomics methods and lack experimental evidence.
Probably the extended and accurate databases of regulons for E. coli are RegulonDB which provides the data source for our program.
Algorithm
Experimental results show that these are the strongest promoters that have been characterized in vitro so far and confirm the hypothesis that the consensus promoter sequences is ""best"". To calculate the similarity between the promoter sequences and the best sequences, we implement the PWM method6 in our program.
PWM (Position Weight Matrix)
Molecular techniques for the identification of promoters are both costly and time consuming, hence in silico methods are an attractive and well explored alternative. The most common in silico method to identify sigma 70 promoters uses position weight matrices (PWMs) and depends on the relative conservation of the transcription factor binding site (TFBS, or motifs ).
The algorithm can be divided into two parts regarding to the difference between the motifs of sigma factors and other transcription factors.
Figure 6 The consensus sequences, the position frequency matrix and the frequency logo
Part 1: the recognition of other transcription factors.7
Other transcription factors are proteins that can bind to a specific DNA sequences (motifs) and regulate the promoter's transcription. To recognize these possible motifs in a given promoter sequences, we calculate the Matrix Similarity Score (MSS) of every possible sites in the promoter sequences using the position frequency matrix of 86 transcription factors published by RegulonDB. The algorithm reports only those matches of a matrix that have got MSS higher than the settled threshold. And MSS for a subsequences x of the length L is calculated in following steps:
fi,Bi , frequency of nucleotide B to occur at the position i of the matrix (B ∈{A, T, G, C})
f imin , frequency of the nucleotide which is rarest in position i in the matrix
f imax , highest frequency in position i.
The information vector
describes the conservation of the positions i in a matrix. Multiplication of the frequencies with the information vector leads to a higher acceptance of mismatches in less conserved regions, whereas mismatches in highly conserved regions are very much discouraged. This leads to a better performance in recognition of TF binding sites if compared with methods that do not use the information"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," towards high affine binding proteins.
We designed our Evobody approach as an alternative to conventional methods for the generation of binding proteins.     In our vision it should be possible to clone each protein encoding sequence into one of our plasmids, let our system     do the work and get a high affinity binding protein, which can be either used for medical, diagnostic or scientific applications.
The starting point - synthetic binding protein library
As starting point, we want to create a library of many binding proteins with a high chance to contain a protein     with the potential to bind our target protein. In doing so we choose the core region of the antibody-mimetic mono-     and nanobodies. In the coding region of those proteins, we randomized the loop regions, which are known to bind     other proteins to obtain our library.
The randomization strategy as well as the choice of the protein scaffold is a key part of library generation.     We identified amino acids, which are present in most protein-protein interaction areas and created a randomization     scheme so that only these amino acids are encoded in the antibody-mimetics binding region. Read more about our     library design here .
Figure 2: Library of initial binding proteins. Expression of the initial binding proteins with variable regions highlighted in seperate colors (turquoise, orange, white, green, pink and blue) and constant regions in olive. The theoretical variability for each scaffold is 1.073.741.824.
Survival of the fittest - bacterial two-hybrid
In the next step, the binding protein library should be screened for proteins with an innate affinity for our target.     We want to realize this by using a bacterial two-hybrid system (Figure 3). Therefore, our target protein (1) is fused to a DNA     binding domain (2), which localises upstream of a reporter cassette (3). The binding protein (4) is fused to a RNA polymerase     subunit (5). Interaction between the binding and the target protein leads to recruitment of the RNA polymerase to the promoter     region of the reporter cassette and activates the reporter gene expression. By using an antibiotic resistance as a reporter     gene the output of the  bacterial two hybrid system should lead to the survival E. coli cells carrying a good binding     protein and the death of all cells with a bad binding protein.
Figure 3: Bacterial-two hybrid system.Interaction between the binding protein (4) and the target protein (1)       lead to recruitment of RNA polymerase (5) to the promoter upstream of the reporter cassette (3) and subsequent       expression of the reporter gene"
