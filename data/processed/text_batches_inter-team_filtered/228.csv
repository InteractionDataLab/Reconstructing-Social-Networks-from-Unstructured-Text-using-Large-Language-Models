The results they got are inconclusive and more testing should be done.
The risk assessment part is more descriptive and subjective, it lacks a quantitative background.

Collaboration with Jilin-China
[debugging a construct]
◎ BIT-China for Jilin-China
https://2016.igem.org/Team:Jilin_China/Collaborations
This year, team Jilin_China aimed to propose a new way to cure the solid tumor by expressing the TAT-Apoptin. The chassis they chose is Bifidobacteria, which can target the anaerobic region of the solid tumors since the microorganism is also anaerobic.
However, the functional device should firstly be transformed into E.coli to operate the methylation process in case that the devices were digested by the restriction enzymes inside the Bifidobacterium longum. They tried several times, but the results were not ideal. Since our team BIT-China is good at genetic operation on E.coli, we helped them realize the expression of TAT-Apoptin in E.coli.
We transformed four kinds of plasmid provided by Jilin_China into E.coli DH5α. The vector is pUC18, and the fragments are separately listed below:
num
Fragment kinds
1
positive control
2
TAT-Linker-apoptin
3
apoptin and Tmp1 signal peptide
4
apoptin and Sec2 signal peptide
After four kinds of positive clones separately containing these fragments were selected, we activated cells in LB culture medium overnight. We inoculated bacteria into new LB culture medium the second day and used IPTG for induction when the OD600 is 0.6. The induction was processed under 16℃ and 37℃ overnight.
After that, we treated the protein samples. We break cells after enrichment. We obtained the separation products of precipitation and supernatant. Separately, we ran those samples.
We have run the SDS-PAGE twice, here are the results:
Fig.1 Different temperature induced with supernatant
Fig.2 Different temperature induced with precipitation

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

At temperatures below 32ºC, called state 0, no reporter protein is produced. Above 32ºC, the first RNAT is melted thus allowing the translation of GFP transcripts (figure 1a) and the system enters state 1. Note that, despite the fact that GFP transcription is under the regulation of a Lac promoter, LacI is not being produced so far as its translation is prevented by a different RNAT. 
When the system reaches 37ºC, mCherry’s RNAT melts allowing it to be translated (figure 1b) and the system enters state 2. At this point, LacI repressor -whose translation is regulated by the same RNAT- is produced, therefore repressing GFP. Again, note that even if mCherry is transcribed from a Tet promoter, Tet repressor’s transcription is blocked by cI represor. 
Finally, if the system reaches a temperature above 42ºC, the system is shut down (figure 1c). This is achieved because the cI repressor herein used is thermolabile, and above 42ºC it is no longer able to bind its operator and repress transcription. Hence, both LacI and Tet repressors are again produced blocking the transcription of GFP and mCherry, respectively.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," applications would be to attach different reporters or effector enzymes. We could attach an enzyme such as nitrite reductase in order to increase expression of nitric oxide as a next step experiment in the future application of cancer therapeutics; we could also investigate adding an enzyme to break down nitric oxide in order to take the next step in the future application of combating nitric oxide pollution. One idea would be to produce a new BioBrick of M-B + Nitric Oxide Synthase (or another nitric oxide donor) + eCFP to test the concept of generating a synthetic gene network which can act as a cancer theraeutic.
Repeat M-B + eCFP transfection into MCF7 cells. Utilise more experimental controls (e.g. M-B only transfection) and construct an M-B + eCFP plasmid which is optimised for mammalian systems
We are very pleased with the results of our mammalian cell transfection, however it was just step one of what is likely very many more steps to optimise the experiment. In the future we would like to test transfection with M-B and B-M to see if both produce similar results in mammalian cells as well as using them as controls to promoters combined with reporters. We would also like to ligate the promoter into a plasmid which is more optimised for mammalian systems in order to test it fully within MCF7 cells.
Optimise use of SNAP NO donor and use alternatives to enhance the induction of Nitric Oxide production
In order to fully test nitric oxide sensation with the promoter we will need to test different nitric oxide donors e.g. SNAP, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide synthase. This will help us fully characterise how the promoter reacts the nitric oxide levels as well as help us decide on the best nitric oxide donor moving forward into producing systems for the future applications that will require nitric oxide production (e.g. cancer therapeutics)

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"cyte-lysis tests to prove the functional activity of scFv anti-vaginolysin that was synthesized in the IVTT system. Not all experiments with VLY indicated positive antibody activity. We hypothesized that proteins could have aggregated very quickly after IVTT expression and the amount of active antibody left in the solution was not enough to inhibit VLY in quantities, what would have been detectable. This hypothesis was further supported by several experiments, which revealed decreasing scFv antibody’s functional activity with time. Moreover, not every experiment was done just after IVTT reaction completed and spend few hours in +4 ˚C. Another option to test scFv, single or displayed on liposomes to gain most reliable results, is an ELISA test. It requires specific antibodies and tags (His-6x or Strep-tag) on scFv or MstX-scFv.

The dxCas9 has a lower affinity to the heparin resin as a result it elutes at lower concentrations of salt (lane 2-10). As the concentration of salt increases less dxCas9 and more fusion elutes (lane 6-10). At high levels of salt the mostly fusion elutes (lane 11-13). Only these last three elution fractions are pooled (lane 11-13). Thus losses are tolerated, to obtain a relatively pure fusion fraction which can be further purified by MonoQ.

Overview
Welcome to BioHub! This is an open and fantastic platform with practical functions for synthetic biologists. For scientists whose goal is to make discoveries in biology, steps using bioinformatics can be seen as the most basic but rather troublesome part. To solve this, our team created BioHub.
BioHub is a platform with several plug-ins, which means that users can not only employ the functions we provide, but also develop new and useful ones which can meet their special needs, without caring for servers and network transmission. Others include Pathway finder, which means find the correlation among genes, Pano, meaning designing genetic circuits like an artist, Simulation, which can imitate real experimental circumstances, and other splendid functions.
Module:Pano
Pano is a visualized editing interface which is designed to arrange the relationships between genes. It can be used to find pathways between genes and simulate related substances according to controlling ODEs.
The relationships of genes are represented by graphs, which include nodes and edges. Each node represents a gene while each edge represents a relationship. Users shall build up a graph in order to input relationships network between genes. Users will be capable to process the network further such as operating a simulation and so on.
Module:Pathway finder
Pathway finder is one of the most powerful plugins of BioHub. In traditional circumstances, searching for the relationships among components in the genetic circuit can be rather arduous, so users must read plenty of papers and inquire several databases. To rescue biologists from this, Pathway finder is born now. Select any two components in genetic circuit, and by searching the database of gene routes in the server we can rapidly know whether they have strong relationship, and whether the feature is of interest. It combines metabolic network databases, cell signaling pathway databases and gene interaction databases, and the path between components means produce, combine, influence activation, promote degradation or others.
Pathway finder is a module integrated in the Pano to provide more convenient and faster ways to find paths from a specific source node to another target node, select appropriate paths, and add them to the Pano. Biologic scientific workers using the Pathway finder"

Safety of our Project
We feel that our project can be classified as safe in general. Every part used was on the parts “white list”                 and was approved by the iGEM safety team. Furthermore, we were in full compliance with rigorous University                 and EU regulations that determined which GMOs and which genes/parts we were permitted to work with in the                 lab.
Safety with Collaboration
When collaborating with Bulgaria, it was necessary for us to ship parts internationally. We made the choice to                 ship diluted DNA in an aqueous solution. This is because shipping the DNA in this manner is non-infectious                 and poses no safety risks to individuals or the environment. We also made sure to include a covering letter                 within the DNA providing assurances of the safe nature of our package’s contents as well as contact information.                 By doing this, we feel we were able to work with international collaborators in a safe and successful manner.
Safety in the Laboratory
In the laboratory, we made sure to always use PPE and follow all University regulations that support safety in                 all biological labs in the school. Furthermore, we always worked under the watchful eye of at least one supervisor,                 which ensured that, despite our relative inexperience working in biotechnology, all equipment and instruments                 were used with the utmost safety and care."

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
One minute tour! :)

TetRDBD-UVR8 expression studies
Figure 1: UVR8 expression: a) SDS-page of TetRDBD-dUVR8 expression. An additional 65 kDa protein appears after introducing a TetRDBD-dUVR8 gene into the cells. b) Native page of a purified TetRDBD-dUVR8-Histag fusion. In native state, TetRDBD-dUVR8 forms a dimer which is split by heat denaturation
We tested whether TetRDBD-UVR8 fusions can be expressed in as a proper folded proteins in E.coli. SDS-page analysis clearly shows, that introducing TetRDBD-dUVR8 results in expression of 65kDa size protein - the same theoretical size as TetRDBD-dUVR8 (fig. 1a). Furthermore, we added 7xHistag to C-terminus of the TetRDBD-dUVR8 construct and purified it through Ni affinity chromatography column. However, contrarily to literature [Heijde2012], TetRDBD-dUVR8 dimer was not seen in SDS-page gels(data not shown). Nevertheless, dimer is observed in the native page analysis, indicating that E.coli synthesizes a functional TetRDBD-dUVR8.

Vortex at maximum speed for 10 minutes. (See “Hints & Troubleshooting Guide” for less DNA shearing).
Make sure the 2mL MicroBead Tubes rotate freely in the centrifuge without rubbing. Centrifuge the tubes at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds at room temperature.
CAUTION: Be sure not to exceed 10,000 x g or tubes may break.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean 2mL Collection Tube (provided). Expect 300-350µl of supernatant.
Add 100 µl of Solution MD2, to the supernatant. Vortex for 5 seconds. Then incubate at 4 °C for 5 minutes.
Centrifuge the tubes at room temperature for 1 minute at 10,000 x g.
Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant to a clean 2mL Collection Tube (provided). Expect approximately 450µL in volume.
Shake to mix Solution MD3 before use. Add 900 µl of Solution MD3 to the supernatant and vortex for 5 seconds.
Load about 700µL into the Spin Filter and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds at room temperature. Discard the flow through, add the remaining supernatant to the Spin Filter, and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds at room temperature. NOTE: A total of 2 to 3 loads for each sample processed are required. Discard all flow through liquid.
Add 300µL of Solution MD4 and centrifuge at room temperature for 30 seconds at 10,000 x g.
Discard the flow through.
Centrifuge at room temperature for 1 minute at 10,000 x g.
Being careful not to splash liquid on the spin filter basket, place Spin Filter in a new 2mL Collection Tube (provided)
Add 50µL of Solution MD5 to the center of the white filter membrane.
Centrifuge at room temperature for 30 seconds at 10,000 x g.
Discard Spin Filter. The DNA in the tube is now ready for any downstream application. No further steps are required. Store the DNA at -20 °C until further use.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," out of the many options left open by the previous definitions? And after finding the optimal architecture, how do we choose the optimal miRNA targets to separate particular cell groups? These are the basic questions we set out to answer by modeling the pANDORRA system.
Modeling classifiers
The main task of a classifier system, given a group of target and control cells, is to produce large amounts of output when inside a target cell and little output when inside a control cell. Ideally, it should function as a logical function: maximum output expression in all target cells and zero in all controls. We will therefore judge its efficiency by how close it is to the ideal. We define the fold change of a concrete classifier instance as the average output margin between the two groups.
The circuit’s layered design naturally guides the modeling effort in two paths: estimating each layer’s output and the effects this output has on the next layer. Basic elements of the model therefore would be relationships between the concentrations of the involved regulatory species and the outputs of the regulated elements.
Take the RNAi mechanism: let Pmax be the unregulated (maximum) output concentration and C* the miRNA concentration that results in a 50% reduction of the output. Then the relationship between the output [P] and the input [miRNA] is:
[
P
]
=
P
m
a
x
1
1
+
[
m
i
R
N
A

C
∗
Next question: if P is regulated by 2 miRNAs together, how do they interact? Following the same logic as in [ 2 ], we assume that the behave additively. If each miRNA has a Ci* concentration of half repression and n is the number of miRNAs, the cumulative regulation is:
[

If there are multiple target sites for a particular miRNA we can assume that their effect on interference will also be additive, so if there are ri target repeats for miRNAi, the output will be:

3. We identified spoiled meat sensors by transcriptome analysis.
4. Backbone pSac-Cm : easy cloning in
B. subtilis, the BioBrick way, for the first time! It's easy to check, BioBrick compatible, E. coli compatible, stabily inserted into the B. subtilis chromosome.
5. We made AmilCP and AmilGFP suitable for expression in Bacillus subtilis.
These chromoproteins can be of significant value to the other Bacillus subtilis users in the BioBrick community.
6. Most importantly: we developed a construct which makes Bacillus subtilis sense spoiled meat and produce an output in the form of a yellow or purple pigment visible by naked eye.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Biologie Synthetique_-_-_TEXT.html,"re ce titre du livre d’Alain Gras sur la fragilité de la puissance, on pourrait parler de puissance de la fragilité ».
Cependant, les avantages potentiels semblent parfois négligeables par rapport au handicap : c’est par exemple le cas lorsque l’on est affecté par le VIH. Et la maladie qu’il engendre ne sera pas contrôlée, d’après Willy Rozenbaum, « si on n’utilise pas la biologie synthétique ». Plus généralement,  ce dernier n’imagine pas « comment on pourrait s’en passer si on veut aller vers une amélioration de la condition humaine ».

Modification de la représentation du vivant
Chercher à synthétiser et à modifier fondamentalement des organismes pousse à s’interroger sur la définition même du vivant. Craig Venter affirme qu’ « on passe de la capacité de lire notre code génétique à la capacité de l’écrire ». Mais comprendre et générer les mécanismes de la vie peut la démystifier ; et le fait de créer des machines vivantes, dans un but précis, risque de nous donner une vision déterministe du vivant. Thierry Magnin s’interroge  « dans un contexte où la vie s’assemble avec des briques, qu’est-ce qui, fait vraiment la différence entre la machine végétale, la machine animale et la machine humaine ? ». On peut après tout envisager que la différence entre les trois ne vient que des interactions entre les « briques » qui les composent. « Comment puis-je reconnaître une certaine dignité du Vivant si tout est fabriqué par blocs » ?
La biologie synthétique peut révéler un aspect ludique, et cet aspect pourrait altérer le respect que l’on porte aux êtres vivants : pour citer une nouvelle fois Thierry Magnin, « ce avec quoi j’ai l’habitude de jouer, j’ai souvent un peu de mal à le respecter ». On peut créer des « pièces » d’"

Our Considerations
Ordering lunch for our team was more difficult than any other protocols we developed. With our mix of kosher-eaters, vegans, and vegetarians, making menu selections was no simple matter. It dawned on us to discuss the relationship of synthetic biology to food ethics. Is laboratory-grown meat kosher? Is it vegan? What do authorities from both traditions have to say about the matter? While in vitro meat is still a prospect of the somewhat distant future, cheese is already being made from animal enzymes that are being synthesized by transformed bacteria. How have the kosher and vegan communities responded to these innovations?
Another of our Human Practices initiatives is less sophisticated, but no less important. We will be running a science workshop at Camp Simcha, demonstrating some of the coolest experiments that synthetic biology has to offer for the education and entertainment of kids and teens dealing with serious illness.

Color output
A lot of the color and aroma compounds that occur in nature are derived from a common precursor: Farnesyl PyroPhosphate (FPP). FPP is a natural occurring molecule in Escherichia coli but it is present in very small amounts. E. coli incorporates the FPP into its cell membrane. To enable cells to express color and aroma compounds in easily detectable amounts it is necessary to overexpress FPP. There is a downside to this, however, as FPP is toxic to E. coli. This means FPP has to be drained constantly. We will do that by producing either a color or an aroma, but it also means we need to tune FPP expression so that it does not accumulate in the cells.
There are two ways to overexpress FPP. First of all, the endogenous DXP pathway of E. coli could be overexpressed. However, it has been shown that this is not very efficient [1] [2] . Alternatively, we could try to engineer part of the mevalonate pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae into E. coli together with a few other S. cerevisiae and E. coli enzymes. It has been shown that this is an effective strategy to overproduce FPP in E. coli [3] . An overview of the enzymes involved in the production of FPP is present in figure 1, at the bottom of this page. Once overproduction of FPP is achieved, we can focus on making a color or smell. To do this, we want to use the BioBricks created by the Edinburgh team last year in their self-flavoring yoghurt project.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," is as good as yours on whether E. coli can degrade (or be engineered to degrade) terephthalic acid. I would do some google scholaring and see what you can find. How many genes are involved in terephthalic acid degradation?
You might want to ask yourselves the following questions: how much do you care about degrading terephthalic acid and how much do you care about making electricity? Also, does the ability to degrade terephthalic acid translate into an ability to degrade PET.
Typically, the yield of electricity from a fuel cell is fairly small, so even a mountain of PET bottles is not going to be a solution to the world’s energy problems. However, degrading a stack of bottles is a solution the plastic pollution problem. My feeling is that a microbial fuel cell is only useful here if it allows you to get rid of reducing equivalents from the cell that you wouldn’t be able to get rid of otherwise (say if you can’t access oxygen due to the need for oxygen sensitive enzymes in terephthalic acid degradation).
Ask yourself the following question: given that Arthrobacter can already degrade terephthalic acid, what bottleneck is preventing widespread deployment of this microbe in the real world? Then try to come up with a solution to that problem.
Also: be aware that Arthrobacter and Bacillus sp. Protocatechuate could also be BSL2.
All the best, and good luck!”
Prof. Eiji Masai: He is the corresponding author of papers where researchers attempt to sequence the TPA degradation and uptake genes of the Comamonas sp. Strain E6. He directed us to some bacteria that potentially degrade TPA on ATCC (bacillus species) and informed us how to obtain the Comamonas species that his lab deposited.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Foo_-_-_TEXT.html," will begin with the tetracycline repressor (TetR), a transcription factor which down-regulates (represses) the transcription of the adjacent gene. This protein and its mutants are often used by synthetic biologists “as control elements to regulate gene expression”   due to their detailed characterisation, but also because of the limited number of proteins available for use in the repressor-TF class.
We want to enhance the diversity of the repressor-TF class by engineering new transcription factors that can bind unique promoter sequences different from the wild-type DNA binding site normally associated with TetR. Our proposed research plan for this summer is as follows:
1) Introduce mutations in the TetR sequence and its binding site
2) Identify promising TF-binding site pairs (using in vivo and in vitro techniques)
3) Conduct multiple rounds of selection to improve affinity and specificity to optimize new pairs of repressor-TFs.
We are also developing a new negative-selection method: lysing the cells with interesting TF-binding site pairs, in order to recover their DNA. Coupled to a microfluidics device such as a chemostat chamber, our method would allow high-throughput in vivo selection.
Strategy
During the summer, we worked on 3 main sections needed to complete the whole project:
1) TetR mutants: Building mutations of TetR, either random or defined (i.e. already characterized in the litterature). This part also comprised in vitro characterization, using MITOMI setup.
2) Reporter plasmids: Assembling different plasmids allowing an in vivo characterization of TetR binding to its recognition sequence. We used RFP and a lysis cassette as a readout - either for characterization or for recovering DNA
3) T7 promoter variants: Coupling T7 promoters of different strength with our 2 reporter genes, to have a better regulation of our Reporter plasmids system. This part includes both T7 characterization with RFP and a proof-of-concept that we can efficiently lyse cells and recover their DNA.
Section 1 presents the different TetR mutants and characterizes them in vitro; sections 2 and 3 demonstrate in vivo TetR-Ptet interaction as well as recovery of DNA from the successful interactions. Details of each section can be found in the ""Our project"" tab.

Introduction
In 2016, the price for a portable EpiPen® kit (two syringes, each containing one dose of adrenaline) increased abruptly in the US, from $100 US to $500-600 US1. The shortage of the drug and its high price led to a reduced accessibility. Adrenaline being the drug of choice for the first-line treatment of anaphylactic shock - adrenaline is injected intramuscularly by the patients themselves if they owns a portable kit - its reduced accessibility raised concerns among parents, who cannot provide enough portable kits for their children, as well as patients and physicians. This widely mediatised issue raised our attention and prompted our cogitation on the possibilities to help render adrenaline more accessible by mean of synthetic biology.
The AdrenaYeast project aims at producing adrenaline using the baker yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Adrenaline is considered essential and insufficient in all the countries recently investigated by the World Health Organisation2, 3, 4.
Furthermore, the current manufacturing processes to produce adrenaline use chemicals that may be harmful to the environment and human health5. The biosynthesis of adrenaline in yeast might help avoid these important issues. Whether the biosynthesis of adrenaline in yeast will reveal a less expensive technology than the current chemical synthesis awaits for a techno-economic analysis. If so, our procedure may help render adrenaline more accessible to developing countries, as is the case with the antimalarial drug artemisinin6.
What are the issues related to the biosynthesis of adrenaline?
We are aware that the AdrenaYeast project will face challenges. As a biotechnology-based health product, yeast-produced adrenaline will be subject to rigorous regulations to prevent any possible health risks. In Canada, any therapeutic agent developed by means of genetic engineering is regulated under the pre-market review and approval standards of Health Canada for new drugs7. The only way to guarantee its safety requires testing its purity, identity, sterility and stability. After proving that biologically synthesized adrenaline is identical to chemically synthesized adrenaline, clinical trials will be conducted to prove its safety in humans8. However, our present concern is to achieve our proof of concept. In other words, we want to, first, demonstrate the feasibility to produce adrenaline in yeast in sufficient quantity before considering its industrial potential.
Additional challenges will need to be addressed"

name of the part and brief description
Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from poliovirus 1 allows for translation initiation in the middle of a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence and thus enables to build constructs consisting of several parts controlled by one promoter
Spytag/Spycatcher part is used for posttranslational protein fusions (fusion of our effectors to membrane receptors).The two parts consists of a domain of streptococcus pyogenes fibronectin-binding protein FbaB. This domain was split and the fragments were rationally engineered [ Zakeri et al., 2012 ]
part BBa_K801030 is a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) from Simian virus 40, it enables targeting of proteins into the nucleus

What potential safety/health risks to team members, other people at your institution, or the general public could arise from your use of this organism/part?
Human poliovirus 1 is a human pathogen but the IRES part we are using is itself not harmful
We believe that the part itself is not dangerous. Since the binding of tag/catcher is very specific, the catcher cannot bind to other proteins and only binds proteins that are fused to the tag
the part itself consists of 7 amino acids and does not pose any safety or health risks
What measures do you intend to take to ensure that your project is safe for team members, other people at your institution, and the general public?
We have all completed a biosafety course and we handle everything in the lab with the necessary precaution. We will not distribute any parts or organisms outside the lab, we are using moss that is not able to sporulate and have implemented a kill switch (see basic safety form)
Explain why you believe the part iself is not dangerous

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#REGObricks#Biobrick_-_-_TEXT.html," primers to anneal to the sequences of pBR322 that flanked both sides of the pBR322 HindIII cut site, into which the urease cassette had presumably been ligated. While this approach ultimately allowed us to biobrick a functional urease cassette form S. pasteurii, the primers we designed were not optimal. First, the primers added approximately 30 bases each on either side of the cassette that were not originally part of the S. pasteurii operon, and these additions could have been avoided by previous knowledge of the sequence. Second, our primers included either side of the original pBR322 HindIII cutsite. In our characterization, we will determine whether this cut site was preserved in our biobrick and if it possible to cut our biobrick with HindIII.
HB101/pBU11 - In order to clone out the urease cassette, we grew up, plated, and put in cryostock the HB101/pBU11 E. coli that we were sent by the Bang lab. Liquid cultures and plates were composed of Team:Brown-Stanford/Lab/Protocols/LB and ampicillin, to which pBR322 confers resistance.
The gel image above represents a successful PCR amplification of the urease cassette insert of pUB11. The leftmost lane depicts a 1 kb ladder, and all lanes to the right of the ladder are PCR product.

Overview
The rapid progression of synthetic biology is providing novel solutions to challenges faced by humankind in a wide variety of fields. Despite this, both public understanding and engagement in this topic are largely neglected. Our goal at Macquarie University is to make synthetic biology available to everyone. To do this we have not only reached out to the community through various educational and engagement programs but we have also integrated their feedback into the design of a portable and renewable hydrogen-producing device."

Reaction 5: ByMichaelis-Menten kinetics and the Ping-Pong mechanism, the rate of this reaction, with rate constant k5, and Michaelis-Menten constant Km5, is: $$r_5=k_5\frac{[GSSG]}{K_{4M}+[GSSG]}$$
Summary of Reaction 4-5: In these, GSSG is reduced back to form GSH, using the enzyme GSR. This is necessary for antioxidation to continue as reaction 1 is constantly using GSH, converting them to GSSG.
Reaction 6: By the Law of Passive Diffusion, the rate of diffusion into the cortex and lens is: is: $$r_6=k_6([H_2O_2]_{out}-[H_2O_2]_{in})$$
Differential Equations
We have six reaction rates derived from above. Now, we will form differential equations, where every time a species is used as a reactant, the reaction rate will be subtracted from the species’ derivative, while each time it is formed as a product, the reaction rate will be added to the species’ derivative. We will go through each species in detail:
Substituting the rate of each reaction, we get the following system of differential equations.
$$\frac{d[GP_{xr}]}{dt}=k_3[GS-GP_x][GSH]-k_1[GP_{xr}][H_2O_2]_{in}$$                                                  $$\frac{d[H_2O_2]}{dt}=k_1([H_2O_2]_{out} - [H_2O_2]_{in})-k_1[GP_{xr}][H_2O_2]_{in}$$                                                  $$\frac{d[GP_{x0}]}{dt}=k_1[GP_{xr}][H_2O_2]_{in}-k_2[GP_{xo}][GSH]$$                                                  $$\frac{d[H_2O]}{dt}=k_1[GP_{xr}][H_2O_2]_{in}+k_2[GP_{xo}][GSH]$$                                                  $$\frac"

Samples were taken for BCA protein assay at the time. The device ran for 4 hours to simulate the application                     in real condition. After that, samples from bacteria culture flask and stimulated blood flask were taken                     for BCA protein assay. To our surprise, the result showed that after the running of the device, protein                     concentration was the same or even decreased (Table 7). We suspected that it’s due to that the dialyzer                     can absorb some protein in it (the surface of the fiber tube, eg.), which means that, at least in our                     experiment, the biosafety of our device is highly promising.
Table 7 The experiment of protein leakage experiment.
To simulate the possible veins that might be used in the clinics, we took out one experiment. For simulated femoral vein, we set the flow rate in the simulated blood extracorporeal circulation part and the bacterial circulation part to be 60ml/min; for simulated cephalic vein, we set the flow rate in the simulated blood extracorporeal circulation part and the bacterial circulation part to be 14ml/min. The experiment is carried out as protocol and the data we get is shown below in table 8.
Table 8 The original HPLC data of uric acid permeating experiment. Because in the two experiment instruments we used to get the HPLC data is different, there is a big different the two sets of data.
We transferred the data into the concentration of uric acid and plotted them. Data-fitting is done to verify that the data conforms to the model, and the result is shown below:
Figure 21 fitting curve and plots of cephalic vein simulation
Table 9 parameters and results of cephalic vein simulation
Figure 22 fitting curve and plots of femoral vein simulation
Table 10 parameters and results of femoral vein simulation
According to figure 6 and figure 7 and parameters (in table 9 and table 10) got from data-fitting, we can find that for femoral vein simulation, the fitting curve matches the plotted data very well. But the match between experiment data and fitting curve of cephalic vein simulation is not so good. While the values of k in the two results are not the same. The reason for those conditions could be that when the flow rate is low, the assumption of uniform uric acid concentration is not valid. Which can be justified in the future work. The results show that efficiency of uric permeating in femoral vein simulation is"

Week 6: June 3 - June 7
Based on the research we have done in the previous weeks we have decided to plot out some experiments that will help us characterize our coils. We plan make use of a Ni-NTA column and His-tags on our coils to characterize our coils. The idea is that we can have a His-tag located on one of the coils and this coil will bind to the column via the His-tag. The second coil will be fused to protein such as GFP ( BBa_K648013 ). This second coil will not have a His-tag and when passed through the column it ideally should bind to the other coil already immobilized via a His-tag. By varying the conditions within the column we should be able to characterize the binding of the coils. If the coil fused to GFP falls off of the other coil it should be located in the collected fluid. The presence of the GFP can be detected by both fluorescence and SDS-PAGE.
Three proposed experiments that we have making use of this are detailed below:
The first test will just test the binding of the coils to each other under standard coil binding conditions (pH = 7). A K coil will be bound to a drip Ni-NTA column via a 6x His-tag C-terminus fusion.  An E coil with an N-terminus GFP fusion can then interact with the K coil that is bound to the column. If the interaction is successful the GFP will not be found in high quantities in the wash steps. The GFP fusion should elute when imidazole is added to the column. The levels of GFP can be verified using both emission measurements and SDS-PAGE.
The second test will make use of this column but will measure the effect of pH on the binding of the coils. Different columns will be set up with different pH washes (3, 5, 7 and 9). It has been previously reported that the coils begin to dissociate at a pH of 5 (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008).
The third test will make use of a spin Ni-NTA column. This test will test the ability of the heterodimer coiled-coils to resist shearing due to applied forces. The columns will undergo centrifugation at different steps after the proteins have been bound to determine if the forces present have any effect on the binding of the coils.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#unnatural base pair#uptake and biosynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html,"). However, the binding of the secretion specific chaperone SecB or the signal recognition particle SRP  (which represents the first step of the Sec pathway) to the signal peptide is influenced by the hydrophobicity of the H-domain (De Keyzer et al., 2003). Signal peptides targeting the Tat pathway are usually around 30 amino acids long (Berks et al., 2014). On the contrary to Sec pathway targeting signal peptides, Tat pathway targeting signal peptides do feature a consensus sequence. The crucial element for Tat recognition is a twin-arginine motif (RR) located at the N/H-domain junction. In bacteria, the RR is usually followed by phenylalanine, leucine and lysine at the RR+2 position with especially the phenylalanine being of high importance (Cline, 2015).
Sec Pathway
In bacteria, most proteins are secreted via the conserved and essential Sec pathway in an unfolded state (Schneewind and Missiakas, 2014; Caspers and Freudl, 2008). The key component of the Sec pathway is the translocase which is located in the plasma membrane and composed of the SecYEG heterotrimeric protein as well as the SecA ATPase. SecYEG consists of three components, SecY, SecE and SecG. SecY and SecE form the core of the transmembrane channel, while SecG is an additional integral subunit that seems to be not essential for the translocation process (Schneewind and Missiakas, 2014; de Keyzer et al., 2003; Caspers and Freudl, 2008). SecA serves as the molecular motor of the translocation process by consecutively binding and hydrolyzing ATP and hence initializing the translocation. The proton motive force (PMF) helps translocating the protein once the process is initialized by SecA (Caspers and Freudl, 2008). SecYEG can associate with another heterotrimeric complex involved in the translocation process consisting of SecD, SecF, and YajC. The exact role of this additional heterotrimeric complex is yet unknown but seems to optimize secretion   (de Keyzer et al., 2003). It was proposed that SecDFYajC might be involved in the proton motive force dependent steps of the translocation process (Denks et al., 2014). Proteins are targeted in two different ways, being mediated by the chaperone SecB, or the signal"

ETH_Zurich,2008,Team:ETH Zurich#Wetlab#Switch Circuit_-_-_TEXT.html," with genomic reduction, specific restriction enzyme to support the gene-deletion mechanism. The second plasmid contains lacI IS, an IPTG-insensitive mutant, that is under control of the tet repressor. Since E. coli does not produce TetR, a  source of constitutively expressed TetR is included. As the system will only work with both plasmids integrated, the first plasmid has ampicillin resistance while plasmid two has kanamycin resistance.
Figure 1: Schematic representation of the target plasmid.
Figure 2: Schematic representation of the pulse generator.
Mechanism
Expression of the lac operon in E. coli is tightly controlled by LacI, a protein, which binds to a repressor binding site within the promotor and disables transcription by obscuring the promotor region.  When bound to DNA, lacI is in the tetrameric form, which consists of two dimers interacting at the end distal from the DNA binding site.  Since our protein of interest is under control of LacI, there is no expression of GFP before induction. In order to turn the expression of GFP on, the start signal, induction by IPTG, is given. Upon binding of IPTG, the lacI  tetramer breaks down into two dimers and the affinity for the repressor binding site is greatly reduced: the lacI IPTG complex will diffuse away from the repressor binding site, leaving the promotor accessible. Transcription and translation of GFP protein starts immediately. For termination of expression, tetracycline is added. Since lacI IS is under a TetR-repressible promoter, lacI IS is not expressed until induction with tetracycline abolishes affinity of TetR for the repressor binding site. Transcription of LacI IS subsequently starts; since LacI IS binds to the repressor binding side of the lac-repressible promoter no matter whether IPTG is present or not, translation of the protein of interest is terminated.
General Layout of the Pulse Generator
The basic idea for the pulse generator was to use the lac repressor to control the start of expression and then use a second protein under control of a different promoter, which in turn would shut down expression by binding tightly to a motif contained inside the lac repressor binding site after induction of it’s promoter with a second inducer. While there are numerous proteins, which bind tightly to specific DNA sequences and while it is even possible to engineer these proteins to bind to a DNA sequence of choice (4-7), we decided to use the IS lac repressor mutant,"

Our team has tackled many important questions that extend outside of the lab this year. Many of these address ethics, safety and sustainability. Safety is a huge component in our project, not only in our participation in iGEM, but also in planning the implementation of our project in future years. For our achievements regarding safety:
We visited local wastewater treatment facilities and spoke to individuals at a local water summit, to learn about the various types of systems within plants and the existing keratin waste removal methods. While planning the implementation of our construct, we designed a bioreactor based on these systems to make it easier to implement.
We have also put in a lot of thought about the ethical implications of our project. We plan to create an ethics review board and have spread awareness about ethics and safety by publishing a perspectives paper in an online student journal called Biotreks.
Through numerous presentations, showcases, and summits within our community, we have spread awareness about our project to the public.
While we view the ethical concerns of our project from a student standpoint, we also have to take in consideration a faith perspective. Being a Catholic high school we have to ensure that our project follows the beliefs of the Catholic Church.
We have also met all the bronze and silver medal requirements:
We met all the deliverables on the requirements page.
We attributed all work done on our project.
We both documented at least one new standard BioBrick part or device central to our project and submitted two new part to the iGEM registry.
We experimentally validated our BioBricks by preparing assays which demonstrated enzymatic activity. For example in our skim milk plate test we saw results of protein degradation by clearing on the plate, we also saw in our hair assay that the tubes turned the colour of the lids showing that the colour in the cap was broken down. Though these results are not conclusive, they show that our construct is working.
We collaborated with the Lethbridge High School Team.  We mentored a young team from High River, Alberta and shared our previous work from last year, as well as research we had found with a team who is working on a similar project.  In addition to this, we participated in Biotreks.  Biotreks is a peer-reviewed online synthetic"

We confirmed the presence of the polysilicate                              layer with imaging techniques, including AFM and TEM.
We tested our synthetic biology design in an optical setup that we specially designed and built to enable lasing in bacteria. Although we successfully                              implemented all our synthetic biology components, this did not result in a lasing bacterium. To find out why, we adapted a conventional laser model to                                      fit the characteristics of our biological laser . This led us to the conclusion that our design requires either a larger cell volume, or a higher fluorophore concentration. Therefore we recommend repeating this experiment in cells that are typically larger, such as mammalian cells. A previous study showed the potential of mammalian cells as a laser cavity, albeit with artificial fluorescent agents and mirrors (Humar & Yun, 2015) . The goal of our project was to use a fully synthetic biology approach, therefore it would be interesting to apply this approach on mammalian cells.
Biolenses
As stated before, we have successfully covered cells in polysilicate. We additionally engineered this strain by changing its morphology from rod-shaped                              to spherical. By simulating the optical properties of these cells, we investigated whether they could act as a biological microlens.  Our models pointed                              out that our cells are able to focus light and therefore act as a lens. To validate that our microlenses do not absorb any light but transmit it, we used                              spectroscopy. This test showed our microlenses indeed transmit the vast majority of the light.
We have discussed the potential of our microlenses with experts in the field of imaging, who saw great potential of the microlenses in a number of applications.                              Apart from our original idea of applying the microlenses in optical systems, we also learned the microlenses could improve the efficiency of solar cells. For                              this application we have written a business plan . One of the possible challenges we encountered implementing our product into a business, was bringing our GMOs                              in the outside world. To this end, we have investigated the most feasible way of sterilizing our microlenses so they can be applied on solar cells.
In our project, we have developed a new application for synthetic biology in the field of optics. Microlenses are a promising new field in optics, but due to                             their environmental footprint and high costs, they are not widely used. The microlenses we developed could be a promising substitution for the conventional                              microlenses. Therefore, more research is necessary to"

PROTEIN EXPRESSION MEASUREMENTS
In order to show that our synthetic bacteria have a fully functional part that works, expression measurements were made. The construct was usually linked to superfold GFP. The fluorescent intensity can be measured in different ways and is directly related to the expression frequency of the construct (the more intense the signal the more expression you have). For most parts plate reader and microscopy experiments were done.
Plate Reading (Relative and Absolute Fluorescence)
A plate reader is able to take optical density (OD600nm) and fluorescent measurements over time. OD is a measure of bacterial growth over time and fluorescence a measure of protein expression over time.

Modification of the yeast
Gene knockout
Based on previous research, three genes are recommended to be knocked out.
Ste2, the receptor of α factor, in order to eliminate the probability of yeasts getting affected by native ligand-pheromone.
Sst2, the GTPase-activating protein for Gpa1p, as a receptor-desensitizing factor in order to eliminate possible up-stream GPCR signal conductive decline due to incessant stimulation.
Far1, the cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, in order to eliminate side effect to cells’ life circle and formation due to signal intensification in MAPK pathway of the pheromone pathway.
Fortunately, we found that BIT-China 2017 used the same pheromone pathway in yeast in their project last year, so we established cooperation with them and brought their yeast-- CEN.PK2-1c ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △leu2. It greatly reduced our experiment works.
Mutation screening
Judging that the auxotroph marker is not enough for subsequent experiment, and resistance markers have a few problems such as plasmids’ easy losing in CENPK2-1C ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △leu2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we used positive 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) selection to obtain Ura3 mutant strains.In this method, Wild-type strains of yeast (or ura3 mutant strains containing a plasmid-borne URA3+ gene) are unable to grow on medium containing the pyrimidine analog 5-fluoro-orotic acid, whereas ura3- mutants grow normally [1].

Analysis
Though we were not able to have our mutant functionally express our system, the tissue flask experiment was an interesting way to observe the effects of a full knockout of the Light Harvesting Antenna Complex 2 (LH2) vs the Wild Type on an array of consecutive photobioreactors.  A couple of conclusions can be drawn from this data that can be used in modeling our synthetic regulation system for LH2 and in the future design of systems for the optimization of Light Harvesting Antenna size for photobioreactors .

Science is an international community, that knows no borders, politics or race. When one embarks on a scientific journey, fellow scientists from around the world are there to offer assistance, guidance and a different point of view, all in the name of scientific innovation. iGEM is no exception, placing great emphasis on the collaborative aspect of every team’s project.
Our first interaction was with the Peshawar team from Pakistan. We were especially excited about speaking to them, due to our respective countries not being in diplomatic relations with one another. We exchanged emails for a while, until we finally scheduled a skype session
In the course of the session we discussed our respective projects and needs for the competition. Our new friends helped us gain a new perspective regarding our Wiki design, and offered wisdom about how to tackle this facet of our project.
Next, we reached out to team Bristol . They graciously offered us a tool they had developed for writing Wiki code, which proved to be immensely helpful. Up to that point we encountered setbacks with our wiki design and this collaboration came at an auspicious time. Thanks to this act of professional courtesy, we were able to make significant process on our wiki page.
Unfortunately, we hit a roadblock early on with our wiki design and decided to outsource the process to an external web design company.
Furthermore, we learned from the Lahore team that, from the first days of the project, they had allocated each area of responsibility to a student from the appropriate study field. Following this, we decided that next year’s team should have a computer science student onboard for the purpose of Wiki design.
The jewel in our crown is our collaboration with the Technion team , on the esteemed topic of ethics. We sought to profoundly investigate the ethical side of our project, seeing as how it deals with sensitive subjects spanning genetic engineering and the human food industry. One of our main objectives was to create a product that promotes ecological and sustainable food production, the basis for which is clearly ethics.  The Technion team compiled an ethics handbook, a succinct manifest spanning the world of ethics, covering subjects from the history of ethics to modern day implications. We read this text with guidance from Dr. Meshi"
UofC_Calgary,2016,Team:UofC Calgary#notebook#sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," in free volume theory, each drug, solvent, and polymer molecule contains an impenetrable core that is surrounded by nanovoids, called free volume
Thermal motions cause the size of voids to fluctuate. Occasionally, a void becomes large enough for a diffusing molecule to move into or through it
Free volume of a matrix depends on the its composition
Free volume can also be increased substantially by sorption of small molecules, such as water. (sorption is the physical and chemical process by which one substance becomes attached to another)
For a molecule diffusing through a water-swollen hydrogel, diffusivity of drug is affected by the viscosity of the water space and also by obstructions placed in the drug molecule’s path by the hydrogel chains

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," the binding of CueR to the pCopA promoter, allowing for expression of RFP. B: Copper biosensor in the absence of copper ions In the absence of copper ions, CueR binds to the pCopA promoter and inhibits RFP expression. A reduced amount of RFP is synthesized due to some leaky expression of the RFP gene.
Upon completing our designs and assembling our plasmids, the next step was proving that they worked. Because this was not our main project and since we were trying to effectively characterize of our parts prior to our the start of our high school visits, we decided to focus testing solely on the copper biosensor.
Results
The first set of tests conducted involved inducing RFP expression using varying concentrations of copper in overnight cultures. Glycerol stocks of XL1-Blue cells transformed with the copper detection plasmid were used to inoculate 4 culture tubes containing 5 mL of LB broth. The appropriate antibiotic was added and then the cultures were induced to a final copper (II) sulfate concentration of 0 µM, 5 µM, 100 µM, or 500 µM. After incubation with shaking overnight, these cultures were spun down in a centrifuge and compared qualitatively. Clear differences in the color of the cell pellets could be seen between the 0 µM, 100 µM, and 500 µM groups. The 5 µM group appeared to be about the same coloration as the 0 µM group.
Copper sensing overnight results - XL1-Blue cells containing the copper biosensor were incubated overnight with varying concentrations of copper. The different copper concentrations induced varying levels of RFP expression. This can clearly be seen in the different coloration of the pelleted cell samples.
Following this qualitative proof of functionality, we proceeded to perform a more quantitative test. XL1-Blue cells containing the copper biosensor were grown overnight without induction to maximum culture density. Approximated 1 mL of this culture was then used to inoculate 20 mL of fresh LB in a 50 mL Falcon tube. This new culture was grown at 37 C with shaking until it reached an OD600 above .4. 1 mL samples of this culture were then removed and induced with copper (II) sulfate to final concentrations of 0 µM, 25 µM, 50 µM, 100, µM, 250 µM, 500 µM, and 1,000 µM. Aliquots of each induced sample were then loaded into 5 wells of a 96 well plate."

The “hype” discourse, or how scientists themselves advertise technique
Philosophers' quotes
“[The purpose of press releases] is persuasion. They are the productions of research communities seeking to raise the profile of their work as a means of persuading potential patrons of the benefits of investment or sceptical publics of future benefits.
Importantly, press releases that emerge from research communities are characterised by a language and discourse that would never appear on the pages of peer reviewed science journal texts. In particular, much of the careful qualification of scientific texts is abandoned for the more strident language of ‘breakthrough’, ‘the first’, ‘the best’, ‘never before’. In other words, science communities suddenly metamorphose themselves into the highly competitive news conventions of the media code. When press releases arrive on the desks of science correspondents there is often precious little time to interrogate claims about new cures and revolutionary promises.
When we examine the journeys or travel that biotechnology expectations make in their passage from laboratory to the news page, it is absolutely clear that it is no longer possible to go on simply blaming the media for hyping things up. Research communities are crucial participants in the production of hype.”
Nik Brown, “Hope Against Hype – Accountability in Biopasts, Presents and Futures”, Science Studies, 02/2003
Team discussion
Despite some patients’ reserves and questioning, most of them are really pleased that we take an interest in their disease and also conscious that our project will not lead to a real treatment.
The “hype” discourse is another form of advertisement. Its goal is not to find a consumer, but to find investors and/or to gain support in public opinion. It is also a powerful tool to convince politicians of the utility of research. If the target is different, the mechanism is the same: the lack of technical culture of the leaders is exploited in order to seduce them with few scientific arguments and many promises. Neither synthetic biology nor iGEM escape this hype temptation: the biotechnological progress is huge, but the laboratory reality is far from the epic tales of future biosynthetic productions and cures. Our team was confronted to this particular problem when submitting our survey to patients. We chose to present the ideal treatment (that we knew we could not achieve) in order to consult them, but although a large number of patients considered our project with caution, some of them clearly thought that we already achieved it. The hype discourse creates excessive promises that lead to unreasonable"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Toxicity Theory_-_-_TEXT.html,") and Au(III) inhibits the growth of nonpathogenic Escherichia coli as seen in figure 1. Furthermore, they determined the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for both ions in the examined buffers as seen in table 1, clearly indicating that gold ions possess toxic properties to E. coli. The toxic effect of gold ions is due to its ability to oxidative cleavage of peptide and protein disulfide bonds (Witkiewicz & Shaw, 1981). Since gold ions are toxic to the NP producing cell, the reduction to AuNPs is desirable, however the stress to the cell and its inhibitory effect have to be investigated.
Figure 1: Concentration dependent growth inhibition by Au(I) and Au(III) ions on multi-drug resistant E. coli (BAA-1161) according to Shareena Dasari (2015).
Silver
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known to possess toxic properties (Colman et al., 2013). The toxicity of AgNPs varies in response to the shape and size of the AgNPs. The toxicity increases significantly when the AgNPs are smaller than 10 nm (Ivask et al., 2014). It has been demonstrated that AgNPs exhibit toxic effects in bacteria at environmentally relevant concentrations (Colman et al., 2013). The growth inhibition is dependent on the concentration of the AgNPs. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for AgNPs in E. coli is considered to be between 3.3 and 6.6 nM (Kim et al., 2007). The exposure to AgNPs results in an apoptosis-like response of the cell. First, the membrane is depolarized by AgNPs, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl peroxide, hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions. These ROS cause oxidative stress and lead to the fragmentation of DNA. Simultaneously, calcium accumulates in the cytoplasm of the cell. An increased concentration of calcium results in the inversion of phosphatidylserine in the membrane. All of these processes ultimately lead to the activation of bacterial caspase-like proteins (Bortner & Cidlowski, 2007; Yun & Lee, 2017). However, there are considerations whether the AgNPs are toxic or whether the toxic effect is due to ions dissolving from the nanoparticles (Hwang et al., 2008). The toxic effects of silver salts have been known since antiquity. Even Hippocrates recognized its"

Also, innoculated overnight cultures in preparation for more glycerol stocks and minipreps tomorrow.  This is for the same parts listed above, with the exception of pSB1AK3, which had no distinct colonies.
Ran a gel of all PCR products from yesterday.  Ran about 5 uL of each, added to 4 uL of water and 1 uL of loading dye. The gel was 1% gel, a large one with 26 combs of 9 mm spacing.  For this, mixed 100 mL 0.5x TBE, 10 uL SYBR Safe, and 1 g Agarose and poured it into the large electrophoresis device.  The gel was running for about 4 hours.
Imaging indicated that none of the PCR reactions had worked, apparently not even the positive control.  Could only see bands for the three ladders included, which were the 100 bp, the 1 kbp, and the 2-log ladders.  Given this finding, one might suggest that something went wrong either with the PCR itself or with the gel.  It seems unlikely that something was wrong with the gel given that a restriction digest for a different project run on the same gel appeared to have a distinct band (for a piece of DNA expected to be 1-2 kbp).
Made more LB + agar plates.  Some of this spilled out in the autoclave.  Estimated that there are still 800 mL remaining, so added 800 uL of ampicillin stock solution.
Made 20 plates.
A talk with Jamie convinced us that we should run the initial plate reader tests we had considered of the activator + reporter and repressor + repoter constructs.  These should be done in parallel to the construction of our real parts.
In terms of our ligations, we need to determine which promoters we will be using, which sets of binding sites, etc.  We need to determine a good inducible promoter for the entire device.  If we choose pGAL1, we will need to make it more tunable, which will require the yeast strain from Smolke that has a knockout. "

Delaware
Since the Mid-Atlantic iGEM Meet-Up, we have been working with University of Delaware to help them establish a foundation for their new team.  By establishing this mentorship, we have been helping them by offering them a diverse set of protocols, providing templates/methods for brainstorming and designing iGEM Projects, and have been available for calls discussing qualities of a successful iGEM project.
Manchester
Involvement with Manchester began when they expressed interest in a business model for their device. Our conversations led us to find that there are major differences with regard to GMM laws across the world. Together, we helped synthesize questions that revealed these inconsistencies among nations. Additionally, we researched and submitted summaries detailing United States law with respect to GMMs within the confines of the targeted questions. Our major collaboration, outside of contributing US law, was in developing a cohesive way for demonstrating the differences between countries. A link to this collaboration can be found here.

After our Mid-Atlantic Meet-Up, William and Mary offered us a set of protocols related to Arabinose-inducible promoters, which helped us further characterize the promoters in Paracoccus denitrificans and use the pBAD promoter in our final tested device."

We arranged an evening's entertainment at the JIC, with catering provided by Papa John's pizzeria of Norwich. A later excursion into the Norwich city nightlife lasted until the early hours of the morning, and certainly gave the bars and clubs something to talk about! At the end of the conference we ensured that there was an afternoon available for teams to explore both the Norwich Research Park and the UEA campus along with the various sightseeing attractions in Norwich city centre, giving everyone the break they deserved!
All in all, the UK iGEM meet up was one of the highlights of our iGEM competition, and we thoroughly hope it was equally enjoyable to all of those who attended!

In fact when LacI is not expressed, pLac is activated, and when there is an expression of LacI, pLac is inhibited. We can easily design a system to induce the transcription of LacI and creates a failed feedback mechanism for pLac inhibition.
History:  In E.Coli, pLac is a part of the lactose operon. LacI is constantly expressed and represses the pLac. In the presence of Lactose, LacI is inhibited and pLac is active and allows the transcription of beta-galactosidase. Lactose can be substituted by IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside).
B0030 + C0012 + B0014 : BBa_K292006 [7]
This part contains a strong ribosome binding site, the LacI repressor and a double terminator (BBa_B0030 + BBa_C0012 + BBa_B0014). This brick comes from the BBa_K292005. The LacI repressor represses pLac promoter from the E.coli lactose operon. So LacI repressor and this bio-brick are really reliable to use when we want to control a gene expression by using pLac promoter. In fact when LacI is not expressed, pLac is activated, and when there is an expression of LacI, pLac is inhibited. We can easily design a system to induce the transcription of LacI by using another operon as the tetracycline operon and creates a failed feedback mechanism for pLac inhibition and so, for gene expression inhibition.
The LacI (BBa_K292006) already contains a strong RBS and a double terminator, so this brick is ready to use! History:  In E.Coli, pLac is a part of the lactose operon.

5 . Cooperation with Nanjing University
With the shortening of the time, our iGEM team encountered difficulties. The plasmid solution used in the experiment procedure in interlab was not effective after many times of cultivation, so the next experiment could not be carried out. We communicated the results with other iGEM teams. Nanjing-China of Nanjing university knew about it and then provided the bacteria liquid we needed. Our team members went to the school of life science of Nanjing university to obtain the bacteria liquid .
With the help of Nanjing-China, we successfully carried out the next experiment of Interlab, and finally achieved  success. We would like to express our hearty thanks to Nanjing-China for their help!

NEFU modeling:
NEFU modeling: They store information in a yeast, and the time of information storage is the key to the case. The information storage time (a yeast growth time) needs to consider some parameters ,such as the initial inputs of α yeast and a yeast, the concentration of a-factor, and the expression efficiency of Bax gene. Firstly, partial correlation analysis is used to analyze the local sensitivity of the complex relationship between parameters and results, which provides a basis for accurate and efficient modeling and reliability analysis of simulation results. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the secretion amount of α-factor and the growth time of a yeast had a higher sensitivity . Therefore, α- factor is refined into dry powder, which excludes the influence on the information storage of other interference factors such as the growth of α yeast . Secondly, since the main body"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts

Lethbridge,2012,Team:Lethbridge#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," surface. Larger magnitude events that may be felt at the surface can occur if the fluid injection causes movement along pre-existing stressed faults, however only one such event studied within this report was reported as felt by workers at the surface and no damage or harm to structures or workers was reported.2 The Davis and Frohlich induced seismicity criteria is a generally accepted methodology for the identification of induced seismicity and can be used to monitor seismic activity at and around hydraulic fracturing well sites.
In contrast to hydraulic fracturing, CAB extraction will not require high pressure injection of fluids. Since CAB extraction will rely on increased porosity generated by the reaction between acetic acid and carbonate rock, high pressure fluid injection will not be needed to create pathways for oil flow. The pressure generated by the breakdown of carbonate rock will help to pressurize the well and should not induce seismic activity that can be felt at the surface. However, extensive study of the subterranean geology should be performed as part of initial site selection procedures to ensure that pre-existing fault lines are not nearby or that fracture barrier layers can be utilized to prevent unwanted fracturing of geological formations. Continual monitoring of seismic activity and potential fracturing of upper geological levels will be necessary safety measures. If larger seismic events are reported, pumping rates or injection volumes can be reduced depending on the nature of the seismic activity.
Additionally, CAB extraction will require the addition of fewer harmful chemicals for successful extraction. Sand and other materials used in hydraulic fracturing to maintain fractures will not be necessary since increasing the porosity of the carbonate rock will require only acetic acid. The natural biosurfactant, rhamnolipid, will be used in conjunction with acetic acid to enhance flow rates. Using natural materials will result in lower risk of harmful contamination of ground water. The use of less harmful chemical additives to maintain wellbore integrity will have to be examined. Water sources will have to be monitored for chemical contamination due to direct or indirect results of CAB extraction. Waste water will be stored for reclamation or alternative synthetic biology technology can be developed to recycle it to be used again in CAB extraction or other processes.
Due to new and updated regulations on hydraulic fracturing processes, this technology for the extraction of unconventional natural resources will be more strictly monitored to ensure environmental safety. Following similar guidelines and regulations will be necessary for the safe use of CAB extraction for tapping into carbonate oil deposits in Alberta and around the world, while maintaining high quality of water, air, and soil in these regions.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup.
The meetup started around 9 with a short speech by Professor Lin He, head of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Bio-X Institute, which hosted the event. Then each team made a presentation displaying their projects and progresses since the summer began, followed by free questioning and discussion time. And when it was near the end of the day, student members had a hour or two to talk and play freely with each other, with a big meal waiting ahead for them.

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

Parisian Meet Up
Our team participated in the 4th Annual Parisian Meetup, organized by Pasteur_Paris . The meetup was attended by all 10 french iGEM teams and included project presentations and workshops.  We met many experts with different specialties, including bioethics, who enlightened us and helped us a lot in shaping our breaking bugs project.  Last, but certainly not least, we met one of the European after-iGEM ambassadors, Mr. Will Wright who, with his expertise, shared his iGEM adventures and helped us get in touch with other after-iGEM ambassadors so they could attend our very own Mediterranean meetup .
We sincerely thank the Pasteur Paris iGEM team for their invitation."

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," trying to erase the measurable risks of such a classical industrial hazard like toxic textile dye effluents, the Goodbye AzoDye project of UCL iGEM 2014 also needs to take into account that its cutting-edge scientific performance potentially necessitates an even greater risk as its incalculability does not even allow to bring forward the knowledge of how that risk would manifest itself. The deskilling dynamic and the reduced complexity that accompanies the practice of synthetic biology provide an additional social threat to the potentiality of the inherent genetic hazards (Cohen 1997; Lentzos 2012).
Consequently, a team like UCL iGEM is confined to a public space where uncertainty has pervaded the collective minds of people who were used to live in a world where risk was nearly always a manageable probability and rarely an unobtainable scientific insight. So, as this epistemological pitfall widens and the uncertainty grows, the social motivations for action are progressively taken over and driven by fear. In the process of this development, environmental controversies begin to arise around such issues as the cultivation of GM crops. Therefore, in the event of the iGEM competition, synthetic biology can almost inadvertently anticipate the public controversy by engaging with a global party of aspiring synthetic biologists. The instructions of playful innovation also entail unconventional and remarkably implicit incentives for the participating students to be more than a scientist in its narrow sense. Instead, the team objectives are defined in such a way that wanting to become a synthetic biologist implies acquiring the skills of a profession which requires the practitioners to be responsible in their actions. Engaging with the public from the very start and understanding how the scientist is inevitably embedded with the rest of society, are therefore inextricably linked to what it means to construct biological parts and devices to eventually use them for the benefit of society (Calvert 2013; Calvert and Martin 2009).
The governance implications of how iGEM works as a competition thus questions not only how we perceive synthetic biology and other emerging technologies such as nanotechnology in relation to addressing uncertainty and environmental concerns, but also how a politics of knowledge can manifest itself within an institutional setting. As illustrated by Zhang (2011), besides the notable uncertainty, the cross-borderness of synthetic biology confronts policy-makers with various challenges (Zhang et al. 2011), but at the same time, this pervasive feature also needs to be fully embraced by policy to ensure that the robustness of society can minimise harmful impact (Gross, 2010). In the case of synthetic biology, the cross-borderness means interdisciplinary action,"

This way, we could both detect the expression and the localization in the peroxisomal membrane. To measure the change in size and number of the peroxisome, the yeast cells had to be observed under the microscope. For the examination of the effect of different Pex11 concentrations in the cell, from total deletion to overexpression, we transformed all constructs into the wild type as well as in the PEX11$\Delta$ strain. For comparison with the normal peroxisome phenotype in both strains we use sfGFP fused to a PTS1 sequence which is transported into the peroxisomal matrix. The deviation in peroxisome morphology indicates the functionality of our constructs.
Pex34
Similar to Pex11 we aimed at examining the impact of different concentrations of Pex34 on the peroxisome morphology. In this case we investigated a concentration range between the wild type phenotype and different levels of over expression, achieved by different constitutive promoters and inducible promoters.
ue to the fact that Pex34 is fully inserted into the membrane, a fusion with a large fluorescence protein could lead to the degradation of this peroxin. Therefore we worked with two different approaches.For the first approach, we fused an mTurquoise protein to the C - terminal end of Pex34, assuming that it doesn't affect the native structure and the import into the membrane.

As a second approach we decided to express Pex34 without any tag in order to conserve its natural function.

Top left ScSSW12, top right ScPAB1, bottom left GAL1 and bottom right CUP1. This constructs do not include any marker, so the expression in the cell must be evaluated by coexpressing sfGFP.
To show the variability of the peroxisome morphology in the second approach we used sfGFP-PTS1, which is imported into the matrix to visualize the change in their size. To"

⑥ Laboratory for experiments, seminar rooms for research and discussion, and the office used tosearch for information and analyze data are rigorously divided. These provisions are intended to prevent the possibility of unnecessary cross-contamination in the laboratory.
Dangerous chemicals
We tried to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals whenever possible. We have completely banned a number of dangerous chemicals, such as ethidium bromide which has been replaced by anthocyanin for our DNA gel electrophoresis. At the same time, we have restricted the use of dangerous chemicals (such as acrylamide) which must be clearly placed in marked areas in the laboratory. And we are also required to keep the chemistry reagents in classified storage.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," principle from cradle to cradle can change industry in the way it adopts to natural cycles. The idea is to create a form of giving and taking considering the ecologic system. If there would be a possibility to clean the planet from PET then this chance should be used to create alternative, eco friendly techniques. Mankind can find it´s peace with nature like Ernst Bloch postulates.
Chapter three: Evaluation and recommendation
In this chapter information gained in this manuscript is used to give a recommendation for ethic decisions like they have to be taken for example in politics. The two principles described in chapter one (Bloch and Jonas) are quite contrary and allow to distinguish only between two options. These two options are that technology should be used or not. Most decisions and their consequences are ambivalent and situation-dependent so that a binary model cannot be sufficient. Another model from Christoph Hubig deals with basic values which he thinks are essential for human beings (Becker (2008), page 128). In the model two basic values are distinguished. These are option and bequest values. Option values imply the variability of options humans can take. The more options remain after a new technique is implemented the better it is for the option values. Options also mean a prevention of factual constrains. A perfect example here is the use of atomic energy. Once praised as being a really efficient and eco friendly technique now the problems became visible. To deal with nuclear waste other techniques have to be developed to prevent mankind from harm; costs are no longer manageable. A good technique therefore allows for alternatives and implies little factual constrains.  Bequest values focus on the rights of individual persons. A new technique must not interfere with basic rights like building an own identity or having the possibility to educate oneself. The individual must always keep its possibilities to take own decisions. If a technique for example leads to the loss of human sanity let´s say by interfering with brain waves it is not compatible with bequest values. If there is a discrepancy between option and bequest values, bequest values should be preferred.  After giving a short introduction into Hubig´s model we will now use these to evaluate the use of synthesized bacteria under different conditions. Like described earlier in this text we will focus on four different possibilities. These possibilities are:
no intervention
Use of bacteria in marine environment
Use of bacteria in sewage treatment
Use of bacteria in industrial facility
Table 1 gives an overview over the option and bequest values for every possibility.
Intervention
