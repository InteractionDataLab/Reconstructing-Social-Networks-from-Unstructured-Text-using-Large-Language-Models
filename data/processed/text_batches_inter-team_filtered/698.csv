Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Human Practices#CAS conference_-_-_TEXT.html," provoke some thoughts about Synthetic Biology, he chose the following main topics:
Do we produce a shift in biology?
Do we educate a new generation of scientists?
Is it necessary to create something for understanding it? (Richard Feynman’s dictum)
What happens to evolution by natural selection when notions of design are reintroduced?
How mindful could we be of the “evolutionary fate” of designed organisms?
Do we really understand the whole of our creation?
How does it affect society?
What influence does it have on our relation to and our respect for evolved biological nature?
For example: Why should we worry about biodiversity when it could be designed?
Apart from us the iGEM teams from Bonn , TU Darmstadt , UCL London , TU München , LMU München , Marburg , Potsdam , Frankfurt , Tübingen , Wageningen as well as the last winner team of High School division Heidelberg_LSL participated at the CAS conference.
After the official program all iGEM teams met in the evenings to have dinner, some drinks together and a lot of fun….

La thérapie génique [1]
La thérapie génique consiste à délivrer un gène spécifiquement à des cellules ou tissus cibles avec une toxicité minimale. Remplacer un gène défectif par un gène sain et ainsi restaurer la fonction perdue du gène chez le patient est l’essence même de cette thérapie. La thérapie génique représente un outil prometteur pour le traitement de certaines maladies et principalement le cancer : l’administration d’acides nucléiques peut promouvoir ou inhiber la production d’une protéine spécifique, pour induire une réponse thérapeutique.
Contrairement aux médicaments qui agissent sur l’activité et le fonctionnement d’une  protéine, les gènes thérapeutiques interviennent plus en amont, à la source même du dysfonctionnement.
Haut de page
Mode d’administration [2]
Le gène peut être délivré ex vivo ou in vivo. Ex vivo, les cellules sont prélevées à partir d’un tissu du patient, puis exposées au gène-médicament. Une fois sélectionnées, les cellules transgéniques sont  réintroduites dans l’organisme du patient. Le gène peut également être délivré in vivo : l’ADN est directement injecté chez le patient, généralement dans le tissu qui doit être traité, afin d’accroître"

Hello, my name is David Brackett, and I’m the Advanced Placement chemistry teacher at Beijing National Day School, as well as the secondary PI for the BNDS-China iGEM group.  I received my doctorate degree in chemistry from the University of California, Davis, where I studied the physical characteristics and spectroscopic properties of an RNA aptamer interacting with small molecules.
After my doctorate degree, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington in the department of Biochemistry.  I investigated the alternative splicing of the Fmr1 gene in mouse brain, a gene that causes moderate to severe mental retardation in humans.
Prior to joining Beijing National Day School, I was a professor of chemistry at Portland Community College in Portland, Oregon.
Xiangmei Dou is our advisor and also a biology teach at Beijing National Day School. She got her PhD at Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science. In recent years, Doctor Dou has published several articles on Biology Teaching and Bulletin of Biology.

Public Engagament
As we all know, human practice plays one of the most significant part in iGEM. Being the first-year-participating iGEM team, we feel the enthusiasm from many other teams. We have received various of meetup and interaction invitations.
Survey
Transportation litigations and disputes have long been a problem in the society which logistics and international transportation plays an essential role in commerce. We aimed to solving this problem despite we didn’t know the issue very well. Therefore, with an eye to knowing the problem detailly, we designed a series of questionnaires and release them on the internet. We have received nearly 1,000 replies from the public. Some reminded us the problems we might come across, and others even introduced new orientations to us. Besides, we interviewed an international ship entrepreneur via Internet, which is also helpful in understanding the international transportation.
95 percents of the sample think it is helpful to use our product
Meetup
The interaction between teams is usually the most important role in iGEM. We have exchange with many other teams by skype meetups, participating Asia meetup, and so on.
Peshawar
In the late June, we have a Skype meetup with Team Peshawar.
Missouri S&T
We were glad to have met Mr. and Mrs. Westenberg from Team Missouri S&T in July at our school. Sharing topics to each other, we got to know iGEM with a new prospect.

European Researchers’ Night
The ""Researcher's Night"", an evening event funded by the Ministry of Science and the EU throughout all of Israel and Europe that aims to enrich students' knowledge and love of science through various creative activities. We produced and executed the event held in Kiryat Shmona (of the Northern Galilee), joined by the iGEM Technion and iGEM Danzinger teams as well. At “Researcher’s Night”, we organized activities in the fields of biology, chemistry and physics, alongside researchers from the MIGAL Institute. Additionally, we presented our iGEM project and performed an activity extracting DNA from wheat germ.
Helping “Danciger Darca Comprehensive High School” with their poster and T-shirts
People always say that family is the most important thing you have. Our group is located mostly in Kiryat- Shemona (in the Northern periphery of Israel), and another group that is participating in the igem- high school track ( Danciger) is from Kiryat Shmona as well. This is a group of bright students studying Biotechnology who have developed an interest in science from an early age and are eager to constantly learn more.
In preparation for the competition , we helped them design the shirts with which they come to Boston, and helped them create and design the poster for the Giant Jamboree.
Such cooperation is always welcome. They liked the design we created for them,  and we helped them raise their morale. It is important to remain unified as we represent the same place, and want to bring it much pride.
Brainstorming over Skype
We held skype conversations as well with Lithuania and Freiburg regarding all of our teams’ projects. We brainstormed ways to progress and discussed the difficulties we had encountered and the solutions we had tried to find thus far.

Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.
Biofilm formation on surfaces is an issue in the medical field, naval industry, and other areas. We developed an anti-fouling peptide with two modular components: a mussel adhesion protein (MAP) anchor and LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genetically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression.

Notice:Except for specially mentioned, all the following vectors were constructed by In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (produced by Clontech). To be brief, every fragment of desired DNA was linearized by primers designed following the protocol provided by Takara infusion cloning guide to ensure accurately 15 base pair (bp) overlap homology with each adjacent fragments. The gel-purified fragments were mixed with 2uL infusion cloning kit Premix solution and ddH2O was used to adjust the mixture to 10uL. The amount of the added fragments was based on the Takara infusion cloning guide.

Connecting with Students: Camp Launch
Every summer, the William & Mary School of Education hosts a summer camp for local middle school students to learn STEM, do hands-on activities, and think about college opportunities and possible careers. The W&M iGEM team has collaborated with the School of Education in the past to do teaching activities with students, so we reached out and invited students and teachers from the camp to visit our lab.
Since we were working with a community partner, we wanted our goals for the event to reflect theirs. The head of the program emphasized that we should try to get students interested in the field of molecular biology and participating in research in college. Therefore, we approached the event with these goals in mind.
Prior to the event, we met with and received feedback on our preliminary plan from the teacher, Deanna Marroletti, who was a teacher in charge of the group of students visiting our lab. We learned that the original activities that we had planned were too simplistic for the group. Although the students were in middle school, they were already knowledgeable about the field of biology. Based on her suggestions, we chose three activities to do with the students: a strawberry DNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, and streaking plates with E. coli expressing RFP. While the DNA extraction activity is quite simple, we started with this in order to get everyone in the group to a minimum level of knowledge about the properties of DNA and how scientists use it in a lab. For the gel electrophoresis activity, we made up a scenario and created different DNA samples for students to test via gel electrophoresis (and solve the crime!). During this activity, we talked about lab techniques and how different kinds of researchers can work with DNA in the lab. Lastly, we did the RFP activity from our high school activity booklet and talked about synthetic biology and lab techniques.
Two groups of 15 students (30 total) each visited our lab for two and a half hours. All the activities went smoothly, and the students seemed to enjoy the themselves and were"

BBa_K654058 . This part contains the TesA gene, which encodes a Thioesterase enzyme. It was submitted by the Utah State 2011 iGEM Team.
This last gene adds the standardization ability to our cell. The enzyme cleaves the Fatty Acyl-Acp that is being elongated by the E.coli metabolism and force the elongation process to stop. This results in fatty acid and ACP, and because of the enzyme specificity, it produces all the FAs with the same chain length. This gene is also the one we rely on to have a bigger acid availability to the cell.
BBa_K590031 This part has been submitted by the Washington 2011 iGEM Team.
This gene encodes an  Aldehyde Decarbonylase enzyme. The enzyme acts on the fatty aldehyde formed by the FAR complex and removes the carbonyl group, resulting in a alkane molecule, one carbon shorter than the used aldehyde. It is essential for our pathway.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," secretions of the mandibular glands and the PLGA nanoparticles. This mixture will then be delivered to the larvae through the excretory ducts.2
Polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) is a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer that is used for the fabrication of drug delivery devices. PLGA could be used to transport proteins, peptides, and macromolecules such as DNA and RNA. PLGA is ideal for drug delivery because its degradation can be used to control the drug’s release profile.
While zero order kinetics would be the most desirable case, this is currently unachivable. There are three possible non-zero ordered behaviours for polymer degradation. Polymer degradation/erosion (A) is dependent on the degradation of the polymer coating. Diffusion (B) is currently the most common release mechanism, wherein release is dependent on the dissolved drug’s concentration. Finally, solvent penetration or device swelling (C) is dependent on the permeability of the device.
The release behavior of PLGA is linked to its degradation, which is triggered by hydrolysis. The profile is bulk degradation as a consequence of the water penetration into the particle and by the polymer´s own behavior. The process can be divided into two phases:
The initial burst where there is a quantity of drug released at time zero related to the drug type, drug concentration, and polymer hydrophobicity.
The progressive drug liberation through the weakened PLGA layer. The solvent hydrolyzes the polymer and creates a channel from which the drug can be released by diffusion and erosion until polymer degradation is complete.
The factors that influence the PLGA degradation are the following:3
Polymer composition determines the hydrophilicity and the rate of degradation of the particles. A high percentage of glycolic acid in the composition increases weight loss.
Polymer coating, which can result in a different reaction, e.g. Chitosan coating makes for sturdier nanoparticles that begin degradation in more acidic environments.
The average molecular weight is related to the polymer chain size. Heavier molecular weights correspond to lower degradation rates.
The drug or molecule type in the PLGA matrix modifies the degradation mechanism and the rate of degradation.  It is clear that the chemical properties of the drug affect the release profile. However, there is not a clear correlation between the drug chemistry and the behavior.
The size and shape also impacts matrix degradation. A higher surface area in comparison to volume shows higher matrix degradation making drug liberation faster.
Environment pH may also affect the rate degradation of PLGA. Strongly alkaline and acidic media leads to a faster degradation whilst less acidic and neutral"

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour71_-_-_TEXT.html," the surface of bacteria. In principle a peptide aptamer could be generated to target these types of molecules, but not by using the bacterial two-hybrid system.
Furthermore we cannot eliminate the possibility that it might affect our results (or future results) whether the peptide aptamer and target protein is linked to the N-terminal or C-terminal of T18 and T25. To exclude this possibility parallel experiments should be conducted with the different combinations. Ideally the bacterial strain, in which the screening is conducted, should lack the chromosomal gene copy of the target protein. If the target protein is highly produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli), the gene encoding it should be deleted before the screen is applied. This is to rule out the possibility of a T18-linked peptide aptamer interacting with the chromosomal gene-product of the target protein and thusfail to activate the reporter system.
However, the bacterial two hybrid system is not limited to bacterial target proteins. The system has been shown to detect interactions between eukaryotic proteins as well. Reference: Karimova G, Pidoux J, Ullmann A, Ladant D. (1998) A bacterial two-hybrid system based on a reconstituted signal transduction pathway. 1998;95(10):5752-6. [PubMed] The target protein should, on the other hand, be non-toxic to E. coli in great amounts. Since it is transformed into the bacterium encoded in a high-copy plasmid.
One of the advances of peptide aptamers in a potential therapeutic use is that they are very small molecules. Because of their size peptide aptamers are less likely to be immunogenic compared to a murine antibody. We hope to further reduce the chances of our peptide aptamer being perceived as ‘foreign molecule’  since we have chosen human thioredoxin (hThx) as the scaffold protein of our peptide aptamers. But a peptide aptamer bound to its specific target will not be able to activate the rest of the immunesystem to help it exterminate an intruder. To heighten the therapeutic use of peptide aptamers one should experiment with conjugating the effector region of human antibodies to the peptide aptamers (please visit our page Medical Aspects for more on this subject).

Future Laboratory  Work
After a screen with the nucleotide library and finding a peptide aptamer against a target protein the next step would be to examine the features of it.
The peptide aptamers affinity and specificity towards its target are two important parameters to know, especially if it is meant for use in diagnostics and treatment.
The affinity is especially important if we should get more than one positive colony in a screen. Several ways exist, to where we can test this, here amongs competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The ELISA wells would be coated with the target protein, to this we will add the peptide aptamer, giving them time to bind. After binding we will wash out any unbound peptide aptamers. A detection molecule that binds to the peptide aptamer though anti-FLAG will be added and later excess detection molecule will be washed out. An enzyme that converts the detections molecule to a color will be added. The color change or the amount of light emitted is proportional to the level of peptide aptamer bound to target.

iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project OR demonstrate an innovative human practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the human practices hub for information and examples of previous teams comprehensive and innovative activities).
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Improve the function OR characterization of an previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year of the iGEM competition) and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must not come from your 2015 part range.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab)."

If the costs of recurrence, as estimated by Cancer Research UK were taken into account - £16000 for stage 1 and £17000 as the average cost of other stages [19] - the cost per QALY would still only be £8300, and at 39% sensitivity would be £19900 per QALY.
Our modeling therefore proves that our sensor would be cost effective in reducing mortality rates from NSCLC. The same principle on which this model is based could be applied to any cancer to screen those with sufficiently high risk using miRNA biomarkers.

Validation of the peroxisomal localization can be achieved via fluorescence overlap of the sensor and a peroxisomal marker, in our case pex13-mRuby ( import mechanism ).
Figure 5.2 Level 2 plasmids with peroxisomal marker Peroxin13-mRuby and uracil auxotrophy for colocalization. Left roGFP2 with strong promoter. Right pHLourin2 with strong promoter.
It can also be achieved by transforming the sensors attached to the PTS1 sequence into a $\Delta\,$Pex5 yeast strain. The sensor is expected to show no specific localisation due to the missing import sequence. We calibrated the sensors in living yeast cells and physiological ranges so that we can not only perform relative but also quantitative measurements. We aim to confirm our hypothesis of a more oxidized redox state of roGFP2 in peroxisomes with violacein pathway activity and want to measure differences in pH within yeast strains with peroxisomal membrane anchored pex3-bacteriorhodopsin protein (membrane proteins) .
Once expression and localization of the sensor is proven by microscopy, measurements with a plate reader or a fluorometer are acceptable. This allows a high number of replicates to be measured accurately in reasonable time. Microscopy is performed with a filter based Nikon Eclipse TI fluorescence microscope at 100-fold magnification and plate reader measurements are performed with a Tecan infinite plate reader (Mahon M. J. et al., 2011) . For pHLuorin2 emission intensity is measured at 535 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 485 nm. Same settings were used for roGFP2 (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . Evaluation of the reported signals is done by the excitation ratio of the the corresponding excitation wavelength.
Nootkatone
In order to have a proof of concept for our compartmentation strategy we intend to establish the nootkatone pathway inside the peroxisome. Therefore we aim to target the three enzymes for the nootkatone production to compartment. Before starting the actual lab work for the ambitious plan to establish a completely new pathway in the peroxisome, there are several aspects that have to be considered first.
The initial step is to find a reliable source to prove the abundance of our precursor Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) in yeast peroxisomes"

Confirming the Presence of the Three-Gene Ligated Product
Experimentor: Grace Yi, Liz Geum
Aim : To confirm the presence of the ligated product containing all three caffeine biosynthesis genes
Results : We ran the ligation of the three genes (done July 24) on a 1% agarose gel. Three faint bands were seen at ~1.2kb, ~2.5kb, and ~3.2kb. The band at 3.2 kb indicates our desired product is present. However, gel extraction will be needed to isolate 3.2-kb product from the others.
Amplifying the Stitched Product using PCR
Experimentor : Grace Yi, Liz Geum
Aim : To amplify the three-gene product using PCR
Results : The same PCR conditions were used as for PCR 2 but with a longer extension time. The forward primer for part H and reverse primer for part L were used. Gel picture showed a very strong band at 1.2 kb region. We suspect that this is because the three caffeine genes are similar at the N and C termini likely due to sequence conservation and strep tags on the 3' end. This would enable the primers to amplify each gene individually, two adjacent genes, or all three genes (the last of which is desired). It would be thereby giving amplification of 1kb. To reach a high enough concentration for cloning, we decided to set up a larger volume reaction for the digest and ligation, gel extract at 3kb band, and clone.
Analyzing Sequencing Results
Experimentor : Grace Yi, Liz Geum
Aim : To analyze the sequencing results for PCR 3 products cloned into pSB1C3
Results : Sequencing results for PCR 3 product of each gene in pSB1C3 arrived today. With our new insert in the vector, sequencing results should show that XbaI and SpeI sites are regenerated. However, none had XbaI or SpeI cutsites, and the two other standard cutsites were present. This indicated formation of X-S scars. With clustal, we found that our sequences and those"

Dialyzing Recombinant MASP2
5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. 1L of it. 24 hour dialysis, with 2 bath changes.

5 mM = 0.3953g in 1L of water
Dialysis start: 5pm
Bath change: 11:30pm
Imitating the DACA Spinline
Folded an aluminum tray to hold the coag bath for the 2 godets
Used a ringstand to hold a hook above the coagulation bath
Extruded dope into a 1L beaker of 90% v/v isopropanol
It didn't work!
The hook had too much friction, so the fiber wasn't able to slide over it. I wasn't even able to get the fiber to the first godet.
I also found that with the isopropanol bath, if you disturb the dope even slightly as it comes out, it starts bunching up. It's very sensitive.
Switching back to yesterday's spin method
Clearly the imitation DACA wasn't working. So I just set up a godet to reel the silk above the coag bath again.
However, immediately after spinning, I submerged the godet in the coag. solvent and removed the silk from the godet. I then used tweezers to try to stretch the ring of fiber that formed
My attempts at stretching probably broke fibers instead of stretching them."

The fifteen successful colonies were PCR amplified using the input/output promoters.
Each colony was scraped into 200μL of water.
20μL of this along with 2.5μL of the forward and 2.5μL of the reverse promoter was used.
PCR program #130 was used.
These PCR products were run on gels using 1μL of construct, 2μL of loading dye, and 10μL of water, with two ladders on either side.
5μL each of the 1Kb ladder and the Versa ladder were used.
See ""Gels of PCRed colonies"" for results.
Summary: only old GFP contained a g-Block.
The fifteen successfμL colonies were also restreaked onto new plates so they could grow!
We digested 2ug of UV, HSP, and GFP with HindIII and XbaI.
Used 30μL total volume and 9.4μL of UV, 8.6μL of HSP, and 9.5μL of GFP.
Let digest for about 2 hours.
Purified these.
The concentrations were as follows:
UV 90.4ng/μL
HSP 99.5ng/μL
GFP 117.3ng/μL.
Ligated these three cut and purified g-Blocks with the X1 pACYC184 cut with HindIII and XbaI overnight.
50 ng of pACYC184 was used and the inserts were used in 1:5 ratios, calculated on the ligation calculator.
20μL total volume was used for the ligations.
6/10/2014
Took ligation out of PCR machine and put in freezer.
Found primers to amplify the successful GFP in pBR322 so that it can be amplified and sent out for sequencing.

Megan Satyadi | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics
I am a junior in MIMG and am returning for a third year as a research advisor and Director of Training. Additionally, I am also an undergraduate research associate in the Kosuri Lab at UCLA studying GPCR-ligand interactions and developing a multiplex assay to deorphanize the entirety of the human and mouse olfactory receptor repertoire. I believe synthetic biology holds infinite power and potential to revolutionize science, and is the perfect outlet for innovative scientific minds. Long term, I plan on pursuing a MD and entering the field of gastroenterological surgery. When I'm not stuck working in a TC hood, I'm an avid reader and enjoy working with animals.
Alan Chen | Junior | Neuroscience
​I am a junior undergraduate just joining iGEM this year and am currently majoring in Neuroscience at UCLA. I have always been interested in synthetic biology and find it fascinating to reprogram existing biological systems. Currently I am working with a group to create a bacterial toxin delivery system.
Amy Guo | Sophomore | Bioengineering
I am currently a sophomore bioengineering student. My interests include botany, particularly plant-herbivore interactions and plant-to-plant communication pathways, and diatoms. Synthetic biology I feel is best described as a pair of much-needed, high-prescription glasses-- your perception of the world around you becomes wonderfully magnified and crisp, and suddenly you are able to view the mechanics of living organisms as an infinite library of blueprints at your disposal.
Omar Ebrahim | Sophomore | Biochemistry
Innovation has never been the product of book smarts alone. For an idea to bear fruit, I believe one has to tinker with it. Unfortunately, much of a biologist's education consists of almost exclusively memorization and recitation of facts. However, synthetic biology is somewhat of an anomaly because it embodies the practice of picking something apart and manipulating it's core components as its standard methodology. I guess that's why I am here.
Andrew Liu | Junior | Biochemistry
I am a 3rd year biochemistry major here at UCLA, and it is my first year on the iGEM team. I love everything science and so the interdisciplinary and undergraduate guided research in iGEM is an incredibly enjoyable experience"

Residues 10 and 12
Once our cage has been designed and purified, it will be necessary to experimentally verify that the cage properly forms and breaks when exposed to thrombin. As of now, our group plans on using dynamic light scattering and conjugation of fluorescent markers to verify these occurrences. I began investigating the inner structure of the cage to look for serine residues that could be swapped for cysteines to use in conjugation reactions. The premise of this experiment is such that the cage will properly form to sequester the inside residues from fluorescent conjugation molecules on the outside of the cage. only when exposed to thrombin will the cage break and allow access to the mutated inner residues containing cysteine, which will conjugate with fluorescent markers to allow easy visualization with a fluorescent microscope."

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," of the controversy was the one whose story was written and maintained for a long time as History of science. By constructing nature (with the help of facts and results), in a dynamical process, he also constructs new active social critters that reconfigure what is true and false, the objective and subjective, the learned and the ignorant. A very good example of that construction can be found in The Leviathan and the Air Pump of Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer (Shapin and Schaffer 1989). They show how Boyle, winner of the controversy against Hobbes, had built modern criterions of scientificity. The controversy was about establishing, as Boyle defended it, through the air pump, the “nature” of air and the “proof” of the existence of vacuum. Through the model of the air pump, the laboratory became the space of the science, the instrumental experimentation became the scientific method. In the same move, the “pure” literary form and the modesty of scientific witnesses of the experiment (as the insurance of objective certification) had deeply figured the form of modern science. Thus, beside the concept of nature, there are hidden stakes we cannot intuitively imagine. By winning the controversy, Boyle imposed new conceptions of truth, of proof, of scientific literature, of scientist as a “social group”, of objectivity and subjectivity, of gender (as show by Donna Haraway in (Haraway 1997) ). Scientificity and truth are now separated from opinion.
Bruno Latour will call “grand partage” (“big division”) that aim of distinction of entities that compose our world. The “modern challenge” was to oppose opinion from truth, nature from technology, human from un-human, inhumanity of science from humanity of society, scholar from politic... Is our concept of naturality and artificiality not included in that grand partage?
Deeply more political, the theoretical approach of Donna Haraway is to denounce the domination process (both material and ideal) which was constructed in the same dynamic as naturality. The process of essentialization are in the collimator of the philosopher : essentialization of the differences between genders, races, species. Building differences, said “natural”, between these entities show a set of stakes we have to keep in mind in our aim of a fair and responsible knowledge, reached in our ethical reflexion. Through Haraway's works, which I cannot summarize entirely here because of their complexity and importance, we have to consider sciences, in particular life sciences, as deeply political. By ruling about forms of the living, biologist can rule about what"

Wet lab:
The lysozyme assay was planned andwas performed twice and first data was obtained. There was also writtena script that analyzes the data from the platereader automatically andproduces plots. This week we wanted to create the plasmids to circularize lambda lysozyme with some test linkers. BsaI sites, overhangs and the linker were added to the lambda lysozyme gene via primer overhangs. Goldengate cloning worked fine, but sequencing showed that there were mismatches in the primer region. Other clones might be sequenced as well, but there is not much hope. That is why we have put more efforts in designing our final inserts that do not rely on large overhangs.

Wet lab:
Our aim was to create a plasmid that circularizes lambda-lysozyme with any linker that can easily be added. Therefore the mrfp selection marker in the circularization standard plasmid had to be exchanged with both a lambda-lys insert and a new selection marker, ccdb. First attempts using Golden Gate cloning + religation failed. However, using new competent cells both the Golden Gate attempt and the alternative, a 3-way ligation, worked well. About the attempts to insert lambda-lys + some test linkers at once: “Other clones might be sequenced as well, but there is not much hope.” (see last week) - Other clones were indeed successfully sequenced.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the binding affinity of a cell receptor would require a large effort to intelligently design a new receptor or, more likely, a large library of random mutant receptors to screen. This idea was discounted fully after we discovered that the innate activity of the receptor tended to disrupt the apoptosis pathway.
Riboswitch
We still liked the idea of creating a sensor that could inform the consumer when the desired concentration of progesterone was present in the culture. From our mentor, McKenna Hicks, we learned about riboswitches, due to her extensive research and creation of the nucleotide-based sensors. We were informed that the guided mutagenesis process for a protein-based receptor was comparatively more labor-intensive anyways than for the sensors that could be created with riboswitches.
Riboswitches are composed of short sequences of nucleotides made up of an aptamer, which is a ligand-binding domain made up of nucleic acids, and the expression platform that can control gene-regulatory functions. These aptamers can be tested in vitro for progesterone specificity, whereas proteins require synthesis in vivo. A paper by Contreras Jimnenez et al. (2015) described several in vitro-derived aptamers specific for progesterone [28] . Unfortunately, like the progesterone receptor, these aptamers are also three orders of magnitude too sensitive for our desired concentration, but have much shorter sequences - an average of 51 bp compared to 933 bp for human progesterone receptor isoform B (hPR-B) [28,29] . Mutating these short sequences and isolating variants would be much easier than mutating a larger protein receptor. We found that the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method follows a similar logic to directed evolution, and is intended for selecting RNA aptamers [30] .
For these reasons, we looked into the viability of creating a progesterone-specific RNA aptamer that could be used in conjunction with a riboswitch expression platform to affect the expression of a reporter gene. Our research uncovered a previous iGEM BioBrick (BBa_K1913011) that used a trans-functioning riboswitch to indirectly affect the expression of an RFP reporter gene directly affecting the expression of a TutR inverter protein as well as another paper describing the in-vitro characterization of several progesterone-specific RNA aptamers. We attempted to mimic the same TutR inverter system as in the previously described BioBrick until we found another paper describing a more fitting option.

Introduction
For decades, scientific breakthroughs and technological progress in biotechnology have empowered the notion of the bioeconomy, in which biomass is used to produce society’s energy, chemicals and materials. More than that, the bioeconomy has been postulated as a crucial component in the much-needed transition to a more sustainable world - one that is, above all, less dependent on fossil fuels. But despite the promises and progress of biotech, the bioeconomy has far from realised its full potential. In part, the biorefineries that were supposed to provide the foundation of a sustainable bioeconomy simply don’t exist yet. In our iGEM project, we aim to tackle this issue by developing an enabling technology for truly self-sustaining biorefineries, which can be used for the production of virtually any product for which microbes can be engineered. This technology, based on a synthetic consortium of cyanobacteria and chemotrophs, can be used in wide variety of applications to empower (find synonym) all facets of the bioeconomy. In the following application scenarios, we contextualize several such applications and discuss in detail the design aspects required for their real-world implementations.
The problem
Climate Change
Today, 82% of the world’s energy supply is derived from fossil resources. According to many, this reliance on fossil fuels drives global warming and climate change. Yet the notion of climate change itself is shrouded in controversy. Surveys show that a majority of Americans think climate change is a topic of significant scientific disagreement. Yet despite popular consensus, overwhelming evidence suggests that human-caused climate change is real and poses tremendous costs and future risks to society and natural systems. In a recent report on the issue, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) documented what we actually know about climate change. Their three most important conclusions were as follows:
Climate scientists agree that climate change is happening. Based on well-established evidence, about 97% of climate scientists conclude that climate change is real, happening now, and caused by humans. This notion is not supported by a single study, but, as AAAS reports, by a “a converging stream of evidence over the past two decades from surveys"

Protein function analysis- Enzyme activity assay
We then validated the function of our pYD1-FliC(XynA) by testing the enzyme activity of recombinant S. cerevisiae EBY100 harbouring pYD1-FliC(XynA). We cultured and induced control group(EBY100-pYD1) and experimental group(EBY100-FliC(XynA)) at the same initial concentration in SG-CAA medium (plus 5% xylan). Supernatant of the same volume were collected every two hours from 10h to 18h to examine the concentration of reducing sugars by DNS method. The results are shown below.
Figure 16 Xylnase enzyme activity assay curve.
The value of OD540 is of positive correlation with the concentration of reducing sugar assayed by DNS method. So here we used the value of OD540 to estimate the concentration of reducing sugar. Before 14h, engineered yeasts were consuming the galactose in medium, so the OD540 values of two groups were similarly decreasing. After 14h, the OD540 of the control group was still decreasing, while the values of the experimental group had changed to increase, and decreased again after 16h, which means that FliC(Xylanase) proteins had been displayed in a certain quantity at the beginning of 14h and degraded the xylan of culture medium to xylose, so the concentration of reducing sugar increased. After a period of time, yeast absorption rate of xylose and galactose was greater than that of xylan decomposed by enzyme, so the concentration of reducing sugar decreased again. Thus, from here we conclude that our FilC(XynA) were successfully displayed on the yeast surface.

Our approach
From the beginning, our strategy has been to understand the overall picture regarding ethics, sustainability, safety, and security in our project. Thereafter, we have tried to find all the specific issues with our project and how we can solve and integrate them into our work.
We early on identified and analysed the different stakeholders, and opened up a discussion regarding the many aspects and opinions that could affect our project. We aim to create a therapeutic product, which is why we have targeted regulatory consultants, business advisors, doctors, patients, ethics professors and health economics professors. Along the way, we were able to identify and integrate different parts such as safety, regulations and product design. However, we also wanted to create valuable content that we believe can positively can influence, inspire, and help current and future iGEM teams, while improving Human Practices.
Killswitch
We faced one of our biggest challenges early on in the project. We realized that if our product PROlung was to be released on the market, it would need to be safe and biocontained, for both for humans and for the environment.
These requirements have not been only established in order to obtain approval from the regulatory agencies, from our interviews we also learned that they were also very important from the doctor’s point of view, from their Hippocratic Oath they would never prescribe anything that could cause any harm, or could be unsafe for the patients.
Not only regulators and doctors raised their concern about this topic, during the Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC), we received the same feedback from an iGEM judge, that we would really need to consider all the safety issues a product like this could raise.
However, the first person raising this concern, and one of our most influential advisors for this topic is Giulio Bernardinelli, a member of iGEM Trieste 2011 and an advisor for iGEM Trieste 2012. He emphasized the importance of having a controllable switch"

Analysis of Data Scanned
This way of regrouping common questions, common practices mentioned by the past teams allows for some basic statistical analysis. What we present here is mostly for descriptive purposes. The first trend that we observe is an obvious augmentation of human practice (HP) projects, both in terms of absolute numbers and relatively to the number of iGEM projects, over the years.
Second, we have this other simple bar graph that is an overview of the data obtained from the scan. It gives the relative amount of each kind of category. Interestingly, ""Public education"" has been the most widely discussed theme. Right after comes ""Ethics"" and ""Public Perception"". The three remaining themes account for the rest. It must be noted that we might at some point considered two different themes for a single team if their projects covered them so this makes a greater total number of themes than human practice projects per se.
The graph below shows the percentage of each category of human practice project in each year of the iGEM competition. As observed, a greater number of teams that worked on human practice project in the beginning (2007;deep blue bands) focused on educating the public on the new field of synthetic biology. This has however decreased recently until 2011 since synthetic biology is growing in the community and the awareness is increasing, however since as of 2011 obtaining a gold medal includes a HP component it may have been an easy way to fulfil this criterion. Now that synthetic biology has become known to the public, the next hurdle is to look at the perception of the public (orange colour) on the field and this attributes to why an increase in human practice projects centred on public perception is observed in recent iGEM human practice projects. Secondly, Patents have become a great issue in synthetic biology as the idea is to create a standardised and reusable open source parts. The issue of patents in an iGEM project discovery and synthetic biology in general has called for an increase in the number of human practise projects addressing this recently (yellow bands). Ethical concerns (pink colour) were raised after the first iGEM competition (2007) on the potential dangers of synthetic biology and this called for a greater number of teams to focus on it in the next year (2008) as shown on the graph. Ethics still remains a major concern of synthetic biology and has since been addressed by the next generations of iGEM teams (2009-2011) although not as in the second iGEM competition. There were quite a low number"

Cell targeting
Context
After the tissue vector action, comes the cell  vector , this one is a modified bacteriophage which has the ability to infect eukaryotic cells. Lambda phage, because of its high capacity of cloning and a capsid structure adapted to a concentrated presence of exogenous proteins, is a good candidate to design an eukaryotic tissue vector . The penton base originally from the adenovirus capsid appears as a promising candidate for Lambda phage targeting. Indeed, it is endowed of several functions like the cell receptors link, the viral particles internalisation and the release of the capsid by the endosome.
Objective
Our objectives are to design a cell vector of Lambda phage type recombined with a penton base from the adenovirus 5 fused by its D protein . The tissue vector should be able to integer the cell, go out of the endosome, transport its DNA to the nucleus of the cell and finally to transcript its therapeutic genes .

We need to generate a KO in the ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase gene so we are going to insert one of our constructs into that locus. We are also going to insert a second transgene into a thiamin biosynthetic gene. This insertion will be easy to score using thiamin auxotrophy as a phenotypic marker. The thiamin gene insertion site target may be more useful to you. Is your team interested in a video conference? If not no big deal, but it might be interesting to talk.

TA system
Background
Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been abundantly found on plasmids and chromosomes of free-living prokaryotes and genes encoding a toxin and its cognate antitoxin are generally contiguous. Toxins are stable proteins that inhibit one of essential cellular processes, such as DNA replication, translation, peptidoglycan synthesis or cell division.
To date, TA systems are classified into five types according to the nature and the function of antitoxins.
In type I and type III TA systems, the antitoxins are small noncoding RNAs. Type I antitoxins bind to the cognate toxin mRNAs to inhibit their translation initiation or to induce their degradation, while type III antitoxin inactivate their cognate toxins through protein-RNA interactions.
Type II, IV, and V antitoxins are proteins. Type II is the best-characterized TA systems where antitoxins neutralize the harmful effects of the cognate toxins through direct binding. In type IV and V TA systems, only one example has been identified, respectively. The type IV antitoxin, CbeA, antagonizes the activity of CbtA toxin by interfering with the binding of CbtA to its target cytoskeleton proteins, MreB and FtsZ. In type V TA system, GhoS antitoxin itself is an endoribonuclease, which specifically cleaves GhoT toxin mRNA to block its expression.
Our study has focused on the lethal efficiency of different toxin proteins.
Mechanism
Regulations of MazF toxin in E. coli MazF-MazE TA system
Escherichia coli MazF, which belongs to the MazEF family with its cognate antitoxin MazE, is one of the best-characterized toxins. Under stressful environments, MazF specifically cleaves cellular RNAs at ACA sites irrespective of the ribosome, serving as a post-transcriptional regulator.
Interestingly, MazF homologues are well-conserved in the prokaryotic domain. Additionally, they cleave discrete RNA sites based on recognition length and sequences. Therefore, MazF homologues are thought to play diverse biological roles; indeed, they"

Introductions
RNA interference (RNAi) is an endogenous, ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved and powerful method for regulating gene expression, which can cause the gene encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation[1]. In this case, a medication in transcription level can be achieved. RNAi is highly effective in silencing the target gene that regulates the specific biological/pathological pathway[2]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that every human disease with over-expression of disease causing gene(s) is a potential target for RNAi-based therapeutics [3].

TO OPTIMIZE THE APPLICABILITY AND ADAPTIVE of this system for protein-protein interaction usage, we designed a novel substitution system for this part as well as for all the collection PPI tool kit. Following this, two proteins could be fused with their corresponding split-GFP fragment at the same time using Bsa I enzyme digestion and Golden-Gate Assembly protocols. For instance, the replaceable Zif268 segment can be replaced by other Protein1-RBS-Protein2 fragment, thus, whether the protein1 and 2 are interaction proteins could be determined by fluorescence signal (Figure 3)..
Figure 3 Schematic representation of the workflow of the substitution system
TO DEMONSTRATE the usability of this substitution system, we introduced a “FRB-RBS-FKBP” fragment to replace the replaceable fragment of this part by using Golden-Gate Assembly (BBa_K1997020). Intriguingly, IT WORKED! Fluorescence intensity measured right after the addition of Rapamycin showed a significant improvement on relative FI, thus validated the usability of this part and the substitution system (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Rapamycin-induced sGFP-N-FRB/sGFP-C-FKBP interaction.
(A) Schematic representation of the rapamycin induced protein-protein interaction. The adding of rapamycin would induce the interaction between FRB and FKBP, thus shortened the range between split-GFP fragments and reconstruct its structure for fluorescence generation. (B) Fluorescent assay showing the fluorescent intensity with/without Rapamycin induction. Relative FI was calculated with normalization of the OD600 value. For Fold change Relative FI, relative FI of the group without Rapamycin induction was set arbitrarily as 1.0, and the levels of the other groups were adjusted correspondingly. The concentration of Rapamycin used in the experiment was 40nM. This experiment was run in three parallel reactions, and the data represent results obtained from at least three independent experiments. **p<0.01.
TO COMPARE this part related newly-introduced split-GFP system with the traditional GFP-N/GFP-C split-GFP system, we analyzed their SIGNAL INTENSITIES and the NOISE-SIGNAL RATIOS.

Results
We analyzed existing parts BBa_K912000 and BBa_912001 using OD. Please see the results in parts regigsry page in Parts page.
Until the Wiki freeze, we tried to construct plasmid with the insert we designed and managed to combine plasmid with INSERT 1, 2 or 3(we couldn't insert INSERT 4, which is a control of the INSERT 2 or 3).
To assay our construct, we cultured E. coli with IPTG induction, purified the crude extract by the His-tag and condensed them.
When the expressed protein (both INSERT 2 and 3) were cut at the signal peptides, the molecular weight becomes 52367.76 or 48575.69 respectively.
The figure bellow is the result of SDS-PAGE. We applied purified INSERT 2 (left) and INSERT 3 (right, not visible)and found that the band of INSERT 2 is at the correct place.
We assumed two possibility that explain why we couldn't get the band of INSERT 3; the concentration of protein is too small, the His-tag didn't interacted with the Nickel column and flowed  through.
To determine the reason why we couldn't see the band, we conducted phytase activity assay with the crude extract, purified and condensed products, and the flow through of purification process.
As the table and figure below shows, we can see high phytase activity in the flow through and concluded that His-tag didn't interacted with the Nickel, probably because the His-tag was not exposed outside. Simultaneously, we can assume that self-Assembling Peptides (SAPs) helped His-tag being exposed and interacting with Nickel.
We applied crude extract of INSERT 2 (left) and INSERT 3. (right). The difference of mobility between INSERT 2 and 3 is very small but may be slightly different. (Difficult to judge)
Phytase thermostability
We assayed thermostability of several kind of phytase; Citrobacter braakii and E. coli phytase from Northwestern 2012 and Klebsiella pneumoniae (our original)
Though the degree of deactivation is different according to kind of phytase, the characteristic that remaining activity after 1 hour heat shock drops is common.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," impact of oxidative stress upon protein structure is significant and since structure and function are inexplicably, linked the functionality of the proteins are likely to be hindered too. Thus, we are looking towards preventative methods that will lessen the amount of oxidative stress that proteins are exposed to.
LYCOPENE CONCEPT
Our lycopene probiotic will act in the gut to neutralise ROS to regain the balance as shown in the diagram above
Lycopene is a carotenoid, and is the compound responsible responsible for giving the distinctive red colour to fruit such as tomatoes and watermelon. It is for this reason that lycopene has previously been used and characterised within iGEM as it lends itself to colorimetric detection. However, we believe this does not completely harness the power of this compound.   Lycopene is one of natures most powerful antioxidants. This is due to the numerous saturated bonds within its structure which enables it to quench ROS including singlet oxygen (2). This provides our cells with protection against damage to critical biomolecules -which can ultimately lead to ageing.
 
Chemical structure of lycopene
We are looking towards using this as a probiotic treatment which also enables us to make the use of Dundee Schools gut simulation to test the workings of this.
Proposed transformation for probiotic in a safe chassis
SYNTHETIC VS NATURAL
So why the need for synthetic biology? Why not just eat tomatoes or watermelon? Well, the synthetic form of lycopene has been shown to be more effective in neutralising this oxidative stress because it is in a more bioavailable form compared to the form that is found in these fruits (2). This enables the compound to be more readily absorbed and consequently more effective in minimising ROS damage.
Beyond this the combination of lycopene with our NarK promoter, the release of lycopene is controlled specifically in response to oxidative stress. This has an advantage over lycopene within food which is all released all at once during digestion and may in fact result in the body containing more lycopene than it can process, meaning more energy would need to be expended to digest it.
Further still probiotics are a more long term solution, as it has been shown that E. coli can occupy the gut for even 3 months! This is a huge advantage as it would not contribute to existing daily medication the elderly population are often burdened with. It also doesn't rely on a diet that is rich in lycopene, which given the price and availability of these fruits, especially watermelon, could in the long term be a"

Intellectual Property Relating to the iGEM Competition
An important aspect of our IP comes into play with those who were responsible for developing the original platform technology on the University of Calgary 2012 iGEM team.  This team consisted of 4 professors at the University, ~25  undergraduate students from various faculties, and 4 graduate students (MSc and PhD) from the faculties of Biological Sciences and Medicine.  More information on team composition can be found here .  Additional parties which hold a stake in our technology include the University of Calgary.
The IP for our project was developed exclusively from a subset of the undergraduate and graduate students who were a part of the team.  Because of the rare situation with non-University employee’s developing IP using University of Calgary services we are presently negotiating with the University to determine their stake in our venture.  Additionally, we have approached the University of Calgary tech transfer office known as Innovate Calgary.  They provide support to new start-up ventures hoping to spin out of the University of Calgary.  To collect the IP within the individuals moving the company forward, we have approached all members of the 2012 team and asked them to sign a release form for their contributions to the project.  Additionally, we have negotiated with the professors of our group, who have signed release forms, and provided written consent that we have their permission to develop this technology independently.  All of this information is available upon request.
In addition, many of the professors at the University have been given the opportunity to become involved in our company or to sit on our advisory board.  Those who have not displayed interest in doing this have also been approached to sign a release.
Figure 2. IP strategy relating to previous iGEM members and professors.
In order to protect our intellectual property previously developed, we have chosen to hold the IP as a group of six members from the iGEM Entrepreneurial team and license this IP to any legal body which we are involved with and require that IP to grow.
IP that is developed in collaboration with our Academic and Industry groups will be held by all parties involved in the development of the technology.  To ensure that this technology is not disclosed we have asked all parties involved with our technology development to sign non-disclosure agreements to ensure all information remains patentable.

After completing the investigation and the design of the preliminary scheme, we want to make some changes in the current situation of low recognition of inflammatory bowel disease among the youth groups. So we delivered a presentation about IBD, synthetic biology, iGEM competitions as well as our programs into more people's lives. To the end, we made a three - fold booklet and poster. We not only distribute our reading materials in public places such as communities and libraries near the campus but also put our reading materials on the reading shelves in the hospital halls and beside the school medical room, hoping that more people can learn about IBD and synthetic biology.
Nearly 100 brochures were distributed to introduce the use of synthetic biology to treat IBD. Many people were impressed by our original intentions and behaviors, and expressed their support and admiration for us. Some even expressed their sympathy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
3 high school lecture
On July 26th, we came to the Northeast Yucai High School in Liaoning Province to give a speech to the third-grade students who are about to enter the university. We detailed the iGEM competition, knowledge about synthetic biology and our projects. Many high school students were interested in biology. They asked questions actively and enthusiastically, and we had conducted more in-depth exchanges. We also taught high school students to do a DNA gel electrophoresis with the plasmids constructed in our project. The basic operation of molecular biology experiment has aroused everyone's strong interest in biological experiments.
4 visitation of patients
We went to the inpatient department of Shengjing hospital affiliated to China Medical University to interview a patient with ulcerative colitis(UC) to learn more about IBD.
The 64-year-old patient was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2016. This is the second time she has been hospitalized for severe illness when we came to her. Through the visit, we learned that:
Ⅰ. Ulcerative colitis seriously affected her life. She had chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea, poor energy, and inconvenient use of the toilet. When coming on, defecate is accompanied with hematic frequently, a dietary difficulty made her complement nutrition with fluid food only. She is depressed all day long.

3. Third Day
On the third meetup day, we focused on increasing awareness towards bioethics. The day started with a presentation given by Ir. Britte Bouchaut, a PhD student from Delft University of Technology, who imposed the importance of the concept Value Sensitive Design in any iGEM project. This was followed by another presentation by Mr. Hui Kang from BGI, who explained how Chinese myths and legends affect people’s attitude towards biological issues. After the presentation, teams were given the chance to discuss two bioethics topics in a workshop and to apply what they learned throughout the day to their projects. Finally, teams that excelled in various parts of the meetup were awarded in our prize ceremony.  iGEM EPFL was awarded with best engagement and poster, while XJTLU China was awarded with the best pitch. The best presentation was awarded to GreatBay China from Group 1, and Marburg from Group 2, who had to convince the judge panel on a sudden death round against TJU China.

The Ethics in Bacto-Aid
In our project’s components there are different ethical concerns. The bacteriocins in the hybrid silk raises questions about health and security: if one is to apply  genetically modified organisms (GMO’s) to a natural environment there will be insecurities. The problem is that we can never, with full certainty, know all possible consequences - but we can derive an estimated account of what will happen. The Precautionary Principle helps resolve this, but the interpretation of the Precautionary Principle differentiates according to one’s preferences and intuitions when it comes to emerging technologies and therapeutics. It basically states that it’s sometimes better to not apply a technology or therapeutics, when the foresight is uncertain. In the opposite situation, the argument is that sometimes it is better to take action, even when one does not have complete certainty on the possible consequences. The Precautionary Principle works as a tool for making decisions that can be rationally justified when uncertainty are present. Sometimes it functions as a rhetorical or epistemological tool, but in the field of bioethics it is mostly a tool for decisions KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik.  In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
Since bacteriocins have no effect on the humane cells, that we know of, we have decided to work with them Cotter, Paul D, R Paul Ross og Colin Hill (2013). “Bacteriocins - a viable alternative to antibiotics?” eng.

The different trials that a new form of therapeutics must withstand are still necessary for determining if it’s safe enough to apply in a natural environment.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Gan Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," try to improve and outperform each other with each round. Eventually, the Generator will reach a level of sophistication in which the generated images will not be distinguishable from real images anymore, which is the ultimate goal of GANs.
Mathematical Description
The generative adversarial networks can be described as a zero-sum game, where the objective function is represented as a minimax function.
Objective function
The Discriminator is trying to maximize the objective function, therefore a gradient ascent can be performed on the objective function.
Gradient Ascent
In contrast, the generator tries to minimize the objective function, therefore a gradient descent can be performed and by altering between gradient ascent and descent, GANs can be trained.
Gradient descent
Yet, it was observed that optimizing the Generator objection does not work well, because when the sample is generated that is likely to be classifeid as fake, the model tries to learn from the gradients turn out relatively flat. Therefore, the generator objective function was changed so that instead of minimizing the likelihood of discriminator being correct, it maximizes the likelihood of discriminator being wrong. According to this new objective function, the gradient ascent is performed on the generator.
New Generator Objective Function
Applications and Examples of GANs
Transfer of image domain – CycleGANs
These GANs transform images from one domain (say real scenery) to another domain (Say Van Gogh paintings) [8].
It can also transform pictures between zebras and horses!
Super Resolution
Super Resolution GANs (srGANs) allow to transform low resolution images into high resolution ones [9].
High resolution image synthesis
GAN algorithm called pix2pixHD allow to generate synthetic real life images from a semantic map [9].
Generating images from text descriptions
Researchers have also showed that GANs can be trained to generate visual scenaries that are described only by text [10].
Drug Discovery
Even though mainstream generative adversarial network research revolves around visuals, researchers from Insilico Medicine proposed an approach of drug discovery using GANS [11].
Similar work with anti-cancer compounds resulted in prediction of compounds that are already proven to be anti-cancer agents and new untested compounds that should be validated with further experiments.
GANs and Synthetic Biology
There is no doubt the Generative Adversarial Networks is an amazing tool which can bring immense changes into numerous, if not all, scientific fields.
Yet, expanding GANs can be a challenging task frequently requires a complete rethink of whole network architecture as was shown by previous examples [12-14], and has yet to reach the field of Synthetic Biology.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept1Fr_-_-_TEXT.html," Ces derniers sont évidemment liés à ceux de M.avium « Wild-type », mais il est envisageable de transformer M.avium pour la rendre sensible à certains chimiotactismes organiques. Pour l’heure, découvrons ce que permet M.avium « Wild-type ».
M.avium peut infecter un organisme par voie orale et par voie sanguine. Si son homologue, M.tuberculosis est souvent vu comme un agent pathogène pulmonaire, les M.avium peuvent potentiellement infecter tous les organes. Cette affirmation est vérifiée chez les patients immunodéprimés au sein desquels la diminution de l’immunité permet à la mycobactérie de se propager dans l’organisme entier.
Des recherches plus poussées sur le tropisme tissulaire ont révélé certains organes cibles. Il est montré que quelques semaines après l’infection, la concentration de bactérie atteint un plateau dans deux organes : le foie et la rate puis plus tard dans un troisième : les poumons.
Figure 2: Invasion des poumons, de la rate, du foie et du thymus par M.avium de 0 à 52 semaines en log de 10 (6 à 10 souris)
On observe également que, durant de nombreuses semaines post-infection, la charge bactérienne continue à augmenter. Or, cette augmentation dans les tissus cibles n’est pas corrélée avec une augmentation de Mycobacterium dans le sang. Cette augmentation est donc le fruit d’une invasion des tissus cibles et non d’une invasion du corps dans son intégralité.
Il y a donc un tropisme mais également une implantation du vecteur dans les tissus cibles. Cette caractéristique est très intéressante car le vecteur n’est pas circulant mais résident.
Le vecteur tissulaire possède donc trois tropismes intéressants et identifiés. Le DVS offre ainsi une application thérapeutique sur des physiopathologies touchant les poumons, la rate et le foie.  Il peut les cibler, s’y implanter, et s’y développer jusqu’à recevoir le signal de délivrance du vecteur cellulaire .

Then, gene expression level will be greatly reduced. Some previous testing results can be seen here and the overall system testing can be seen here .
The wavelength of blue light used in this system is 470nm, and it has a minimal overlappingeffect with red and green light. There is also a figure in this published paper showing different gene expression levels with different light intensities. More importantly, after careful calculation we find all the parametres indicate this system is suitable for us to use in our designed box. Another interesting and important but unexpected brief interlude happened during our calculation, and this will be mentioned at the ""Others"" part in this page.
Downstream Element Regulated
We have already got the FixK2 promoter, and the next thing is to choose suitable reporter genes and functional genes and put them downstream of this promoter.
To test this system qualitatively, the sgRNA targeting to RFP is regulated by FixK2 promoter. Considering the mechanism of CRISPRi system, in the absence of blue light(wavelength=470nm), RFP will be knocked down and under the blue light RFP will be expressed normally.
To test this system quantitatively, the sgRNA targeting to luciferase is regulated by FixK2 promoter. Then we change light intensity and detect gene expression amount. Since the amount of expressed luciferase can be tested indirectly by chemiluminescence detector, it is likely that at last we could get the relationship between light intensity and gene expression amount.
To test this system practically, the sgRNA targeting to one key enzyme in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, FadD, which will prevent fatty acid synthesis. After detecting the fatty acid amount in the culture and inside the cell and comparing different total fatty acid amount under different light intensities, we are able to prove this blue-light controlled CRISPRi system can be used to regulate genomic genes thus regulating the metabolism in vivo. Moreover, this will be one example showing our system is versitile and universal.
To test the whole system, the blue light system controlled sgRNA is designed to target one of the fatty acid synthetic enzymes, FabZ. Together with TesA and FabI controlled by red and green lights, we hope to maximize the producing efficiency of the fatty acid synthetic pathway by changing the ratio of these three enzymes' amount. From this experiment, we will prove that the whole system can optimize metabolic pathways via regulating genomic genes, which is our final goal.

Synthetic biology involves unknown factors and sometimes pathogenic organisms. In our project we have tested the effect of our bacteriocins on pathogenic organisms, which calls for some different precautions than when working with non-pathogenic organisms. We also use proteins from a secretory pathway of a toxin called alpha-hemolysin to transport PHB out of E. coli. The transport proteins have no pathogenic effect in a strain of bacteria, which does not produce the toxin, as our strain of E. coli. In order to secrete PHB through the pathway we biofuse a signal peptide from alpha-hemolysin with phasin. As the toxin is not part of the biofused protein, no special precautions are necessary.
We have also thought a lot about the safety of our final product: whether or not it is safe to use and safe for the environment. The results of our investigations can be found on this page, where we talk about working with pathogenic organisms, an upcoming problem with the environment and at last making a risk assessment of our project.
Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylcoccus aureus (S. aureus) is a commencal, opportunistic pathogen. S. aureus is normally found on the skin, in the nostrils and throat. Any damages on the skin, such as wounds or on the mucosal barriers, allows the bacteria to interact with the blood, where it spreads to other parts of the body. Many strains of Staphylococcus demonstrate the ability to form biofilm matrices, which makes infections by these strains hard to treat. A biofilm matrix consists of exopolysaccharides, proteins, teichoic acids, lipids, extracellular DNA and the bacteria. The biofilm protects the bacteria, which makes them less vulnerable to antibiotics ARCIOLA, C. R., VISAI, L., TESTONI, F., ARCIOLA, S., CAMPOCCIA, D., SPEZIALE, P. & MONTANARO, L. 2011.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).
a) Dual color FRET: Constructing fusion proteins is required.
b) Multicolor FRET: To detect base mispairing.
2. –Sifan Wang
Unstable fluorescent protein
Add peptide tail after GFP so that it can be identified and decomposed by intracellular proteinase. The key lies in controlling and modulating the fluorescence intensity and the degradation velocity.
3. –Jianzhao Chi
Function of some nano antibiotics: Modifying GFP's character.
Conclusion:
     Group 7 focused on the choke point of this project: The degradation of fluorescent proteins, i.e. how to switch from one color to another. This problem was mentioned by Group 2 as well. How to switch from number A to number B when constructing a bio-screen? After studying literatures, Group 7 put forward three probable proposals.
1) FRET mechanism.
2) Unstable fluorescent protein.
3) Utilizing nano antibiotics to regulate fluorescent protein.
     After discussion, we thought the second proposal is relatively viable. For the first proposal, mutual interference between yellow and blue lights is a hidden trouble. And the catabolic enzymes of nano antibiotics mentioned in the third proposal may be not easy to find.
     So the members of Group 7 are suggested to study further about unstable fluorescent protein and peptide tail. But all the three proposals are worth trying. And the study results of Group 7 can act as reference of the project of Group 2 — Bioscreen.

What's the relationship between the biosensor and synthetic biology?
a) Constructing probe molecules. Whereas it may be difficult to construct, because single chains are not stable.
b) Application in microbe. Introducing unstable single chains may lead to degradation.

Feasibility analysis
a) SELEX ( systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment )

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," gut flora [5, 20]. In                         addition, due to the poor quality of air condition, heavy mental stress, a more sedentary                         lifestyle and consumption of high-fat foods, people who live in a developed city are more                         likely to get IBD [5, 20]. At present, the incidence of IBD in Asia is rising rapidly. In Hong                         Kong, for example, the number of cases increased by 30 times from 1985 to 2014 [21], and the                         gastroenterology ward was crowded with young IBD patients [20].
Western diets are broadly defined as containing high amounts of saturated fat, red meat, sugar                         and low amounts of fruit, vegetables, grains, seafood, poultry meat [17]. Studies have                         confirmed the association between Western diet and the pathogenesis of IBD [22, 23]. In                         addition, immigration studies showed that people move from developing countries to developed                         countries and adopt to Western lifestyles are more likely to suffer from IBD.
In the long run, the incidence of IBD in Asia will soon be similar to Europe and America [20].                         To make matters worse, compared with European and American countries, the efforts of Asian                         countries to cope with the medical and economic burden of IBD are seriously inadequate [20]. In                         addition, many patients who have been sick for a long time are unaware of the fact that they                         have IBD, which leads to underdiagnosis of IBD [20].
5. Current therapies
The treatment of IBD is very complicated. Traditionally, IBD has been treated with Step up                         therapy, which starts at a certain level depending on the severity of the disease, and                         gradually escalates the therapy when the lower-level therapy fails [25]. The order from low to                         high is as follows: aminosalicylic acid preparation (aspirin) → glucocorticoid →                         immunosuppressant (azathioprine) →biological agents (anti-TNF) → surgery [26]. This routine                         step up treatment is not suitable for patients at risk of rapid disease progression and may delay optimal medication time and increase the risk of hospitalization and surgery. The use of                         top down therapy, that is, the preferential use of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody than the step                         up strategy can more effectively induce and maintain remission and change the disease process                         [25].
Surgical treatment is often seen as a last resort, but as the understanding of the disease                         continues to deepen, it has been found that some patients with early-stage I"

     Reproducibility is one of the pillars of science, it allows separate groups of scientists to perform the same experiments and come to the same conclusions. Despite the importance of reproducibility, studies 1 and 2 show that oftentimes the conclusions published in high-impact science journals are not reproducible. As iGEM is a synthetic biology competition, we wanted to find out if synthetic biologists also encountered similar problems. We reached out to scientists to ask for their thoughts on reproducibility, and whether or not an online protocol database would help to increase reproducibility in science. The survey was emailed to 155 recipients, the majority of whom were iGEM advisors and student participants. A link to the survey was also posted on the iGEM facebook page. In total, 55 responses were received, and were used to aid our design of ProtoCat.
     We asked participating teams about their experiences with the protocols that iGEM provides on their website. Surprisingly, 78% of teams encountered issues with, or had to make adjustments to one or more of the iGEM-provided protocols that they used. Even though the iGEM-provided protocols are classic molecular biology protocols, and among the most commonly used in the field, a large majority of users had problems with them. With this information in mind, we wanted to gauge the appeal of a software like ProtoCat. We asked scientists whether or not they could see themselves using a multidisciplinary, online protocol database, with 73% indicating 'yes', 27% indicating 'maybe', and none indicating 'no'. Given the positive responses, we felt certain the ProtoCat would be appealing to scientists searching for protocols.
     Respondents provided plenty of ideas such as giving users the ability to search for, review and rate protocols. We implemented as many of these as we could, placing particular emphasis on creating an efficient and easy to use search engine as many it seemed to be the most important part in the respondents' minds. More information on the results of the project can be found here .

Hello my name is Anna and I am a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Master in Göttingen, as well. First a short story about how I decided to become a biologist: When I was in school, we had a practical week of genetics with a professor from an university. Since this laboratory experience, I decided to study biology and to become a scientist! I did my bachelor thesis in the department of Molecular Structural Biology in Göttingen, where I became a fan of proteins. Participating the iGEM team means very much to me because I am looking forward to work independently and I like to develop new ideas in a group of students.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," contrast values (used here as an estimate of a factor’s effect on the response) for each supplement in CFPS systems using the moderately active cell free extract (D2), and Figure 9 shows the contrast values for each supplement in CFPS systems using the low active cell free extract (B2).
While some conclusions can be drawn from this data, care should be taken as the inherently low activity of systems using this data resulted in a high noise-to-signal ratio. Nonetheless, the DoE screening design identified 7 out of 13 factors which may have a negative effect on CFPS activity. This might have been expected because the CFPS system had a very low activity, which suggested that the supplement solution was far from optimised for that extract. Three of the factors with an inhibitory affect were potassium glutamate, sodium oxalate, and ammonium acetate, which, as has already been explained earlier, is not unusual as cell extract require specific amounts of these salts for high activity. Other supplements which appear to be having a strong negative effect on CFPS activity, such as the tRNAs and Co-enzyme A, are harder to explain.
Due to a lack of time, repeats of these experimental designs were not performed, and therefore the results of this analysis are only indicative. Further experimentation should be performed to validate these results, and hence the conclusions drawn.
Conclusions and Future Work
This study has begun multifactorial analysis on the components of the supplemental solution for cell free protein synthesis systems. It has provided evidence that some supplements have a greater effect on protein synthesis activity than others, and that the important factors may differ between cell extract batches. The ability to use a Design of Experiments approach towards the optimisation of CFPS systems has also been demonstrated. While this study has provided evidence to-wards these claims, further work should be performed to validate the findings. A DoE screening design for the supplements of CFPS sys-tems should be used on the same cell extract batch repeatedly. This will help confirm that the screening models derived from the experi-mental design data are accurate. The screening design should also be performed on many different batches of at least moderately active cell extracts to confirm that important supplements do differ between batches. Following the above, a surface response design could be used for all commonly important supplements of the CFPS system to deter-mine its effectiveness at optimising CFPS activity. The information could also be used to determine commonly unimportant supplements so they can be eliminated from the supplement solution, hence de-creasing the cost per reaction.

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#project#wetlab#fungal toolkit#biosafety_-_-_TEXT.html,"ysis [4].  In the case of fungi, the increase in membrane permeability itself would not lead to lysis because the cell wall would remain intact; however, the increased membrane permeability would allow the second stage—a chitinase protein—access to the cell wall.  The organic polymer chitin composes a significant fraction of filamentous fungal cell walls and has been identified as a promising target for antifungal agents because of its structural importance [5].  The rationale behind this kill switch system is that once the holin proteins open pores, the chitinases can access the cell wall and degrade it, rendering it structurally useless. The chitinase utilized in our system is the Cht1_2 gene from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, and it is hypothesized to act in either cleavage of chitin fibers or in pathogenic defense [6].  To successfully implement and control this system, we plan to place both the Cht1_2 gene and the lambda holin behind PpelA, an inducible promoter from the fungi Aspergillus nidulans. This promoter is both repressed by glucose and induced by polygalacturonic acid, allowing for full control over both expression and repression of the holin and chitinase genes [7].
Notes: Cht1_2 was synthesized by IDT and the pelA promoter was generously provided by the Turgeon lab at Cornell University.
This figure depicts our fungal kill switch system.  The first step is the holin gene that blasts holes in the phospholipid bilayer membrane, allowing the chitinase gene to pass through this membrane and degrade the chitin in the external cell wall.
