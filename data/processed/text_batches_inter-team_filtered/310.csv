Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetox_-_-_TEXT.html," will be co-transformed into P. putida construct containing the HMF pathway. These colonies will be grown for the furoic acid assay and we can determine from absorbance measurements whether the HMF pathway is functioning.  We will sequence the genomes of non-functioning strains and identify which genes were turned off via dCas9 knockdown.
The 19 target genes in P. putida were identified through manual genome comparison with the help of graduate student Iman Farasat.  These are genes that are likely involved in furfural catabolism and are present in P. putida but not present in E. coli.  Many of these genes encode cofactors, chaperone proteins, ATPases, and several other possible transport proteins.  Our hypothesis is that a key oxidoreductase in the HMF pathway requires a molybdenum-containing cofactor, which is produced by a separate pathway and inserted with a chaperone protein.   Manual comparison of genomes is time consuming, and another objective of our research is to develop a program that can optimize genome comparison. This program would employ “BLAST”, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, to identify homologs between species and potential target genes that are contained in one genome but not another.  Optimizing genome comparison would allow industrial and academic researchers to identify the likely missing genes in any pathway.
The final objective of this research is to engineer the HMF pathway in E. coli.  This is a late-stage goal, providing the missing ingredients of the HMF pathway are identified.  But if this objective is completed, it could be one step closer to sustainable fuels produced by bacteria.
Our Objectives
1) Validate the gene knockdown strategy using dCas9
This is our first objective.  Once we insert the dCas9 system, HMF pathway, and RFP cassette into the P. putida genome, we will use a crRNA targeting RFP to attempt to knockdown RFP expression. If we see white colonies, we will know that transcription of the RFP gene is blocked and the system works.
2) Validate the functioning of the HMF pathway
Along with our first objective, we will concurrently evaluate the functioning of the HMF pathway inserted into the P. putida genome using a 2-furoic acid assay. We will inoculate LB broth with P. putida colonies that have grown in the presence of 5-fluorouracil and add 3 g/L 2-furoic acid. Colonies that show growth and consumption of"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

The overall goal of modeling the system would comprise of the following: a fully developed kinetic model of the system starting from initiation  of radiative exposure to the cleavage of catechol or x-gal and the subsequent expression of  color.  With a fully developed model and known data from testing, future devices could be made with varying sensitivities, which could be accomplished through varying the RBS strengths of the Pr promoter.

Bacterial Dosimeter Cost Analysis
The purpose of this report is to emphasis the monetary cost per device that it would cost to produce such a device for sale and compare against major competitors already in the market of selling dosimeters.
When buying our bacterial dosimeter, there are two kinds of cost associated with the device: fixed cost and variable costs. The fixed cost occurs when buying the tray because the tray can be used over and over again with a new tray put in after every use. The variable costs are the cost associated with buying the individual trays per use. Additionally, the cost of catechol must be factored into the equation because it is required to show the results of the dosimeter.
Equation 1: Cost on User for Using our Bacterial Dosimeter to Detect Radiation
Cdosimeter = Ccase + ( N*Ctray) + Ccatechol
Cdosimeter = Cost per Bacterial Dosimeter Ctray = Cost per Tray Ccase = Cost per Case N = Number of Trays Ccatechol= cost of catechol per use
Equation 2: Cost of building each individual Case in the Dosimeter
Ccase = V*Cplastic
Cplastic= Cost per cubic meter of plastic V = Volume of Plastic
Equation 3: Cost of building each individual tray in the dosimeter.
Ctray = Cecoli + Cgellan + Cplastic
Cecoli = Cost of Growing the Bacteria Cgellan= Cost of Phytagel™
Taking the price of the gellan gum (PHYTAGEL™) in bulk, the average cost would be that of $1,003.20 USD for 5kg of powder.  At this price, it would cost approximately Considering that the dimensions for one sheet of gellan gum in our model has the dimensions of 0.035m x"

Then we found its fluorescence value and the value of OD600 with only LB medium samples differred greatly. So we decided to use the 1.0mM Cu in LB medium as the blank samples of the 1.0mM control.
We can observe from the figure, when the copper ion concentration is range of 0-0.1mM, with the increase of concentration of copper ion, promoter strength increased. In the copper ion concentration of 1mM, the promoter strength decreased.

They also noted that they wanted to differentiate their personally engineered bacteria from those designed by others.  In response, our team added a video introducing synthetic biology and the iGEM competition (created by the IONIS team) and instructional text beside the petri dish that would reduce confusion and clearly state the abstracted scientific process.  We also added a color-coding feature to individuals’ bacteria and programmed the graphics to appear in a particular location in the environment based the bacteria’s engineered activities.  The bacteria images also appear directly after users deploy their bacteria onto the environment so that users can more easily identify which bacteria is theirs.
Fig. 4 Example of deployed bacteria on Mars
 About a week later, our team conducted a user study with fifty MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound students.  At this point, our updated prototype now featured the color-coded bacteria and explicit instructions that the BU and MIT teams had suggested.  All students spent a lot of time happily tinkering to make multiple combinations, expressed pride at their creations, and were aware of and tried to make combinations to fulfill the status bars. They stated that they could definitely imagine this prototype as a museum exhibit.
Fig. 5 Testing with members of MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound
 Unfortunately, we noted that even with the clearly presented instructions, many students still largely ignored the instructions and then seemed unsure about how to proceed.  Students also echoed the BU/MIT teams’ desire for an informational synthetic biology video.  As a result, we decided to add a tabbed “Information” section that would clearly display instructions right next to users’ workstations, play a video about synthetic biology and iGEM, and display information about BioBricks’ source and the team that engineered it.  With this final prototype, we were ready to begin formal evaluations.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Physcomitrella_-_-_TEXT.html," of the early diverge of the evolutionary lineages, they share fundamental genetic and physiological processes. Hence a good approach to studying the complexity of higher land plants is to look at the bryophytes with their much simpler phenotype. Here researchers chose Physcomitrella patens as a model organism with a genome size of about 450 Mb along 27 chromosomes that is highly similar to other land plants in both exon-intron-structure and codon usage. [ Schaefer and Zryd, 2001 ]
Life cycle
Figure 1: Physcomitrella life cycle
Generally land plants show an alternation of generations, the haploid (1n) gametophyte produces sperm and eggs which fuse and transform into the diploid (2n) sporophyte. This then forms haploid spores which become new gametophytes. Besides having no vascular system, bryophytes also differ from higher land plants in the fact that the gametophyte is the dominant phase of their life cycle, whereas in vascular plants the principal generation is the sporophyte.
The life cycle of P. patens [ Reski, 1998 ] only takes about 3 months and starts with the spore developing into a filamentous structure, the juvenile, transitory stage of the gametophyte, called protonema, which is composed of two types of cells. The chloronema cells with large and numerous chloroplasts mostly perform photosynthesis and thus supply the photoautotrophic plant with energy while the task of the caulonema cells is fast growth. The adult stage of the gametophyte, called gametophore (""gamete-bearer"") has a more complex structure bearing leafs, stem and rhizoids. The transition from juvenile to adult gametophyte is started by initial cells in the protonema filament that differentiate into buds. The budding is therefore a single-cell-event, greatly stimulated by the plant hormone cytokinin, which promotes cell division.
The sex organs of the moss develop from the tip of the gametophore. P. patens is monoicous, meaning that male and female organs are produced in one plant. When liquid water is surrounding the tip, flagellate sperm cells can swim from the male sex organ to the female organ and fertilize the egg within. A zygote then develops into the sporophyte, which in turn produces thousands of haploid spores by meiosis. Sporophytes are typically physically attached to and dependent on supply from the dominating gametophyte.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," all mosquitoes within an environment, whether these mosquitoes are transmitters of malaria or not.
Bjarne: What we know is that there are basically three kinds of mosquitoes, that mainly target humans or specifically target humans. The molecules we produce or the enzymes we use are partly from skin microbiota, so we try to imitate human skin or human scent to target certain malaria mosquitoes. And I also think there is this study showing that mosquitoes with plasmodium are even more attracted to humans than others.
Dr. Hutchinson: Yes.
Bjarne: So yes, we would have off-target effects, but we try to minimize them.
Mr. Oertel: So, your trap is kind of a virtual net? It will protect people where the trap is placed.
Bjarne: Yeah. You can imagine them like a giant attractor like a black hole for mosquitoes. You place them and try to get as many mosquitoes in a local area.
Dr. Hutchinson: The trap of course has to be preferential to the mosquito compared to the human being. You have got to make it more attractive.
Lisa: Yes.
Mr. Oertel: Do you plan to place it in a house?
Lisa: No, it needs to stay in the sun, because of the cyanobacteria. They need sunlight to grow and produce glucose for the E. coli. It’s not possible to place it inside.
Bjarne: There are other traps that have a similar mechanism, so there are traps that lure mosquitoes and try to kill them. The problem is that they need maintaining, they need electricity and our trap should work as follows: You put them down and it stays there, it is sustainable, it keeps working. But that is why we have some information on how to set up your trap, because if you use these kind of traps that lure and kill you usually not put them inside a house, because you might have the mosquitoes going into the house, because they scent the trap, and they end up stinging the human. So, you put them around certain areas to get the mosquitoes away.
Dr. Hutchinson: Do you have an insectarium here?
Bjarne: We work with the Bernhard-Nocht-institute. Working with the mosquitoes is just possible at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine.

Spore Germination Modeling
     To predict the occurrence of diseases more effectively and timely, we made the spore germination rate. According to the researchers, we first fitted out a linear equation for the spore germination rate base on the humidity and a cubic equation for the spore germination rate base on the temperature. By multiplying them, we get the general model for the spore germination. At last, the model was combined to IoTtalk to apply peptides into farmlands.
Fitted out the equation with researches and get the general spore germination rate model.
Conducted experiments as verification and determine the coefficients.
Result
Spore Germination Rate
     Because we found out that the humidity and temperature affected the spore germination the most. Therefore, we wanted to build a general model for the spore germination rate based on temperature or humidity with different fungal species that can fit in every fungal species.
     At first, we used the spore germination data on the research papers to fit out the functions.
Spore germination based on temperature [1]:
     (1) Myce-liophthora thermophila's spore germination rate based on temperature
$$ y = 0.0004x^3 - 0.0132x^2 + 4.0447x -24.746 $$

     (2) Aspergillus niger’s spore germination rate based on temperature:
$$ y = 0.0326x^3 - 4.0593x^2 + 160.2x - 1943.7 $$

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Escherichia coli. However, other teams do not have the time or means to do as well.
Thus, the 2015 Paris Saclay team project offers to all iGEM teams a fast, efficient and inexpensive way to build an impenetrable shelter for bacteria.1
The system principle
The aim of the containment is to create a physical barrier which should prevent accidental spreading of bacterial culture. The idea is to make a containment where bacteria can grow but which does not allow them to be in contact with the environment. Bacteria will be contained inside silica monoliths. To enable cell growth, we found a protocol which describes how to make cavities inside silica monoliths possible.
First, cells are encapsulated in an alginate gel. The alginic acid polysaccharide is a linear copolymer of β-D-mannuronic and α-L-guluronic acid extracted from brown algae or bacteria.
Alginic acid polysaccharide
The bacterial culture is mixed with sodium alginate and the solution is dropped in a chloride calcium solution. At neutral pH, carboxylic acid functions are deprotonated so that the polymer bears a global negative charge, usually compensated by sodium ions. Addition of divalent cations such as Ca2+ induces cross-linking of the polymer, and therefore gel formation.
Then, silica monoliths are created around the beads obtained by a sol-gel process which allows the formation of silica gels at room temperature from aqueous precursors (Brinker and Scherrer 1990). The reactions involved in this process are presented in the figure below.
Polymerization reactions involved in the sol-gel process
Finally, the gel is dissolved by using an acid which chelates Ca2+ so that cells have a cavity where they can grow and which can be filled with a defined growth medium.
Protocol
The first one is performed by dropwise addition of a 1.5% (w/w) sodium alginate cells suspension in a 0.1 M CaCl2 solution. After 10 min stirring, about 3 mm diameter beads are easily collected by filtration. The calcium alginate polymer prevents cell contact with synthesis precursors. The second step consists of silicate polymerization in the presence of commercial silica nanoparticles (Ludox HS40 from Aldrich), leading to a nanoporous monolithic structure. Monoliths are prepared at room temperature by mixing 2 volumes of 1.25 M sodium silicate with 1 volume of colloidal silica and 1 volume of succinic acid (5 wt"

IGEM 2015 Project Description.
The 2014 WashU iGEM team successfully transferred the nif cluster from Cyanothece 51142 to E. coli. However, the nitrogenase activity they measured was minimal. Therefore, the WashU/Penn State 2015 team dedicated itself to increasing the nitrogenase activity of last year’s E. coli strain by knocking down and overexpressing certain genes on the nif-containing plasmid. Additionally, we are using genome-scale metabolic modeling to guide potential genetic interventions and facilitate nitrogen fixation in E. coli. We are performing a systematic analysis of metabolites and genes in our model to optimize nitrogenase activity.
A few weeks into our work, a member of our lab had trouble repeating the 2014 results and we began to consider the notion that E. coli may be incompatible with components of the plasmid—whose parts come directly from Cyanothece 51142—at the transcriptional, translational, or post-translational levels. After an evaluation of our remaining time and resources, we decided to construct a more minimal nif cluster for E. coli in order to reduce the effects of any native regulation present in the original plasmid we used. We plan to continue our analysis of the nif cluster using overexpression, knockdown, and metabolic engineering.
Our team is part of a larger project that is seeking to confer nitrogen fixation capabilities to a non-diazotrophic cyanobacterium, Synechocystis pp. 6803. Synechocystis is evolutionarily related by the endosymbiotic theory to plant chloroplasts, so a nitrogen-fixing Synechocystis could be used as a model to engineer plants that fix their own nitrogen. We hope that the results of this year’s iGEM team will be useful to the researchers working on The Nitrogen Project since E. coli is a well-characterized, fast-growing model organism.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," as a function of time in minutes. The data is based on the simulation of 1000 independent bacteria.
The simulated data revealed, that when enhanced RelE production is implemented, in order to induce dormancy in E. coli, the effect come easily. However, implementation of RelB expression is also found necessary to ensure that the bacteria are able to enter an active state again.
The model showed that the system is sensitive to the RelE:RelB ratio, as well as the total amount of produced toxin. As seen in Figure 2, implementation with production rates in the vicinity of 50 and 35 molecules per minute for RelB and RelE respectively, was found to be suitable for balancing our system; the bacteria lay dormant within the computed time and re-enter an active state within minutes.
The simulated data made it evident that implementing an optimised dormancy system comprises a challenge, as the individual expression levels of RelE and RelB, as well as their interaction, has a crucial impact on the regulation of dormancy. Thus, controlled gene expression of both RelE and RelB is required to implement a controllable dormancy system in the PowerLeaf.
If you want to dig deeper into this crucial modelling of the dormancy system, read the full results here.

Gillespie Algorithm
The Gillespie algorithm is a way to calculate the evolution of stochastic functions; in this case cell concentrations. To use the algorithm, two things are required:
Reaction rates of the system at a given configuration.
A random number generator.
For each time step, two things are calculated using the random number generator:
The time before next reaction.
Which reaction occurs.
The time before next step is given by:
Δt=S-1log(r1-1)
Where S is the sum of the reaction rates and r1 is a random number between 0 and 1. This gives the time, as if the system was one reaction with reaction rate S, using the random number to give an exponential distribution.
The reaction is chosen proportionally to each individual reaction rate using another random number, where reactions with high rates will occur most frequently.
As each reaction is carried out, the new time is the sum of the previous and added reaction times.   These calculations are carried out until the time reaches the wanted limit, or a specific number of reactions has occurred. It is necessary to have a limit on the number of reactions, as it elsewise is possible for the calculations to continue indefinitely.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

After fixing the issues we had with our procedures we decided to move on and do a restriction digest using our liquid handling robot.  It was important to use the same liquid cultures in order to eliminate any variables other then performing the RD by hand or by the robot.  Three of the restriction digests were done on the robot in order to make sure the same process could be repeated.  I also did a restriction digest on a terminator so the robot could later ligate the GFP with the terminator.   In order to cut the GFP we used EcoRI and SpeI while for the terminator I used EcoRI and Xbal. After running the gel, it could be seen that the GFP was cut as it was about 1.2KB on the gel.  However, while loading the gel I realized that some of the RD done by the robot had a total volumes less than 50 micro-liters.
7/5/2011-7/8/2011
In order to continue on with ligation on the robot I decided to do a manual ligation with GFP and a terminator.  I used the new protocol which involved a 6 to 1 ratio and a ligation time of 11 hours.  Unfortunately, when they were plated nothing grew.  This was our final trial with our ligation protocol.   This backup restricted us form continuing forward.  Therefore, I decided to run the rest of the cut GFP and terminator that I had after doing a restriction digest with the robot and I.  After doing a gel extraction and a Nanodrop Quantification I received similar values as the one form the previous week.  This was a good sign as they were all from the same colony.  However, the first robot trial had a very low yield and it may have been that the robot did a better job"

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," I could standardize a protocol for bacterial growth in the two versions of the medium we were using, the one with glycerol amd the one with glucose as carbon source.
This was the week of the medium: MOPS had to be ready as soon as possible to start with the characterization of our constructs. And this fun work was given to me! …I spent about three days weighting salts and filtering solutions drop by drop…
Anyway, in the meantime I also prepared the Molecular Biology exam and then had the first failure with my new construct K731600: the ligation products did not survive to the transformation, neither one good colony grew up. So I prepared a new digestion: but only at the end of the week I realized I have used an “unreliable” plasmid: the final concentration resulted horrible, so I needed to start again from the beginning amplifying a new pSB1C3 and digest it again.
This week will be remembered also as “the week of the first contamination”: plates of all of us started to have weird halos, and from now on the contamination started to be a fellow traveler of us.
I confirmed my construct (K731500) by screening in a 2% agarose gel. I'm waiting for the sequencing results. I've been working on K731510, I will have the results next week.
We played a little with the fluorimeter, measuring BL21 coltures with just Venus or Cherry, our template with both proteins and another construct that has them in the opposite order (RL0020). The coltures were inducted with IPTG 0.1mM and we analysed fluorescence at different times of induction. We also tried to left them O/N in the refrigerator and we found out that the fluorescence greatly increased.
We repeated this kind of experiments several times, testing also RL0024 with the double mutation of the illegal sites.
One day Mansy came to see how it was going on and to make fun of us a little (that is a kind of relaxing hobby for him), and we discussed together what could be the best parameters for the future measures:
Excitation
Emission
Cherry
587nm
615nm
Venus
485nm
528nm
Then we began to test some others features of the protocol: we tried to sonicate the samples, and took an enormous amount of data at different induction times and different lapse times after sonication. We repeated each experiment several times and with different colonies from the transformation time. We were completely adsorbed by this work but organize and analyse all that data was far worse than take"
NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#design_-_-_TEXT.html," extracellular AI-2 was first described by Xavier et al. , where genetic deletions of its synthase (luxS) and its repressor (lsrR) were used to interfere with bacterial communication.
However, the interrelated complexity of QS networks renders the elucidation of its mechanisms difficult, and the production of simple, ""modular"" networks would enrich the understanding of these actions.
How we did it?
We have addressed this through the model-based design, construction, and characterization of these ""controller cells"" to modulate the external AI-2 environment. These cells are designed via the compartmentalization of different aspects of AI-2 processing: production(luxS, mtn), uptake (lsrACDB), phosphorylation (lsrK), and degradation (lsrFG).
Fig 2
We demonstrate utility by modulating naturally occurring processes of biofilm formation and chemotaxis. We envision that ""controller cells"" that modulate bacterial behavior by manipulating molecular communication, will find use in a variety of applications, particularly those employing natural or synthetic bacterial consortia.
Biosafety Considerations

With the advent of synthetic biology, genetically modified microorganisms are being increasingly used for bio medical, industrial and environmental applications.

The neuron analogy
Our genetic “clock hand” , is similar in many ways to the action potential propagating along nerve cell axons (Fig. 3, Fig.4). Both can be classified as excitation waves which are driven to propagate in one direction by positive and negative feedback loops. Imagine a circle of axon. The propagation of action potential is just like a clock hand movement (Fig. 5). We explain the mechanism of our clock “gear” by analogy with action potential of the nerve cell.
Figure 3 The clock hand moves in one direction; from the past to the future.
Figure 4 One directional propagation of action potential
When stimulated, a pulse of positive membrane potential (action potential) is generated. (Fig. 5). Positive membrane potential opens voltage-gated Na+ channel. Influx of Na+ increases positive membrane potential. This is positive feedback to amplify positive membrane potential. After a few milliseconds, positive membrane potential opens voltage-gated K+ channel. Increased K+ outflux decreases membrane potential. This is negative feedback to decrease positive membrane potential (Fig. 6).
Figure 5 Action potential of nerve cell
Figure 6 Positive and negative feedback loops regulate positive membrane potential to drive the action potential along nerve cell axon.
The positive membrane potential spreads along axon, coupling membrane potential of neighboring region, and causes another rising phase and falling phase. This is observed as action potential propagating along a nerve cell axon.
The feedback loops and coupling creates one-directional movement in nerve cell. Nerve cell and our Clock have the positive feedback followed by negative feedback and coupling in common (Table 2). Thus, as in a nerve cell, the one directional excitation wave may be generated on our Clock (Fig. 7).
Table 2 Action potential and clock hand
Figure. 7
Positive feedback loop
The positive feedback loop of the clock “gear” is composed of luxI (3OC6HSL(AHL) synthetase), the pLux/Tet hybrid promoter, and the luxR activator(Fig. 8).
Fig. 8 Positive feedback loop
This positive feedback loop makes rising phase of gene expression. It works as follows (Fig. 9);
0, LuxR is constitutively expressed in cells.
1, AHL flows in from out of the cell and binds to LuxR.
2, the AHL-LuxR complex binds to the pLux/Tet hybrid promoter and increase the transcription rate of"

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," soluble tumor neoantigens are acquired by DCs, they would be trapped in endolysosomal compartments and digested into peptides, which are subsequently loaded almost entirely onto MHC class II molecules for presentation to CD4+ helper T-cells solely. However, for achieving an effective immune response, the therapeutic cancer vaccine is expected to elicit robust cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses, which is essential for tumor cell destruction ( Janssen et al., 2005 ).
Thus, it is also key for cancer vaccines to enable cytosolic delivery of neoantigens for a successful activation of cytotoxic T-cell mediated immunity. Effectively, having a platform for neoantigen delivery is favourable for vaccine delivery as it protects antigen and adjuvant molecules from degradation and clearing, enhances lymphoid organ targeting, and modulates APCs’ functions for better presentation ( Amigorena et al., 2010 ).
Encapsulin Antigen Delivery
In 2016, an article was published by Sebyung Kang and colleagues describing the employment of the protein cage nanoparticles, Encapsulin (Encap), as neoantigenic peptide nanocarriers by genetically incorporating the OT-1 peptide of ovalbumin (OVA) protein (used as vaccine for B16-OVA melanoma tumor model) to three different positions of the Encap subunit ( Choi et al., 2016 ). This article motivated us to look further into Encapsulin as a strong candidate for the vaccine platform.
In the mentioned study ( Choi et al., 2016 ), DCs that were pulsed with constructs of OT1-Encap-C (C-terminal fusion with OT-1 peptide) induced OT-1-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. This indicates Encapsulin ability to enhance the uptake of the OT-1 peptides by dendritic cells and the subsequent presentation of these peptides to DC8+ T cells.
OT1-Encap-C presentation to DCs was also able to induce the differentiation of functional effector CD8+ T cells in murine spleen. Finally, OT-1-Encap subcutaneous vaccinations in B16-OVA melanoma tumor bearing mice effectively activated OT-1 peptide specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells before or even after tumor generation, resulting in significant suppression of tumor growth in prophylactic as well as therapeutic treatments.
Encapsulin was thus chosen as the platform for  CAPOEIRA’s vaccine system, for multiple reasons:
Encapsulin was shown to have an effective activation of dendritic and T cells in vitro"

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," advisor Wang Xuan suggested that maybe lacI expression was too strong. Preliminary model simulation indicated that lux pR was a knot where loads of biochemical reactions intersects. We decided to build a less leaky but more sensitive lux pR promotor and started the design of lux pR-HS.
Week18 20180722-20180728
We realized that previous plasmid construction was not efficient, so Huang Tianze designed a new set of plasmid construction plans. The parts are InFusioned into the smallest transcription units and individually amplified, then use 3A assembly to assemble the units together to form the test plasmids. So…even more PCRs and gel recoveries.
Week19 20180729-20180804
The new plans worked out quite well. This week we sequenced the unit plasmids and confirmed most of them. Wang Tingxuan and Chen Xinyi ligated the lux pR test plasmid. Yao Liang designed the lux pR mutants. Started to build Neon and Safety Catch.
Week20 20180805-20180811
Wang Tingxuan went to the regional meet up hosted in Peking University. We sent out the first batch of our HP surveys. Pilot lux pR testing showed that AHL induction intensity was quite high. But IPTG induction of lacI+pI promotor still showed no results. RDFZ_China suggested that we use Tac promotor.
Week21 20180812-20180818
Wang Tingxuan designed new quorum sensing test systems of Rhl and Cin. IPTG induction still generated no results. Started Ptac test plsmid construction. We considered the effect of lacI dosage and decided to use three different levels of induction.
Week22 20180819-20180825
We tested lux pR and mutants AHL induction with Thermo Varioskan Flash. The preliminary results lead us to design the sequence of lux pR-HS. Designing plasmids for IPTG induction of CRISPRi. Ordering more primers hahaha.
Week23 20180826-20180901
Finished construction of Neon plasmids. Positive feedback was indeed very strong, the fluorescent intensity was way stronger than lux pR AHL induction. CRISPRi plasmids were difficult to assemble because dCas9 was too long. We aborted the original plan and decided to build dCas9 and gRNAs into separate transcription units and ligate them later. Also Ge Xiaofei and Chen Xinyi attended CCiC in Shanghai and sent"

June 7: Today I looked at programming for the Microsoft Surface. I followed a tutorial for creating a simple application called HelloScatterView in Microsoft Visual Studio. The application displays a series of images on the Surface that the user can then manipulate.
Week of June 11
June 12: Today we visited the BU Photonics Center where we were given a crash course on synthetic biology basics. We gave brief presentations on our projects and received feedback from Shawn and Monique, the BU team members, and Traci, their PI.
June 13: Today we set up a brainstorming image map in an unused classroom upstairs and bounced around ideas for our projects.
June 15: Today we decided to include flipping the cubes to represent the cold shock and shaking the cubes to represent the vortexing and integrating the plasmid into the E. coli. During the afternoon, I also attended a Bioethics talk where I learned about the plagiarism problems plaguing the research field.
Week of June 18
June 18: Today we finalized our paper prototype. We roughed out the basic interactions with the cubes and the Surface using paper cutout Sifteo “screens” and a “storyboard” using posterboard and Post-it notes. We then gave a brief rundown of the installation to Consuelo. While we were demonstrating the project, Linda came up with a good way to deal with the menu cube, as we had been struggling with a good way to implement a menu while keeping the number of specialized cubes to a minimum. Linda’s suggestion was that we utilize the four different sides of the cubes as menu selectors, and depending on which of the sides another cube was placed next to, the menu selection would change.
June 19: Wendy and I met with Orit to go over our paper prototype. Before meeting with her, we’d come up with different ideas for the installation to connect more directly with synthetic biology. One of these ideas was to create representations of ice buckets and petri dishes that users would then physically “place” the cubes into to cold shock or incubate the bacteria. We thought about using another Surface and possibly even the Microsoft tablet. However, after talking with Orit, we decided that these additional features might be cumbersome. Orit stressed that we needed to grab the attention of our users in about five seconds, so streamlining the interaction was really key. This meant that we needed to simplify the characteristics we gave our creatures and that we needed to get rid of our menu. We are most likely going to be sticking strictly to color as the trait that we are going to modify in order"

Figure 5-22: The changing trend of response index with the change of light intensity (blue LED, 470nm, 5W, using pmyo3-iC1C2-EYFP worm)
From these data, we can find out some conclusions.
(1) For all these strains, the response index is getting larger with the increase of the current.
(2) For pmyo2-ChR2-YFP and pmyo3-ChR2-YFP, when the current increase to about 600, we can see the worm can be totally activated.
(3) For pmyo2-iC1C2-EYFP and pmyo3-iC1C2-EYFP, when the current increase to about 800, we can see the worm can be totally activated.
(4) For pmyo2-ChETA-EYFP and pmyo3-ChETA-EYFP, when the current increase to about 900, we can see the worm can be totally activated.
(5) For all the strains of worms, 1000mA is the most suitable current. So in our project we use 1000mA blue light (470nm, 5W) to test our worms.

Comparison of low levels of LldR and LldP, to Figure 4B, representing high levels of LldR, can suggest either of two things:
introduction of lldP into the system leads to leakiness due to uptake of possible traces of lactate in the medium
the levels of LldR are too low to properly suppress the LldR-promoter even without presence of lactate
To discriminate these two possibilities we tested the system, as mentioned, with a higher expression of LldR and LldP obtained due to a medium strength Anderson promoter ( BBa_J23118 ). The reduced level of leakiness despite higher levels of lldP suggests that the problem before was not import of lactate from the medium (which should not be present anyways) but due to insufficient levels of LldR and therefore lack of proper repression in absence of lactate.
Based on these results we decided to use BBa_K1847008 in our final system since its high ON/OFF ratio with a value of 15.27 allows for sensitivity in the range in which we expect the lactate output of our cancer cells to be located. Additionally we showed that introducing the permease lldP increased sensitivity of our system to lactate. Further validation showed that lactate from mammalian cell can be sensed in presence of lldP. All in all, we designed a promoter which is repressed by LldR and activated by L-lactate and responds with an increased sensitivity compared to the wild-type promoter.
Increased sensitivity for single cell lactate output
Overview
We wanted to test if the lactate levels produced by our mammalian cells would be high enough to trigger GFP expression from our reporter plasmid, and whether or not there would be crosstalk between wells containing mammalian cells and wells without them. We combined bacteria and Jurkat or 3T3 cells, respectively, in our chip and recorded the bacterial growth along with the GFP fluorescence in 16 wells for 7 hours. We did the same experiment in absence of mammalian cells as a negative control.
Results
The results obtained from the lactate detection measurements within our nanowellplate show a clear increase of normalized fluorescence over time.

The collaboration with team TU Delft is a brilliant experiment, the Skype meeting and part correction not only helps our team’s lab work but also build a nice friendship between two teams. We appreciate the works and really look forward to meeting TU Delft in Boston!
．TU Delft Collaborate Memo :
After stumbling upon the description of our project, NTHU Taiwan initiated conversations with us via Facebook. Their project also consisted of a biosensor device, on this case featuring a series of overexpressed receptors and enzymes capable of both sensing and degrading EDC’s (Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals) that could be used on-site with sewage waters. A series of Skype meetings followed, in which the usefulness of the inclusion of any of our accomplished BioBricks into their project was discussed. Initially, vesicles and TDPs were deemed potentially interesting for NTHU Taiwan.However, after a closer study of our vesicles BioBrick by Taiwan, they came back to us with a series of points such as the variability in the content and size of vesicles, that made us aware of the weaknesses of our approach for packaging Cas13a and TDPs in our vesicles. Such a feedback resulted important for TU Delft iGEM 2017, as it made us aware of more aspects that should be addressed and optimised in our vesicles prior to its integration in our project.However, the collaboration took a different direction when Taiwan reported difficulties in the transformation involving their plasmids.
[ Figure. 1.5-3 ] Snapgene overview of NTHU Taiwan’s construct.
TU Delft offered to revise their SnapGene files featuring their construct to discard a faulty design as the cause and shared a series of recommendations on how to make their design clearer in Snapgene and how to achieve transformations with higher yields.
Nonetheless, a series of recommendations were still made by TU Delft as to eliminate redundancies and make their design in SnapGene clearer and more organized.
Finally, NTHU communicated the accomplishment of their transformation after reordering their plasmids.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," We assume that: Equal internal volume, an internal pressure of 1 bar and an external pressure of 0.006 bar. In order for the box, to be able to contain this pressure, the wall thickness would have to be 1.3 m thick, compared to the domes 0.3 m wall thickness. The pressure distribution is also clearly more uniformly distributed in the dome, compared to the box. The relations between “volume to area” of the dome and box are as follows:
\begin{equation} Area_{circle} = r^2 \cdot \pi \end{equation}  \begin{equation} Area_{dome} = Area_{circle} + \frac{r^2 4 \pi}{2} = 3 r^2 pi \end{equation}  \begin{equation} Area_{box} = 2a^2 + 2a^2 + 2a^2 =6 a^2 \end{equation}  \begin{equation} \frac{Area}{Volume} -relations : \end{equation}  \begin{equation} \frac{a^3}{Area_{box}}  = a \cdot \frac{1}{6} \end{equation}  \begin{equation} \frac{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^ 3}{Area_{dome}} = \frac{2}{9} \cdot r \end{equation}  What becomes apparent from this, is that the “volume to area”- relation is lower for a box. This means that you would need more building material to construct a box, compared to a dome of equal volume.
Fig 2: - The picture shows how the internal stresses accumulate in a dome, simulated in COMSOL. It also shows the minimal wall thickness (0.3 m) when using Aspergillus as building material in Mars, if the dome has to be able to contain 1 bar.
Fig 3: - The internal stress accumulation of a box is a lot higher than a dome. In order for an box, of same volume as Fig(2), the wall thickness would have to be 1.3 m in order to contain 1 bar against the Martian atmosphere.

From this       data the adaptation times for different changes can be read out directly. This data is important for tuning our model to our data (see Model).       To yield the data in a form, which can be used to control the robot, the tumbling frequency is read out before and after induction. To this end, we created an algorithm, which reads out the number of tumbles over a certain amount of time using       a “sliding window” over the raw data.

This figure shows the response of one bacterium to a concentration change from 0 to 100 μM. Top: This graph depicts the step increase of the aspartate concentration, which happens at 90 s after measurement start. After the medium exchange the concentration stays at this level. Middle: The graph shows the data acquired from the analysis of the bacterial rotation. The bacteria, which have been tethered to the glass surface spin either in CCW or CW direction. At the beginning of the time series the Tar receptor is fully adapted to the environmental concentration (which is 0 in this case), so it spins with its natural tumbling frequency (tumble = CW rotation). After 70 seconds the flow starts to increase for the medium exchange resulting in a forced stop in rotation. The medium containing the 100 μM aspartate reaches the bacteria at 100 s (marked with the red arrow), after which the flow rate decreases over the next 10 seconds. This results in the start of the expected rotational behavior at 110 s. Towards the end of the graph the bacteria have adapted to the new concentration. Bottom: This graph is generated from the one in the middle by calculating the CW rate using a “moving window”. This data is used as the output of the biosensor.

This figure shows the chemotactic response of the tethered bacteria to a aspartate concentration change of 0 - 10 μM. The information on how to read the graphs is described in figure 4.

Human Practice Overview
Thinking beyond laboratory is one of the key factors that would affect the yield of scientific researches into real social interests. Thankfully, this idea has been recognized by the iGEM community for a very long time. Not only should every team participate in various social activities, but also we need to keep a real time interaction with the society, the place that we ultimately hope to create significance.
This year, our team applied the knowledge of synthetic biology to seek feasible solutions to the energy issue. Urgent as it is, the energy issue is more than a regional problem, but has raised global concerns.  In this social context, converting solar energy into chemical energy is undoubtedly of fundamental and industrial importance. Our original interest on this topic was initially sparked by recent cutting-edge research in artificial photosynthesis. To enhance our understandings about energy issues, and meanwhile, arouse public awareness of synthetic biology, we raised multiple public questionnaires and dialogues within academe and industry. In communications with industrial community, field experts as well as administrative authority afterwards, we realized that development of a robust, sustainable and scalable approach for hydrogen production would be socially relevant, industrially important, but technically challenging. This has led us to set our ultimate goals to solve such challenge by leveraging the power of synthetic biology. We eventually proposed and demonstrated a sun-powered biofilm-interfaced artificial hydrogen-producing system, Solar Hunter. Benefiting from the real time social interactions, we kept modifying the system to be more and more adaptable to the scalable industrial application. This new system will in return, introduce a synthetic biology-based approach towards energy applications in industrial context.
Additionally, while conducting the research, our team not only kept real-time interactions with the society regarding to the project itself, but also we actively participated in a variety of educational propagation and public engagements. As the first-ever iGEM team at ShanghaiTech, this year we established the iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI), a special social activity for every iGEMers at ShanghaiTech. For this"

Midiprep
For larger amounts of bacterial cultures the QIAGEN® Plasmid Plus Midi Kit was used to isolate plasmids. According to the instructions included, all necessary solutions were prepared and 25 ml bacterial culture harvested after 12-16 hours incubation. The sample was centrifuged at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pelleted cells were completely resuspended in 2 ml Buffer P1. Then, 2 ml buffer P2 were added and mixed thoroughly by inverting until the lysate appeared viscous. The solution was incubated at room temperature (15–25°C) for 3 min. The QIAfilter Cartridge was placed into a new tube. Afterwards, 2 ml buffer S3 were added to the lysate and mixed by inverting 4-6 times. The lysate was transfered to the cartridge and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. During incubation the QIAGEN Plasmid Plus spin column was put into the vacuum manifold and tube extenders inserted into each column. The plunger was inserted gently into the QIAfilter Cartridge and the lysate filtered into the tube. Thereafter, 2 ml buffer BB were added to the cleared lysate and mixed by inverting 4-6 times. Lysate was then transfered to a QIAGEN Plasmid Plus spin column on the vacuum manifold. Vacuum was applied until all liquid remains were drawn through the column. To wash the DNA 700 μl buffer ETR was added and vacuum applied. Residual wash buffer was removed by centrifugation of the column at 10,000 x g (9,700 rpm) for 1 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge. The column was put into a clean 1.5 ml tube. Finally, 200 μl water (55°C) was added to the center of the spin column. The column was let stand for 1 minute and centrifuged for 1 minute to collect the eluted DNA.

In order to determine whether these measures would be enough to ensure the safe and ethical dispersal of recombinant DNA into the environment, we have begun conversations with Dr. Mark Segal at the US Environmental Protection Agency. These talks served two purposes: to understand the current status of regulations surrounding the release of engineered biological materials into the environment and to see whether our adapted amberless concept might serve to clarify certain gray areas and push regulations forward, making them more sensible for researchers and safer for ecosystems everywhere. Currently, the study of genetically-modified organisms in the environment is covered under the 1997 Microbial Products of Biotechnology section of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which says that limited, controlled trials are exempt from seeking EPA approval. However, the ultimate application of these recombinant cells in remote sensing capabilities (i.e. on a biodegradable UAV) would require approval from the EPA in the form of a TSCA Environmental Release Application (TERA). We are still in the process of determining whether our amberless concept could act as a case study for the EPA to consider when drafting new regulations.
Uses of UAVs
In order to fully understand the benefits, risks and ethics of using UAVs and to address the stigma surrounding their use, we first had to get first hand information from experts who work on, or use UAVs for their daily activities. To do this, we conducted short interviews (15 minutes long) with experts from various fields including Earth Sciences, Planetary Sciences, Synthetic Biology and Remote Sensing.  The responses from these experts increased our knowledge on the current uses of UAVs, the capabilities of the current models, the regulations of handling UAVs and the future of this technology. We have used (and will continue to use) these responses as a tool to increase awareness to people of the good uses of UAVs.
In addition to interviewing experts, we conducted a social survey that was aimed at getting the general public’s opinion on the uses of UAVs for civilian uses. This survey correlated people’s knowledge of UAVs and their opinions on UAVs and apart from helping us get a general sense of the public’s opinion, it has made us believe that, the more people know about the beneficial uses of UAVs, the more they will be willing to try, use or even add to this new technology.

Delivery
“Is there a material for the catheter or its coating that is suitably permeable to this mystery molecule(s) yet entirely able to contain the source of microbes without any leaks?”
Professor Jef D. Boeke
Director, Institute for Systems Genetics
NYU Langone Medical Center
Asked by others and by ourselves, our thoughts on how to practically implement Solution has shaped the project and forced us to tackle the problem from many angles. We needed a method by which we could expose the catheter, and bladder, to our anti-microbial proteins, and in a safe manner. Safety was a key consideration when designing delivery methods. We looked at a range of different approaches, including a variety of different catheter coatings, a semi-permeable membrane inside the catheter and encasing our bacteria within sodium alginate beads. For more information, check out our safety and design pages.
Commensal Bacteria
We thought further about the discussions we had had at Hornsey UTI clinic and were inspired by what Prof. Malone-Lee said to us:
“Biofilms have a profound effect on antibiotic resistance … bacteria that can penetrate through biofilms strikes me as a very sensible project direction.”
At the clinic they talked to us out using competing species of bacteria to replace the common uropathogens.
“Patients keep taking probiotics while being treated with antibiotics in our unit and they don't seem to mind ingesting 20-40 billion acidophilus bacteria without a second thought.”
Dr. Sheela Swamy
With these conversations in mind, we went back to the drawing board. Our data showed us that we needed a high local concentration of anti-biofilm and antimicrobial agents to be able to break down a biofilm. We thought about how we could create these high local concentrations and came up with a new solution: to introduce free living bacteria into the urinary tract. Whilst we are aware that current GMO regulations would not permit this, we have explored the possibility of it becoming an option in the future.
Many people perceive the use of GMOs to be unethical and this has far-reaching impacts on society, such as the enaction of anti-GMO legislation. To explore these ethical questions and find out the public’s opinion on our project, we sent out a questionnaire to over 150 people, asking: If your"

We ran time courses for mScarlet parts under different concentrations of IPTG, and WM17_377 (K2333420) variants under different concentrations of aTC and IPTG. Data looked messy in general so we're re-cloning mScarlet parts.
Week 15 (September 4 - September 10)
Wetlab Summary
Remaking inducible mScarlet control part, WM17_408 (K2333427). Ran an experiment for WM17_401, WM17_394, WM17_396, WM17_397, WM17_398, WM17_399 (K2333413-K2333419) in the plate reader with inducer. Looking at the data analysis, the fluorescence of these constructs is really different from construct to construct (but is consistent between biological replicates.) However, it is very clear that .01mM IPTG has a fluorescence reducing effect, and .1mM even more so.
Week 16 (September 11 - September 17)
Wetlab Summary
Ran experiment for aTC-inducible mScarlet pdt parts WM17_409-414 (K2333428-K2333433) in the plate reader. Analysis of data reveals several things. One, all the tags are working. Two, all concentrations of mf-Lon are high enough that we can't see any difference between the different tags. Three, all constructs look to be the same fluorescence. We also decided to FACS mScarlet parts at 4 hours instead of 6: cell density was nice and degradation seems to be occurring. We grew WM17_409 (K2333428) for 5 hours and ran a time course with and without IPTG. Degradation continues after steady state is reached, but it's fairly minor. Callan headed up Gibson cloning of pTet mScarlet + pLac mf-Lon combo parts, and the re-cloning of 408 (K2333427).
Week 17 (September 18 - September 24)
Wetlab Summary
This week we ran a 4 hour time course for WM17_409 (K2333428) under aTC and either .1mM IPTG or no IPTG. Every twenty minutes, we took 100µl from each of the tubes and immediately filtered into tubes on ice.

Synthetic Biology Class
One of the ITB_Indonesia human practice activity was organizing synthetic biology class in our faculty. We divided participants into groups. Each group created a unique idea correlated to synthetic biology and made a system composed of series of biobricks which available in iGEM parts registry. Those ideas then were presented in the class. In addition, each group needed to expose functions and applications of their own idea. The presentation was very inspiring. A lot of idea could be a solution for problems that recently happened, especially in our country, Indonesia. Participants were very enthusiast to discuss about those ideas and projects proposed by each group such as smart yogurt, ''Escherichia coli'' cupid, ecolosa, etc.

Week 25 (October 15 - October 19)
Once again, we cut our PetroBrick / J13002 /NPT construction so that we could ligate CAR into the end of it. We tranformed this large construct into super competent cells on a chlor plate, and performed PCR, but this was not successful; we were looking for bands of 7973bp. Despite this, we made overnight cultures and minipreps to try and digest our construct with EcorI, but this did not yield any bands corresponding to our construct. We attempted this a few times, but had no success. Once again, we were not able to successfully ligate OleT into the PET vector.
Week 25 (October 22 - October 26)
We felt that we would try a different approach this week in building our construct. Instead of ligating CAR into the PetroBrick / J13002 /NPT BioBrick, we would try to ligate this construction into the PET vector containing CAR, with CAR downstream of NPT. After cutting and performing a ligation, we transformed into E.coli, but had very few cells. Nonetheless, we did a PCR to check if the size of our plasmid matched our ligated construct, but unfortunately it did not. Once again we were looking for 7973 bp, but did not obtain any of these bands. We did not have time to proceed further with this construction, as there was data to be inputted for the final Wiki Freeze.

1) KEGG database
The program ‘Gil’ is a project based on KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database (KanehisaM., et al. 2014; and KanehisaM., GotoS., 2000). There are numerous advantages of KEGG (Adriaens M. E., et al. n.d.). Above all, KEGG has a nice interface. In an overview graphic, we can take all reactions of a pathway, and see the enzymes that are involved in the reaction by clicking individual reactions. In addition, there are most information about the gene linked with this enzyme. So we organized and parsed the databases that provide information of compounds, reactions, genes and enzymes.
However, KEGG database is definitely not perfect. First, it doesn't provide thermodynamic data. Additionally, KEGG database shows reactions in a bidirectional way, which lacks the information of thermodynamical feasibility. Also, KEGG is a pure gene database. While each enzyme has a large amount of gene information attached, it lacks a bit in the other departments. Therefore, users easily encounter empty pages that do not have any information. Lastly, every glycan in KEGG database is not connected with its corresponding compound. When glycan IDs are not connected to compound IDs, it is not possible to find a reaction with a glycan.
2) Thermodynamic information
Thermodynamic constraint is one of the most important factors of biological experiments. Therefore, the program ‘Gil’ provides Gibbs energy changes of each metabolic reaction.
The program ‘Gil’ obtained thermodynamic data from two separated databases even though they were obtained from the same program, eQuilibrator (Flamholz A., et al. 2012). The first database is composed of Gibbs free energy from standard condition—pH 7.0 and 0.1 M ionic strength. These data are correct, but the size of the database is smaller than the other one due to the lack of wet lab experiments. On the other hand, the second version is made up of values from a calculation. This database has much more values than the first one however, it is hard for researchers to apply this values directly to their experiments since they are not experimentally proved. Thus, additional attention is needed to utilize the second version"

Human Practice
This year we did some great thought experiments to imagine what we want to achieve and discuss. As we know, synthetic biology aims to create new life systems never exist in nature. So, we came up with an idea why not design a new life form. Nowadays, artificial intelligence develops so fast. We are curious about what if computers and organisms become the same system. Therefore, we thought and described why our project mix-realty cell was a new form. And we considered the possibility of evolution of mix-realty cell. In the meanwhile, we also considered what mix-realty cell could be applied for and what mix-realty cell could influence our lives. Moreover, we did other work to help our project. We think deeply about the current situation of popularization of life science in China. We try to figure out if there is a way to change this circumstance. And we also do some outreach activities to raise public understanding of our project.
Public outreach
1.Volunteered in science & technology museum
At the time of Children's Day, we helped volunteer in Wuhan science&technology museum. We have a great day with kids~
2.Help local primary school completed lab courses
Many primary school in China don’t has lab. We decide to help a school in our community by offering our lab to them to complete their experimental education.
3.IGEM TalkX: Synthetic biology training club
Our university is a comprehensive university based on agriculture and life science. So the public has a good foundation and open attitude on synthetic biology. We set up a club to communicate with everyone concern about synthetic biology. The communication began at every weekend. We are happy to see it's really make great sense to all participant. Most of our team member were elected from the club member.

Figure 4.3d models of HBEGF-TAR chimera on membrane.
After deciding sequence combination of amino acids in modelled chimera    HB-EGF/Tar protein, analyzing the interaction of both fusion protein and    diphtheria exotoxin (Figure 5) is extremely important to ensure functional    ligand-receptor system. The basic concept of interaction modelling is    that the protein will be bound to each other well if it causes the    ‘environment’ energy (termed by E parameter; calculated by formula below)   being lowered down. In this part, our team sent the respective sequence to    ClusPro website for further analyzing.15

E = 0.4Erep + -0.40Eatt + 600Eelec + 1.00EDARS
Note: Erep and Eattr denote as repulsive and attractive contributions    to the van der Waals interaction energy. Additionally, Eelec means an    electrostatic energy that occur during both protein interaction. EDARS is a pairwise structure-based potential constructed by the Decoys of    the Reference State (DARS) approach, and it primarily represents    desolvation contributions, i.e., the free energy change due to the    removal of the water molecules from the interface.15

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html,"Alst-RFP CLONING
We cloned IDT G-Blocks GadE gene into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and TnrA-pAlst-RFP G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 1800 bp long.
As the result of Colony PCR experiments, we observed bands are either negative or less molecule-weighted than we expected. We made liquid cultures of the not negative colonies, and isolated DNA from these colonies after incubating for 16 hours. we did cut-check with EcoRI and PstI enzymes in order to control occurring DNA’s.
After  cut-check, we observed less molecule-weighted bands again. Therefore we decided to control our ordered G-Blocks and did a PCR experiment with CMV forward and SV40 reverse primers. The gel  image of this PCR is shown below.
TnrA-pTnrA-RFP PCR
After that PCR, we observed less molecule-weighted bands than normal.
pET45 -TnrA-pTnrA-RFP CLONNING
We questioned if the plasmid is incorrect because the results of PSB1C3 cloning weren’t matching with our expected results. We cut the G-Block with BamHI and XhoI and ligated it with pET45-b which was cut with same enzymes. We transformed this ligated product into BL21 bacteria strain, which has T7 RNA polymerase.
In order to control if the cloning is made correctly, we did a colony PCR with T7 Promoter reverse and T7 promoter forward. If cloning isn’t made properly, the band should be at 360 bp line and if is made properly the band should be at 1779 bp line.
In colony PCR results, we observed lower molecule-weighted bands than expected, again. In this case we realized that this gene sequence was wrong.
We didn’t have enough time to order and clone this gene so we didn’t continue to do this part’s experiments.

Caltech,2012,Team:Caltech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", we electroporated the Z. mobilis cells and then grew the transformants on the substrate as the sole carbon source.
In the second part of this subproject, we will use a certain type of plate from Biolog. The Biolog plates contain many wells; each well containing a different carbon source. We will suspend E. coli and Z. mobilis cells in the wells of the Biolog plates. We expect to see that E. coli can grow in wells that Z. mobilis can not and vice versa. We will also expect to see some overlapping wells. We will then digest the E. coli bacteria, and then use those digest fragments as DNA inserts to be transformed into Z. mobilis. Because the DNA fragments will be very large, which will create very large plasmids, we can not simple electroporate the plasmids directly into Z. mobilis. So instead, we will need to use a kit to use a bacterial phage and insert the plasmid into E. coli. Then we can transfer the plasmid from the E. coli to Z. mobilis by conjugation. We will then expect the transformed Z. mobilis to be able to grow in the wells that E. coli and the original Z. mobilis Biolog plates.

Biodiesel is made up of a variety of fatty acid alkyl and methyl esters, as well as long-chain mono alkyl esters.  In principal, biodiesel is a great fuel source because after discarded hydrocarbons are transesterified (when an alcohol and ester swap R groups), the subsequent alkyl ester-based fuel burns more efficiently than “normal” diesel and reduces the wear on engines.  Unfortunately, biodiesel is not a completely viable or reliable energy source because of low production yields.  A team of researchers at Berkeley engineered a strain of E. coli capable of producing alkyl esters at 9.4% of theoretical yield, which is on the higher end of current yields of biologically derived alkyl esters.  To make biodiesel cost competitive, we need to increase yield per substrate.
Generating large volumes of alkyl esters per substrate is an energetically demanding process. There are a variety of ways to increase the NADH/NAD+ ratio in our E. coli cells.  One of our objectives was to knock out E. coli’s NADH dehydrogenase enzymes Nuo and Ndh, which typically oxid"

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," The software parses the design using spaces, so this is a strict rule of the tools.
4. Inputs - For both tools, the user is allowed to enter an input string.  This string corresponds to which invertases are used in your design.  For example, if our design was ""I0 A B I0' I1 C I1'"", we could enter the input string ""0 1"" or ""1 0"" or ""1"" or ""0"".  All of these input strings make sense.  Entering an input string that contains an element which is not an invertase in the current design does not make sense.  For example, entering the input ""X 5"" would do nothing because there is no invertase X or invertase 5 in our design.
That's it!  Now it's time to learn how to use the tools.
Simulation Tool
The goal of the simulation tool is to allow the user to test a particular input, or series of inputs, on a proposed design.  The GUI offers the user two text bars in which to type their design and their input, following the notation outlined above.  After entering this information, the user can press the ""Run"" button to test the input.  Upon pressing this button, the text area shows the inversions made when each invertase is added.  It not only displays how the entire design is affected, but it also displays the part permutations before and after each invertase is added. Below is an example of this tool where our design is ""I0 A B I1 C I0' I1"" and our input vector is ""0 1"".
Once the user has tested an input vector, they are free to change the input or design and run another test.  The new text will be added below the previously generated text; however, the user can choose to clear the text using the ""Clear"" button.
Checking Tool
The purpose of the Checking Tool is to quickly determine whether a given design is capable of making every permutation of parts within that design.  This of course is determined by testing every permutation and combination of possible input invertase sequences.  To use this tool, the user can first enter their design.  Given this design, if the ""Auto Input"" box is checked, the tool will determine what invertases are available for inputting and then test each of these possible input vectors.  Here is an example this Checking tool testing a slightly more complicated design.  After clicking the ""Test Design"" button, the GUI produces a table displaying the results.  This can be seen below"
Tec-Monterrey,2014,Team:Tec-Monterrey#ITESM14 module3.html_-_-_TEXT.html," in the following way:
<p> First, the bacteria begin to grow while producing the autoinducer (3-oxo-C6-HSL).
</p>
<p> Then, when the autoinducer reaches a critical threshold concentration, the complex LuxR-AHL is formed. </p>
<p> The LuxR-AHL complex activates transcription of the luciferase operon by binding to the lux box, a 20bp inverted repeated sequence located in the luxI promoter region. </p>

The goal of this module is to control the expression of bacteriophages using V.fischeri’s quorum sensing system.  To do this, we will use three parts: luxI, luxR and the pLux.
First, a chromosomal integration of the two genes of interest (luxI and luxR) is required. This integration will take place in two different loci (lpp and msbB). The idea is to insert these genes and simultaneously knock out two genes of the bacterial membrane (for more information see <a href="" https://2014.igem.org/Team:Tec-Monterrey/ITESM14_project.html#tab_module1 "" target=""_blank"">Module I</a>. This way, the genes will be expressing the autoinducer synthase and the LuxR protein at all times.
The second part of the strategy is the direct mutagenesis of the phage M13 at the promoter of the PII protein. The PCR mutagenesis will add the pLux as a promoter of PII protein. This protein is responsible for the replication of the single strand by nicking the double stranded form of the genome.

There was no detectable peak at 588nm (λmax) (Fig. 10) . We explored all of the alternatives using the limited resources that we have as we did not expect to come this far with the lab work.  Additionally, due to the time constraint we did not proceed with troubleshooting the problem.  However, based on the several failed attempts we propose that:
The parameters used to quantify the chromoproteins could be further optimized.
Our techniques could be improved as this was the first time we performed this procedure.

Meanwhile, we are facing a problem as we conduct effect testing of our oil biodesulfurization, which is that our university is not equipped with the certain device that could accurately detect the sulfur element in oil, such as Micro-Coulomete. For that matter, FAFU team is willing to provide us with technical support. They will help analyze the crude oil sample we send to them which has been treated with our engineered bacteria, with Micro-Coulometer that their school owns, and then send back the analysis results to us.

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour33_-_-_TEXT.html," has been evaluated, as this is the region where most antibodies where used. 63 universities were represented at iGEM 2014 out of approximately 4000 academic institutions in Europe. Reference: European Union. The role of universities in the Europe of knowledge. (Link) (Accessed August 21st 2015). Taking these numbers into consideration, iGEM 2014 represents 1.6 % of the market. Assuming only one research project per university is using antibodies, which is unlikely, this evaluation reinforces the assumption, that the remaining product can be sold. In some instances this will not be the case, due to the specialized nature of production or property rights. Therefore it is estimated that 30 % of the production will be lost.
A cost analysis is key in estimating profitability, and determining if this project should be carried on after iGEM. These estimates shows if our presumption of the competitiveness are wrong rather than right. The analysis is used to approximate the pricing of the product, since it does not exist on the market as of yet. The aim is to reduce prices by half in comparison to the price of mAbs, which leaves an acceptable margin between reality and estimates.
Capital Investment
To estimate how much capital is needed to build the plant, the Busche model (1995) with modifications has   been used. Reference: Seider, Seader, Lewin and Widagoo. Product and Process Design Principles - Synthesis, Analysis, and Evaluation; Third Edition - International Student Version; John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; 2010 The size of the factory has to be estimated before costs can be calculated, and therefore it is necessary to   evaluate the number of units needed. As established under entrepreneurship it has been decided to   produce several small batches, and the market analysis estimated the amount of batches to be 250 per year. According to the timeline a batch cycle is 63.5 [h], and the next batch can begin after a flash   sterilization of the fermenter, 42.5 [h] from the start of the batch. This implies, that the cycle time of   two batches is 106 [h]. It is assumed that the plant is closed for 4 [weeks/yr] and a work week consists of 5   days (120 [h]). Which means that 3 set-ups are needed. This assumption leaves a time buffer in case of   unforeseen maintenance or orders.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and"

Spring Workshop
Every year, the Albertan iGEM teams from Lethbridge, Edmonton, and Calgary converge for several conferences culminating in a friendly competition called aGEM .  This weekend, we had the first conference, the spring workshop, and got to meet the teams from Lethbridge and Edmonton.  We heard about their projects, the challenges they faced, and later met with several speakers, shown below, to discuss the personal, technical, and communication challenges ahead.  We also took a tour of Peter Facchini's lab, where we learnt a lot about how metabolomics is researched and got to see the insides of a mass spectrometer.
Lethbridge's Project
Last year, Lethbridge designed a strain of E. coli to degrade catechol, a pollutant in tailings ponds.  Though successful, the strain was not very efficient.  This year's project is to optimize it; a major focus is on the development of micro-compartments to target enzymes to specific locations inside the cell. Their preliminary results suggest they can contain up to 5 proteins at once.
Alberta's Project
The University of Alberta's team wants to modify Neurospora crassa to break down common industrial waste products such as saw-dust into usable biodiesel. The key feature of the fungus is that it grows well on cellulose; Alberta's delegate, Rae, named four key goals in their project.
Find the ideal growth conditions for the mold in environments consisting of industrial waste products, such as wheatstraw, sawdust, etc.
