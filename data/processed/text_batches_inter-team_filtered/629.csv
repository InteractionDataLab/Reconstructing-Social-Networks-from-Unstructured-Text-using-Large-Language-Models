2. Determine the types of enzymes in E.coli
3. Study about alkane monooxygenase
4. Using and synthesizing of wax
Directly injecting substrate is meaningless. Find out if we can use various substrates.
Acyl-CoA reductase(AcrM) is the key enzyme.
5. Increasing efficiency
Overexpression of the gene AcrM
Modification of inclusion body
Group 2
1. Microorganism that synthesizes biosurfactants and degrades hydrocarbons
Detection of soil contaminants; Because soil condition is difficult to determine through naked eyes, detection is important. (Removal of contaminant and thereby facilitating soil’s recovery)
Absorbing the contaminant
Surfactant expression: Green Fluorescent Protein; House-keeping gene expression: Red Fluorescent Protein
Because many species of bacteria can synthesize biosurfactant, it may be possible to degrade various contaminants.
Reason for TU Delft’s unsuccessful experiment: injecting too many genes all at once interferes with the regulation system, resulting in non-favorable results.
- Should we insert the genes all in one cell?
Heterogeneous genes, if they are expressed at the same time, may cluster. Furthermore, the organism will not be able to sustain and survive a modification of its membrane.
Facilitation mechanism: Incorporation of a regulation system into TU Delft's mechanism. Insertion of nitrogen fixation gene to bring about a more fertile soil. However, a downside to this method is that a plant must be nearby. Searching for a microorganism that is independent of plants may be an option.
Nitrogen fixation is not easy. Hydrogenase is used in Nitrogen fixation, but its enzymatic activity is greatly diminished upon exposure to oxygen, thus decreasing efficiency.
- Groups 1 and 2 should combine and study more about Delft.
- We should not be satisfied with simple detection. We must proceed further.
- Advisor will let us know of the possibilities of our experiment.
- Find out why Delft used the genes they used.
- Aiming for bioenergy production
Substrate selection
Fermentation by anaerobic bacteria of burnt waste matter from cities is too big of a scale
Wax seems to be the ideal substrate.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," why we use three methods to find potential Cry proteins:
A direct sequence comparison with a stringent cut-off defined to be an E valueExpect value is the number of hits one can ""expect"" to see by chance when searching a database of a particular size. of 0.1 or lower and an alignment overlap of at least 50%: BLAST The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is an algorithm for comparing sequence information, such as amino-acid (protein) or nucleic-acid (DNA/RNA) sequences. 13
Using a database of only Cry proteins, this tool will allow us to rapidly identify other proteins with highly similar sequences.
A probabilistic approach based on the primary subdivision between Cry proteins (45% sequence similarity): HMMER.
The HMMER toolkit contains several programs that the pipeline uses. 14 The program first builds many different profiles based on the multiple sequence alignment of the primary Cry protein groups. This is handled by Clustal Omega. 15
HMMbuild: Builds a profile HMM from an input multiple alignment.
HMMpress: Formats an HMM database into a binary format for hmmscan.
HMMscan: Searches a protein sequence against a protein profile HMM database.
All of these methods are still based on the same Hidden Markov Model principle 9 .
A machine learning approach based on protein features using many weak classifiers to give a majority vote: ""RandomForest"". 16 This part is explained further in the protein classification section.
Protein Classification
The protein classification part of the machine learning is done by the pipeline in two steps: First the features of a protein are predicted using Biopython 10 , and then the pre-trained model predicts a class based on those features.
Features
After some experimentation with the features chosen for modelling, we came up with the following list which we think will capture essential structural elements and allow for good predictions.
Molecular weight of the protein.
Aromaticity, ie the relative frequency of aromatic amino acids (Phenylalanine, Tryptophan and Tyrosine)
Instability index, ie the relative frequency of instability causing dipeptides, for more information see Guruprasad et al 1990. 17
Isoelectric point, which is the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge.
Alpha Helix fraction, the relative frequency of amino acids that tend to be in found in the secondary structure known as alpha helices.

Link
With Imperial College_London, we proceeded Kuas’s team survey and discussed about each team’s project. Imperial College_London were trying to develop a team communication app that allows every member of the team an equal opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns. Accordingly, to design their app and ensure its effectiveness, they needed help from the iGEM community on deciding the content of the app. Kuas teammates were deeply interested in team communication issues and had many discussions on similar topics before, so we were glad to deliver our thoughts about the team communication by conducting individual surveys on August 17th.
Also we provided feedback on their science communication guide, which helps scientists to tackle inconsistency problems in synthetic biology when it comes to sharing information with non-scientists and with the public. Providing feedback to their guide was a valuable experience, giving our Human Practice team the opportunity to learn attitudes to have when performing public engagements.
Since Korea and the United Kingdom are so far to have an actual meet-up, we have consistently been in contact through e-mail, Facebook, and online Skype. The first online meet-up was on August 18th through email. Imperial College were working on controlling bacterial gene expression on a 2D plane using electrical stimuli from electrode placed at specific coordinates. Their project was very intriguing and as same undergraduates, Kuas thought our team could provide feedback on their project and also get wet-lab advice and feedback on our project from Imperial College_London.
On September 5th, we did oral description about each project and actual feedback by videochat. Human practice member of Imperial College_London first asked about our project and gave advice, and KUAS also gave feedback on Imperial College_London’s project. On our concern about new variable in microbial system, Imperial College_London recommended the concept “pioneer” as a creator of nutrients. Also, like suggesting quorum sensing system which gave us fresh inspiration on detecting microorganism, Imperial College gave us good opinion on our overall project. We checked Imperial College_London’s project progress and provided some feedback. On the latter part of videochat, we talked about Imperial College_London’s team communication app & science communication guide and finished the collaboration. The collaboration with Imperial College_London was really inspiring and gave us valuable learnings.

Collaborations overview
The focus of iGEM is progress in research and the improvement of Biobricks to standardize biological parts for an easier application. To reach this ambitious goal and receive medals in the iGEM competition, teams must work together and establish solidarity and cooperation instead of rivality. The following text is an overview of our collaborations.
We asked team Bielefeld to help us with our first steps in iGEM. During our meeting they gave us a detailed instruction for the Gibson- and Biobrick-Assembly and many useful information about Sponsoring. Without their help we had not gained  such a good impression and we decided to finally sign up for iGEM. Read more!
Another important Team we cooperated with, was team Aachen . Like us they are working on a project with an optogenetic focus. We built a lightbox for the light-controlled induction of optogenetically controlled proteins for Team Aachen.  We already had a blueprint from our own lightbox therefore we were able to build an improved version which perfectly fits the requirements Aachen poses. So the box was ready to use for their testing phase. Read more!
We also received help from team Tübingen , as they sent us four yeast shuttle vectors. The vectors were not available from the iGEM HQ, but required for our project. We are thankful that we did not have to produce them ourselves, which enabled us to build and use our yeast constructs instantly. Read more!
OPTOPTOSIS also coordinated a Collaboration between eight german iGEM teams! For our postcard campaign we contacted all german iGEM teams and asked them to join us and create postcards showing and describing relevant topics of synthetic biology. They contain short descriptions so everyone can understand what synthetic biology is about. Most teams gave us a positive feedback and joined immediately.  After finishing the cards, we sent them to each other and distributed all cards on any events we organized like e.g. the NRW-Day. Read more!

[Fig 1] Biomarvel team member & KUAS_KOREA Team member
This year, team KUAS_Korea has been collaborating with team Biomarvel_Korea high school iGEM team. We shared our trials and errors KUAS_Korea have made in iGEM for past few years as well as general understandings in synthetic biology which could help them starting things up.
Biomarvel_Korea is a high school team, and this is their first year in iGEM. This time they are aiming for synthesizing GBP-ProG fusion protein for electrochemical biosensor, which detects heart failure with high accuracy, inexpensive cost and high sensitivity. It is such a brilliant project reflecting socio-contextual issues, so feel free to find more of them at their wiki.
Two teams, Kuas and Biomarvel have consistently communicated through e-mail and Facebook for collaboration. The first offline meet-up was held on August 10th, and at the moment both teams were still at the stage of setting basic concepts and principals of the project. We discussed each team’s projects and gave comments regarding the direction of the project and further points to elaborate. Listening from the outer perspective, especially from young active students was a truly helpful and intriguing experience.
Besides contents of the project itself, collaboration with Biomarvel_Korea was meaningful enough in the means of giving a real help to difficulties most of the iGEMers are facing. We went through some basic requirements for iGEM together such as project scheduling, wiki management, part submission and some other fulfilments for medal criteria, which can be often too overwhelming to manage all by themselves. This also actually helped us to look back and go through our own works and make sure that everything was properly managed to be reviewed and rewarded.
Overall, during the whole process of communication and content sharing, we gained valuable learnings on cooperation from their genuine thoughts and authenticity towards the project"

Overview
Most biochemical reactions rely on the enzyme. An enzyme system composed of various enzymes is needed to participate in the complex metabolic pathways. As a result, they tend to form a complex, significantly increasing the reaction efficiency by increasing enzyme-substrate contact. However, in applicational fields such as industry and environment, enzymes we directly use can not form a multi-enzyme complex on most occasions, so the reaction efficiency is not satisfactory.
This year, our project intends to achieve protein polymerization with the help of TAL effector, a DNA-binding protein, which can recognize specific nucleic acid sequences. With circular DNA, plasmid, as the connection medium, expressed proteins in the host can form a complex selectively, so that a variety of enzyme combinations can be used to complete different tasks. Compared to traditional methods, the advantages of the project lie in selective polymerization of proteins, and the ability to mediate polymerization between more proteins.
Enzyme polymerization: In prokaryotic cells, enzymes are freely dispersed. However, our fused protein can be effectively anchored and brought closer to each other. In this way, it can shorten the time for substrates to transport between each enzyme in the pathway, reduce the energy loss of substrate mobilization, and enhance the reaction efficiency.
Enzyme maximization: Because TAL’s recognition sites are fairly abundant and of little specificity, we will be more likely to find corresponding recognition sites on a plasmid. Since there might be more qualified sequences on a plasmid, one of our goals is to find as many of them as possible, so that more enzymes can be polymerized on the same plasmid. This provides us with multiple ways to utilize the element.
Enzyme polymerization plus maximization: As mentioned earlier, our project can achieve enzyme polymerization as well as maximization. Hence, we attempt to combine these two highlights in order to deliver greater value. Among all the enzymes involved in a metabolic pathway, we can factitiously combine several (three, four, five or even more) specific enzymes in order"

From this result, the time of trehalase reaction was not enough. Thus we decided to incubate for overnight.
Fig.4 TLC after trehalase reaction
4. Evaluation of trehalose production in Escherichia coli
Escherichia coli strain TOP10 was transformed with the vectors that constitutively express otsA and otsB by promoters with different strength (Table.). Transformants were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth medium (LB medium) containing 600 mM NaCl and 2% Glucose) at 150 rpm and 37 ℃  for 12 hours. The transformants were harvested and washed with phosphate buffered saline containing 600 mM NaCl and then, resuspended with ultra pure water. Trehalose was extracted by boiling the cell pellets at 95 ℃ for 5 min and cells were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 15 min.  The supernatant was concentrated by freeze-drying and used for TLC. 1 μL of each samples were spotted onto TLC plates and dried at room temperature. The TLC plates were developed in acetonitrile –water (7:3), dried and dipped into H 2 SO4-ethanol (5:95). The sugar spots were visualized by heating at 180 ℃ (Fig.5).
Fig.5 Flowchart of experiment
TLC
The spot of a transformant harboring otsBA under constitutive promoter Pmedium was almost the same height as the standard sample of trehalose. On the other hand,  the spot of a transformant harboring empty vector was not detected (Fig.6). This result suggested that trehalose was produced by our BioBrick part that express OtsB and OtsA in E. coli.

Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," GFP.
Prior to the measurement assay, BW27783 cells transformed with BBa_I0500 were plated and examined for fluorescence, both with and without the presence of inducer. The uninduced cells were not found to fluoresce, while the induced cells did fluoresce. The fluorescing cultures were used to make the frozen stock of BBa_I0500 which was used in the measurement assay. This indicates that our untransformed BW27783 should not fluoresce without the presence of inducer. Furthermore, the untransformed BW27783 cells used in the measurement assay were at no point prior to the assay exposed to arabinose.
To explain the fluorescence of the untransformed BW27783 in the measurement assay, it is speculated that our strain of BW27783 exhibits a rapid production of GFP in response to even low concentrations of inducer. Experimental error is also a likely source of inaccuracy in the data, although the qualitative features described were consistent across 3 trials of the experiment. Research into these results is still ongoing.
Determining The Factors Which Affect Perception of Synthetic Biology: A Multiple Regression Analysis
Despite synthetic biology's rapidly growing importance in a wide variety of fields including energy and health, it is still relatively unknown to the population at large. While some may have a vague notion of what synthetic biology is and its potential impact, most do not have anything to associate it with. In fact, some may even find the juxtaposition of artificial (synthetic) and natural (biology) confusing or contradictory. We at the iGEM University of Waterloo Human Practices team believe this represents a prime opportunity to help shape the public perception of synthetic biology and allay the fear and paranoia typically associated with the emergence of similar new fields of study. To do this effectively, we believe it's necessary to examine closely what factors or characteristics may affect a person's perception of synthetic biology. The purpose of this study, then, is to use statistical analysis, specifically regression modelling, to quantify these factors and their effect on perception. We created a survey to gather the data necessary for this analysis. It consists of three sections: first, background information to help identify the relevant factors for each respondent; next, a ""pop"" quiz designed to provide insight into the respondent's knowledge of synthetic biology; finally, a section that relates to the respondent's perception of synthetic biology and its uses.
The central question to be answered by this study is ""what makes somebody more likely to have a favourable or unfavourable opinion of synthetic biology?"" The purpose of this study is to determine the measurable effect of certain factors such as age and field of"

Gel purified dCas9 and ColE1 cassettes. 1 out of 4 dCas9 PCR's were successful, and 2 out of 4 colE1's were successful, all of which were Ashlee's. We attributed this to Emily's lack of cloning experience.
Sam prepared electrocompetent cells for use later on, and began process of primer design. Clay designed the synthetic leader sequence and finalized the program in MATLAB that optimizes GFPs at codon level.Met with Dr. Salis and decided to also optimize a GFP for slow insertion time, based on a model created by Iman Farasat.

Plasmid prepared the Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid, DH10B-PKD46, FTV-ptac-LacI-CmR plasmid, and NoHP_15A_Plmra_CmR plasmid containing RFP with a strong, unique promoter.  Stock of NoHP_15A_Pkmra_CmR and FTV_ptac_LacI_CmR for cryogenic storage was also made. Lambda Red Recombinase cassette was amplified using PCR Rescue and gel purified.
All constructs (variant GFPs in vector pFTV checked for enzyme restriction sites, enzymes picked to be used in the cloning process. gblocks designed using format: junk DNA- restriction site- CDS- restriction site- junk DNA. Sam designed rescue primers to be used for amplifying the gblocks. They will be expensive and we don't want to leave any chance of running out of stock once we have them. Primers for rescue PCR redesigned when it was realized that Clay accidentally truncated the GFPs by incorrectly copying the coding sequence of original superfolder GFP from its Ape file.

What I can do now is transferring araCpBad-CysE from the submission      vector (which is high copy) to a medium copy vector; it will be needed      when I have to characterize it (it seems light years far now). We choose      pSB3C5, digest it with E and P along with the PCR made to screen the      construct in pSB1C3.
I carry on with the ligation and transformation in DH5a, that the screening      with both EcoRI and PstI and BamHI and PstI confirms . And another Part goes to the stock box.
For M256I CysE, I decide to go on with 3 different approaches      at the same time: inserting M256I CysE after araCpBad in its vector (this approach worked with the WT version), making new overnight cultures from the failed 3A Method of the previous week (you never know) and making a mutagenesis PCR on the confirmed WT Composite Part. Ironically, the one that doesn’t fail the screening is the second one (the one I made with the least hope). LOL.      I make a PCR from the construct (in pSB1C3) with BioBrick primers  and digest with E and P, to insert it into pSB3C5 digested with the same      enzymes.
I also wanted to see if “HOPE” version of pBAD was functioning different from the E. coli's genome one so I started making duplicates of the constructs with the other version of the promoter. I also used this week for defining the best conditions and protocol for the characterization.
I did not start the week in the best way, because I won the “King of the lab” title already from Monday… But even if I made some mistakes at the beginning of the week I managed to create my two new constructs by the end of the week! Here it is the gel that confirms that I won my battle:
In the weekend I started the preparation of MOPS medium, that we are going to use in the next weeks to start to characterize our constructs; and I also began to make another new construct, K731600.
K731500 has been created. I use Andrea’s part K731300 and the lacOp part amplified by PCR from the gene we received from Genescript. It's hard to confirm it by electrophoresis since Andrea's and mine constructs differ by 0.15kbp.
Sequencing confirmed the correct mutation of both"

Conclusion
Without blue energy it is very likely that all peak oil based products become more expensive. The same is true for  for transportation that uses oil. This could lead to a decrease in movement around the globe for common people while the trend for the past few years was a more globalised world. Therefore people have to adapt to this new situation. This could lead to friction in society, a concerning development.  Also it is very likely that knowing there is a technology that could help solving the world's energy depletion problem but it isn’t aloud to use causes friction. This would not only lead to friction in society but also decrease trust in government. It could lead to the impression that the only thing that has to change for a sustainable society, is a signature from the government. The possibility that oil rich countries rise in power will probably to friction in society as well as"

-Nanodropped the miniprep product and determined the high DNA concentration  and purity in c1 for elastin and c4 for rAIP
-Transformed c1 and c4 DNA into T7 cells for eventual protein expression
-Ran PCR on the c1/c4 miniprep for gel extraction and hopefully sequencing tomorrow
Thursday, 6/30
- Ran colony PCR on 2 colonies from elastin 40x and and 2 from rAIP plates
Friday, 7/1
-Found out the T7 liquid cultures weren't inoculated
-Prepared 5-alpha elastin and rAIP for sequencing
Tuesday, 7/5
- Checked protein expression in elastin circular mRNA expressing T7 cells; took 1 mL of each colony's 50 mL liquid culture preinduction after 2 hours of growth at 37°C  and used 20 μL to measure OD600 at 100x dilution (colony 1 corresponded to 0.5 and colony 2 to 0.4). Induced remaining 49 mL with 49 μL of 1000x IPTG solution (40 mg/mL) and waited 2.5 hrs. In the meantime, centrifuged remaining 980 μL of the pre-induction samples, removed supernatant, and added 50 μL CellLytic buffer to pellet. Resuspended and froze to perform extraction for comparison together. After 2.5 hrs, tested 20 μL of each culture; found both to be 0.6. Used 833 μL of colony 1 and 667 μL of colony 2 to get equivalent cell concentration, centrifuged, added CellLytic, and performed small-scale protein extraction on both. Additionally solubilized the insoluble fraction. In addition, anticipating existence of product, performed same procedures at large scale for the remaining 48 mL of each culture. Froze the soluble and insoluble fractions.
Wednesday, 7/6
- Lysyl oxidase plate showed growth, ran colony PCR and gel electrophoresis to see band sizes (CG/EL/AL)
- Made liquid cultures
-Ran SDS-PAGE on 10 μL samples from the small scale extraction products for comparison. Used 20 μL of the ~40 μL made for each so as not to overfill the wells, and put in 10 μL of ladder on either"

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the dxCas9 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Nickel Affinity Chromatography. 12% SDS PAGE of dxCas9 (expected size 158.3kDa) Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 pre-induction, lane 3 whole lysate, lane 4 clarified lysate, lane 5 cell debris, lane 6  flow through, lane 7 wash 1, lane 8 wash 2, lane 9 elution 1, lane 10 elution 2, lane 11 elution 3, lane 12 elution 4, lane 13 elution 5, lane 14 elution 6.
The nickel chromatography was not completely successful, but improved significantly after an the concentration of imidazole in the binding buffer was reduced to 5mM. The dxCas9 did not completely bind to the nickel resin and was observed in the flowthrough and wash (lane 6-8). It is recommended to further optimize the nickel chromatography to further reduce losses, and reduce contaminating proteins due to non-specific binding to the nickel resin (lane 9-10). However for our purposes, the losses were tolerated, and only elution fractions 3 to 6 were pooled (lane 11-14). Additionally, a double band for dxCas9 is observed. The purification will be continued however, we will look deeper into this observation. Is this double band due to degradation, or some other interaction with the dxcas9? We are working with technicians on performing mass spectrometry.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html,"A and svp rom the Fussenegger lab are codon-optimized versions for expression in eukaryotic cell lines.
We transformed competent E. coli TOP10 with each plasmid to prepare plasmid DNA and perform a cotransformation of an E. coli Rosetta strain with both plasmids. Transformed cells which carry both plasmids should produce the blue pigment indigoidine.
Unfortunately, there were no blue colonies after the co-transformation. We repeated the experiment under various growth conditions; i.e. we used different incubation temperatures, light conditions, shaking and addition of ascorbic acid, which was reported to stabilize indigoidine in liquid cultures (Muller 2012).
Week 6
Indigoidine Production - bpsA
This week we repeated the co-transformation of both the E. coli Rosetta and the BAP1 strain with the bpsA (pMM64) and the svp (pMM65) plasmids. The E. coli BAP1 strain is a variant of E. coli BL21(DE3) and contains the sfp PPTase from B. subtilis 168 (Nakano 1992, Quadri 1998) and a T7-promoter, brought in using a genomic integration approach (Pfeifer 2001). The Pfeifer lab kindly supported us by sending the BAP1 strain.
After induction, liquid cultures of positive BAP1 transformants should turn blue.
Both strains still didn't turn blue when grown and induced on plate and in liquid culture, even after some days with different growth conditions. We continued with the validation of the pMM-plasmids.

Week 7
Indigoidine Production - bpsA
Since we couldn't observe indigoidine production using pMM64 and pMM65 in the previous two weeks we validated the pMM-plasmids using restriction digests.
The restriction digest of pMM65 was correct but pMM64 didn't show the expected bands on an agarose gel. We continued trying to amplify the bpsA and svp gene in a PCR screening.

Week 8
Indigoidine Production - bpsA
We performed PCR screenings of the pMM64 (bpsA) and pMM65 (svp) plasmid for validation.
The PCR screenings showed that the pMM-plasmids are correct. We designed primers to assemble our first pSB1C3 derived plasmid pKH1, which carries both the"

Results of Growth Curves
Growth in BG-11 + NH4Cl
      It was quickly found that 10-ß growth was limited in BG-11 due to one or more auxotrophies.  Upon contacting NEB tech support, it was confirmed that 10-ß cells are deficient in leucine synthesis.  Thus preventing them from growing in BG-11 that is not supplemented with this amino acid.  However, further testing with BG-11 and leucine indicated that 10-ß still could not grow significantly in this media.
      Testing was then done with other cell lines, in an attempt to find a cell line that was not inhibited by amino acid auxotrophies.  BL-21 cells were first used, with no luck.  NEB tech support was again contacted and asked for a cell line that was not deficient for any amino acid synthesis.  NEB recommended Express Iq cells, claiming that they were not auxotrophic and would be ideal for expression studies using the pTRC promoter.  Unfortunately, it was found that even Iq cells were not capable of significant growth in media lacking amino acid supplements.
Growth in BG-11 + Amino Acids
      Upon finding that none of the cell lines available to the team were capable of growing in BG-11 supplemented with ammonium chloride as the only nitrogen source, sources of amino acids were looked at.  The first of these sources was tryptone, a trypsin digest of casein providing all amino acids.  Our studies showed that a concentration of 0.5%  w/v tryptone produced our desired standard curve, with an average OD at 600 nm of 0.992 (n=2), 25 hours after inoculation with an overnight culture.  This experiment was done using 10-ß cells.  Readings on the contents of tryptone showed that it contained unacceptable amounts of sugars (Biotech Solabia Group).  This would interfere with our studies into the effects of adding glucose to our media.
      The next source of amino acids tested was casamino acids, another product of casein.  However, casaminos provide greater amounts of free amino acids and small peptides and do not contain notable quantities of sugars (BD Difco).  Our experiments produced the desired standard curve with a concentration of 0.25% w/v casaminos, in the case of 10-ß, and 0.20% w/v for Iq.

Discussion
The results of this proof of concept indicates that MAGE works in two of the MAGE compatible strains ΔmutS::beta-neoR and ΔmutS::GP35-neoR. More thorough experiments need to be done. The results suggest that the beta protein is a more effective recombinase for the type of oligo used in this experiment.

Also the sample drawing was performed at the same time, after one hour and after 16 hours, for better comparison with the previous experiment. The outcome of this experiment was checked by Plaque Assyas. Again the Dickinsons SP was used as a control. In all three ORI experiments the PREDCEL run seemed successful, but the most promising results could be achieved with the pSC101 ORI. So for further experiments this ORI variant was chosen.
As in this big experiment the dilutions fort he control (adding neither theophylline nor caffeine) have been missed in the plaque Assay it was repeated fort he p15A ORI and the pSC101 ORI for both sample time points.
Another PREDCEL run was conducted adding a number of different caffeine concentrations (0 �M, 500 �M, 200 �M, 100 �M, 50 �M, 30 �M, 10 �M, 5 �M) to find the threshold where we can detect how much caffeine is needed to be converted into theophylline to have an effect on the phage propagation (evidence for activity of CyP1A2).
Riboswitch and CYP1A2 testing: Next, we planned to use the HPLC to see how precisely we can detect theophylline and caffeine. So all necessary buffers and samples have been prepared.
Modeling
Equations for modeling the glucose concentration in PACE lagoon and in PALE lagoon were developed. The model that remains to be build can help finding the ideal glucose concentration in the medium. That means glucose concentration that are high enough to suppress the MPs before their induction, and low enough to allow for their induction.

AP_dark_Ppsp-EL222-BR
To ensure that gIII expression is only activated after phage infection, a new Promoter: Ppsp-EL222-BR was developed. This is necessary to prevent cells from becoming resistance
towards phage infection as a consequence of the continuous gIII expression. The psp-Promoter and pBLrep were combined based on the paper ""Negative selection and stringency modulation in phage-assisted continuous evolution"".
The tet-binding region of the psp-tet promoter was exchanged by the EL222 binding region, which should lead to a gIII expression only in the dark and after phage infection. The psp-promoter was amplyfied using AP_destructase_SD2-luxAb (Purification ID: 536) as template"

Goksel has every right to look optimistic! The experiment went according to plan
Experiment Recap
In summary, our team have attempted to transform E.coli with three BioBricks - BBa_J04450 (with plasmid pSB1AK3), BBa_I13522 (with plasmid pSB1AK3) and BBa_J04450 (with plasmid PSB1AT3). The cells were cultured on ampicillin-covered agar plates overnight after being treated with both the BioBrick DNA and the competence inducer calcium chloride. Only 10 colonies emerged on the ampicillin-covered plates - 2 cultures transformed with BioBrick BBa_I13522 and 8 cultures transformed with BioBrick BBa_J04450.
These cultures were then placed in some nutrient broth and left overnight to replicate and amplify the plasmid concentration. Today, we will process these cultures of cells by extracting and purifying the plasmid DNA - this will then be used in DNA electrophoresis to confirm that the DNA inherited by the ampicillin resistant bacteria are the BioBricks we inserted.
Observations
The above image shows the appearance of the 10 tubes after a night of incubation in the shaker. Tubes 1 and 2 showed yellow, translucent cultures, whereas tubes 3-10 showed red, translucent cultures. This is because tubes 1 and 2 contain E.coli transformed by the biobrick BBa_I13522 (with plasmid pSB1AK3) which encodes Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) whereas tubes 3-10 carry the BioBr"

Dissemination of science for High school students
&
Introductions about Botchan and IGem in University’s open campus
The team of Botchan have been making effort and work hard to disseminate science more easily based on university’s lesson.
From our experience, we consider what is most difficult in high school’s subject and what is most easily solution to disseminate science for high school students.
So, we had determined using the opportunity of open campus of Tokyo University of Science.
In building of lecture’s 1st floor, The team of Botchan had introduced about competition of Igem as well as what is biology included synthetic biology.
By the influence that Noda campus in Tokyo university of science has a Faculty of Science and Technology, and a Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Almost of the people had interested in the team of Botchan’s exhibition.
Also It was the great experience teaching someone.
Being as a result, Dissemination using a exhibition was successful. Also we expect next year’s open campus event.
Dissemination of science for parents and child using biological experiment.
The team of Botchan has been making effort and work hard to disseminate science more easily based on university’s lesson.
From our University’s lesson, The achievement of fate of Country’s advance from the dissemination of natural science, The team of Botchan determine to open the Science class in university.
This time, The team of Botchan’s purpose is making a scientific interest for children.
So, We have a lesson about what is DNA and it’s role in the body. Also, we want to show shape of DNA in real not a theoretical shape.
The team of Botchan and participants make an experiments of DNA extraction from Broccoli and view a genetically exchanged Escherichia coli experimentally.
Participants have a great interest in experiments and result.
Also, It can be a opportunity to make dream or interest in Scientific area.
For dissemination of science for everyone based on university’s lesson, we’ll never give up.
To make the world there’s no discrimination or barrier in scientific area, The team of Botchan works hard now on.

BioBrick-A-Bot: Sharing and Collaboration in Automated BioBrick Assembly
(New Approach to Human Practice in Synthetic Biology)
Ways to Facilitate Collaboration
BioBrick-A-Bot  is a prototype of a automated BioBrick DNA assembling robot (hereafter called ‘bot’). We have demonstrated with a proof-of-principle that it works. This is only the first step. Once this is done, other iGEM teams can build and customize their own, inexpensive bots. Collaboration is made extremely easy because of the 3 design philosophies below:  replicability, interchangeability and extensibility.
Replicability
The cost of building your own bots is about US $700. The Lego Parts are easily accessible. We will provide hardware construction instructions in a document form, so that iGEM teams can follow and build ALPHA and PHI modules. We will provide RobotC source codes to iGEM teams too.  So, It is easy to replicate BioBrick-A-Bot Model C that we show in the Proof-of-Principle Demo.
Interchangeability
Interchangeability is the next logical step to collaboration and sharing. We have shown a proof-of-principle that it is possible to build two different physical implementations of ALPHA module, with different geometric configuration and physical dimensions, and still run the same software. Hence various other iGEM teams are encourage to customize their own variants of the ALPHA modules. These ALPHA modules should work seamlessly with the software provided. iGEM teams are also encourage to check in new ALPHA implementation in the registry, so as to facilitate sharing and collaborations.
Extensibility
The next phase in collaboration is actually extensibility."
DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Repressor Section_-_-_TEXT.html," is clearly demonstrated that both of the repressors represses their respective promoters 100%. In addition to the run in the BioLector the DNA has also been sequenced. The sequencing data for the submitted BioBricks  showed no mutations in neither the promoter region nor the repressor, indicating that the lack of GFP signal is indeed a consequence of repression.
The difference in GFP expressions from Gifsy1 and Gifsy2 indicates that the pR1Gifsy1 promoter is stronger than the pR2Gifsy2. See Figure 8 and Figure 12.

Summary of Week 9: August 1 - August 7
In the ninth week we did a lot of internal re-organization to increase our overall efficiency in work. This involved re-organizing an internal wiki that we use for management of our available DNA as well as a log of transfections needed to be done. Lots of samples were FACS-ed, generating lots of results that we can make graphs out of. Many of our parts were successfully characterized.
August 7
21 FACS samples for rtTA-DD experiment and TRE:mKate. Preliminary results: Hef1a:eBFP2 did not show up. Added dox to the TRE:EBFP experiment. Also ""procured"" formaldehyde and BSA for immunostaining. Fixed and blocked cells for staining tomorrow. Also passed 4 plates of cells using new technique which should fix the clumping issue that is leading to non-uniform transfection efficiency. The key is to dilute cells to 4x10^5 and then add 0.5 mL to well, as opposed to adding a small concentrated amount of cells into well, then diluting. Inoculations of the EPHB2, EFNB1, and CXCR1-TEVs-GV16 were done a little late in the day, but will still be miniprepped after the morning meeting on Monday. Restriction mapping not started\- once SalI-HF is in the lab, will commence. Designed new primers for Notch engineering.
August 6
8 samples for FACS. Transfected TRE:EBFP2 experiment. Mariola had 40% transfection efficiency. Tyler's had around 10%. Ken's stuff had no fluorescence. Completed gel extraction, Gibson ligation, and transformation of the EPHB2, EPNB1, and CXCR1 ENTR vectors; inoculated duplicates of the ten LR reactions and the pDisplay-CCL5-MYC Gibson redo.

Experimental Results
In order to more accurately quantitate the effectiveness of the input part of the circuit, it was desirable to have an output that could be easily quantified by the equipment available at Genspace. Therefore we decided to put the LacZ gene under the control of Lux. This was the rationale behind the construction of BBa_K1799019  (biosensor 2 above)
Evaluation of BBa_K1799019 (3A-Assembled Lux + LacZ Device
A Beta-Galactosidase Assay (aka “Miller Assay”) was carried out as described by Marian Price-Carter from the Roth Lab at UCLA ( http://rothlab.ucdavis.edu/protocols/beta-galactosidase-3.html ).  Different concentrations of AHL were found to impact both cell growth profiles as well as Beta-Galactosidase activity levels.   We also found that constant exposure to high levels of AHL (1uM) through repeated 1:100 dilutions had                     no discernable impact on cell growth compared to negative controls (0uM), but had the unexpected effect of minimizing Beta-Galactosidase production – even relative to negative controls.  Indeed, we found the unit-step change in AHL concentration                     to be the salient factor in increased expression of Beta-Galactosidase.  By “unit-step” change, we mean making a 1:100 dilution from an overnight with no AHL into an LB solution with the appropriate antibiotics and a greater-than-zero                     AHL concentration.
The AHL concentrations reported here were determined based on initial attempts to find a concentration range where cell growth was neither substantially delayed nor was Beta-Galactosidase production only modestly increased.  Consistent with previous characterizations involving the Lux promoter (for example, see   http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0062:Experience  ), we found unit-step AHL concentrations of 0.1nM, 1nM and 10nM to span this range of interest.  A negative control with no AHL and a positive control maintained in 1uM AHL were also included for comparative purposes.
Overnights were first prepared in 0uM and 1uM AHL concentrations with appropriate antibiotics in LB media in a rotating incub"

Every member of our team has been trained about general lab safety and project design safety by our previous members. For example, the former leader and our advisors taught us how to run the experiment correctly and avoid mistakes.
Project design safety
For the safety of our team members, we designed the project to be as safe as possible. Because the core of our project is  allowing bacteria to commit suicide. Considering biosafety, firstly we selected Escherichia coli as the host cell when implementing the project. To avoid the number of pathogenicity, we limited its number under a specific range. Second, we selected the toxic protein which does no harm to human body. Third, in the process of implementation of the project we chose the RFP as a reporter gene which can be detected directly without adding any harmful reagents. At last, we even used inducible promoters to control the expression of toxin protein genes in gene circuits.
Lab Safety
Our team conducted research in a safety level 1/2 laboratory. The organisms we used, E. coli strain DH5α and E. coli Top 10 are suitable for the S1/2-safety laboratory we are working in. Besides, the plasmids we are using for transformation (pSB1C3, pKD46, pKD3, pSB3K3, pSB1K3, pSB4K5 for E. coli) are not harmful for humans.
See more in Notebook / Equipments & Materials
Because of the nature of our project,  contacting with microorganisms is inevitable. In order to avoid any harmful effects to each member of our team, all laboratory work was in accordance with the safety requirements for the laboratory. This includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:
① Eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited in the laboratory.
② Don’t deal with the wastes at random.
③ All experimenter must wear protective equipment such as gloves and Lab coat.
④ All equipments that came into contact with biological material (such as tips and glass glassware) must be autoclaved.
⑤ Store quick-burning, flammable materials in designated locations which are away from ignition sources for fire protection. And there is no accumulated clutter in the hallway, for our safety while accident happening.

GFP reporter plasmid miniprep
Today, Nida and I miniprepped 6 ml of GFP reporter cells, consolidating the equivalent of 2 minipreps into one column.  However, the yields and purities were pretty terrible, with yields of 7 and 11 ng/ul and purities that were much greater than 2.  This is likely to be caused by the fact that the cultures that we miniprepped were prepared by spiking 3 ml of LB/spec with 1 ml of saturated culture in an attempt to grow up a lot of culture in a short period of time.  There was likely a lot of cell lysis and general cell debris that hindered the miniprep, causing it to give such terrible yields.
We inoculated 12 more ml of culture for miniprepping tomorrow morning, since we are low on time.  This should hopefully give us enough culture to work with such that the miniprep will eventually give us the quantity/concentration of DNA required for transformation and/or plasmid library testing.

Calculate any generalized inverse of L and call it H wit coefficients \(h_{i,j}\). Then: $$ r_{i,j}= \ h_{i,j} + \ h_{j,j} - \ h_{i,j} - \ h_{j,i} $$
For the Moore-Penrose inverse of L, \(L^{+}\) with coefficients \(l^{+}_{i,j}\), we have [11]:
$$ r_{i,j}= \ l^{+}_{i,j} + \ l^{+}_{j,j} - \ 2 \ l^{+}_{i,j} $$
Thus, in this way it is possible to calculate the resistance between any two nodes of an electrical system. First, we represent the electrical system by a connected weighted graph and subsequently, we calculate the resistance matrix with the algorithm described above.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample."

Extra bases were added between the overhangs and the construct so that once the part was assembled into the plasmid, the XbaI and SpeI sites could be regenerated and the biobrick prefix and suffix restored. This construct (J23100-deGFP) with the overhangs was submitted to IDT for synthesis as a gBlock.

Implementation
The J23100-deGFP construct described above was Gibson assembled into a pSB1C3 plasmid using the NEB Hi-Fi assembly kit. To do this, pSB1C3 was digested with XbaI and SpeI to create a linearised plasmid backbone . The deGFP gBlock DNA was prepared according to the IDT protocol and assembled into the linear plasmid backbone according to the NEB Hi-Fi Protocol . The assembly mixture was then transformed into commercial DH5α cells and incubated on chloramphenicol plates overnight. Colonies which were green under UV light were picked and grown in 5 mL LB broth overnight before undergoing plasmid extraction . Successful insertion of the J23100-deGFP construct into pSB1C3 was confirmed through a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI followed by gel electrophoresis . Figure 2 shows that the insert was successfully inserted as the double digest resulted in two linear bands at ~2100 bp (linear plasmid) and ~800 bp (deGFP). The DNA samples were then sent for sequencing to ensure that the construct was correct. Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .

Finding new parts for Marchantia Polymorpha
One of the key aims for our project is to introduce Marchantia polymorpha to iGEM with a toolset that enables future teams to develop it further and capitalise on its benefits. So given the limited knowledge about its genetic makeup at present, we have sought to find possible inducible promoters in Marchantia that could be used for parts.
Method
To start off, we hypothesised that inducible promoters would be associated with responses to environmental cues or pressures and that, given their importance, related genetic motifs would be largely conserved in the evolution of land plants. So as Marchantia polymorpha is an early land plant [1] , we thought it was likely that many homologues to its genes could still be found in later plants and that these genes could be used to find promoters.
We reviewed research papers to create a shortlist of inducible plant promoters for which we might find homologues in the marchantia genome. We narrowed our search to promoters regulated under limiting supply of essential nutrients including nitrates, sulphates, phosphates (although light variation, circadian rhythm, metabolism and development related inducers were also considered initially). For the majority of our analyses, we selected Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism from which to identify target genes because of the quality of genetic information that is available for this plant. However, we also used genes from the following organisms where data was available: B. nigra, L. esculentum, B. napus, C. reinhardtii, G. max, N. plumbaginifolia, P. patens.
We identified a shortlist of 27 genes that might be regulated under limiting supply of nitrates, sulphates, and phosphates.
We obtained the peptide sequences for these genes from"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

What is your chassis organism?
USTC-Software is a software-developing team, we manipulate only codes instead of wet-lab things, hence there is no biohazard and bio-safety problem.
Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms, besides your chassis?
We won't do experiments in lab, because USTC-Software is a software team.
How will your project work?
Our software will be running on the computer.
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
Our project aims at helping biologists with their work by a software we designed, and won't use any bacteria or their plasmids.
How would your project be used in the real world?
USTC-Software is a software-developing team, we manipulate only codes instead of wet-lab things, hence there is no biohazard and bio-safety problem.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
As our project is a software, I think anyone who use it should read our guidebook. Moreover they should obey the rules of lab.

Collaboration
The Brown-Stanford iGEM team was involved in a number of collaborative efforts with iGEM teams this summer. Below we detail each of these projects.
CommunityBricks
At the Fifth International Meeting on Synthetic Biology, we began an intriguing conversation with some of the fellow iGEM teams we met. One of the key components of the competition each year is outreach and collaboration, both  within the synthetic biology community as well as with the larger public. These efforts remind us that science does  not happen in a vacuum and prod us to take action in incorporating others into our research and conversation. In  the past, many iGEM teams have reached out to their local community in the form of surveys and conversation catalysts. Some teams have even made use of the media and received publicity for synthetic biology through articles and  news reports.  These are important but unfortunately isolated efforts; there has not been much coordination between teams, of either tools or publicity.
This year, we hope to restructure the outreach component of iGEM to be more high-throughput. Instead of having  individual teams work strenuously to push for publicity in local areas, designing and redesigning new surveys and  activities each year, what if we could run Outreach like next-gen companies are running gene sequencing— in     massive parallel? Of course, iGEM teams are a little different from DNA sequencing machines.  To scale up our efforts, we need to incorporate more teams and get everyone working together.

The single chain Avidin (scAvidin) cells showed absolutely no A3C5 signal but a low Biotin-Atto488 background signal that could be caused by biotin-importers that transport biotin into the cells or the slow diffusion into the periplasm of E. coli. In contrast the BAP-Receptor also shows a high surface presentation as seen in the A3C5 signal of nearly 4000 for the ""high"" induced sample. The elevated biotin-Atto488 is unexpected but could be explained by the weakened and partly permeable out membrane that does not stop the small-molecule dye from entering the periplasm.
Discussion: The autotransporter is working and can present small protein cargos on the bacterial surface
The performed experiment confirm the functionality of the device including the tetracyclin repressed promoter, the secretion into the bacterial periplasm as well as the presentation of the protein cargon on the bacterial outer membrane. In agreement with the expectation the 62 kDa big scAvidin with its extremely strong fold is too big in size for the autotransporter and can not be presented on the bacterial surface. In contrast the smaller BAP-NanoLuc (19 kDa for the NanoLuc) or the eMA (15 kDa) both can be efficiently presented on the surface. The enzymatic biotinylation of the Biotin Acceptor Peptide (BAP) using recombinant BirA biotin ligase is well established but could not be show before the wiki freeze. In Summary the whole device works great but there seems to be a limitation concerning the size of proteindomains that can be presented with the EspP autotransporter. We are curious to see what future iGEM teams will use the EspP Autotransporter in the future.

Week 21 (October 16 - October 22)
Wetlab Summary
Began to wrap up wetlab with some final experiments. We have seen speed change in pre-induced cells, but we needed to go a little longer in the time course to see steady state. We also organized simultaneous induction for WM17_408-413 (K2333427-K2333432) as well as UMD parts to get IFFL data.
Week 22 (October 23 - October 25)
Wetlab Summary
We ran our last two experiments for this year: WM17_408-12 (K2333427-K2333431) and UMD01, 03, and 04. We discovered that pdt #3c does indeed work!

Dionysia Valkani
MSc. Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering, 4th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
My motivation for doing iGEM was primarily an interest in undertaking a challenging project in the interesting area of synthetic biology. iGEM involved a great deal of independent research, requiring initiative, self-motivation and a wide range of skills. I was confident from the beginning that this experience would be extremely exciting and valuable for both my studies and overall general development.
What did you work on during the project?
My main focus has been on the laboratory work, being involved in both designing and performing experiments. I was also part of the administration group, contributing in coordinating and project management tasks, and the team-building group, organizing team-development activities.

How were we informed by the survey and focus groups?
- Addressing the concern raised in our focus group that the possibilities presented about synthetic biology are ‘over-hyped’ we only gave examples of synthetic biology projects that have been successfully undertaken.
- Included discussion as to why we use antibiotic resistance genes (which in one session lead to a discussion of alternative selectable markers).
What did we improve for our second go?
The second time round added in an animation to show how restriction enzyme sites can be added to a fragment of DNA by PCR.

Sheffield iGEM Meet up
The Oxford iGEM team attended the meet up organised by the team at the University of Sheffield on Friday the 18th of July. The purpose of this visit was to continue building the relationships between teams that were started at the Oxford-based meet up in June. The team gave a short presentation on the project so far and had a great time getting to know the Sheffield, York, Kent and UEA-Norwich teams!
YSB 2.0
Glen, Phil and Andy were OxiGEM’s representatives at the YSB 2.0 meet up at the Wellcome Trust and UCL. We were very pleased to be asked to give a workshop to our fellow young synthetic biologists about the issues surrounding intellectual property and iGEM.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.
Figure 5: Template reaction
We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and"

The major differences between the results and our theoretical values was the later maximum GFP concentration and the difference between the measured maximum and the theoretical maximum for 9×10-9moles/dm-3 of miRNA. In order to delay the peak in GFP concentration the rate of RNA decay had to be decreased. We also introduced a term for GFP degradation, to account for the peak in fluorescence. We then tried to fit the data by changing the parameters with these ideas in mind. The new values for these parameters were:

We divided the biosynthetic demand per AA by 3600 to get the demand per AA in mg/gDCW/s. Next, we divided it by 3600 to get the values in mg/gDCW/s, since COMSOL Multiphysics commonly works with seconds instead of hours. To get the average demand of per AA we summed all the synthetic demand values per AA and divided them by the amount of amino acids registered (twenty). After that, to get from gDCW to cells divided the synthetic demand by the average dry cell weight per cell of 280 fg (18). This gets us the average AA demand per cell in mmol/cell/s. We multiply this by 1000 to get the value in mol/cell/s, but to get the total amount of AAs needed per cell we still have to multiply the current value by 20, since our current value is for a single average AA, giving:
Uptake of nutrients per cell, Unut,cell =4.22E-19 mol/cell/s
Table 3: Variables used to obtain various combinations of models to review the contribution of patch composition and seeding density to the total hydrogel patch.
To get results out of the model we take the measure that the MBEC for lysostaphin should be  reached at the latest moment at 12 hours after the bacteria are induced to produce lysostaphin.
We will determine the moment of reaching MBEC at the skin for lysostaphin for several thicknesses of hydrogels with varying seeding densities. Three thicknesses of hydrogel will be modelled, starting with the hydrogel with a nutrient layer of 1 mm, cell layer of 1,111 mm and a buffer layer of 1.8889 mm for a total of 4 mm hydrogel. Secondly, a hydrogel with nutrient layer of 1 mm, cell layer of 1.111 mm and buffer layer of 0.9445 (half of the original) for a total thickness of 3.056 mm. Lastly, the buffer layer will be completely removed. Only the cell layer and nutrient layer will be left for a thickness of 2.111 mm.
Moreover, for the three mentioned variants of hydrogel four seeding densities will be tested in steps of x10. The start will be at the amount of cells in OD = 0.01 which is 3 million per millilitre and we will end at 3 * 1010 cells per millilitre for which we definitely know we reach MBEC.

Students should learn that DNA and proteins are ordinary tools of biologists. The students have seen, by what means organisms are changed and what safety standards prevail in an S1 laboratory. In a final discussion students could ask about synthetic biology.
A second important area in Germany is the elder generation. Demographic trends in Germany go on towards an elder society. Traditional and often conservative thinking restricts the development and especially the exploration of new technologies. For this reason, the iGEM team of Darmstadt took part in a senior session of chemists in order to elucidate the elder generations about the new technologies. Often, the elder one has to face with fear of things, they do not even know. The team has tried to take the fear and tried an open and honest talk about opportunities and risks of synthetic biology. The enthusiasm of the team was also well received by the elderly.
Another aspect is mainly the industry, because they are interested in most cases for new technologies. The iGEM team from Darmstadt got the opportunity to present their project to an economic audience at the ACHEMA. It attended quickly that the questions about the project were very different. Even at the ACHEMA the team had to made persuasions to the company and also informs about the new technology of synthetic biology. Risk management plays a special role, as the technology is in contact to the product and further with the consumer.
Another area in which it should be informed and discussed is the scientific field itself. The CAS Conference - Synthetic Biology offered a good place especially for discussion about pros and contras of Synthetic Biology. Here got the team from Darmstadt the opportunity to present their project to a consortium of scientists. Discussions quickly immersed themselves in tiny scientific details
Probably the most important section are people from everyday life. To achieve these people, the iGEM team had organized an interactive panel discussion. Here were the residents of Darmstadt informed about the project and of course biotechnology and also Synthetic Biology. Guests were able to actively participate in the discussion and remained a few hours even after the end. At the event day, that has been initiated by the eleven German iGEM teams in Berlin, the team was able to take part at an ""Umweltbörse"". This gave the team an excellent opportunity to address the people on the street to interest in the project. Since the project of the iGEM team dealing with environment and recycling, it fits well in this event day of the city of Darmstadt. It's a long way for synthetic biology to be accepted as normal technology in Germany"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Contributions_-_-_TEXT.html," in discussions and workshops. We did this during the iGEM Eurasian meetup by discussing bioethics with the attendees. We designed this workshop with the active involvement of bioethicist Virgil Rerimassie and the tool he co-developed: the iGEMers guide to the future , frame reflection tool.  We would like to share how to develop a workshop like this with the iGEM community, so that teams of the future can use this guide to further develop awareness of bioethics. Are you interested in the experiences of the workshop we organized? Please visit our education and public outreach page .
We will discuss first how to set the goals of a workshop, then the general set-up, followed by the materials and people needed and finally do some suggestions on documenting the event. In each case, we will first present the general principles we followed, and then give an example based on our experience duirng the iGEM EurAsian meetup in a dropdown.
1. Set your goals
Setting up the workshop starts with asking yourself some questions:
What is the goal of the workshop?
What is your starting position?
What is the end position you want to reach?
What are the conditions/factors/variables to account for that will effect getting to the desired end position?
When answering these questions, make sure they connect to each other logically! Also make sure that the goal you are setting is realistic given your setting. If  you for example have a workshop time of one hour, it might be a bit much to ask people to come up with complete answers to questions they had not yet thought about.
Example: setting the goals of the iGEM EurAsian meetup bioethics workshop.
Goal
We aimed to increase the awareness of bioethics in the participants and to trigger reflection on the bioethical questions of their own projects.
Starting position
Participants from iGEM teams with ages between 15-28 and very different cultural backgrounds.
Ending position
Each participant has started to ask bioethical questions concerning their own project.
Conditions/factors/variables to account for that will effect getting to the desired end position:
a limited time of 90 minutes
a large number of attendees (120)
2. Make a set-up
When you have set your goals and determined the variables you need to take into account, you can start setting up the workshop itself. Decisions that need to be made are:
How many topic(s) do you want to cover?
What topic(s) are you going to discuss?
How are you going to introduce the topic(s)?
Do you want a plenary discussion, discussion"
SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," although the concerns by the international community are rising, there is still few efficient way to cure such problems.
Though many contributing causes of hearing problems [3] have been identified and new therapies (e.g. electrical devices, medication) keep coming up year after year, the majority of people with hearing impairment still cannot be cured (Here, “cure” means “one can have similar level of hearing ability to common ones”) due to these limitations:
Hearing-aids: Long-term risk (amplified sound may induce greater damage to inner structures).
Cochlear implant: Only for patients with neural residue; high cost; long-term risk (damage for different hearing frequency range, especially for frequency below 1000Hz)
Medication: Normally use traditional Chinese medicine; long treatment cycle; unclear mechanisms; less effects, only used for short-period hearing loss.
Operation: Not recommended. Less effects; high risk; high cost; potential to cause sequela.
Thus, we started to think that we can use genetic methods to change mini-structures on ear cells to see whether there may be effects expected to shade light on several kinds of hearing problems in future.
Objectives
Our Human Practice plan set out 3 central objectives:
Improve awareness and understanding of Hearing loss
We educated people with synthetic biology concepts in a multi-dimensional manner. We are well aware of that education is the only way for us to try to change the life for children living in hunger and poverty. We taught pupils and middle school students in rural areas about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. We hope our teaser of the world well beyond the boundaries of China may give them the power and vision to fight for a better life.
Our team member Zhenming Yu is teaching synthetic biology and iGEM to students in Liangshan, Sichuan.
We also gave lectures to high school students attending Summer Camp in SUSTech.
Investigate social reality of Hearing loss
After learning from many specialists, we designed and distributed questionnaires and booklets for investigation, spread, science popularization and call on awareness, which addressed the importance of our project.
More importantly, we tried to organize commonweal activities and cooperate with accessibility smartphone app developers to further improve our human practice.
Our collaboration with the developers of the accessibility app ""Deaflife""
Increase our own social reach and personal values
By organizing our Human Practice activities, we harvested new knowledge, which played crucial roles in improving ourselves as well as our project. Furthermore, we spare no effort enhancing the social awareness on the caring of people with hearing loss from different aspects. We hope that we"

Sense/Respond: Mentor Mike was finally back from vacation and the students were very excited to see him and update him on current progress. They discussed the plan moving forward and the layout of the rest of the summer. After half an hour, the students had a general idea of the ""end goal"". They discussed the DNA sequencing that had just come in and were like described. Afterwards the students continued working on collaboration and organizing wiki pages.
Packaging: The six liquid culture samples were taken out of the incubator and 3ml from each tube was miniprepped for four restriction digests. The Nanodrop was used to check the concentration of DNA in each sample. After the digests were performed using Nco1, Kpn1, HindII, and Nco1 and HindIII, a gel was run to analyze the results. The results obtained were unexpected, but several samples, 14 and 32, were chosen as likely candidates.

Packaging: In the morning, the entire iGEM team met with mentors at RH to discuss the projects and Wiki. At the lab, the RXers miniprepped samples 14 and 32 of NEB 5-alpha/ pJAAM1. Later, restriction digests with Nco1, Kpn1, HindII, and Nco1 and HindII were performed on the miniprepped samples. Lastly, cultures of NEB 5-alpha/pJAAM 1 were diluted and spread on LB agar with ampicillin plates.

Finally, BNGL offers easy integration with Virtual Cell , a graphical simulator of cell systems - ideal for outreach with the public and teaching.
Cpx Pathway Model
Due to the high complexity of the Cpx Pathway, it was necessary to graphically plot the processes taking place within the cell by hand, allowing us to then simplify and compartmentalize aspects which, while having an effect on the overall results, were of no interest to us. The above image shows the 3rd iteration of this, with colour-coded interactions, products and proteins. The main enzymes of interest were specifically named, while a general product labelled as 'denaturants' was listed to encompass the more than 100 other Cpx-mediated protein syntheses. This would be inaccurate, if not for the use of Rules-Based software, such as RuleBender - for the model to work, one must list the starting concentrations of each molecular species, hence by setting the 'denaturant' promoter concentration to be at least 100 times greater than that of pGFP or pCpxP, the relative interaction mechanics are preserved.
So far, the model is still only at version 0.3, due to the difficulty in confirming the vast number of reaction constants needed - unlike Physics or Chemistry, biological factors will frequently differ by orders of magnitude, dependent upon the conditions they were measured in etc. This is the main downside to using a rule-based approach, as our good friends Manchester and York point out in their modelling support videos. However, the model currently describes the behaviour of CpxP, CpxA, CpxR and the phosphorylation processes these use, as well as the effect of misfolded protein sub-units (caused by membrane stress) and the expected relative production of GFP versus other species produced via CpxR promotion. This should provide a workable, skeletal basis for characterisation of our first Bio-System as GFP concentration scales directly with fluorescence. As we take measurements, we will then feed this back into the model to fine tune it, and thus develop it further for characterisation of our second system . Beyond this, it is hoped the model source code can then be submitted as a beta-stream to the modelling database. It is otherwise available as a raw text document here for future teams to make use of and improve upon.
Advice on using the model
Firstly, it is important to bear in mind that the model is an alpha-version, and not fully optimised or debugged."

2. The bind between different ligands and GPCR will not impact signal transduction in pheromone pathway.
Based on these, the most significant work is to find out the RFP intensity corresponding to the standard sucrose.
Combining the experimental data, we made a simple calculation and got the RFP intensity of standard sweetness amounting to the fluorescence intensity induced by 750nM ideal ligand in our model.

We set a correction factor Kcorret=750  on calculation result. Then we reset the input according to following equation:
Then we prefered to predict different sweetness of sweetener. The sweetness data was obtained from previous study[7].  (Table 7．)

Discussion
After 22 hours, the peak of all curve were displayed as the pheromone model. And different sweetness also could induce different fluorescence intensity. But this model still need optimization in further, based on the following aspects:
(1) Through molecular simulation to discover the combination constant of sweetener binding process.
(2) The correct factor is to be considered the molecular weight, binding sites and combination numbers of the sweetener.
(3) Combine the protein expression and cells growth together. Consider the interaction between two models.
SUMMARY
Based on our models, we successfully got following results:
1. We simulated the structure of T1R2/T1R3 receptor and bound it with different sweeteners to observe the combining situation of different sweeteners through molecular docking.
2. We constructed the signal transduction model to simulate pheromone response pathway in two different levels and proved that our system could work as we expected.
3. We also provided an ideal relationship between RFP intensity and sweetness based on the wet lab data and our signal transduction model , which also demonstrated that our system could detect different range of sweetness.       Although sweeteners are various, but we still can taste all of them and sense different sweetness due to the powerful sweetness receptors, T1R"

It has been incredible to discover the sheer power of computational techniques; the programs that we use have the ability to model scenarios, screen drug molecules, and calculate various drug levels. iGEM helped me discover the beauty of combining different techniques to achieve a common goal. In the future, I hope to study medicine while still conducting research.

Now entering my senior year of high school at Canyon Crest Academy, I have been involved in iGEM since I was a sophomore. With a lifelong love of biology, mathematics, and helping others, I have found synthetic biology in general and the iGEM program in particular to act as an ideal medium by which to explore all of my interests, as well as to help advance knowledge in the scientific and medical fields. I have particularly enjoyed understanding the underlying reasoning patterns through which programs such as VMD and NAMD are able to accurately model inter- and intramolecular interactions.
Ariel Braunstein
I am a senior at Canyon Crest Academy. My existing passion for biology grew this summer through iGEM. I joined iGEM because it gave me the opportunity to learn both wet lab techniques, as well as to do research on subjects that interested us. iGEM also introduced me to the computational side of the biological sciences and the way that programs like NAMD (Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics) can be used in conjunction with traditional wet lab methods to do research. My experience with synthetic biology during the iGEM competition has led me to look for universities with synthetic biology programs for my undergraduate degree.
