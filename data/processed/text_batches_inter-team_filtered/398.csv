Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," more samples from Team Immobilization: check their labjournal. As well we went on with characterizing our laccases. ECOL was analyzed regarding its behavior in different concentrations of MeOH and acetonitrile. The activity was measured with concentrations of 2-16 µL, respectively. Since ABTS is changing it´s emission spectrum when being in contact with methanol we also detected the OD530. As expected ECOL is happier when only little MeOH is in its environment. We did the same measurements with acetonitrile and got the same result: the fewer acetonitrile, the better for ECOL. Again, we will hand over these results to Team Substrate Analytics.

Figure 6: Activity of BHAL measured via oxidized ABTS at OD530, showing activity in each fraction after prufication.
Also another measurement session started today. Team Cultivation lend their purified laccases from TTHL and BHAL produced with constitutive promoters to us. SO we rebuffered them and checked the activity with our standard protocol. And the results were good! In both cases we could detect activity in each fraction that Team Cultivation gave us (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). We are happy to have more laccases, but we are not sure, if we can pay enough attention to characterize them. We are trying our best, but BPUL and ECOL come first.

Succinate + Fumarate < Glucose?
J_exp28
I stumbled upon a few online studies that detailed pairing succinate and fumarate as  carbon sources for E. coli. Growth deficiency on succinate in our model, from my interpretation, has to do with the essentiality of two enzymes: succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase. Fumarate is derived from the breakdown of glucose in the glycolysis pathway, so replacing glucose with succinate results in a deficiency of fumarate in the cell. I assumed that these two enzymes, which are responsible for promoting microbial metabolism and play an essential role in the citric acid cycle, can not catalyze cell activity if both succinate and fumarate are not at sufficient levels. When I added fumarate as an additional energy source, the model did experience some level of growth, but the max biomass value was only 0.269648 in comparison to 0.454531 for glucose. Tom recommended that I look into the pathway taken by succinate in E. coli determine if any transport reactions have been overlooked in our model. On a side note, I found one study that redirected the metabolism of glucose to succinate, and detailed increased succinate yields from increasing the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and inactivating the glucose phosphoenolpyruvate- dependent phosphotransferase system. This resulted in increased ATP production and increased concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate for carboxylation. Inactivating the pflB gene, which encodes pyruvate formate lyase, was also associated with increased succinate yields. However, the primary goal of this particular study was to increase the production of succinate, so I’m not yet sure if these same steps can be taken to maximize growth in our model.

OptKnock comes knocking
J_exp30
While Laura continued running her double gene knockout code, Tom and Maggie mentioned a code called OptKnock. Optknock suggests a list of potential reaction knockouts to couple growth production with the production of a desired product, in our case max biomass and reduced flavodoxin, respectively. Biomass values will vary depending on the percent biolevel we set in our code (refer to 7/29 for more details). Laura and I spent some time reviewing a chapter on OptKnock to become more familiar with it’s structure and objectives. The goal of running this code is to provide another route for identifying potential"

The relevance of α5β1 integrin as a proangiogenic factor arises from some knock-out experiments. It is assumed that both fibronectin and aforementioned integrin directly regulate angiogenesis. Hence, it is reasonable to expect the α5β1 integrin to play an important role as a potent anticancer drug target. Additionally, recent studies suggested a key role for the α5β1  integrin in certain bacterial invasion of human host cells leading to antibiotic resistance. The bacteria exhibit on their surface proteins belong to the invasin family which are capable of selectively recognition of this integrins. These findings suggest that usage of bacteria containing the invasin outside of the cell membrane to targeting cancer cell is resonable idea.
Error proofing and disposing of the run down bacteria
During the course of planing we have given much thought to the issue of error proofing. When the project will be finalised we'll be dealing with a potentially dangerous microbe, capable of entering eukaryotic cells. This forced us develop a method of emergency killing the bacteria at any given time, a so called ""kill switch"". We chose to use a toxin/antitoxin system (MazF/MazE for example) in which both proteins are produced at equal levels. The antitoxin will be expressed from a promoter that is easily inhibited by small size particles capable of penetrating inside the cell. If at any moment we decide to terminate the treatment the introduction of such a particle to the blood stream will cause the bacterium to halt the production of the antitoxin thus effectively killing itself.
The other problem we have faced was what to do with the bacteria that have already completed their task. If such a bacterium finds itself absorbed by a white blood cell along with the apoptosomes it might start inducing apoptosis to its new host. Our solution to that problem was inspired by the Team Waterloo's 2008 project. The cytoplasmic operon could be supplemented with an additional endonucleolitic enzyme, one that would dispose of every unnecessary peace of DNA including bacteria's genome and previous operons. Such a vessel could only carry out the one final step (be it protein secretion or conjugation) over and over again until it depletes all its resources becoming eventually digested by either the host cell or along with the apoptotic remnants.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html,"presses the genes in the lytic cycle and maintains the lysogenic state. Moreover, this protein is autoregulated in a very special manner. CI dimerizes ( ) and binds into its own promoter (PRM) upregulating its own production. However, in high concentrations, CI represses its production maintaining it on an appropriate level. Dimerized CI represses a lytic cycle transcription factor Cro by binding to operator regions before PR. The lambda phage changes the state from lysogenic cycle to lytic cycle (i.e. lysogenic induction) when the host is exposed to DNA damaging factors, such as UV light. The damage activates the SOS response and the production of RecA protein involved in repair and maintenance of DNA. RecA has protease activity and it cleaves CI resulting in a drop of CI dimer concentration, derepression of Cro and lysogenic induction. Dodd et al. (2001) showed that the concentration of CI affects the capability for lysogenic induction. Thus, it is important that lambda phage maintains the CI concentration in specific frame in order to be able to switch to lytic cycle when the opportunity arises. High concentration leads to inability of lysogenic induction whereas low concentration results in too high induction sensitivity.
Lambda repressor protein CI is able to both upregulate and repress its own production.
The interaction of CI protein and lambda repressor promoters is well illustrated in the . The repressor region consists of two promoters, PRM and PR separated by common operator sites (OR 1, 2 and 3). The CI protein dimers bind to the DNA at these three operator sites. Johnson et al. (1979) showed that CI binds cooperatively on the three operator sites ( ). The OR1 has the highest affinity for the CI dimer which recruits another dimer to the OR2 site. This blocks the transcription of the PR promoter and activates the PRM to produce CI. Bell et al. (2000) suggested that these CI dimers at the two operator sites form a tetramer. Very similar interaction is observed between two of the three OL operator sites which are located 2,4kb away from OR operator. In addition, CI binds to OR3 and OL3 sites, but only in substantially higher CI concentrations (Johnson et al., 1979). This leads to the repression of the PRM promoter. Maurer et al.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Leveraging a Xenobiotics Approach against Bacterial Contamination

Microbes to Produce Tagatose

Using a Co-Culture Bioreactor Design
Focus 1: Background
After our team determined that we wanted to focus on problems in bio-production and manufacturing, we needed to do extensive research about problems and solutions and how we could innovate within existing parameters.
Why Does Our Project Matter?
We believe that as aware citizens of a global community, we have an obligation to help further progress with sustainable, renewable energy. However, we believe that resolving the economic differences between fossil fuels and green energy is key to opening the door for alternatives. Successfully leveraging the approach of xenobiotics will allow for the engineering of many currently limited resources, in which organisms serve as easily controlled, cost-effective centers of synthesis and manufacturing. Ultimately, we want to expand our project as a sustainable platform that is versatile and modular, meaning that it can produce a variety of substances when needed.
Challenges
Some of the biggest problems in bio-production that we wanted to solve included the following:
Bacterial Contamination
Even within the biofuel process, there is still concern for lack of overall efficiency. One of the primary concerns is microbial contamination. To deal with this issue, farmers often use expensive antibiotics, an option that leads to antibiotic resistance and ultimately, an ineffective product. Bacterial contamination often occurs because non-host organisms can also metabolize the glucose from the crops, eventually outcompeting the native strains. This also leads to additional costs in biofuel production.
Allocation of Resources
Because bio-production relies on crops as a starting point for production, farmers face a difficult choice between allocating the majority of their crops for fuel production vs for human consumption. This food vs. fuel debate is complicated by the world’s changing demographics: as the world’s population approaches 8 billion, farmers must decide if growing food consumption outweighs needs for energy consumption, or vice versa.
Guiding Questions
After determining the problems that we wanted to tackle, we set out to answer the following questions through our wet-lab work:

Protein purification using His-tag affinity (SDS-PAGE then Ni(II)/Co(II) column/nickel-chelated horseradish peroxidase? Or use Western Blot using antibodies selective for His-tag?)
Nanodrop at 200nm and 280nm to measure protein concentration in eluent
Assaying for DNase:
Culturing on DNase test agar (if secretion tag works, no need to purify protein) → visualize DNA hydrolysis either by i) HCl flooding to precipitate DNA out ii) using a dye such as toluidine blue
If we want to make use of the purified proteins - need to have a solution-based assay that can detect polymerized DNA vs hydrolysed DNA?
Assaying for antipseudomonas activity: the Chang paper used PAO1 as target (for DNAse, MccS):
Grow PAO1 in 150uL medium in 96-well, incubate 24h with peg lids → rinse pegs with PBS → immerse pegs in plate containing purified DNase → crystal violet staining (alternatively maybe can just grow biofilms at bottom of wells - harder to wash)
Grow PAO1 similarly, then immerse in culture of DNase-secreting E. coli
Crystal violet staining: stain, rinse, de-stain, measure absorbance at 575nm
Assaying for Art-175: basically incubate PA (the original Art-175 paper used PA14) with purified Art-175 (or supernatant since our Art-175 has secretion tag) and monitor OD at 600nm over time (refer to paper)
Without secretion tag - H# (MccS), P# (DNase)

We were applying a DNA template containing a HHR in front of the Malachite Green Aptamer, we analyzed cleavage by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis. We could identify the cleaved HHR-MGA RNA by high sensitive Sybr Gold staining.
Using our fluorescent tool box we can demonstrate again that substrate of RNA-cleaving DNAzyme causes problems during transcription. We can identify a slight decrease of Spinach fluorescence and increase in the Malachite Green signal. Thus this RNA yield of this transcription is low (Fig. 11A). As we were applying a DNA template containing a HHR in front of the Malachite Green Aptamer, we analyzed cleavage by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig 11B). We could identify the cleaved HHR-MGA RNA by high sensitive Sybr Gold staining.
Employing different Polymerases for Universal Setup Conditions
Fig. 12. Determination of the transcription efficiency of different polymerases.
A
We applied our Spinach/Malachitgreen setup to different RNA polymerase such as T7 Phi 2.5, T3, Sp6 and E. coli.
B
ATP consumption (ATP-AptamerJWAS1 Spinach fluorescence) and RNA synthesis (Malachite Green fluorescence) were measured in real time. ATP was fast consumed and RNA transcribed by T7 and T3 polymerases. SP6 shows activity as well. E. coli RNA polymerase was not showing any activity.
To overcome the dependence of the setup to apply a specific polymerase we designed new transcription templates containing different promoters for a subset of commercial available RNA polymerase such as T7 Phi 2.5, T3, Sp6 and E. coli (T7A1) (Fig. 12A). All polymerases have been tested for 12 hours at 37 °C and were measured in regular time intervals using TECAN Safire. The results show that the decrease of ATP AptamerJWAS1 Spinach2 activity is connected to the speed of the RNA polymerase. The data indicates that the reduction of ATP goes faster for T7 and T7Phi 2.5 than for the other candidates (Fig. 12B). Therefore the fluorescence of ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 decreases. The T3 polymerase is a little bit slower than the T7 RNA polymerase and does not reach"

LA_Biohackers,2014,Team:LA Biohackers#Practice and Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," molecules.14 Any group that seeks funding from the NIH must comply by these guidelines. Often, other funding sources  require compliance with these guidelines. Generally, the NIH Guidelines provide a sensible backdrop for any DIY organization.Here, the NIH defines recombinant and synthetic nucleic molecules as molecules that a) are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules, and b) can replicate in a living cell (i.e. recombinant nucleic acids); nucleic acid molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules, i.e., synthetic nucleic acids, or molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) or (ii) above.13
Six different categories of experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are recognized by the NIH Guidelines.13 These categories encompass experiments that: a) require Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approval, RAC review, and NIH Director approval before initiation; b) require NIH/OBA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation; c) require Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board approvals and RAC review before research participant enrollment; d) require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation; e) require Institutional Biosafety Committee notification simultaneous with initiation; and those that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines.13 Again, while compliance with these guidelines is mandatory only if the group receives NIH funding, these guidelines are often seen as the best current practice. Additionally, and more relevant to the aspiring community laboratory, four risk  groups are recognized by the NIH Guidelines.13 These risk groups then determine the appropriate biosafety level applied to the specific experiment. The biosafety level and risk assessment help determine the appropriate containment conditions and how organisms should be handled.
Risk Group 1 (RG1) agents are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans and correlate to a Biosafety Level of 1 (BSL-1). This group can include Escherichia coli and baculovirus. BSL-1 follows standard microbiological practices allows work to be done on open bench tops, suggests that standard microbiological practices are followed and suggests the posting of biohazard signs. Risk Group 2 (RG2) agents are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available. Agents in this group fall under a Biosafety Level of 2 (BSL-2), and may include adenovirus, all human and non-human primate blood contaminated specimens, and herpes simplex virus. BSL-2 suggests restricted lab access"

Colicins
Colicin G and Colicin H
Colicins are proteins produced by some strains of Escherichia coli that are lethal for related strains of E. coli. Colicins of strain CA46 (colicin G producer) and of strain CA58 (colicin H producer) should be the same, and indeed, the sensitivity patterns were nearly identical.
Only the triple mutant receptors fepA cir fiu was completely resistant to the colicins from these strains. (i) the production of colicin by colicinogenic E. coli cells is induced by SOS agents, as is seen with lysogenic phages, and is lethal for producing cells. (ii) the produced colicin is released into the medium late after synthesis (later shown not to be the case for all colicins). (iii) colicin kills sensitive cells according to single-hit kinetics. (iv) colicin is not active against the producing bacteria if there is presence of a specific antagonist protein called the immunity protein.
All colicins are organized into three domains, each corresponding to one step of colicin action:
The N-terminal domain is involved in translocation through the membrane.
The central domain is involved in binding to the receptor.
The C-terminal domain contains the active part.
The production of colicin by colicinogenic E. coli cells is induced by SOS agents. The produced colicin is released into the medium late after synthesis. And it kills sensitive cells according to single-hit kinetics, not being active against the producing bacteria if there is presence of a specific antagonist protein called the immunity protein, which is in our strains.
Escherichia coli strains CA46(pColG) and CA58(pColH) each apparently synthesized two generally similar bactericidal colicin proteins whose molecular weights were approximately 5 500 and 100 000. And indeed, the sensitivity patterns were nearly identical. They use the same receptor on sensitive cells, probably the outer membrane protein Fiu, as indicated by the partial resistance of fiu mutants of Escherichia coli to both active proteins.
The sequence of the colicin G and colicin H determinants have been deposited under the accession numbers AJ515251 and AJ515252, respectively, in the EMBL/GenBank database.

Model for Genetic Probability
This model describes the process in which we get 2 worm strains with stable genetic traits and the hybrid offspring. It was proposed at the beginning of our project to optimize our experimental design concerning how many worms we need to inject and how long it will take to make sure we get the expected result before iGEM Jamboree.
These 3 steps are considered in the model:
Inject plasmid (odr-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::mCherry and str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP) through miniMOS system.
Select the rescued worms using mCherry and GFP.
Mate the 2 strains to get the hybrid offspring of red fluorescence on AWA neuron and green fluorescence on AWB neuron.
Comparing the calculation and the experiment results, we demonstrate that the 2 strains that we finally get have the insertion gene on different chromosomes.

First is the E.coli that you ""kill"" using the chat by saying ""colicin"". The smelly bacteria follows, although I forgot to mention this in previous updates. Not that impressive...I just put a script in so the bacteria emits a colored smoke periodically (smells like pizza). Next is the GFP jellyfish/bacteria combo. I realized that the jellyfish from which the protein is isolated from looks nothing like the abomination I have created so I built an almost exact replica of Aequorea victoria and segregated them to an area. Then the Bioremediation Station (pretty good title, eh?) is next, and there's some unfinished stairs leading up to it.
why did I do it like this? well we don't want to confuse our visitors right off the bat. I figured ""antibiotics kill bacteria"" would be an easy enough to concept to grasp. Also once they know that different genes can do different things when expressed in bacteria (smelly), and they can be extracted from animals (jellyfish) then the bioremediation (an actual application) becomes easier to understand.
There was also a brief ethics meeting today. We all decided that it's best if we planned out the Second Life conference as soon as possible. Fahd and Emily are going to look up some ethics places in SL and listen to some talks to see how they are organized. We are also brainstorming about what people should be involved in our conference as speakers. We are hoping to get people like Andrew from DIY Biology and other important figures. Audience will also be important and other than SL residents we are hoping to invite some educators that we met along the way. Also,  now that we're helping TU Delft, I bet at least one person on their team would be willing to help us.

The linear model we constructed validates the linearity between the concentration of $H_2O_2$ and the fluorescence intensity divided by the OD value, which the $H_2O_2$ is in the interval from 0 to 2.5$mM$. And we also analyze the residuals of the model to ensure it works well. With this model, we can properly predict the output when the concentration of $H_2O_2$ is in certain interval.

The  BBa_K1976050 was made by performing a PCR on a product synthesized by IDT, using the primers M_RBS_DNAse_FW and suffix right.  Following that another PCR was performed using prefix right and suffix right and digesting it using EcoRI and PstI. Following that it was ligated into the backbone pSB1C3 which was digested the same way and dephosphorylated, using our standard protocol for the antarctic phosphatase. Following that using the standard T4 protocol, these fragments were ligated together. E. coli Top10 were then transformed with the ligated plasmid. Following that a colony PCR was performed to check for the proper band height.

OLS Canmore
To increase a feeling of unity and to create connections between communities in Alberta, our team decided to collaborate with the OLS Canmore high school team.
After first reaching out to their team, we arranged a Skype conference to discuss areas that we could potentially collaborate in. We eventually decided that our team could help out with Canmore’s lab work on their construct to test out a part they have had troubles with. More specifically, we will be helping to confirm that the cells contain the correct part by performing some gene sequencing. Our team will also be searching for enzyme production.
While our team does this, Canmore agreed to send out the survey that we mentioned before, in order to gain a wider range of responses from it. They will also be looking into the ethical and moral side of bacteria entering the body for us.
As a way to work together on our projects, we decided to create a Google doc between the two teams where we give each other feedback and ask questions about the two projects.  Learning from this advice and critique, and applying it will allow both teams to further their projects in a better way. For example, Canmore’s team asked for more specific details on how our team plans to administer the snake venom in our project. This question made us realize that when explaining our project, we need to specifically address the exact way that the venom will be applied in our construct in order for people outside of our team to understand. Their team also wondered whether snake venom had been used previously in a clinical setting for blood coagulation. Their curiosity for this led our team to research more into this matter. Ultimately, we found out that a team of researchers at Rice University in the US have created a new hydrogel infused with snake venom that is used for blood coagulation, but still has to go through years of testing before it will be approved to be used on humans(http://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-hydrogel-made-from-snake-venom-stops-bleeding-in-"

As previously mentioned, WWTPs are not legally required to treat water from pharmaceuticals [10]. This fact inspired us to propose a Work of Conduct. Extensive regulatory research, as well as discussions with experts within the field, resulted in the suggestion of a suitable Work of Conduct for the municipal and private WWTPs in Europe. This can be found here .
Business Plan
We believe our idea has promising potential to be moved into a business level. We want to plan our future by defining the team structure, market entry strategy, funding strategy and Lean Canvas .
Team
The team consists of 20 members from 11 nationalities and different academic backgrounds divided into five departments: fundraising and business development, research and development, communications and engagement, marketing and visibility, and information technology (Figure 8). To know more about us, visit our website: igem.se
Figure 8. iGEM Stockholm organogram.
Market Entry Strategy
We want to achieve profitable growth; thus, product marketing is utterly important. By using the Ansoff Growth matrix , we were able to select our market opportunities and establish relevant strategies. In our case, as a Business-to-Business (B2B) selling model, we are offering a new product in a new market, which means we are following a diversification strategy. This type of strategy requires both product and market development to create value for customers and build profitable relationships.
Following this marketing strategy and paying equal attention to both customers and competitors, we also designed an integrated marketing mix program to accomplish our objectives and establish strong positioning in our target markets.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," the safety form . Furthermore, our team participated in the 5th annual BioBrick workshop hosted by DTU BioBuilders. Here we participated in a lab safety course before entering their laboratories. Both of these lab safety courses gave us the necessary knowledge to work safely with GMO and handle waste appropriate, as well as the according procedures in case of an emergency.
In the lab, we worked with several potentially harmful chemical agents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethidium bromide, chloroform, phenol, Congo red, antibiotics, and autoclaved glycerol. These chemical agents were handled using gloves at all times, and whenever deemed necessary, handled in a fume hood. Gloves were worn when necessary, and clean lab coats were worn restrictedly in the laboratorial areas. To visualise bands in agarose gels, we used an UV board. UV rays are carcinogenic when exposure is frequent and prolonged. To reduce the amount of exposure, several precautions were made. Gloves, long sleeves and a facial screen were worn at all times, and the time spend at the UV board was kept at a minimum.
Public and Environmental Risk Assessment
The chassis organisms containing the system is meant to be contained in a device, which is incorporated into an urban environment. While this device would be a safely enclosed container, it still possess the risk of physical breakage from violent acts or environmental disturbances. For this reason, we consulted a plastics expert, who advised us to use the plastic known as Polycarbonate. This plastic is remarkably durable, with the ability to ward off most physical traumas. The plastics expert has estimated that such a container would last in an urban environment for at least 20 years, and most likely more than that. To illustrate the durability of the plastics, he notified us of several devices from the 1980s made of the same plastic, which still stand strong today.
One of the biggest concerns would be the release of GMOs into nature. While the GMOs used are not pathogenetic, they would be able to share the plasmids containing antibiotic resistance selectors to other bacteria, that might be pathogenic. Antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria complicates the treatment of an infected individual and could, in tragic cases, be the difference between life and death. However small the risk of this scenario might be, it should be addressed properly. Furthermore, antibiotic resistant E. Coli strains could outmatch some of their fellow E. Coli strains through natural selection. This could negatively affect the balance of nature, that we are aiming to restore with the development of"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

problems:
-A lot of plants do not have Nod factor receptors, as wild type Rhizobium infects only legumes, so we would have been restricted to legumes as well. Also there is specificity among different Nod factors and their receptors on the plants meaning that not every Nod box containing bacteria could infect every plant.
-In theory inserting a whole ""Nod box"" of genes into E. coli should enable E.coli to function in relation to the plant much in the same way as Rhizobium does, however we can not be sure of that, even though there is evidence that some genes in Rhizobium (NodD) have orthologues in E. coli (glmS).
-Plant accepts Rhizobium as a symbiont and expects to get something from it, therefore if we were to use Rhizobium as chassis we could leave the initial nitrogenase function intact, however there might be a problem using E. coli as it would not be capable of fixing nitrogen the plant might not accept its infection thread.
-Rhizobium forces plant to form nodule on the root, however ideally we would want to set up infection into the leaves. Maybe possibility to send vesicles through the xylem to the leaves, however vesicles would face problem of crossing plant cell wall.
Accumulation of HCO3− and packaging into the vesicles: CaA and carboxysome
A lot of cyanobacteria / algae, use specialised carboxysomes to accumulate HCO3− through a number of HCO3− transporters and carbon dioxide converting enzyme Carbonic anhydrase which performs interconversion of CO2 and HCO3−. Different genes in C. reinhardtii (cupA, cupB) act as transporters of CO2 and automatically convert it to HCO3−. There is a number of other transporters utilised by cyanobacteria, but these just transport HCO3−
and do not convert it to CO2, and therefore are not useful to us. Then a number of genes involved in carboxysome production would have to be included in the chassis as well. Also normal carboxysome in a cyanobacterium contains a number of other protein products to convert CO2, however these are not necessary as carbon fixation would be performed by the plant itself. Finally a CaA - carbonic anhydrase converting HCO"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html,". First, primers specially designed to anneal to the PxylA+RBS+comK region within B. subtilis were used to amplify and isolate the desired gene. This took multiple tries, but was eventually completed. It was discovered that the amplicon required an extension time of 3:00 minutes at 72 ° C in order to be successfully amplified, an unusually long period of time for a sequence of only ~840 base pairs. The PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and the gene was extracted using the EZNA Gel Extraction Kit by Promega. As mentioned previously, the objective was to place comK, including its xylose inducible promoter and RBS, into a Biobrick vector. This was made possible by excising the RFP gene from an RFP Generator Biobrick plasmid and replacing it with the comK gene. Both the vector and insert were digested with XbaI and PstI, and the product was cloned within Top10 E. coli. Our secondary objective was to remove the EcoI and SpeI cut sites contained within the open reading frame of the comK gene. Unfortunately, this could not be completed before the deadline.
However, we have successfully biobricked and sequenced the lacZ gene. It is on its way to Boston!
Desiccation and heat conditioning of B. subtilis spores
It was decided that the long term, freezing, and short term, refrigerating, storage B. subtilis spores should be subjected to complete desiccation, drying, and then  subjected to heating.  These heating conditions were designed to imitate conditions that  the spores might be subjected to while in the dignostic device.  Two temperatures were  chosen, 40 °C and 60 °C.  Because the device would be in very hot developing countries for what could be years hot, but still environmentally plausible, temperatures were tested.  As well, long and short term storage spores of spores that were made in the presence of xylose, either with xylose added when bacteria was added or xylose added  when SG x2 was added, to test if the desiccation and temperature treatments had any adverse  effects on spore regeneration.
The same method of desiccation as above was used and then the spore were either placed on a hot plate, for 40 °C, or in a water bath, for 60 °C, for 24  hours.  After the 24 hours the desiccated spores"

Overview
The device consists of a pen made of waterproof material, divided into three compartments, initially isolated one from each-other. Click on the images below to understand how it works.
The Chassis
Looking for a chassis that would resist the presence of ethanol, and specially of methanol, the simplest solution was to use yeast cells, largely employed in the production of biofuels, such as Saccharomyces cerevisae [6]. Our best choice would be a methylotrophic organism, that is, one that can use methanol as a carbon source [7]. Our chosen yeast, called Pichia pastoris, is a species of methylotrophic yeast, with its genome sequenced [11], that is commonly used in the production of recombinant proteins [8], mainly due to its growth characteristics, such as rapid growth rate and cell density, which make cell suspensions a paste-dense material [9]. It also posses methanol-responsive promoters, that could be part of a genetic circuit that would respond to the presence of methanol. In addition, P.pastoris cultures are able to grow in media with up to 10% of ethanol [10], which makes it a perfect candidate for our chassis.
Figure 1: Pichia pastoris, the methylotrophic yeast.
Molecular detection
In order to detect methanol in alcoholic drinks, we searched for P.pastoris promoters inducible by methanol, and preferably known to have well-established genetic recombination techniques.

Hide ODEs
We visualize these ODE's in the Simbiology Toolbox which results in the following diagram:
4.2 Cell B
The system of Cell B is also under control of the cI repressor and is activated similar as cell A. The activation by the temperature raise, leads to the production of LuxR. AHL of the medium can diffuse into the cell, binding LuxR and activating the next component of the circuit. This leads to the production of CheZ and PenI. CheZ is the protein responsible for cells to make a directed movement, governed by the repellent Leucine. PenI is a repressor which will shut down the last part of the circuit which was responsible for the production of RFP.
We can extract the following ODEs for Cell B from this sytem:

As such, it is no surprise that I thoroughly enjoy the sciences and any intellectual pursuit for that matter. The iGem program, which I have been affiliated with since my Junior year, has truly allowed me to branch out of the wet lab environment and apply what has been taught to me in school to both medicine and further understanding of the science. iGem truly exposed me to a new side of of bioengineering, and science itself for that matter, of the theoretical practices that can be played out in computational biology through programs such as VMD and NAMD, simulating the nuances behind molecular behavior. Going forward in my educational career, one that will ultimately end up with my being a physician, I would certainly like to continue applying and furthering the knowledge that I ascertained through my experience in iGem to enhance my scientific pursuits, both in practice and research.

I am a Senior at Canyon Crest Academy.  I’ve done many things in my life, including living on my own when I was 16 years old,  yet I found iGEM to be very inspiring.  It’s amazing to see so many people having a love for making everyone’s lives just a little bit better.  In this cynical world, iGEM is truly one good step forward for humanity.  Having the pleasure to work with and observe both the high school and graduate students has given me a lot to think about my future in Medical Science.

Conferences
Innovate Calgary Workshop
The Innovate Calgary workshop was held at the University of Lethbridge as part of the initial training for the South Venture Business Plan competition. This workshop was the first exposure to the business world for the members of Synbiologica Ltd. We were introduced to the basic components of a business plan, intellectual property protection, insurance, funding sources, investment and networking.
Accelerate SOUTH50
Accelerate SOUTH50 is an entrepreneur and technology event where founders, business leaders, start-up entrepreneurs, advisors, investors, mentors and students converge to expand and support the entrepreneurial eco-system in southern Alberta. This event was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Network of Southern Alberta (RINSA). We had the opportunity to learn about the different kinds of intellectual property and brand protection, how to develop and expand on our business plan using the Growth Wheel®. It was an excellent opportunity to network with technology focused businesses and investment groups.
Alberta Aboriginal Entrepreneur Youth Camp
Isaac Ward is an aboriginal student at the University of Lethbridge invited to the Alberta Aboriginal Youth Entrepreneur Camp (AAYEC).  It was an opportunity that would provide aboriginal youth and students aged 18-35 in the province of Alberta to learn about basics of starting a small business.  It was a weeklong camp that integrated intense business training provided by the Acadia Centre for Social and Business Entrepreneurship with integrated cultural practices provided by camp mentors and Elders that encouraged aboriginal students to explore the skills required to be a successful entrepreneur.  The camp was held at the Red Lodge Guest Ranch in Bowden, Alberta, and organized by the Alberta Indian Investment Corporation.  At the camp we learned about skills such as Team Building, research, marketing, business operations, financing and presentation skills were taught.  The camp gave Isaac the opportunity to really take time to focus on exploring the aspects of business while integrating the sustainable practices of his aboriginal heritage.  He was able to bring these skills back to the Synbiologica group and apply them towards developing our business plan.
GeekStarter Workshops
The Alberta Innovates Technology Futures GeekStarter Program provided us as well as the other entrepreneurial and collegiate iGEM teams in Alberta with workshops and guest speakers who have been involved in iGEM and specialize in specific areas of synthetic biology. We also had the opportunity to give practice presentations to previous iGEM judges before attending the iGEM competition. AITF has provided us with many valuable networking resources and skill development opportunities.

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#P&P intellectual property1_-_-_TEXT.html," lead a new, more imaginative line of thinking about intellectual property protection, and to move away from analyzing these issues within the traditional and deeply engrained innovation vs. access dichotomy.
Creating legal mechanisms to support this kind of innovative and flexible thinking about IP will be increasingly important to synthetic biology and to iGEM as the field grows increasingly complex and the dynamics between the many different interested parties continue to evolve. In order to successfully balance the demands of the public interest, investors, the environment, researchers, and inventors we will need to be more open minded when considering how to deal with IP in the future. It will not suffice to simply ask whether 'to patent or not to patent' and suppose that this is the extent of the available options.
A further issue which we believe needs to be addressed by a change in the law is the current incapacity of the law to provide protection for computer code and algorithms. This is an issue which extends far beyond iGEM. Counter-intuitively, the lack of protection for algorithms means that this information can justifiably be kept secret rather than being visible and accessible to the public and/or regulators. The danger of this situation was demonstrated only recently by Facebook's so called 'social experiment' during which the company controlled the newsfeed content of users in an attempt to manipulate their emotions. Jim Sheridan, a member of the Commons Media Select Committee, expressed his 'worries about the ability of Facebook and others to manipulate people's thoughts in politics or other areas', and stressed the need for legislation in this area.
Similarly, some form of protection for computer algorithms might allow models relevant to the iGEM competition (and to synthetic biology more broadly) to be shared in a similar way to BioBricks. Engineer Leroy Lim, responsible for some of the modeling aspect of the project, commented that it would have been highly useful to have models from previous years available at the beginning of the project. 'People would be far more likely to share their code and collaborate on this if we thought we'd get credit for our work...with companies it's even worse, there's no option but to keep your code to yourself because there's nothing else stopping competitors from taking everything you've developed and taking away your business'.
iGEM policy
Given its ever increasing prominence in the field of synthetic biology and its unavoidable influence on the future of the field, iGEM cannot remain neutral on the matter of intellectual property. In the words of iGEM start-up Morph Bioinformatics,
“iGEM must position itself and not only define its role in the world of biotech - but also how it sees"

NYU,2010,Team:NYU#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," so it is not viable to synthesize it via GeneArt (even though we still have all our basebucks) because of the much larger minimum order requirement. Instead, I broke the part down into three overlapping oligos and ordered them from IDT. The first oligo is just the first 60bp of the CDS. The second and third are the next 60bps (with 10bp overlap) but they are taken from the reverse complement of the sequence. I am currently writing a perl script to do this automatically and will post it as soon as I have it.
The second protocol I’m developing will help with maintaining stocks of biobricks. We are in full swing at the moment and keeping our stocks of soluble biobrick DNA is troublesome. Instead of using a good amount of each of our biobrick minipreps in an assembly, it may be possible to use a PCR product of the VerF/R2 primers and a biobrick template. That way we can just amplify the biobrick region from biobrick template and use the PCR product (with or without purification) directly in our assembly digestions and ligations. I just started the PCR cycle and will post results when I have them.

Also, researched potential sources for other “intrabodies,” stumbling on “Single Domain intracellular Antibodies: A Minimal Fragment for Direct In Vivo Selction of Antigen-specific Intrabodies”:  Further thought required on the applicability of intracellular single variable domain (IDab).
Russell:
N-ubiquitin biobricking transformation resulted in only one colony on the plate with 200uL of transformant. I inoculated it, but such a low efficiency may mean that it is a self-ligated plasmid (although self-ligation control resulted in no colonies).
pTEF:RBS assemblies from PCR amplicons resulted in many colonies. I inoculated 4 colonies and performed VerF/R PCR test to see if inserts are the expected size. Alongside this PCR I am making another 50uL stock of pCTCON backbone, so the cycle will be overnight and will run the gel tomorrow.

From Microbe to Biological Sensor
A Revealing Exhibition of Synthesis Biology
As has been done last year by precedent team, we held a three-day exhibition introducing applications of synthesis biology and allergen testing to the public. The exhibition also included direct details about iGEM program, fun interactive activities which provided kids a glimpse of the field of biology.
""How to Diagnose Allergen with Yeasts?"" Theme Exposition
In the exposition, we designed a brief speech in order of ""Approaching Cells"", ""Principles of Allergen"", ""An Overview of Synthesis Biology"" and ""Allergen Testing Master"" to guide kids from basically observing cells to understanding the procedure of allergen and our program's intention and designs. In order to make the exposition more entertaining, we also made an interactive illustration with pictures and videos extracted from prevalent Japanese animation ""Working Cells"".
""Real Cells"" Microscope Observation Experience
Kids involved in this section used microscopes under team members' instructions, viewed the making of mounts and observed structure of plant cell, animal cell and fungi.
""Bacteria DIY"" Colored Card
Being aware of basic knowledge of bacteria, kids were encouraged to tint blank bacteria patterns given to them according to their personal understanding and imagination. They were also asked to write down how they wished the bacteria they ""created"" was able to do. We wish that some of them could really realize those magic abilities via bacteria in the future.
DNA Modeling
After a short superficial lecture about DNA, kids handcrafted DNA helix 3D-model with colored cardboard under team's instructions. While having great fun, kids simultaneously twigged little about fundamental biological facts concerning DNA such as ""A is slicked with T while C is with G"", ""What does a helix structure look like"" and so on.
""Glowing Bacteria"" Fluorescent Painting
This section gained the most population all through the entire exhibition. Cooperated with Molecular Biology Laboratory of Tsinghua University, we used IPTG-induced fluorescent bacteria looked red, yellow and"

Fudan_China,2017,Team:Fudan China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," switching to another state. Furthermore, even if Inducer 1 disappears after the transient induction, this state is stable. By adding a reporter following either of the repressors, we can retrieve the information whether the inducer has ever existed. When using this device, both inducers are allowed to be customized to detect and memorize various events, such as DNA damage and quorum sensing7.
Figure 1 | A representative memory device using toggle switch.
Another type of transcriptional-level-based memory device was designed later in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which involves positive-feedback loops8, 9(Fig.2). This system is bistable as well. In one condition, Inducer 1 does not exist. As a result, Reporter 1 and Activator 2 cannot be transcribed by Promoter 1, making the positive-feedback loop untriggered. In another condition, Inducer 1 induces the sensor and transcribes Activator 2. Activator 2 then binds to Promoter 2, triggering the positive-feedback loop. After the trigger, Reporter 2 will be expressed sustainedly in the absence of Inducer 1. The information is thus stored. Similar to toggle switches, Inducer 1 can be customized. For example, positive-feedback loop was designed to memorize the existence of high pheromone levels in budding-yeast10.
Figure 2 | A representative memory device using positive-feedback loop.
Memory devices based on DNA level
Memory devices based on transcriptional level have two obvious disadvantages that information stored transmitting between two generations is not easy and that information will be lost after cell death. As a result, memory devices based on DNA level was developed, giving memory devices the ability to store information directly on DNA of chasis organisms. There are many types of devices in this category, respectively based on integrases(also known as recombinases) and CRISPR.
Memory devices using integrases was described in 20083(Fig.3). Integrases recombination systems can catalyze reactions including inversion(Fig.3 a), deletion(Fig.3 b) and integration(Fig.3 c) of DNA sequence at specific sites. When two recognition sites(attB/P for serine integrases) are in opposite direction, integrases inverses the DNA sequence between two sites, functioning like a switch. To make it become a true memory device, one inducer controls the expression of the integrase. After the transient induction, integrase is expressed and completes the inversion. We can acquire the stored information in multiple ways, such as PCR or sequencing."

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your"

We performed 5' dephosphorylation of a biobrick vector (previously digested with XbaI and SpeI) with CIAP ( Protocol 10 ) in order to test the reaction efficiency and compare with SAP protocol ( Protocol 9 ).
We did two ligation reactions, one using the phosphorylated vector (control) and another using the dephosphorylated ( Protocol 11 ).
We transformed the electrocompetent E. coli ( Protocol 3 ) with the ligations and plated in LB-AMP-KAN media.

Safety
Laboratory safety: All of our laboratory members have receieved safety training before. We must fill out the log sheet of the laboratory safety after the inspection tour.
Environmental safety: Firstly, we have evaluated the project feasibility and its relating security issue. In order to ensure that “Sirens” will work efficiently in the condition as we expect, we construct a photoinduced reverse promoter which can change direction to regulate the period of toxin release. In addition, a suicide switch designed for E. coli depending on quorum sensing so that after E.coli attracts and kills the nematodes, it will not spread into the environment. Also, we built a device which can restrict the spread of the"

The \(S\) Matrix
While \(G\) is precisely known, \(S\) needs to be optimized. In dosReis 2004, the optimized \(s_{ij}\)-values for S. cerevisiae are published, yielding the \(S\)-matrix,       $$           S =           \begin{pmatrix}               1 & 0 & 0 & 0.0001 \\               0 & 1 & 0 & 0.72 \\               0.32 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\               0 & 0.59 & 0 & 1           \end{pmatrix}       $$       where both rows and columns are ordered as A,C,G,T. Thus, the \(W_i\)'s computed from the \(SG\) multiplication are each influenced by two tGCN's. As an example, calculating the translatability of CCG will be equal to the dot product of the third row of \(S\) (because the third position is a G), and the sixth row of \(G\) (because the first two positions are CC):       $$           W_{CCG} = 0.32 \cdot \text{tGCN}_{CCA} + 1 \cdot \text{tGCN"

Science does not and should not exist in isolation. In the process of realizing our project, we had numerous conversations with both beta- and social scientists. These influences helped us reflect on the impact our project may have on society and made us more aware of the thoughts people might have on our project. We implemented every piece of advice both in our project design and our human practices work. Here, you can see what influenced us and to what these different influences led.

Description of Our Project
Motivation:
During every synthesis, biologists need to find the proper terminator,which is a tough work . If they can deal with the problem without manual work but electronics,  time will be saved a lot. We want to get the goal that when one inputs the sequence of their designed parts or the wanted terminator efficiency on their laptops,our program can immediately output the efficiency or the terminators .on the screen, which they can use directly in their productions. It will save plenty of time and work.
Background:
It is important that transcription is imperfectly terminated at some terminator so that the ratio of the amount of downstream of the terminator is controlled. That synthesis in biology needs not perfect termination but a property to pass. Up to now, biologists have built a approximated system which allows us to predict the terminator efficiency of a known-sequence terminator, and even design a terminator with wanted terminator efficiency.
What to do:
Our aim is to design a software----T.E.Q  which can achieve goals stated below:
The software contains a database of terminator efficiency. This database includes many sequences of terminator and its efficiency. All the sequences were collected by our team members.
If you enter a sequence of terminator, it can calculate the free energy and the efficiency of this sequence. Besides, it will also predict the structure of the sequence.

Semen
Introduction
For semen detection our main target ligand is the polyamine spermidine which is found in relatively high concentrations in seminal fluid (5-15 mM). Spermidine is made from another polyamine called putrescine and is the precursor of spermine.          Regulation of polyamine synthesis, degradation and transport is tightly controlled in bacteria. In E. coli, two of three identified transport systems are ABC transporters composed of a periplasmic binding protein, a pair of transmembrane proteins and a membrane protein possessing ATPase catalytic activity.          Out of these three components, we were interested in investigating the periplasmic binding protein PotD which specifically binds spermidine. The fact that this protein is responsible for transportation of spermidine and lacking in enzymatic activity meant that it was an ideal candidate for use in FluID for semen detection.
Figure 1 - Crystal structure of PotD in complex with its ligand spermidine. PotD (blue) is a binding protein specific to spermidine (red) which is a polyamine found in semen.
As with the other binding proteins, our aim was to overexpress this protein in E. coli, purify it and attach to it carboxylate-modified fluorescent microspheres.
Results
The gene encoding PotD was amplified from E. coli MG1655 and cloned into both the biobrick vector ( BBa_K1590009 ) pSB1C3 and the high expression vector pQE80-L. The pQE80-L vector allows for inducible expression of our target proteins along with an N-terminal poly histidine tag.
Figure 2. Characterisation of PotD. Single colonies of MC1061 E. coli containing pQE80-L encoding PotD were used to inoculate 5ml of fresh LB growth medium supplemented with ampicillin. Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, one was induced with 1mM IPTG and one was left uninduced as a control. They were left to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1ml sample was taken and the cells pelleted. The cells were resuspended in 100µl of Laemmli buffer"

Week 1
The first week of work was an exciting time for the NRP UEA iGEM team as we officially started our iGEM project! We spent the week largely focusing on planning out our project and taking part in some human practices activities before we can officially begin lab work. We were able to take part in the University of East Anglia School of BIO Colloquium, have talks on our project from PhD students working on similar topics, visit a fellow iGEM team and take part in a radio interview.
Day 1 (09/07/12)
Today the University of East Anglia School of Biological Sciences hosted its annual colloquium, an event where members of faculty gather together to discuss news over the year, give talks on their research and present posters. We were able to listen to many great talks on the research that has been going on in UEA and view the posters on display, where we were able to find out which researchers in the school were looking into nitric oxide and other topics relevant to our project, with a view to working with them in the future. We also spoke to representatives from Bioline, Qiagen, Fisher Science and Star Labs about the products they sold which we would likely require later on in the"

Biofilm-related problems are well known in medicine, with Cystic Fibrosis being the first known biofilm-associated medical condition. Besides foreign implants, there is also a need for an effective biofilm treatment for diabetic foot ulcers. Biofilm is assumed to be responsible for chronic wound infections, leading to open wounds that can’t manage to heal sufficiently by themselves.
He also told us that there is a lot of ongoing research revolving around biofilm removing substances, but none of those substances have been implemented at St. Olavs Hospital. Large biotech companies are being reluctant in developing new antibiotics due to bacteria in biofilms developing resistance in a commercially short period of time. This makes finding an alternative method for biofilm removal an even more important and urgent task.
Eivind was also kind enough to provide us with some insight regarding our project. He told us that the bacterium known to be responsible for most infectional problems is pseudomonas and that a biofilm removing method has to be compatible with this bacterium. In addition a potential bacteriophage treatment has to be minimally invasive in microflora composition. There has been done research suggesting that many medical conditions are a result of faulty microflora composition, and if this is indeed the case then a disturbance in its composition might do more harm than good. We believe that if our method is adapted to pseudomonas this shouldn’t be a problem as pseudomonas is a pathogenic bacteria that is, with the exception of the gastrointestinal tract essential, unessential to our microflora.

Conclusion for Integrated HP
A new area of application is avoiding biofilm formation in the production chain in the production of seafood and therefore also in other areas of food production.
Key insight
It is a challenge to avoid biofilm in every part of the production chain. Biofilm usually do not grow on smooth surfaces, and this makes it harder to prevent and remove.
At the production site there is always high humidity levels which can lead to an increased risk of bacterial growth.
In the seafood industry the main enemy is the Listeria bacteria. There is some future concerns about the bacteria developing resistance against disinfectants that are"

Overview
S-Din (Search engine and Design platform for inspiration with Network analysis) is an integrated Search Engine and Design Platform, developed specifically for Synthetic Biology. Due to the exponential growth of published researches, many of them have never been fully exploited of their values. S-Din has been designed to integrate searching and designing seamlessly, finding exactly what users need and enabling users to edit simultaneously. What's more exciting about S-Din is that tree of words and various analyses were developed to inspire the user to generate a better idea. A simulation model was developed to help ensure the robustness of user’s design and wet-lab validation was conducted to validate its reliability. Our Github repo can be access from here .
Description
WHAT IS S-Din?
S-Din integrated Search Engine and Design Platform was developed specifically for Synthetic Biology. With the power of our Algorithm, we provide a one-stop solution to start a project.

Safety
The aim of this project is to provide a software tool for wet-lab biologists to facilitate the process of choosing the appropriate parts to use in their experiments in minimum amount of time and effort.  It is always challenging for wet-lab biologists to pick the right parts to make a working device that satisfies their demand, for solving this issue, our team decided to prepare a software that enables wet-lab biologists to easily pass their desired input and output to this software and observing the predicted pathways which are activated by the input and produce the requested output. Our software can also rank the DNA constructs based on the popularity of BioBricks and the frequency of their usage. By this way, our software proposes a method which can be utilized in pre-experimental step as a supporter DNA design tool.
Safety is always a concern in synthetic biology, computer applications and virtualizing techniques tries to reduce the threat of non-predictable events.  We can safely say that ""we are as safe as the Parts Registry database."" We do not use any information or part that is not already available in the parts registry database. Whatever new ""constructs/devices"" Mining for BioBricks (M4B) software generates can also be generated manually by browsing the parts registry. We do not build or test these devices and provide purely ""information"" to biologists. The Mining for BioBricks (M4B) software we are developing is only intended to use for research purposes and no clinical or military application is supported by METU-BIN Team.

Cloning of the toxin MazF in E. coli
The cloning of the toxin MazF in E. coli itself was tricky. Even though the MazF itself worked, it didn't grow well, and after retransformation we got only six colonies to pick (right picture above). This shows that this Biobrick is probably functional and is a problem for E. coli to handle even without promoter.
The 3A assembly with the promoter did not work at all (left picture above). We yielded mostly just red colonies and the few that were white were wrong, never having the promoter with MazF. After many attempts with either the pSB1C3 or our own Bacillus vectors, we chose to directly transform the 3A assembly into Bacillus subtilis in hopes that it would cope better with the toxin and/or the promoter would be less leaky. This was too late to finish before Amsterdam unfortunately. But maybe the story will be told to an end at Boston.

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," We first chose E. coli because it is the most used chassis in the field of synthetic biology, with many publications available to guide us in the handling. Since we had in our group of supervisors a specialist in Pichia pastoris, we also decided to use this yeast as a vector. We thought that two different chassis would increase our chances to succeed and they offered different advantages too, depending on the experiment to conduct.
We also chose the linker protein domains. We picked CBM3a because of its specificity and affinity for cellulose. To link our molecules of interest, we wanted two different hooks to optimize the system versatility. We chose streptavidin for the conjugation of biotinylated biomolecules and an unnatural amino acid, 4-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF) to add inorganic molecules by click chemistry.
May 17th, 2018: A heroic subject
The determination of the three heads of our linker lead us to find a name for the project, Cerberus, in reference to the three-headed dog of the Greek mythology. We also started to think about a logo for our project.
We conducted researches about unnatural amino acids. Only one publication by Peter Schultz mentioned such a system for P. pastoris. We started a collaboration with the laboratory of Peter Schultz.
May 24th, 2018: A connected world
The wiki is open, our computerist attacks it immediately!
Social networks and communication between teams are important aspects of iGEM. Hence, we decided to create a platform for exchange and dissemination using Instagram. We thought that photos would make it easier to get into the everyday life of different teams, so we invited each team to post a picture a day for a week on an account we called: igem.teams.worldwide!
May 31st, 2018: Many things to do...
We went to ENSIACET to meet Philippe Serp and his team, they invited us to come and activate the graphene we needed for our project in their laboratory with their expertise. We scheduled this meeting for July.
The first drafts of our logo began to arrive, we voted to define the color. After thinking about it, our computer experts persuaded us to leave it in black and white so it won't interfere with the design of the wiki that we wanted to be very simple.
We received cellulose-producing strains from the Imperial iGEM team 2014 (Gluconacetobacter hansenii and Komagataeibacter rhaeticus). We kept in touch with Christelle Labruy"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," future.
When discussing the results with Dr. Schryvers, he recommended some changes to our protocol. One major change we considered was using a stock solution of 10% xylose to dilute our cells since previously we were unaware of the final concentration of xylose that was added to the cells. We will apply these changes to our future transformations.
Week 15: August 5 - August 8
We instituted the changes suggested by Dr. Schryvers to our existing protocol. However, cells did not seem to transform, as plenty of growth was observed on the plain agar plates, but nothing grew on the spectinomycin plates, suggesting that DNA was not uptaken by the cells. Similarly, none of the colonies expressed RFP. Thus, transformation continues to be a work in progress.
We borrowed a small amount of calcium nitrate from Dr. Wong, as it was the only reagent we were missing for making 2x SG media for sporulation of B. subtilis. We obtained the sporulation protocol and media recipe from OpenNetWire . We put the spores into the shaker for incubation over the weekend for the sporulation process to take place.
Week 16: August 11 - 15
We harvested the spores that grew over the weekend by spinning down small volumes in the benchtop centrifuge. They were then washed with cold nanopure water. Once we obtained these spores in 2mL tubes, half were designated for storage in the fridge (short-term, require weekly changes of water), and the other half were designated for long-term storage in the -20°C freezer.
We then researched different ways we could verify the presence of spores. These primarily compose of:  Researched ways to verify their presence Gram stain! But no reagents
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
Naturally competent bacteria take up foreign DNA when exposed to conditions of energy starvation (Hamoen, Venema, Kuipers & 2003) . Once taken up, foreign DNA is generally degraded into nucleotide constituents and used as an energy source (Hamoen, Venema, Kuipers & 2003) .  Because B. subtilis has an aggressive mechanism for doing so, we are interested in determining how much “buffering” DNA is required to protect the sequence we wish to recombine into the B. subtilis genome. (Khasanov et al) . determined that a minimal of 70 bp is required for homologous recombination to take place. Furthermore, it was determined that a linear relationship exists"

Piotr, Anita and Kyasha start work on modelling.
Clearly identify all steps of the output pathway and draw out the diagram. Start with the simplest case and build up from there.
Completion
It was recognised that modelling of output amplification model would be beneficial as model could give answer to how many amplification steps would be most effective in given context.
It was decided that other model to be done afterwards would involve modelling the activation of our ComD receptor and the disaply of proteins.
It was concluded that the amplification model except for transcription and translation was involving just enzymatic reactions.
Tried approaching the output amplification model using Michaelis-Menten kinetics as Kyasha had already some experience in doing that.
Decided to have a go on implementing the simple production equations in MatLab.

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users"
