Figure 10: The real optical part we built
The following picture shows our                                 details of optical part, which includes various splitters.

The                                 reflection light will project to detecting film , while the transmission beam splitter                                 will continue going to reflection mirror. 2) Then why do we need The 80%(R)/20%(T),                                 along with 10%(R)/90%(T)? Actually these combination is really important to decrease the                                 relatively high intensity reflected from reflector. Much higher intensity from reflector                                 will not fit the formation condition of interference pattern.                                 80%(R)/20%(T)+10%(R)/90%(T), approximately allowing 18% light approach reflector, are                                 combined together on the bottom of the picture.

Mechanical part
We use a kind of plastic called Acrylic to build our mechanical part--the BOX. Acrylic is                                 totally transparent while there is a piece of paper stuck on it. Our box was designed by                                 ourselves and it's processed by company from the website TAOBAO.

Oh, all parts should be fixed with hot-melt adhesive (hot glue), in order to maintain stability. The glue is tacky when hot, and solidifies in a few seconds to one minute. Hot melt adhesives can also be applied by dipping or spraying.

Gibson Assembly Protocol
Introduction
This is adapted from the protocol for Gibson Assembly using the Gibson Assembly® Cloning Kit (NEB).
Materials
Gibson Assembly Mastermix (NEB)
DNA Polymerases (for generating PCR products)
Recommended: Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, or Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix
ddH20
LB plates with appropriate antibiotic
Procedure
Set up the following reaction on ice:
Reaction volumes:
NEB recommends a total of 0.02–0.5 pmols of DNA fragments when 1 or 2 fragments are being assembled into a vector and 0.2–1.0 pmoles of DNA fragments when 4–6 fragments are being assembled. Efficiency of assembly decreases as the number or length of fragments increases. To calculate the number of pmols of each fragment for optimal assembly, based on fragment length and weight, we recommend using NEB's online tool, NEBioCalculator .

Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to, and prime, the PCR amplification of another leading to a new, chimeric 16S gene that is not indicative of any bacterial or archaeal species.
These reads must be removed to make sure that our data are accurate. This is done by VSEARCH, which stands for vectorized search. VSEARCH attempts to align the sequences to genomes. If half of the sequence matches a region from one genome, while the second half of the sequence matches a region from the genome of a different organism, the program knows that the sequence is chimeric and not a biologically distinct sequence.
Next, the non-chimeric, paired and filtered reads are matched against a database. The database matching step picks operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are represented by distinct 16S gene sequences, and compares them to a database to be taxonomically identified. There are three primary ways to pick OTUs. De-novo OTU picking matches 16S sequences together into OTUs without the use of any reference database; Open OTU picking matches 16S sequences to an open-sourced database like BLAST; and Closed OTU picking matches 16S sequences to a closed database like GreenGenes. The method we used is de-novo OTU picking, which does not use a reference database for OTU picking, and then compares the OTU’s to a database for identification. De-novo OTU picking is much slower than using a reference database to determine OTUs, but it provides a more wholly inclusive dataset. It is more inclusive because any 16S sequence not matched to a reference database in open and closed OTU picking are thrown out. Through de-novo OTU picking, the program does not throw out 16S data. The taxonomic assignment occurs in 7 steps, which are all wrapped by the pick_denovo_otus script provided by QIIME:
Pick OTUs based on sequence similarity within the reads (de-novo picking)
Pick a representative sequence for each OTU
Assign taxonomy to OTU representative sequences
Align OTU representative sequences
Filter the Alignment
Build a Phylogenetic Tree
Make the OTU table
Each step here gets us to the OTU table, which can be used for downstream analysis including chart creation and PICRUSt analysis.
Lastly we remove low confidence OTUs that are represented by less than 0.1% of the sequencing reads. This number is chosen because it is the predicted sample bleed-through on the illumina MiSeq machine, making it a cutoff for removal of low confidence OTUs.
Using QIIME we can"

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#flagellin_-_-_TEXT.html,"asts, $k_{ns}$ is the nucleation rate constant on display sites, and $C_s$ is the total concentration of display sites. Due to different conditions on the yeast surface and the lower mobility of monomers displayed there, there should be a minor difference between $k_n$ and $k_{ns}$. This difference can only be determined in experiments, but due to time constraints, we have not been able to conduct this experiment, so in our simulation we will take $k_n = k_{ns}$.
The above formulation has been used in many previous models (e.g. Wakabayashi et al. (1969), Michaels et al. (2014)). Kashchiev (2015) gave a more detailed theory of the nucleation process, but confirmed that the approximation in the above form is valid.
We shall next examine the elongation process. Asakura (1968) established that during elongation, the concentration of monomers follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics, where seeds (regardless of length) are seen as the enzyme and monomers are seen as the substrate. This process can be illustrated as follows
\[ \ce{monomer + seed <=>[K_m] monomer-seed ->[V] seed} \]
where $K_m$ is the dissociation constant of the $\text{monomer-seed}$ complex, and $V$ is the rate at which $\text{monomer-seed}$ transforms into a new $\text{seed}$ ready for further elongation. By rapid equilibrium approximation, $K_m$ can be taken as the Michaelis constant. This gives us
\[ \frac{\mathrm{d}C_m}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\frac{k_eC_nC_m}{K_m+C_m}-\frac{k_{es}C_{ns}C_m}{K_m+C_m}-s\frac{\mathrm{d}C_n}{\mathrm{d}t}-(s-1)\frac{\mathrm{d}C_{ns}}{\mathrm{d}t} \]
where $k_e$ and $k_{es}$ are the turnover numbers of the elongation process in the solution and on the yeast surface respectively, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant. By the same argument as above, we set $k_{es} = k_e$. The first two terms correspond to the decrease resulting from the elongation process, while the last two terms correspond to the nucleation process.
Putting the obtained equations together, we get

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#safety-b_-_-_TEXT.html," this BioBrick.
Potential pathogenicity
This BioBrick consists of three different parts: The first 224 amino acid residues come from the NpSopII gene from Natronomonas pharaonis, encoding a blue-light photon receptor with 15 residues removed at the C-terminal. The following 9 amino acids are a linker. The last part is HtrII fused with Tar from E. coli. The complex' first 125 amino acid residues come from HtrII and the remaining 279 from Tar ( 7 ). NpHtrII is thought to function in signal transduction and activation of microbial signalling cascades ( 8 ).
A single article has been written about haloarchaea in humans indicating that these played a role in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( 9 ), but there is no evidence that the genes this BioBrick is made from or any near homologs are involved in any disease processes, toxic products or invasion properties. They do not regulate the immune system in any way.
Environmental impact
The BioBrick does not produce a product that is secreted into the environment, nor is it’s gene product itself toxic. It would not produce anything that distrupt natural occurring symbiosis.
The BioBrick might increase a bacteria’s ability to find nutrients and as such ease its ability to replicate and spread in certain dark environments. On the other hand the BioBrick is very large and this will naturally slow down its replication rate. Generally we do not believe this BioBrick will make its host able to outcompete natural occurring bacteria, simply because it’s function is not something that will give its host a functional advantage.
Possible malign use
This BioBrick will not increase its hosts ability to survive in storage conditions, to be aerosoled, to be vaporized or create spores. None of its proteins regulate or affect the immune system or are pathogenic towards humans and animals.

As fellow scientists exploring the field of targeted evolution, we helped the iGEM-team Heidelberg by conducting an experiment for them, to validate their results in another lab. Our colleagues used three different mutagenesis plasmids (MPs) created by A. H. Badran et al. in 2015: #1, #2 and #3, as they are named by the iGEM team. The MPs build up on each other in accession of their respective numbers.
#1 increases the mutation-rate through arabinose induced expression of dnaQ926, an ineffective E. coli DNA Pol III proofreading domain.
#2 also contains the gene encoding Dam methylase under arabinose induction, as well as the gene seqA under low-level expression. Dam methylase is crucial in mismatch-repair in E. coli, as it methylates the parental strand in DNA replication, making it distinguishable from the new daughter strand. If Dam methylase is overexpressed, the daughter strand is methylated too quickly, which impairs the mismatch-repair mechanism. seqA encodes a protein that delays the function of Dam methylase, which solves some issues of the arabinose induced promoter being not completely tight.
#3 contains the additional genes ugi, cda1 and emrR. ugi encodes cytidine deaminase, which catalyzes cytosine to tyrosine transitions and therefore causes base substitutions in the host’s genome. This transition goes through a deoxyuracil intermediate, which may be excised by uracil-DNA glycosylase during the native uracil-excision pathway. cda1 is a natural inhibitor of uracil-DNA glycosylase and therefore acts synergistically with ugi. emrR is a gene repressor for a number of different multidrug resistance pumps. The exact mechanism is unknown"

ABSTRACT
In a parallel galaxy, there were two brothers named T1R2 and T1R3, they lived in a galaxy that was under the threat of sweet monsters who wanted to rule the galaxy. Though the brothers were born with the ability to eat these monsters, they were too weak to fight with so many enemies. To be stronger, they asked the battle creatures who lived in planet JB486 for help and sent their genes to a battle king SC84117 in the meantime. Driven by a mysterious force from the depths of the universe, the battle king, after adopting the gene T1R2/T1R3, lost its genes ste2, sst2 and far1. After integration with T1R2/T1R3 perfectly, something magical happened, a spaceship with a red ruler appeared. The battle king transformed into this spaceship which can eat sweet monsters, known as the Sugar Hunter. Since then, he travels all around the galaxy to fight sweet monsters and use the red ruler to measure them, the galaxy stays peaceful ever after.

Pour off the medium and store the open centrifuge tube on a stack of paper towels for 2 minutes. Use a vacuum aspirator to remove any drops of remaining medium adhering to the walls of the centrifuge tube or trapped in its neck.
Resuspend the cells gently in 20 ml of ice-cold Inoue transformation buffer.
Add 1.5 ml of DMSO. Mix the bacterial suspension by swirling and then store it in ice for 10 minutes.
Working quickly, dispense aliquots of the suspensions into chilled, sterile microcentrifuge tubes. Immediately snap-freeze the competent cells by immersing the tightly closed tubes in a bath of liquid nitrogen. Store the tubes at -70°C until needed.
When needed, remove a tube of competent cells from the -70°C freezer. Thaw the cells by holding the tube in the palm of the hand. Just as the cells thaw, transfer the tube to an ice bath. Store the cells on ice for 10 minutes.
Use a chilled, sterile pipette tip to transfer the competent cells to chilled, sterile 17 x 100-mm polypropylene tubes. Store the cells on ice.
Include all of the appropriate positive and negative controls.
Add the transforming DNA (up to 25 ng per 50 µl of competent cells) in a volume not exceeding 5% of that of the competent cells. Swirl the tubes gently several times to mix their contents. Set up at least two control tubes for each transformation experiment, including a tube of competent bacteria that receives a known amount of a standard preparation of superhelical plasmid DNA and a tube of cells that receives no plasmid DNA at all. Store the tubes on ice for 30 minutes.
Transfer the tubes to a rack placed in a preheated 42°C circulating water bath. Store the tubes in the rack for exactly 90 seconds. Do not shake the tubes.
Rapidly transfer the tubes to an ice bath. Allow the cells to cool for 1-2 minutes.
Add 800 µl of SOC medium to each tube. Warm the cultures to 37°C in a water bath, and then transfer the tubes to a shaking incubator set at 37°C. Incubate the cultures for 45 minutes to allow the bacteria to recover and to express the antibiotic resistance marker encoded by the plasmid.

Applied design - Filter
The Schematic diagram of the Filter
In order to make the decomposition process more effective, our team comes up with the idea about making a Filter via Bluepha capsule. The Filter will be divided into six parts:
An upper water tube which inflow the sewage into Blupha capsules
The first strainer that filtrate impurities which might physically destroy the Blupha capsule like solid particles, stringer, and soft colloid
Blupha capsules is PHA beads covered with E. coli that express laccase and form biofilm. In order to make a more stable structure, the Bluepha capsule will be arranged densely. As the sewage flow through the plant, Bluepha capsule would decompose the sewage efficiently
An outer tube that allows sewage to flow through the two strainers and Blupha capsules
A tube that would expel the degraded sewage out of the water-filter
A strainer that will hold the bacteria and prevent the bacteria from flowing out of the device
As sewage inflow the Filter through the upper water tube, the impurities in the sewage will be fil-trated by the strainer. Then the sewage without impurities would flow into the part with Bluepha capsule, so the dyes in sewage will be decomposed effectively.  After the decomposition, the sew-age without dyes will flow out of the Filter through the Filter. The flow velocity will be controlled by a flow control valve.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the fusion protein to load its components was demonstrated by EMSA, which closely followed by the integration assay ( Whitfield et al, 2008 ).
Experimental design: Trypsin resistance assay identified whether dxCas9 was able to load the designed sgRNA. Loaded dxCas9 undergoes a significant conformational shift causing the protein to become significantly more trypsin (protease) resistant compared to an apo-dxCas9 (non sgRNA loaded) protein ( Jiang et al, 2015 ). We visualized this resistance to trypsin by comparing the protein degradation ratio between loaded- and apo- dxCas9 on an SDS PAGE.
Electrophoretic mobility shift (binding) assay (EMSA) further identified the complex formation between fusion protein and EPO (BBa K2643004). A mobility shift occurs when binding of DNA to protein retards the movement of the DNA through the polyacrylamide gel, creating two distinct bands ( Sternberg et al, 2015 ). When the EPO coding sequence DNA formed a complex with loaded dxCas9, we observed a band shift in comparison to the unbound EPO on a 5% TBE native PAGE. With the same principle, we performed EMSA to verify the loading of DNA adapters on Tn5.
We performed EMSA to verify the loading of fusion protein with sgRNA, DNA adapters, and target EPO CDS. Next, we assessed the target specific integration using a sgRNA that was designed to guide the fusion protein to the position ~160bp of the EPO cDNA ( BBa_K2643004 ). The Tn5 portion of the fusion protein integrates DNA adapters at this position. This integration split EPO into two fragments of ~250bp and ~480bp. We performed two negative controls of targeted integration: without sgRNA and with only Tn5  protein in parallel. We PCR amplified the integration products with primers that annealed to the adapter DNA and the beginning (or end) of the EPO cDNA and visualized the product on a 5% TBE native PAGE. Finally, we sequence verified the two integration products to determine the exact position of integration. Figure 11 depicts this experimental design.
Figure 11. Experimental design of fusion protein in vitro integration assay. The fusion protein loads DNA adapter. The sgRNA directs the whole fusion protein to the target site (~200th bp of the EPO cDNA) and Tn5 performs the integration. Integration of DNA splits EPO cDNA into two fragments of ~248bp and ~486"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," work in the form of outreach and human practices as it's about the actual technology derived from our lab research. A summer of hard work culminated in the presentation we'll give at the iGEM Jamboree, which will be happening in Boston at the end of September.
What problem are we interested in?
Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health and is an issue in all partts of the world, and one of the ways through which bacteria confer themselves protection against antimicrobial drugs is the growing of biofilms. Biofilms, or ""bacterial slime"", are responsible for a whole host of medical, industrial and environmental problems that are very costly and technically challenging to remedy. The scale of the problem is huge, with up to 80% of all infections involving the formation of a biofilm. Some examples where biofilms pose especially big an issue are urinary tract infections (UTIs), catheter and implant infections, dental plaque formation as well as infections in cystic fibrosis patients. In industry and infrastructure, biofilms are also the main culprit behind the fouling of various plants and pipelines for aquaculture, water treatment, and food production.
Both antimicrobial resistance and the other problems associated with biofilm formation are big issues in their own right but are especially problematic when they're combined. The bacteria, already constantly evolving to afford themselves more innate resistance against antibiotics, produce biofilms as protective layers that shield them from the drugs even more comprehensively.
How are we proposing to solve the problem?
There is currently no commercial antibiotic that specifically targets bacterial biofilms, but researchers have identified a range of bacterially-derived biomolecules that degrade and destroy biofilms. As such, our project involves the engineering of bacterial strains to make them produce and secrete enzymes that can destroy the pathogenic bacteria and the biofilms they make. The beauty of the antibiofilm agents we plan to use is that they have been shown not to induce resistance in the target bacteria, meaning that having them continually produced at a low level will not be nearly as bad as with traditional antibiotics. Our system is applicable to a whole host of biofilm environments and with a simple design that can be used in multiple sectors, we hope to get a step further in providing a novel approach to treating microbial infections.
In terms of product formulation and design, we hope to ultimately arrive at a functional proof-of-concept e.g. an enzyme-secreting infection-clearing catheter or a modular system that continuously and cheaply cleans out pipelines, and to achieve that we have a 16-strong interdisciplinary team comprising 1 engineer, 2 physicists"
USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," thorough. Their strictness is understandable, biosafety is a very important issue, and the shipping of biological materials should be very carefully handled. But no matter how strict, they still cover a lot within these regulations - meaning that whatever biological material you wanna send, you are able to send it, you just need to fill out the corresponding paperwork. Brazil’s shipping regulations on biological materials, however, is very lacking in comparison. For example, rather than determining norms for shipping of infectious agents (like IATA does), Brazil’s Health Regulatory Agency ANVISA just bans shipping it completely. That didn’t stop us from shipping the registry DNA samples, but it hampers Brazilian research unimaginably. Also, shipping of ALL biological material in Brazil must be done under the name of Institutions, not individuals, which also added a world of unnecessary bureaucracy for us. For international shipments of goods from Brazil, senders are required to provide an NCM (Mercosul Common Number), a number ID that identifies which kind of product is being shipped. However, since Brazil shipping regulations don’t take biosafety regulation under consideration, the closest description of our DNA samples we could find was “Miscellaneous Unspecified Goods from Animal Sources” (despite our samples being from E coli). And we weren’t the only Brazilians facing these issue, either. We were communicating extensively with teams AQA_Unesp and Amazonas_Brazil when preparing our DNA samples, to try to help each other out with the loads of pointless bureaucracies.
Shipment instructions for future Brazilian teams
First of all, the shipment must be made under the name of an Institution, so you will need to provide a CNPJ (if your PI or someone you know has a CNPJ and are willing to send it for you, that works too). You will need a signed declaration (in Portuguese and English) that states the detailed description of the product (Exempt Biological Material: DNA (non-infectious, non-hazardous, non-regulated) and its purpose (research only), and stating that you are aware that your package will be submitted, without exception, to an X-ray machine, and that the submission to the X-ray machine will not compromise your shipment’s functionality (yes, we are aware of the contradiction of that sentence; the Federal Police, however, isn’t). The declaration will need to be printed in letterhead paper (“papel timbrado”). Your package will need to be sent through EMS, and will need to be identified with NCM 05119999 (“Miscellaneous Unspecified Goods from Animal Sources”. Yes, we realize the source of"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," NRPS modules by 4'-Phosphopanthetheinylation of the T-domain. Every NRPS module has to be activated by a 4'-Phosphopanthetheinyl-transferase (PPTase).  which transfers the 4'-Phosphopanthetheinyl moiety of Coenzyme A to a conserved serine  residue in the T-domain.
Besides these fundamental domains (C-domain, A-domain and T-domain), some NRPS modules incorporate additional domains enlarging the amount of potential catalytic reactions, such as cyclization, epimerization or oxidation of the amino acid [Reference].
For example, a single module of P. luminescens laumondii TT01 (DSM15139) contains an internal oxidation domain (Ox-domain) in its A-domain and a special TE-domain ( Figure 2a ). This enzyme first adenylates L-glutamine (A-domain), which is then attached to the T-domain. The TE-domain cleaves and catalyzes the cyclization of the substrate, which is further oxidized by the Ox-domain. The oxidation of two cyclic glutamines results in the formation of an insoluble small molecule ( Figure 2b )[Reference].
Figure 2: Exchange of the indC T-domain on a pSB1C3 derived expression plasmid       The indigoidine synthetase indC from P. luminescens consists of an adenylation domain with an internal oxidation domain, a thiolation domain and a thioesterase domain. We replaced the indC T-domain with T-domains of other NRPS modules (one of which is the indigoidine synthetase bpsA from S. lavendulae) and seven synthetic T-domains, which were customized to be introduced to indC, respectively.
The small molecule produced by the pathway described above is a blue-colored pigment called indigoidine. Accordingly, the catalytic NRPS is referred to as indigoidine synthetase or blue pigment synthetase encoded by various bacterial strains such as S. lavendulae subsp. lavendulae (ATCC11924) or P. luminescens (
). Previous publications showed that replacing the T-domain of the blue pigment synthetase bpsA from S. lavendulae with T-domains of other NRPS modules results in a loss of function, i.e. the engineered indigoidine synthetase does not produce the blue pigment (
). So far the only T-domain exchange that resulted in a functional b"

Hence the use of our Cas13b-APOBEC system could potentially restore the function of GLB1 in patients with this mutation, thus acting as potential therapy towards such genetic diseases.
As such, we designed a EGFP-GLB1 fusion protein to act as an alternative base editing reporter for potential testing  in a disease model in the future. Based on published work (ref) on GLB1 mutation genotyping in patients and its corresponding residual enzymatic activity (Table 1), we carried out site-directed mutagenesis on 319T->C, which lead to phenylalanine at amino acid 107 to be changed to leucine (TCT mutant), and on 1166T->C, which leads to leucine at amino acid 389 changed to proline (CCG mutant). These two single nucleotide substitutions are expected to results in total loss or minimal residual beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity.
Using colourimetric (X-gal, ONPG) or fluorescent (DDAOG) beta-galactosidase substrate, we can then check for the restoration of GLB1 enzymatic activity after base editing in transfected cells. A successful base repair by our Cas13b-APOBEC system would allow the conversion of a mutant GLB1 to a functional GLB1, thus leading to restoration of enzymatic function (Figure 2). At the same time, the EGFP reporter  can act as transfection/expression control for internal normalisation.
Figure 2. Schematic illustration of EGFP-GLB1 reporter. EGFP and GLB1 gene are separated by the linker which contains stop codon for eGFP and a Kazak sequence for GLB1 translation initiation. This ensured both proteins are expressed as their native size. Our APOBEC1-dCas13b base editor will change UCU to UUU for TCT mutant and changed CCG to CUG for CCG mutant to restore enzymatic activity.

We have also begun the process of optimizing the system to increase its sensitivity.  Our initial goal is to demonstrate that SeeDNA could be used to specifically detect a target sequence from restriction digested genomic DNA.  If this level of sensitivity and specificity can be achieved following further testing and optimisation, it would suggests that the SeeDNA diagnostics could work in a clinical setting.  Its success in detecting both single stranded and double stranded targets mean it can be used to probe for many targets in molecular diagnostics.
In summary our experiments showed the potential forSeeDNA to be used in a variety of applications but further optimisation is required to maximise its diagnostic ability.
Potential Applications
SeeDNA is a versatile technology.  We anticipate that it could be used for the following applications
Detection of Pathogenic DNA
This system could be a rapid and cheap diagnostic tool for DNA sequences from pathogenic bacteria or viruses. We have designed a detector for the double stranded Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and it should be possible to detect other DNA viruses like Varicella-zoster virus (Chickenpox) and potentially RNA viruses like Human Immunodeficiency virus.  Bacteria that cause food poisoning or infection should also be detectable
Mutation detection
Many diseases arise by mutations in DNA that result in a faulty protein. SeeDNA could in principle be designed to detect the presence of specific mutations (insertions, deletions, substitutions).  A detector plasmid could be constructed which could detect known mutations or to detect only non-mutated sequences. SeeDNA could be a quick screening diagnostic.
For example it could be used as the readout of a restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) as an alternative to gel electrophoresis or other forms of chromatography.  RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms) are ideal targets for this detector as binding to the target relies heavily on a target of the correct length.  As such it could be used for genetic testing of for example Cystic Fibrosis  or Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA).  SCA is caused by a point mutation at position 6 in the β-globin chain of haemoglobin. This mutation results in glutamic acid being replaced with valine. This results in the aggregation of haemoglobin, which can result in the blockage of small blood vessels such as capillaries.  Our detector plasmids could be tailored to detect both the normal and SCA alleles, allowing for the determination of an individual’s"

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to deformity and destruction of joints by bone and cartilage erosion. It is estimated that 1% to 3% of the world population is affected, being most common in developing countries. This disease affects about two to three times more women, aged between 30-50 years, with peak incidence in the fifth decade of life (Alamanos & Drosos, 2005; Mota et al., 2012). In Brazil, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in adults ranges from 0.2% to 1%, corresponding to an estimated 1.3 million people affected (Alamanos et al., 2006; Ferraz & Ciconelli, 2003; Woolf & Pfleger, 2003; Laurindo et al., 2002; ACR Clinical Guidelins, 1996; Symmons et al., 1994; Marques Neto et al., 1993).
In 2007, RA was the fourth largest budgetary impact disease, consuming 10.4% of the resources (Carias et al., 2011). Studies have shown that the biological disease-modifying drugs have ongoing high cost, and the annual cost of treatment per patient estimated between € 13,500 (US$ 15,296.01) and € 15,000 (US$ 16,995.56; Hoebert  et al., 2012). In Brazil, a 48-month course of treatment with conventional regimen followed by biological costs R$ 1,701,286.76 (US$ 438803,94; Monteiro & Zanini, 2008), and the cost of six months of treatment with infliximab is R$ 19,698.00 (US$ 5,080.60; Venson et al., 2011).
The mortality rate of patients with RA is higher than in normal population, and life expectancy decreases according to the severity of the disease and when it started ( http://www.artritereumatoide.com.br/artrite-reumatoide/#epidemiologia ).
Inflammatory macrophages are central cells to the pathophysiology of disease due to their prominent numbers in the inflamed synovial membrane and at cartilage-pannus junction, their clear activation status and their response to successful anti-rheumatic treatment.
There is no cure for RA and the drugs"

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2018,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", 2014). This could be exploited to detect this type of cancer in an early stage (Zackular et al., 2014).
Early detection has a key role in survival of colon cancer patients. Regular screening of people in the risk group of developing colon cancer is therefore of importance (National cancer institute, 2018). Factors that can contribute to low screening rates are complications around the screening procedure such as fear and lack of resources (National cancer institute, 2018). Research is put on how to increase the screening rates with one of the option being patient-reach out in order to increase awareness (National cancer institute, 2018). In addition to this, cheaper, easier and faster detection methods might encourage more people to do regular check-ups.
Treatment
Today, surgery is commonly the first choice in the treatment of colon cancer. However, in 1 out of 2 patients undergoing surgery, the cancer recurs (PDQ Adult treatment editorial board, 2018). Other treatment options are radiation therapy and chemotherapy which can also be combined with surgery (PDQ Adult treatment editorial board, 2018). Both of the latter treatment options cause side effects such as weakness and diarrhea (Cancer research UK, 2015).
Research is put into the field of personalized oncology in order to personalize cancer treatment based on genomic profiling. In this way, the treatment becomes more effective while side effects are reduced (Rosenblum & Peer, 2014). In the field of personalized oncology, omics data describing for example enzymatic activity is used to decide which therapy to employ. The data can also be used to monitor drug response and adjust drug dosage (Rosenblum & Peer, 2014).
In relation to genome profiling, better understanding of mutations that could cause cells to become cancerous has led to the development of targeted therapies (Rosenblum & Peer, 2014). An example of a targeting therapy is use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies that inhibit EGFR signaling (Martinelli, De Palma, Orditura, & De Vita, 2009). EGFR is involved in important cellular transduction pathways (Martinelli et al., 2009) and has found to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (Rosenblum & Peer, 2014).
Research is also put into the development of new immunotherapies that can be used for colorectal cancer (Kalyan, Kircher, Shah, Mulcahy, & Benson, 2018).  Immunotherapy focuses on stimulating the immune response to fight the"

The three experiment sets clearly demonstrate that the framework is optimised when a higher concentration of cells expressing the reporter device is present (Figures 6, 7, 8, samples labelled 1:1:13). Although a background signal is visible in the systems expressing the pink ( BBa_K2205018 ) and the sfGPF ( BBa_K2205015 ) reporters, the blue reporter ( BBa_K2205016 ) due to its lowest background level, constitutes the most suitable reporter module for the Sensynova platform when customised as IPTG biosensor.
Conclusions and Future Work
The qualitative results detailed above highlight the crucial advantage of our multicellular, modular framework, as it enables each component to be optimised avoiding any extra cloning steps. As each biosensor may be different and require specific designs and optimisation, easily choosing and changing modules and predicting in silico the bacterial community behaviour is essential for the development of new biosensors.

TRAINING AND ENFORCEMENT
Training:
All team members who work in the wet lab must complete full training prior to the onset of work under         the instruction of staff and teachers in the lab. These courses set specific guidelines and are the         standard requirement for work in a biosafety-level 1 lab at SZU-China. Additionally, all team members         will attend the experiment seminar with the chief manager of the cilvil engineering lab, Professor Deng         and Doctor Zhang. During these seminar, they will check on the students safety operation procedures         specific to the labspace in which we work.
Furthermore, our downstream micro-capsule experiment is highly paid attention to. The total assembly and         cultivation is strictly supervised for every procedures and well documented. The exact proportion of         ingredients and the sequence involving in assembly is not only related to safety issue, but also the         success of our self-repairing concrete.
Enforcement:
Team members who violate safety rules are required to work under the supervision of the experiment         staff for the remainder of the week, or until the safety officer believes the member is capable of         performing the task unsupervised. For multiple infractions or complete disregard to safety protocols,         a member may be restricted from laboratory work until he/she undergoes retraining again, and demonstrates         proper performance to a team leader of failed technique(s) in a controlled setting."

Figure 5.  
The conclusion arrives in figure 5, named DXS+PT, which is our double plasmid CPS bacteria, and displays the same peaks (A), (B) and (C) as both the WT + polyisoprene and pure polyisoprene. This is a strong indication of the presence of rubber - specifically, this is an indication that our CPS bacteria produces rubber: Bacteriorganic Rubber. Peak distortion of the spectrum due to solvents are the same as seen in the rubber purification from WT + polyisoprene.
Fig. 6
Fig. 7
A second round of testing was done to validate the first experiment. We wanted to include a negative test (WT), in order to exclude the possibility of a naturally occurring polyisoprenoid compounds in E. coli. We performed rubber purification on WT, our CPS bacteria as well as a strain containing only the pSB1K3-araC-Para-HRT2 device. Bacteria were grown and rubber extracted as described above. The three samples where unfortunately not dried properly in the vacuum oven due to apparatus malfunction.
The test provided the following results: Fig 6 lacks the characteristic peaks of polyisoprene at 5.12, 2.04 and 1.68. It can be concluded from their absence that there is not rubber (nor any other compound that might provide a similar chemical shift values) in the wildtype. In the CPS (Fig. 7), we observe very a slight peak at 5.12, indicating the presence of (A) hydrogen. This peak has the same splitting pattern as the first round of H1-NMR, but it has a very low intensity. The (B) and (C) peaks are hidden in the background noise, which is most likely due to cell debris and solvents, which did not evaporate appropriately. We suspect that the machinery has a decreased sensitivity towards the isoprene peaks due to the high amount of solvent seen from the assigned peaks, but the peak at 5.12 (with the recognizable splitting pattern) is a strong indication that rubber is once again present in our CPS bacteria (containing both HRT2 and Dxs plasmids).

After the E. coli genome is successfully modified, the ribosomes are purified with the help of the previously incorporated Strep tag, and the final product is used for IVTT reactions.
Modification procedure
CRISPR-Cas9 was utilized via pCas9 and pTargetF plasmids 8. pCas9 constitutively expresses Cas9, which induces a double-strand DNA break at a specific target sequence, that is complementary to the guide RNA. The guide RNA sequences for our targets were introduced via reverse PCR into the pTargetF plasmid series, which then supplies it to Cas9. After the double stranded break occurs, the HDR (homology directed repair) mechanism is activated, which repairs the genome according to a supplied donor sequence. This process is highly efficient with the assistance λ-red proteins, expressed from pCas9. The donor sequence has ~300 bp length homology arms and the insertion sequence that can include either the His or Strep tag to be fused with the chosen ribosomal subunit C’-end, as well as an in frame selection marker (select antibiotic resistance genes). pCas9 expresses a gRNA targeting the ori of pTargetF, therefore the cells are automatically cured from pTargetF after each modification. Additionally, pCas9 has a temperature-sensitive ori, it is cured by growing the cells at 37 oC.
Fig. 2 Scheme of the genome modification process:
1.  pCas9 is introduced into the target cells
2. pTargetF and the according donor DNA are electroporated into the cells
3. Cas9 and our custom gRNA form a complex that cuts the genome DNA at the target. The genome is repaired via HDR according to our donor DNA sequence - X1 (homology arm of target ribosomal subunit) with fused tag, X3 (antibiotic resistance gene) and X2 (second homology arm).
4. pTargetF is cured and the process can be repeated with a new target.
For multi-gene editing, we chose to supply the donor sequence as a linear DNA strand (PCR product). Due to financial reasons, to construct the donor DNA sequence we performed separate PCRs of the homology arms (from the E. coli genome), selection marker (antibiotic resistance genes from available plasmids) (Fig. 4). The oligomers had the his and strep tag sequences incorporated into them alongside 2 different restriction sites."

Overview
We have decided to submit 9 new BioBricks this year, which are separated into 2 categories:
The chassis for our project is based on the Pseudomonas putida bacterium, for its ability to utilize aromatic molecules, mainly focusing on protocatechuate. We have decided to contribute the the iGEM part repository by submitting the genes encoding the enzymes participating in the protocatechuate degradation pathway, in which Protocatechuate, a toxic molecule for most bacteria, is converted to 3-oxoadipate. One of the genes, pcaB, had 4 PstI restriction cut sites and we did not have enough time to introduce silent mutations to the sequence, hence we did not clone and submit it. All 4 other genes were cloned into the pSB1C3 vector and submitted.
Another part of our project involves engineering of the LC-Cutinase protein. We have chosen the LC-Cutinase protein as a target for rational mutagenesis for its PET degrading activity, and using the PROSS algorithm produced 4 mutants.                                              We have also designed a codon optimized version of the W.T. protein.                                              We have cloned and submitted all 5 LC-Cutinase variants.

High School Achievement
Auc Turkey, the high school iGEM team trained by Atoms Turkiye member Mustafa Elitok has achieved the non-other 1st runner up prize in the 2013 jamboree which can be viewed on the link https://2013hs.igem.org/Main_Page . Despite joining for the second year, their achievements was an inexplicable joy for us and our university. Our high school student Furkan Bestepe who has undergone a training period of two years has become a member of our team Atoms Turkiye. Below: AUC Turkey Project Description.
Big budgets and significant amounts of energy are annually allocated to cooling systems. Also, these cooling processes are one of the factors of environmental distruption. The aim of our project, BactoCooler, is to accomplish a highly efficient and low cost cooling without distrupting nature’s magnificient balance through the usage of the most common form of life on Earth, bacteria. BactoCooler contains a special RNA Thermometer which allows translation after a specific temperature. This initiates the production of the urease enzyme which is responsible in the breakdown of urea. This organic endothermic reaction results in the significant cooldown of the environment.

In order to test the germination rate of the B.subtilis endospores, we used the whole yeast solid plate (Fig.3) and the 2xSG liquid medium (Fig.4) to harvest the mature spores, The yield of spores can be calculate by phase contrast microscope using the Hemocytometer，which always reach 90% in 72h after cultivating（Fig.5)

Fig.4 2xSG liquid medium
Fig.5 The endospores of B.subtilis observed under the phase contrast microscope. Sporation rate always reach 90% above in 72h after cultivating at the whole yeast solid plate and 2xSG liquid medium.
To verify the increases in the germination rates with L-alanine of spores transformed this part PsspB-gerAa ( BBa_K2232020 ), both spores of original strain (control group) and transformed strain (gerAa group) were collected and detected the germination rates  induced by L-alanine(2mmol/L). Germination was monitored by reading the drop in absorbance (A600) in a 96-well microplate reader (Molecular Devices FlexStation 3).Theoretically, the earliest easily measured event in spore germination is the release of various ions, and Ca2+-DPA release is accompanied by the loss of 70% of the total amount of the OD600 that is lost upon spore germination. Consequently, measurement of the OD600 of germinating spores, in particular, the maximum rate of the fall of the OD600 at a given germinant concentration, is a simple and reliable method for quantitating and comparing rates of spore germination. As shown in Fig.6, the gerAa group showed a higher proportion in germination and"

Without their help and encouragement, our work would not have been such an integral project.
CCiC
The fifth Conference of China iGEMer Community
The fifth Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) we attended in August was accredited by the iGEM authority. In the conference, we presented our team’s poster and demonstrated the project. With abundant preparations and excelsior attitudes, we achieved great success and high reputation.
Every night during the conference, our poster attracted a number of students from other universities to discuss with us. After a short period of dissemination, our project’s designs and effects were learned by almost all participants. While giving publicity to ourselves, we paid attention to other teams’ lecture and presentation, taking notes and discussing together late in the hotel.
On the last day, our representation was splendid due to lucid logical structure and full plans to answer the questions raised by famous iGEMer, the special guest of the conference Zhang Haoqian, and get recognition from all guests present.

Ethics
The international competition iGEM gathers each year together more and more teams (110 teams for the 2009 session) added to 18 Europeans programs, 70 industries, 10000 laboratories in the world which have all the same common objective: the construction of living systems, following the assembly principle of functional modules.
The emergence and the fast development of this discipline require reflection, to put a regulation system in place ready in the next 5 to 10 years for safe practices.
Thus at the occasion of the iGEM concourse, we realized this debate to think about ethic stake linked to synthetic biology.

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project#Cyano_-_-_TEXT.html," into the coding region of a subcloned ThiE gene. This dysfunctional ThiE construct will then be transformed into Synechocystis and through homologous recombination, replace the native ThiE gene.
ThiE K.O./GLF Construct Components
ThiE Gene: The sll0635 open reading frame was PCR amplified from total Synechocystis PCC6803 genomic DNA and subcloned into pSB1a3. Forward and reverse primers were designed with 5’ extensions containing iGEM prefix and suffix sequences.
Glucose facilitative transporter (GLF) Gene+double terminator: The GLF gene was synthesized based on the sequence of a Zymonomas mobilis invertase gene described by Neiderholtmeyer et al. (Applied and Environmental Microbiology (2010) 76: 3462) which was codon optimized for expression in cyanobacteria. The gene was also synthesized with a double transcriptional terminator designed from sequences described for iGEM part BBa_B0005.
petBD promoter+RBS: The strong light inducible petBD promoter will be used to drive the expression of invertase gene in Synechocystis. The petBD+RBS (BBa_K390015) was generously provided to us by the Utah State iGEM team.
Chloramphenicol resistance cassette (CamR): The chloramphenicol resistance cassette was PCR amplified from pSB1C3. This cassette includes the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene with its own constitutive promoter and transcriptional terminator. This cassette is frequently used to select for positive transformants in Synechocystis.
Gibson Assembly of ThiE K.O./GLF Components
Primer Design: Forward and reverse primers for each DNA part were designed with 20 base pair overlapping sequences with the upstream and downstream flanking segments. This will create 40 base pair overlaps between neighboring parts in the construct.
PCR: GLF, CamR, and petBD+RBS were amplified from BBa_K558005(Nevada), pSB1C3, and K390015(Utah State) respectively under standard PCR conditions. ThiE in pSB1A3 will be amplified to include the vector. This will be used as the backbone for Gibson Assembly.
Assembly of Parts: The above parts will be assembled into the following construct
Primers developed for PCR and Gibson Assembly for GLF operon. Overlapping DNA sequences can be created through PCR by adding twenty base-pairs of"

We had no luck there which is why we chose to use SDS-PAGE to see if we had any product at all. If i remember correctly (though you might want to check our wiki) we had a band of 'protein' that corresponded neither to the pre- or post- cleavage kDA size for the enzyme. I think we found a paper indicating that the secretion step may occur in 2 parts, but I don't think we could confirm sizes.  We tried out construct in a number of E. coli strains, (the paper we based it on used BL21, but we also tried MC100 and DH5alpha) but we didn't get a chance to look at protein from all of them, we just had breakdown assays to confirm we weren't making an active product. In terms of implementation, we aimed to make an under-sink bioreactor which would tackle the problem close to the source, as well as releasing enzyme into the water supply to help further downstream. We aimed to use filtration systems to allow for enzyme release whilst keeping our cells contained within the device - no worry about water contamination! We did look at kill switches based on time, nutrient depletion etc, but decided it was too risky for what we wanted.  There should be some images of the device on the wiki too.  We hadn't really looked at implementation of the Keratinase too much, our main focus being the lipase. Interestingly, a few companies are now making hair conditioner that contains peptides - something you would be producing as a byproduct. Perhaps something to look at? Competition-wise, keep everything really simple. Don't make big bold claims - the judges will see through it in a heartbeat. If you don't know something, admit it, but be ready to explain how you would find it out in future. Have your presentation ready before you go!!! We spent 4 days in our hotel lobby putting it together before the jamboree started and so didn't get to see much of Boston while we were there.  Well done on making it this far! Let me know how it goes and if the Keratinase does work, I'm sure the rest of my team would like to hear about it too.  If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.

We asked him about the necessary properties of tap water and actually used processes to separate metal ions from drinking water. Furthermore as a contact person to the industry we talked as well about the target group of our system being middle-class businesses with less financial resources than big companies. We talked as well about our reactor design and he stated some ideas. His expertise about industrial and economic structures helped us to improve the way we designed our reactor toward being financially viable for middle-class business.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," is the biggest collaboration in the iGEM history. We feel awesome about what we did!
Second
We provided parts BBa_C0061 and BBa_I0462 to the Toulouse iGEM team due to the high transform difficulty they described using this year's distribution. Toulouse could directly use them for their cloning and we got some useful feedback about our parts.
Third
We had a short meeting with 4 members of NJU iGEM team that visited us. During it, we introduced this year's project to each other and exchanged the opinions. We welcome all other visitors as well.
Fourth
In the summer vacation, we drew a doodle about 2013 iGEM in Furong tunnel in the camp with the member of software team of our university. This tunnel is not only a main stem but also a famous scenic spots, so that more than 30,000 people per day will pass by and look our doodle. In addition, the doodle is a quite novel approach to introduce synthetic biology and we believe that no team did it before.
We also held a garden party with software team where introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to 200 students of senior high school from the whole Fujian Province. Go to page…to see more
In the wet lab, we helped them to structure their plasmids, such as teaching how to ligation and digestion.
Fifth
We've also had a really good communication with the iGEM team of Peking University. From August 11th to August 19th ,one of our team members went to Peking University to get a deep cooperation with them. Firstly we introduced our own project in this year and exchanged the opinions .They gave us some good suggestions in experiments and models. What's more, they gave us one BioBrick of sfGFP (BBa_...), which gave a great help to our structure. This sfGFP allowed our circuit to generated a brighter fluorescence and made easier to obverse in the microfluidics.
Acknowledgement
We very much appreciate the work you've done in the HP. Last but not least, we're really grateful to the high school students for their joy in the HP.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html," liver damage (US EPA ORD NCEA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) 2014). Some studies associate high copper levels with aging diseases such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease (Brewer 2012).
Detection
The most important analytical method for the detection of copper in water is the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),which has the lowest detection limit (0.02 μg/L). Other methods often used for detection are the atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) with flame detection, which has the highest (20 μg/L) as well as graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and stabilized temperature platform graphite furnace atomic absorption (cavillona 2004).
Our copper Biosensor
We used the native operator of copper homeostasis from E. coli K12. This includes the promoter (CopAP) and its regulator CueR. CueR is a MerR like regulator, which stimulates the transcription of CopA, a P-type ATPase pump (Outten et al. 2000). CopA is the central component in obtaining copper homeostasis, it exports free copper from cytoplasm to the periplasm. This is enabled by copper induced activation of the operon transcription via CueR. The CueR-Cu+ is the DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator which activates transcription (Yamamoto, Ishihama 2005). We combined CueR ( BBa_K1758320 ) under the control of a constitutive promoter with the operator site of CopA Promoter and sfGFP  ( BBa_K1758321 ) for measuring output signals.

Growth
Week 1 May 8 -15
We procured a strain of Neurospora from a neighbouring lab and set out to learn how the organism grows. We made potato dextrose media and tested the growth of Neurospora in the presence and absence of glucose.
We also tested out household fertilizers as a replacement to the potato component in varying concentrations, we did not observe much growth in just fertilizer and glucose. We examined the fertilizer and found that it was missing Magnesium and Calcium. We created a salt solution and measured growth on fertilizer and glucose with our added salt solution.
We created primary experiments on saw dust and coffee grounds.
Week 2 May 16 - 22
Tested the growth of Neurospora on strained versus unstrained potato dextrose media in varying concentrations.
We set up a growth curve on potato dextrose media in 100mL volumes to attempt to create a standard curve.
We set up small scale experiments of sawdust and coffee grounds with promising results.
We made a variety of media from grass clippings and wheat straw. We tested chopped versus ground components of each and also tested NaOH pre-treatments of wheat straw.
Week 3 May 23-29
We learned about how to properly inoculate with conidia and correct procedure for growing and harvesting conidia.
We attempted a scale – up of the successful small scale Wheat straw and grass clippings experiments from last week.
We created media from phone book and baked sawdust and preformed a small scale experiment.
We tested varying amounts of distilled water in grass clippings and saw dust.
We attended the AITF workshop in Calgary.
Week 4 May 30 – June 5
We miniprepped pMOCosX G6C9 for the growth team. We transformed pCSN44,  and pBARKS in to DH5alpha cells and plated on Amp agar plates.
We attempted to perform a small scale growth curve in potato dextrose media.
We tried to make petri dish cultures with liquid media of wheat straw, grass and potato dextrose.

Changing Direction
After public survey and discussing with experts, we realized that the project on Trichophyton rubrum study was almost infeasible. Through the investigation and communication, we found that treating skin cancer was a more essential and necessary               researching object. So we decided to shift the focus of our project from Trichophyton rubrum to skin cancer.

The vast majority of the respondents had specialised in biological sciences (although this spanned very different fields including microbiology, biochemistry, immunology and pharmacology) by the time they participated in iGEM, indicating that they were already set on a career in biology before taking part. Significantly, however, one third of respondents were not specialised in biology, with their backgrounds ranging from physics and engineering to computer science, mathematics and medicine. These students came from various years of the competition, and were present from the very beginning of the competition in 2003 through to the most recent years. iGEM seems to have been quite successful in attracting participants from various backgrounds, which is crucial in the development of such an interdisciplinary field.
The respondents came from teams across North America and Europe - although an effort was made to collect data from universities in other continents, we were not successful. This is partially due to the fact that the vast majority of iGEM teams were either North American or European up until 2009, when there was a large expansion in Asia. However, we are aware that this still introduces a bias to our results that needs to be bourne in mind.
The iGEM Projects
The significance of the actual projects that are undertaken by iGEM teams is a key part of the contribution that the iGEM community brings to the field of synthetic biology, together with building the online and physical library of standard DNA parts and of course inspiring students to participate in the new science. A criticism that has been made of the competition is that since the students have such little time to work on their projects, they either end up with ‘gimmicky’ machines or are not able to make significant headway in achieving the ambitious goals they set themselves at the outset. Evidently, more work must be done beyond the summer in order to develop projects further, but has this been the case in the past?
Graph 3 shows that over two thirds of the projects that respondents to the survey took part in were continued beyond the jamboree, though the extent of the work done varied significantly between projects. Some of the projects were only slightly augmented, with some further BioBrick modification, sometimes finishing off projects that weren’t completed in time for the jamboree. This work was sometimes done by the original team members, but also often carried on by their iGEM mentors or supervisors, who were often professors or post-Doctoral students in the lab they were working at.

RNA thermometers (RNATs) are RNA sequences that can post-transcriptionally regulated gene expression in response to temperature shifts by a way of undergoing conformation changes in the secondary structure of RNA. below shows the secondary structure of natural formed RNA thermometer found in 5鈥?untranslated region of many eubacteria. Graph 1. Last year XJTLU_CHINA 2015, tested more than 10 nature existed and artificial RNATs using Egfp as reporter gene. Though all of these RNATs are reported perfect performance in original experiments, the expression of EGFP can only be controlled by three RNATs. < a href=""http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1824556 "" style=""color: #428bca"" title=""qbeta"">A1from BIT China showed highest protein expression and temperature induction (more than 10 times of induction). This year again, we want to further characterize the A1 RNAT using MRFP as reporter gene. However, when the green fluorescence gene was replaced by red florescence gene, surprisingly, no protein was expressed. (Figure X) Hence the aim of this year is to optimize the performance of RNAT A1 in the expression of Mrfp.

The principle is shown in (Figure 2.), the hairpin structure harbors the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD sequence) and, in this way, make it inaccessible to the 30S unit of the bacterial ribosome, resulting in inactivation of translation. (SD sequence is polypurine sequence located in around 8 nt upstream from the start codon and responsible for anchoring ribosome in the RNA single strand). Once reaching a certain temperature, hairpin structure would vanish and as a result, exposing the SD sequence to"

We applied the same methodology to the study of each of the systems: PQS, BDSF and DSF. Our approach was to first build models for the core components within the engineered system. In this way, we could generate predictions  regarding the expected outcome -   qualitative and quantitative promoter expression behaviour  in response to varying signal input levels.  Having built this theoretical framework, we could then more easily address questions and technical problems generated by the wet science. Most importantly, we were able to use our modelling framework to suggest improvements and solutions to the technical issues that arose and thus steer project design in a positive feedback loop.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal"

For future projects, a video that looks into the mechanisms and the debate surrounding genetic engineering might be more beneficial in being able to influence more changes in opinion. Furthermore, better organization of the video might have helped to make the video much easier to follow along with, making it more informative to the population. Future projects could look at a variety of populations to get a larger demographic involved in the project. These results could be very interesting.
Institutional Review Board
In order for the Penn State team to conduct research in the form of a survey using human participants, the surveys and recruitment process needed to be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Three of the students, Alex Bina , Lauren Rossi and Vishal Saini received training through the IRB in conduction sociological and biomedical research. After training, and with the help of Leland Glenna, an associate professor of rural sociology and science, technology, and society at Penn State, the research proposal was reviewed and approved, as proven by the implied consent form .

Create a survey with targeted questions about your project.
submit the survey to the public,Quantitative,""MOSQUITO SURVEY
Question 1: do you use mosquito eradication products? Analysis: 81.46% of the respondents use mosquito eradication products, indicates that mosquito eradication products are well accepted by the public and the market is huge.
Question 3: do you pay attention to new innovative mosquito eradication products? Analysis: 16.56% of the respondents always pay attention to new mosquito eradication products and 55.96% of them do it sometimes. These data indicate that new mosquito eradication products, like the product of ours, could be noticed by the public and have the potential to access to market.
Question 8:what do you think are the deficiencies of mosquito control products in the market? Analysis: Due to the results from question 8, inefficiency, inconvenience and less in variety are the three main problems of mosquito control products in the market. Therefore, in order to get the product of ours accepted by the market and public, we have to improve its efficiency and convenience.
Question 10: what’s your attitude towards the advancement of mosquito control technologies in the future? Analysis: 55.3% of the respondents are expecting new and more advanced mosquito control products, which indicates that the product of ours could be accepted by the public as a new measure of mosquito control if it’s advanced enough.
NEXT SURVEY - GMO Survey Question 1: how much do you know about GMO？ Analysis: 79.61% (9.92% + 69.69%) of the respondents know GMO and 20.11% have heard of it, while only 0.28% of the respondents know nothing about GMO. These data indicate that GM technology is known and accepted by most of the respondents.
Question 2: Which one (or more than one) of the followings might be GM products found in the Chinese market? Analysis: This is a test about respondents’ knowledge on GMO. Except for maize, all of the products in the list could be GMO or GM products in China, but the number of volts for maize is the second highest (90.65%), and most people don't believe that cottons, beets, tobaccos, ppapaya and insulin could be GMO or produced by GMO. This suggests that the majority of the respondents are lacking of knowledge"

Video 3: Bacteria inside of Arabidopsis thaliana roots. These videos were put together using Z-stack images taken on a confocal microscope. These images can be converted into 3D pictures that allow us to verify that the bacteria can indeed be found inside the roots rather than on the surface (data and imaging by Imperial College iGEM 2011).
We repeated this experiment at a later date with plants that had been allowed to grow for a longer period of time. The bacteria were predominantly found in root hairs and inside of cells on the root surface (Figure 11). These plants were older than the ones previously used for uptake experiments and bacterial uptake was much more predominant.
These results show that we would be able to expose plants to IAA from inside the roots themselves. This is extremely important for assessing the secretion of IAA by our bacteria. Nevertheless, we will need to conduct further uptake experiments in soil and with other plant species to confirm that uptake would be possible in the project's eventual implementation stage.

1.Nitric oxide sensor
In order to detect the NO specifically and accurately, we constructed pCDFDuet-1 plasmid as our expression vector, which contains the NO binding protein for expressing reporter gene. (Figure 1). Briefly, we integrated NO-binding protein, NorR, into this plasmid for activating the amilCP reporter gene expression via binding to PnorV promoter. To testify the validity of NO sensor, we used T7 promoter and lacO protein for boosting the NorR expression under the IPTG induction.
Figure 1.  Diagram for NO sensor system in pCDFDuet-1 plasmid. T7 promoter, the gene downstream of this promoter will be transcribed when there is T7 RNA polymerase. lacO, the sequence represses the nearby promoter when there is no inducer (e.g. IPTG). RBS, ribosome binding site. NorR, NO binding protein. PnorV, a promoter which is sensitive to NO. amilCP, blue chromoprotein. T7 terminator, a terminator from T7 phage.
According to the previous work, ShanghaiTechChina_B 2016 team demonstrated 100μM Sodium Nitroprusside Dihydrate (SNP) aqueous solution could continuously release NO and its final concentration is stable at about 5.5μM, which as same as the NO amount in IBD patients and 100 times higher than healthy individuals [1]. According to their work, we could simulate the IBD patients’ NO signal in vitro. In the subsequent test of the NO sensor, the final concentration of the SNP aqueous solution was maintained at 100 μM.
We transformed the constructed plasmid with NO sensor into DH5α, cultured at 37 ℃ overnight, and then diluted to OD600 = 0.2. Culturing bacteria at 37 ℃ for 1.5 hours, the appropriate concentration of inducer IPTG and SNP aqueous solution were added. After 6 hours of culturing, 1 mL of the bacterial solution was centrifuged at 8000 r.p.m for 1 min (Figure 2). It can be seen that the NO released by the SNP aqueous solution can effectively activate the expression of the reporter gene. Surprisingly, the blue chromoprotein in group 1mM IPTG without SNP was also be activated with undetermined"

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates. The stored bit is present on the output marked Q (or the complement Q).
Figure 11. SR latch
Normally, in storage mode, the S and R inputs are both low, and feedback maintains the Q and Q outputs in a constant state. If S (Set) is pulsed high while R is held low, then the Q output is forced high, and stays high when S returns low; similarly, if R (Reset) is pulsed high while S is held low, then the Q output is forced low, and stays low when R returns low (Figure 12).
Figure 12. SR latch truth table
The R = S = 1 combination is called a restricted combination because, as both NOR gates then output zeros, it breaks the logical equation Q = not Q. The combination is also inappropriate in circuits where both inputs may go low simultaneously (i.e. a transition from restricted to keep). The output would lock at either 1 or 0 depending on the propagation time relations between the gates (a race condition). In certain implementations, it could also lead to longer ringings (damped oscillations) before the output settles, and thereby result in undetermined values (errors) in high-frequency digital circuits. This condition is therefore sometimes avoided.

UV Radiation: SOS system
Ultraviolet is that part of electromagnetic radiation bounded by the lower wavelength extreme of the visible spectrum and the upper end of the X-ray radiation band. The spectral range of ultraviolet radiation  is,  by definition, between 100  and 400 nm  and  is   invisible   to human  eyes.  The  UV spectrum is subdivided into three bands: UV-A (long-wave) from 315 to 400 nm, UV-B (medium-wave) from 280 to 315 nm, UV-C (short-wave) from 100 to 280 nm. A strong germicidal effect is provided by the radiation in the short-wave UV-C band.
Figure 13. After dimerization of two adjacent thymines blue light gives energy to photolyase to repair the damage
The maximum UV germicidal effect  coincides with the peak absorbance of DNA (near 260nm) due to the dimerization of two adjacent thymines. E.Coli cells have a system that recovery DNA damage when it occurs. The best studied transcriptional response to DNA damage is the SOS response [Friedberg et al 1995, Walker et al. 1996].
