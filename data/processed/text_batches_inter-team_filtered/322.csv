Mathematical Modeling of Bistable Toggle Switch
In addition to our experimental efforts, we have developed mathematical models in two different approaches to aid the construction of a successful toggle switch in S.cerevisiae. Following the construction and characterization of a library of genes parts, one must choose two genes to couple in order to make a working toggle switch. The goal of modeling was to provide theoretical guidance to choosing the optimal pair of genes that will make a toggle switch. With the two models we have developed, we could not only demonstrate how various characteristics of the gene affect cooperativity and bistability, but also understand the requirements for building a successful genetic switch.
Cooperativity
Cooperativity is a common phenomenon in biological systems involving multiple ligands binding to enzymes or receptors. The change in affinity of a binding site for a ligand upon a ligand-binding leads to either positive cooperativity in which affinity is increased and subsequent binding become more likely, or negative cooperativity in which affinity is decreased to hinder future binding. One of the most famous examples of cooperative binding is the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting protein in red blood cells. When an oxygen molecule bind to hemoglobin, its affinity for oxygen increases greatly, and when three oxygen molecules bind (3-oxy-hemoglobin), its affinity for the fourth one is nearly three-hundred times higher than deoxy-hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen. This cooperative property leads to the sigmoidal shaped curve shown below.

All this assumptions are the same used to solve the Navier-Stokes equation of fluid mechanics to find the Hagen-Poisseuille equation [18] used to describe laminar flows. In this case, there is no need to calculate the Reynolds number to estimate the flow characteristics - all the assumptions behind the Hagen-Poisseule equation already garantees that. Since we're using a 0.5 mm squared pipe, it is needed to substitute the tube diameter in the Hagen-Poisseuille equation for the equivalent hidraulic diameter[17] of a squared pipe - that is just the side of the squared section of the tube.
Equation 1: Hagen-Poisseuille equation with the hydraulic diameter of a squared pipe. Phi is the volumetric flow, the eta letter is the viscosity, delta P stands for the pressure difference, d is the diameter of a circular pipe, L is the channel lenght, and l is the side of the squared pipe.
To estimate the pressure applied by the user, the ""palmar pich"" finger pressing movement was considered the most approximate movement that we expect from our user. Using an average force of almost 54 N for this type movement provided by the literature[16], we calculated a pressure of approximatedly 440 kPa to be exerted under the reagent chamber section area. Considering the tube lenght the distance from the reagent chamber  to the beginning of the biomimic valve (on the valve region the laminar flow hypothesis is no more assegured) and using the viscosity of water (we estimate that the solutions will have the same order os viscosity), we have found a volumetric flow of 540 microL per second. Since the reagent chamber have almost 520 microL,  it will be emptied by one second. Considering all the errors involved and the rough approximations, this is the magnitude of time appropriate for operation - our concerns were about the user need of keep holding the buttons in order to the liquid flows. The volume of Virkon to be splited on Reaction Chamber and Spores Chamber need to be proportional to the volume of spores/cells solution on each chamber. This implies in a equivalent proportional Virkon flow. We made a pessimistic estimative of the residual reagent volume on the Spore chamber, approximating the liquid surface to a spherical cap touching the spores chamber bottom (see the reagent chambers on Fig. 6). The residual volume calculated was 61.35 microL, what corresponds approximately to"

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," by finding the bottleneck in data transfer from the computer to Arduino, and the transfer rate from Arduino to motor controller shield. Processing time in both the computer and Arduino are comparatively negligible.
Transfer to Arduino: 115,200 bits/second, 14,400 bytes/second         Transfer to motor controller: standard mode of I2C: 100,000 bits/second, 12,500 bytes/second         Bytes required for one command: 12
Therefore the maximum theoretical number of commands that can be sent at once is 12,500/12 = 1040. Including a safety margin of over 5x to ensure that all servo/syringe combinations can move 5x per second to ensure smooth motion all at once, Neptune’s set maximum is 200 servo/syringe combinations.
Neptune transforms the build area of a desktop CNC mill into that of an entire machine shop, and beyond. By milling square, modular components with pre-drilled holes for easy mounting Neptune can span a build area of one 4.2”x 4.2” square to hundreds of feet in any direction. This modularity, in addition to enabling huge build areas, allows for custom baseboard configurations to fix each project’s individual needs. The pre-drilled holes ensure proper component alignment and spacing, further adding to Neptune’s ease-of-use.

Future Plans for Neptune
EXPERIMENT SCHEDULING & AUTOMATION THROUGH NEPTUNE
Neptune has the ability to guide a user through designing, building, and controlling a microfluidic system. Further development on this functionality will incorporate the automation of controlling an experiment in a microfluidic chip through Neptune. We plan to design a scheduling language which Neptune will use to schedule events such as opening or closing a valve or dispensing a certain amount of liquid at specific times. The user will be able to utilize this functionality in a graphical, intuitive way. This will enable a scientist to run a completely automated experiment through Neptune’s tool chain.
INTEGRATION OF SENSORS INTO SYSTEM
In order to allow a more precise control over a microfluidic system through Neptune, we plan to incorporate sensor data collection into the GUI. When running an experiment, automated monitoring of factors such as fluorescence, temperature, and pH can allow for a more intelligent experiment scheduling. For example, if cells in a cell trap need to reach a certain level of fluorescence before a nutrient is washed over them, our future plans for Neptune provide an interface where a biologist can monitor this fluorescence using sensors (such as those manufactured by Atlas"

Furthermore, researchers are trying to employ them to know more about bovine spongiform enceohalopathy(mad cow disease) and Alzheimer's disease. Are you worried any more after we tell you these facts?
A.I'm not worried but we should use it carefully.
B.It can be used for scientific research but should be forbidden from industry.
C.We should prohibit all kinds of usage of it for we haven't understood it completely.
6.Yeast prions can self-assemble and aggregate or disperse according to different temperature or drugs.Do you come up with some innovative application of them?
7.What problems or obstacles do you think could affect the application of yeast prions to industry?
We got 1269 answers from different kinds of people and thus we could make some analyzations from these valuable data.
From the question 2 and 3 we can analyze the knowledge of the public to prions and yeast prions.             Q2:
Q3:
Since most people don't major in biology, we do not expect them to be very familiar with prions. We are glad to see that a great number of people have some knowledge of it (45.31% of them have heard about it or are familiar with it). However, the percentage of people knowing yeast prions is much less (12.69% of them have heard about it or are faliliar with it). We consider that it is because people are more likely to hear something about the horrible mad cow disease in news reports or Alzheimer's disease by contacting with some senior citizens suffering from it. Thus they began to search information about the diseases because of fear and curiosity, then they may get in touch with the word ""prion"". However, when it comes to yeast prions, people might know less about them for they cause no serious diseases and have less influence on people's life.
We also try to find out whether the eduction backgroud of people can have some relationships with their knowledge about prions.
By analyzing the responders' education level and their knowledge of prions together we are surprised to find the relationships beyond our expectation.
In common sense we expect that people's knowledge about biology increases when they get more education. Yet we discover the percentage of undergraduate college students knowing prions(405 out of 559 =72.4%) is much higher than that of bachelors(75 out of "

The bands of the single digests correspond to the expected size (~5300 bp) as well as the bands of the double digests (~3500 bp and ~2000 bp). These bands correspond with the expected weights of fer/hyd1 in CAM.

Lanes 2-9 were performed on the 23/8/17 of 4 sample colonies of Quick cells. Lanes 3-5 and 7-9 (samples B, C, D) display expected band weights of ~10,700bp for single digests and ~8700 bp with ~2000 bp for double digests. Sample A of Quick cells in lanes 2, 6, 13 and 14 did not possess necessary band weights and were discarded. Sample A of commercial cells in lanes 11 and 12 correspond with expected single and double digest band weights. Samples B and C show expected band weights for all single and double digests in both Quick and commercial cells (lanes 15-22). Sample D in commercial cells (lanes 23 and 24) did not possess the expected band weights and were discarded. Sample D in quick cells (lanes 25 and 26) showed the expected band weights for single and double digests. This gel validates the design construct of the HGPGC plasmid.

Flp and FRT form the Flp-FRT system. The function of Flp-FRT system is the same as Cre-LoxP system’s. FRT site has the similar structure with LoxP site (Fig.9) [35].
Fig.9 The sequence of FRT site
Cre-LoxP system and Flp-FRT system can be used in Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) [36][37], so we use the principle of RMCE and design the first kind of our fine-regulation circuits (Fig.10).
Fig.10 The gene circuit of Cre/Flp-mediated recombinase circuits
In fermentation process, the environment usually turn acidic, so we produce alkaline substance(γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) [38] in the primary state. And alkali-induced promoter P-atp2 and acid-induced promoter P-asr are employed to produce the recombinase Cre and Flp respectively. When the pH of environment reaches the P-atp2’s responsive range, Cre would express and recognize the LoxP sites at both sides of strong constitutive promoter J23119 and it would be inverted. Therefore the bacteria stop to produce lactate[39]. Similarly, when the pH of environment reaches the P-asr’s responsive range, J23119 would be inverted again. The bacteria will produce GABA again. Through the combination of multiple LoxP sites and FTR sites, we can realize multi-regulation and fine-regulation function.
To prevent gene from wrong inverting, we designed two kinds of sRNA to inhibit Cre and Flp’s function respectively. When one of recombinases expresses, the sRNA for the other recombinase will be produced at the same time. The sRNA would inhibit the translation of the other recombinase and we can avoid the wrong inversion. sRNA consists of two parts, the scaffold structure MicC and a target-binding sequence. Target-binding sequence, an anti-sequence about 15~20 bp, can inhibit the translation through binding with mRNA [40][41].
These circuits is used when the functional acid and the alkali are both medium.

Biological development
a. Project prospects
With the development of biotechnology, especially the rapid development of synthetic biology in recent years, more and more sustainable production of energy, chemicals and natural products can be achieved through metabolic remodeling of microorganisms. Among them, perfume compounds are an important class of chemicals, which play an important role in the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries, and have a huge and rapidly growing market demand.
Among them, quinone fragrances have become an important high-end spice that has attracted much attention due to its unique botanical aroma and potential medical properties. The production methods currently used are mainly chemical methods, direct extraction methods and biosynthesis methods. Although most of the flavors and fragrances are currently synthesized by chemical methods, however, for terpenoids, chemical methods have bottlenecks that are difficult to synthesize or have low yields and poor quality. The direct extraction method is far from satisfying human needs because most plants grow slowly and are restricted by strict geographical and climatic conditions, resulting in difficult product purification and low yield.
In theory, any naturally occurring terpenoid fragrance can be fermentatively produced by constructing a corresponding synthetic route in a suitable microbial cell. Currently, it is mainly reconstituted in traditional E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce target products, and most of the terpenoids can only obtain simple intermediates by microbial heterogeneous synthesis, and the yield of most products is still limited to milligrams per liter. The level of production has led to low overall production, low production"
NTU_SINGAPORE,2017,Team:NTU SINGAPORE#Experiment_-_-_TEXT.html," non-functional.
In this project, we rationally removed domains and subdomains that do not directly contribute to sgRNA binding or target DNA binding. Truncation is largely guided by crystal structure, by selecting domains and subdomains that, when removed, should minimally impact dCas9 folding. A short linker replaces the truncated domain. Truncation is performed at gene level, using Gibson assembly of the dCas9 plasmid. Gibson primers are designed to exclude the truncated region while introducing the short linker sequence.
Truncations achieved thus far
Of the various truncations tested, truncations in the HNH domain was found to be very well tolerated, likely due to the highly modular nature of the domain. REC2 domain can be truncated, at the cost of around 50% activity – agreeing with literature (Nishimasu). Lastly, a small RuvCIII-2 deletion is also well tolerated.
Although other truncations were also tested, it was found that these 3 truncations combine well together i.e. negative effect on gene activation is minimal when truncations were combined. The triple truncation (∆REC2 ∆RuvCIII-2 ∆HNH, henceforth referred to as ‘∆3ple’) is especially of interest since it reduces the size of the dCas9 gene to around 3.2kB – on par with the size of Sa-Cas9.
Homology Directed Repair
CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used as a targeted genome editing tool in human cells. This is due to the simplicity of designing the guide RNA (gRNA), which can be easily designed to target any sequence. This simplicity is especially apparent when compared to previous gene editing tools which rely on protein-DNA interaction, such as meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), which are more difficult to design.
In order to achieve targeted engineering in human cells, Cas9 protein first cuts both strands of the target DNA (guided by the gRNA via complementary base pairing), making a double-strand break (DSB). The DSB is perceived as a negative signal by the cell and hence is targeted for repair. The cell repairs the DSB by either NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) or HDR (homology-directed repair). In the context of targeted engineering, HDR is preferred since NHEJ can introduce indel mutations, whilst HDR can introduce any donor sequence that we want as long as the donor DNA is flanked by homology regions.

Collaboration
This year, we have carried out several collaborations with other iGEMers.
We invited Paris Bettencourt iGEM team to present their grand-prize winning project at the International Medical Student congress organized by our university: Turgut Özal which is known in the media as the ‘most compelling medical congress with the highest number of attendees coming from across the nation and worldwide’. For collaboration matters, we organized and coordinated a SynBio workshop titled as “SynBio 4 All” to engage with the medical students and introduce them to the macrocosm of synthetic biology and iGEM.
Annually, the medical faculty of our university organizes the largest and the most qualified medical student congress in Turkey with the highest attendance. Last year, over 1,500 medical students and experts attended our congress to present, learn and discuss new researches and treatments in the field of medicine. Medical students all over the world and Turkey distinctively join to present their scientific research conducted throughout the year. Another fact is the international nature of this congress where experts and scientists such as Professor. James Yoo, famously known for his creditable work in the field of regenerative medicine attend, enriching the contents and atmosphere of the congress. Each year, our congress has an extreme impact on the media which never fails to take its place in the news and TV channels. The organization, design, coordination and configuration of the scientific program is not only carried out by a few people but in fact with the entire medical students of our university who work as a team with great delicacy, enthusiasm and in the guidance of supervisors to embody the finest congress of our country.
Researches and scientific works performed by students compose the main portion of the event. Last year, 115 oral presentation and 75 posters have taken place in our congress. The topics and scientific background of these projects are also the mainstream"

ABTS solution was prepared from ABTS aliquot by mixing 11ml Citrate buffer pH4.0 with 200µl ABTS and 20µl H2O2. ABTS solution was applied to wells and color development was measured immediately afterwards with the infinite M200 PRO plate reader at 405nm for 35min in 2.5min intervals. To calculate VEGF amounts values of time points lying in the linear standard range were used.

II Chassis Organism Safety
    The chassis organisms used in our project are E. coli MG1655 ΔsidA ΔlacI and E. coli EPI300, both of which are classified into Risk Group 1 and Safety Level 1. Because of this, they do not cause disease in healthy adult humans and are allowed to be operated in open bench. Our genetically modified bacteria were cautiously operated and discarded and surly not released to the natural environment to prevent interference to the natural environment.
III Experiment Safety
    In order to minimize potentially risks that could be brought about by certain instruments and reagents, our members were requested to use normative protective equipment and follow the safety manuals throughout our lab time. Instruments like alcohol burner, centrifugal machine and hazardous reagents like ethidium bromide were carefully used and discarded according to the safety manuals. Gloves, lab coats, pants and close-toed shoes are demanded during lab time, and it is not allowed to touch about when wearing gloves. Besides, no food or drink is allowed in the working space.

In our system this will cause dislocation of the equilibrium towards IPP production, since IPP is the five carbon building block in the rubber biosynthesis. In accordance, the reversible formation of B1-vitamin from DXP will be dislocated towards the production of DXP rather than B1-vitamin (See our model).

Degradation Model
Overview
After conducting the previous modeling, we now obtain the possible structure and the binding position of the fusion protein. The next step is to inspect on the fusion protein’s enzyme activity. We want to know the degrading efficiency under some circumstances, hence by constructing a degradation model, and expect to learn how well does the fusion protein work. Finally, we sincerely send our gratitude to OUC-China on assisting us using Gillespie algorithm to process Stochastic simulation.

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," lead                     our project to the solution of the pollution. Considering purine metabolism pathway, three enzymes, urate                     oxidase, allantoinase, allantoicase, must be synthesized to degrade uric acid to urea.”
In their project, they intended to reduce the urate concentration outside the cell as well. However, they didn't succeed                     in the end due to the lack of the exploration of parameters may influence the result and they only used                     uricase in their project. In our project, we constructed the complete pathway and verified the parameters                     to reduce the urate concentration outside the cell successfully. For their project, according to our                     experiment, we suggested them to use M9 medium to culture the bacteria then spread it to the surface                     of the bird dropping.
Dialysis-like device
The key to the treatment of refractory gout is to lower the blood uric acid concentration, but direct protein contact may                     be blocked immediately by the IgG antibodies (of a long half-life) of the uricase-resistant patient,                     so it is necessary to build a relatively independent immunologically privileged sites. Through the establishment                     of a dialysis system, we try to solve the problem of refractory gout. At the same time, if the efficiency                     of the device is acceptable, it can be used as an inexpensive treatment regimen to accelerate the dissolution                     of gout and may be able to change the principles of treatment for chronic tophi. Or even more,
We plan to overexpress the protein regulating the uric acid metabolic pathway in Bacillus subtilis to activate the pathway,                     and add an in vitro dialysis device, trying to treat patients with refractory gout who are resistant                     to intravenous treatment of uricase drugs.
We designed a dialysis device which injects the needles into the human vein in both directions and allow blood to flow through                     it. We used commercialized dialyzer in our design. In this dialyzer, the blood flows through the dialyzer                     which only allows small molecules to pass through and the bacteria remains in the another side of the                     fiber tube, unable to enter the bloodstream. The blood flow inside the tube is mainly driven by the peristaltic                     pump (Figure 14).
Figure 15 The figure of the dialysis-like system and the real device system we made.
At the point of blood exchange, blood flows into the dialysis tube; outside the dialysis tube is artificial serum medium.                     Small molecules in the blood (such as urate) can be exchanged outside through the dialysis tube.

Yeast Cell Wall
Functional analysis of heterologous GPCR signalling pathways in yeast
Graham Ladds, Alan Goddard and John Davey Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK
This article is the one that brought the cell wall to light as a potential problem for our purposes
It claims that ""Potencies for small ligands (Mw 1000) are similar in yeast and mammals, those for intermediate ligands (Mw 5,000) are about two orders of magnitude less in yeast, and large ligands such as chemokines (polypeptides with 70–80 residues) are often unable to activate receptors when applied exogenously to yeast.""

Bourne From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143 and Cadus Pharmaceutical Corporation, Tarrytown, New York 10591-6705
This article is one of the articles cited by the previous article
The GPCR used was activated by C5a, a chemokine.
The only mention of the cell wall is:
""A separate plasmid ... allowed autocrine expression of the C5a ligand as an a-factor prepro/C5a ligand fusion protein; autocrine expression was necessary because C5a cannot traverse the yeast cell wall.""

Penn,2012,Team:Penn State#Projects_-_-_TEXT.html," information about the sequence of amino acids in a protein. However, much like the lines on a sheet of paper, the protein codeine sequence of an mRNA molecule does not start right at the beginning, or top of the page. Instead, once the mRNA is bound by a ribosome, a start codon must first be read before the protein can be translated. This start codon is generally AUG, or Methionine.
Once this start codon in read the ribosome will continue reading and building the polypeptide (protein) until a stop codon is reached. But what happens if you have two AUG codons close together? That is the question we are attempting to answer.
We are trying to understand what happens when there are two start codons very close together, but out of frame. Out of frame refers to how the ribosome reads the mRNA. Remember those codons and how they are groups of three bases on the mRNA? The reading frame refers to which group of three. If you start at one base and read the bases in groups of three from that point on, that is one frame of reference. If you then move your start point ahead one base, then you are reading in a new reading frame. If you advance you starting point one more base, that is the third reading frame. If you advance it again you are now back in your first reading frame, but you have skipped the first codon. We are looking into what happens when you have multiple start codons close together, but in different reading frames. Which frame will be preferred?

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"

A.niger kinteics
A.niger degradation kinetics  As A.niger was able to degrade all the quercetin in 48h we decided to measure precidly the degradation kinetics. We followed the quercetin degradation for 32h (almost all the quercetin was degraded
We could clearly see the exponential aspect of the curb. Almost all the quercetin degradation happened between 16h and 29h. We calculated the degreadation speed between these two moments : V=(C(17)-C(29))/(29-17) = 0,8g/h This value is important to study the impact of a gene on the A.niger’s ability to degrade quercetin. If we had more time we would have done this kind of kinetics on all the fungi to compare their ability to degrade quercetin.

“Imagine a world where natural rubber is produced by gene manipulated bacteria that can facilitate the polymerization of rubber. Perhaps inside silos that can be placed underground  or in environments unusable for agriculture.”
- iGEM SDU 2013
The new and bright future.
Bacterial growth is limited only by its micro-environment. They do not need to grow on certain natural grounds with a distinct climate, but can easily be grown in industrial facilities. Scaling the production system from the wet lab of the university grounds to a production plant poses challenges, but looking beyond these, possibilities appear.
The newly established innovative production plants will not require a vast amount of time before production can commence. Bacteria only needs a matter of hours before they are able to produce, in contrast to the 7 years of maturation of the rubber tree. Furthermore , they will not need the vast areas required for plantations. The facilities can be placed on infertile land, saving the rainforest and liberating arable lands suitable for high-yielding agriculture.
It is easy to imagine"

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," gram negative bacteria, including E. coli is more oxidative than the cytoplasm and will therefore improve disulfide bond formation. So we are using the Ecotin tag to target proinsulin and Winsulin to the periplasm in the hope that they will fold correctly and form the correct disulfides.
This method also has the additional advantage that the periplasmic fraction can be extracted without lysing the entire cell, separating our insulin from cells DNA and the rest of the cytoplasmic “junk”.
Figure 6. Details of E. Coli periplasmic expression of pro/winsulin
B. Subtilis
Secretory Expression
Current methods of insulin production grow bacteria in huge vats. But bacteria like E. coli that only express the protein in the cytoplasm need to be lysed to extract it. Which means they need to drain hundreds of thousands of liters of culture to separate the cells from the media before lysing the cells and then purifying insulin from the DNA and other cellular proteins. Although we will be testing cytoplasmic E. coli expression similar to these methods, we wanted to come up with a way to efficiently separate our insulin from the cells and decided the best way would be have it secreted directly into the media.
This is where Bacillus subtilis comes in!
Bacillus has been a common tool for recombinant protein production for years and has been proven again and again that they are highly efficient secretion factories. The hope is that having the insulin separated from the cells in the media would mean that scaled up production could use a system where the media is constantly cycled out and the cells can continuously produce our insulin. As can be seen in Figure 7, expression using B. Subtilis can be very simple contributing to our goal to create an easily purifiable product.
Figure 7. Details of expression of pro/winsulin in B. Subtilis
Our Purification Process
Our insulins were designed with a 6x His sequence at the N-terminus of the insulin. This sequence, comprised of 6 histidine residues, binds to nickel. When cell lysates or media containing insulin are added to nickel beads, all of the cellular components should wash off from the beads. This separates them from insulin which remains bound to the nickel beads. As such, the 6x His tag sequence's affinity to nickel can be used to purify insulin from cells or media.
We considered two methods for the purification of our insulins: nickel columns, and nickel agarose resin. The nickel"

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the standardization template includes the upmost important information     about the Biobricks that are required for the BioGuide Software to run     its searching algorithm.
Briefly, BioGuide application is designed to catch the input and     output relations of individual parts to examine possible Biobricks pathways     for specific input and output queries. In other words, at pre-experimental     stage, it helps wet lab biologists to design their unique constructs     by revealing possible alternative options for pre-determined purposes,     along with the primary paths. Our ultimate goal is to improve the algorithm     designed for iGEM 2010 and present a new version of the BioGuide in     iGEM 2011, which will provide optimum design of constructs for predetermined     parameters.
Most of the parts are composed of functional and nonfunctional constructs     which are formed by atomic parts. And every part should carry the information     for all of its atomic parts within itself. The “input” heading actually     stands for promoters. Parts with one or more promoters can be found     at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Along with the information on which and how     many promoters a part might have, the activity level of promoters are     also important to distinguish between a constitutively active promoter     or a promoter activated by specific physiological processes or states     etc. This information was crucial for us to dissect in order to run     our algorithm as it directly affects which inputs can activate the devices     or the systems.
Throughout our investigations on the Parts Registry, we found out     that much of the terminology was being used ambiguously. Although this     might not be vital for synthetic biologists, it is still endeavoring     to understand the function of certain regulatory elements which also     becomes a time consuming task for the researcher. Thus, we recommend     that the explanations of certain regulatory elements should be redefined     and fixed especially for synthetic biology for easy communication, sharing     and searching of information.
Common misuses of the terminology can guide us to figure out how     to construct a standard nomenclature for synthetic biology. We claim     that a standard nomenclature is urgently needed for synthetic biology     for the following reasons. First of all, synthetic biology is an emerging     research discipline and an industrial application area which is highly     promising. Secondly, redefinition of the terminology to build a standard     nomenclature is needed as some of the terms are prone to be used instead     of another causing problems related to misuse for the global communication     about synthetic biology. Lastly, the nomenclature has major importance     for the construction of a persistent and trustworthy database for synthetic     biology which"

Annemi's 40 PCR reactions from yesterday didn't give any result, meaning that we still haven't succeeded in ligating our biobricks into pSB1C3. We will put this on pause for now and concentrate on ligating our biobricks into pSB4A5/pSB2K3 with GFP/RFP.
The ligations made yesterday L1-L10 were somewhat successful. All transformations besides the ones containing RFP gave colonies. Today we restreaked these colonies and tomorrow we can do O/N. We also restricted G1, G2, and RFP so we can redo those ligations that didn't work.
Annemi made a PCR og RFP and GFP. These will be purified and run on a gel tomorrow.

Got in touch with students using the BioLector (Manos and Jacopo). Made a tentative booking for weekend 9-10.10.10 (Friday 8th also possible). Jacopo will explain how to use the equipment a few days before we run the plates. Recommendation is to measure OD of a culture grown outside of Biolector (but in the same medium) to have an estimate of when best to treat with arabinose (this applies to the antirepressor system). Should treat during exponential phase. Also it's important to prepare the plate under the hood, to avoid contamination.

Computation power: More than 1,100 calculating computers are connected to the iGEM@home network and more than 100,000 jobs have already been computed in this project consuming 1.2 Million CPU hours. This is equivalent to a 28,190$ per month cloud computer cluster by amazon web services
Communication: Users of iGEM@home already posted a 190 times on into the forum (mostly providing bug reports and suggestions for further development steps). The screensaver has shown up 1300 times for an average of 2:08 hours. In this time it displayed about 40,000 screensaver slides.
For the most up to date information visit the server status page , the official BOINCstats and our forum .
2. Online survey on iGEM@home
Close to wiki freeze we conducted an online survey to gather some additional information about the users and evaluate key features of iGEM at home. The majority of survey participants are male (88%) whilst they spread widely across the age spectrum (12-88 years old). 89% of participants decided to join the iGEM@home project to support the science of the iGEM teams. Only a few users are interested in the teamwork aspect of distributed computing or in comparing computer power with other users. The survey was well received by the community and covered 20% of the total users of iGEM@home, starting with 55 replies at the first day and dropping to less than 5 replys/day at the second day.
A set of results regarding the content and setup of iGEM at home is visualized in figure 1. The data in (1) reveals that most of the participants are users we want to call ""BOINC veterans"" that already run or ran several BOINC projects on their computers (82%). Comparison of the server data with the data automatically gathered by the iGEM@home user platform reveals that the group of BOINC veterans is slightly overrepresented in the survey (82% survey/75% total users). The two populations of users differ in their attitude towards the two communication platforms screensaver and forum which is represented in the bar chart (Figure 2). BOINC veterans equally pay attention to both media whilst new users tend to focus on the screensaver. The fact that 80% of new users reviewed the slide show is an encouraging result regarding the effectivity of content distribution via the screensaver (also compare figure 1,(2) and (3)).

Lab & Researcher Safety
We keep safety at the forefront of our work. Through our day-to-day lab protocols and equipment, we aim to facilitate a safe approach to synthetic biology.
Before beginning work in the lab, all our team members took a lab safety course offered by Kim Ellison at the University of Alberta. This, along with the guidance of our PI, Michael Ellison, allowed us to become familiarized with lab work prior to working independently. Our day-to-day safety protocols include wearing appropriate PPE whenever in the lab (gloves, lab coats, closed-toe shoes, and long pants), washing our hands before exiting, tying long hair back, and strictly keeping food and drinks outside of the lab. By taking these precautions, we minimize the personal risks associated with our research.  Our lab in the Medical Sciences Building at the University of Alberta is classified as biosafety level 2, meaning that it is fit for use with moderately dangerous biological agents. Even so, all of the materials we use in the lab are well-characterized and generally non-hazardous, posing minimal hazards to our health and that of the environment. We are using a strain of E.Coli called DH5-Alpha, a non-pathogenic strain developed specifically for laboratory cloning.
Environmental Safety
We are using an E.Coli strain (DH5-Alpha) with very limited ability to survive outside of the lab, they pose virtually no risk to the environment."

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Anti-venom
- Traditional way of anti-venom production:
1. injecting venom or detoxified venom into a horse (tiny amount, multiple times)
2. After the antigen growing period, contract the horse blood plasma
3. Use stomach digestive enzyme to breakdown the anti-venom protein into smaller globin
4. Use (NH4)2SO4 to salt out the globin (purification) [1]
- Oxides like K2MnO4 can neutralise venom by denaturing the polypeptide chains - complex ligase like AuCl2 can denature venom by binding with them, when preventing venom entering the tissues [2] -immune system has a stronger response to venom [3]. When the mast cells are stimulated, they release histamine. Histamine can subside the venom - histamine producing bacteria: found in tuna; 18 types of bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens and other anaerobic bacteria
- To conclude: 1. decide the working mechanism (toxicology) of a specific type of venom: does it attack neurons? brain cells? cardiovascular system? respiratory system? 2. does it react with histamine? 3. bacterial production of histamine

INTRODUCTION
ChatterPlant proposes an innovative system to establish a bidirectional communication between plants and humans. Since Plant Synthetic Biology started to be a leading field, the Phytobricks collection has continuously been increasing. This year, we provided iGEM registry with the necessary Phytobricks to use ChatterPlant’s technology according to the philosophy of our project. Furthermore, we have contributed to the progress of Plant SynBio repository since we have characterized and used many delivered parts at iGEM Registry.
Essentially, we contributed with a compilation of Phytobricks aiming to establish a channel between plants and humans. Here, we report all used parts in this project and finally, we also report a table with the Basic Parts that we submitted to the iGEM Registry.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KaraNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," especially talking about IDEs and surface programming. Best take-away was breakpoints - started using them immediately in my code. They offer an amazing amount of information and it's all so easy to access! Trying to capture all that with printing would have taken much longer and been more of a hassle to sift through. Finally implemented drag and drop on Parts, moving from L0 search to L1 toolbox, with some little extras to keep things from tripping up or throwing exceptions or other unfortunate things. The add Parts button I put in to test a variable in a different class turned out to be invaluable for making parts to test drag and drop out on, and we finally came up with a way/implemented a way to differentiate the two types of interactions Parts have - contact and drag. It's been worrisome to think of ways to differentiate the two but I think it works fairly well! THough I might be biased, having helped code it and all. Perhaps the pilot study will prove useful for feedback in that regard. But this is great! This is the most progress we've made in days! OH AND I FINALLY GOT HOW TO GET CLASSES TO REFER TO ELEMENTS CONTAINED ELSEWHERE! Thanks to Consuelo. I feel silly for not thinking of it before, but it was just such an important breakthrough because nothing else that happened today would have been possible without it! Though there's still so much left to do, I feel a lot better about our prospects than I did yesterday. Even if we did get an ultimatum and have to hurry up and catch up with the rest of the class.
04 - 07 Jul 2012
Start of drag and drop implementation for Parts. It's nice that using ScatterViewItems gives a visual component to the behavior. They can now move between the Parts palettes at the top of Level 1 and the L1 modules inside the construction tabs. L1 modules themselves still need quite a bit of work, but they now take in Parts! Manual construction is up and running even if the addition process isn't yet the most forgiving. With the UI making progress, I got set on backend integration to give our controls some real data to work with. At the end, the string search worked but figuring out how to do filter search has been difficult. There isn't a way for us to access all of a particular part and filter those results by category.

See more information on the Biosensor webpage
Even though everything can be completed in two days, the exercise can be paused at any step by putting the DNA in a freezer. This makes the exercise adaptable to most classroom timetables, no matter how inflexible. At this moment Biosensor is in the first phase, which means that the Biosensor will not have detection promoters, but instead a constitutive promoter to show the response gene. The Biosensor kits are expected to be distributed in the Spring 2018. Biotech Academy is working on preparing a second phase kit, which will entail responsive promoters with the potential to detect specific molecules and express a chosen gene.
Content of the Biosensor kit:
1. Tube with E. coli cells DH5 alpha in 15% glycerol
2. 1 detection genes
3. 7 response genes
4. Restriction enzymes
5. Primers
6. Plasmids (For amplification of more detection and response genes)
7. Chloramphenicol

Safety
The protocol has been done in collaboration with Kresten Cæsar Torp, the subject adviser for Biotechnology of the Danish Ministry for Children, Education and Gender Equality. This has been made to make sure that it is in tune with Danish law within synthetic biology. The parts have been approved by the Danish Working Environment Authority, meaning that no application work is needed by the high school teachers in order to work with the kit.
Biotech Academy collaboration
Our collaboration with Biotech Academy has been extensive and rewarding for both sides. In the early phases of our team we hosted the BioBrick Tutorial where we invited all the nordic teams to DTU.

Jon Scott, PhD, Medical Projects Team Lead, Space Medicine Office, European Astronaut Centre. Jon told us that there is an interest in combining exercise with anabolic drugs such as PTH, GH, and IGF-1, in order to improve the effect of exercise. Furthermore, there are some drawbacks with exercise in space as it is right now such as, 1) it is time consuming, 2) not all astronauts like to do it, 3) it produces heat, CO2 and moisture and 4) it increases the consumption of food. Jon also mentioned that proteins that can be used for diagnosis and for research purposes during space travel also would be very useful to produce with our system.
Jozef Mravec, Assistant professor, Section for Plant Glycobiology, University of Copenhagen. Jozef has helped us to perform experiments with the confocal microscope in the laboratory.
Jørgen Sauer, PhD, Fermentation Scientist from Novo Nordisk. Jørgen gave us some very interesting and useful feedback on our project. We spoke with him about several aspects of our project both safety, design and technical aspects of protein production.
Jane Nøhr, PhD, Cluster Manager at Biopeople, Denmark's Life Science Cluster. Jane provided us with very useful inputs concerning both the project and the current protein production processes in industry. Jane drew our attention to the current way of protein production in the industry using Pichia pastoris. Jane also suggested us to pay special attention to yield and purity when developing our product.
Kirsten Jørgensen, Associate Professor, Work Environment Coordinator, and Vice Head for Teaching at the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen. Kirsten assisted us greatly when filling out the Safety Form and ensured that we applied for the appropriate internal safety applications to ensure we were able to do our experiments. Furthermore, she provided us with a letter of recommendation that was useful for our funding applications.
Karen McDonald, PhD, Professor at Department of Chemical Engineering, UC Davis. We got into contact with Karen through CUBES. We discussed the biomedical aspects of the proteins that we want to produce for space travel and she gave us some very valuable inputs. Karen said that the 2.5 hours of exercise per day (which is the standard right now for astronauts) might be difficult for long term space explorations and therefore some drugs would potentially be very useful when facing this problem. Karen McDonald's research group are working on producing the protein drug PTH (parathyroid hormone) in a way that is suitable for space travel. Karen McDonald also"
Caltech,2008,Team:Caltech#Project#Phage Pathogen Defense_-_-_TEXT.html," phage into the environment. Control of this aspect of the system is vital for integration with the overall iGEM project. The induction of λ phage lysogens has been explored since 1950 [6], and serves as a model system for the study of other temperate phages. The most famous induction mechanism is ultraviolet radiation (UV). In UV induction of λ lysogens, UV induced DNA damage activates the cellular SOS mechanism, which activates the expression of RecA, a protein involved in SOS response. RecA, in turn, cleaves the λ repressor and leads to phage activation. In this study, activation of the recA pathway was not readily feasible, so an alternative effector was used to elicit induction.  A secondary plasmid expressing the E. coli regulatory gene, rcsA, is used as the trigger for λ phage induction. rcsA is one of several regulatory genes which provide a recA independent pathway for λ induction [7].  Overexpression of RcsA leads to λ induction, and, furthermore, RcsA appears to directly compete with the λ repressor cI [6]. In this project, rcsA is used to trigger phage production. The effectiveness and dynamic range of rcsA induction is explored.
Constructs
Figure 1 - Constructs involved in expression of the lamB receptor and the TetA cassette
All constructs were made with standard assembly methods. lamB and rcsA were cloned out of DH10B genomic DNA. Two families of plasmids were constructed for this project. The first consists of plasmids that express the lamB receptor and the tetracycline resistance cassette. The level of lamB expression required for λ phage infection is unknown, so the strength of the promoter/ribosome binding site (RBS) combination upstream of lamB was varied between the four constructs of this family.
Figure 2 - Constructs for characterization of rcsA induction
The second family consists of constructs used to characterize rcsA induction of λ phage. rcsA was placed downstream of an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) inducible promoter, LuxR. This promoter was extensively characterized by Doug for the oxidative burst project . Using flow cytometry data, the peak response for this promoter was determined to be 10 nM AHL. Plasmids with three different RBSs in front of rcsA were constructed to characterize the response of induction. Furthermore, a promoterless rcsA construct was built as a negative control, and a construct with constitutively active"

Additionally, we hope to resolve the conflicts between environmental management approaches and economic development in desertification areas to a certain extent.
To better understand some of the social or political issues behind desertification, and the potential social impact may caused by our projects. We are going to interview Dr. David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environmental Center via Skype on October 30, 2018. Here below is the main content of our interview:
Coming soon ...
Our appointment with Dr. David Tyfield is October 30, 2018, after the  Giant Jamboree, and we will to update the interview information after the wiki is unfrozen.
Dr. David Tyfield
Dr. David Tyfield graduated from Oxford University and London School of Economics and Political Science. His current research focus on critical analysis of the emergence of a globalised knowledge-based economy, including carbon innovations, climate change and the rise of China. David works as principal investigator for research projects funded by NERC, EU, British Council and NSFC.
Interview Draft
Environment & Economy & Policy
Environmental problems such as global warming and desertification threaten global ecological security,sustainable economic and social development. How do you think of the economic impact of these environmental issues?
The knowledge economy emphasizes on the sustainable development of the environment, then what is the significance of the sustainable development of the environment to the development of the knowledge economy.
 Our society is a complex self-organizing system including social welfare and human rights organizations, government organizations and so on. These complex organizations and social components such as the physical (material) economy generate different economic forms like the environmental economy and the knowledge economy. Do you think it is contradicting to develop and protect these different economic forms at the same time (for example, for the infrastructure construction of society, it will sacrifice environmental resources). What actions should be taken by the various organizations in our society to protect and develop these economic forms? I learned that you studied biology at Oxford University and studied social science philosophy at LSE. What prompted you to shift your interests to the relationship between environmental change and the knowledge economy, or why these issues matter to you?
Desertification
 What is the moment that you deeply feel the word of “climate change” or “deserfication”? May you talk about your own experiences?
 Sometimes, desertification even may affect areas which located thousands kilometers away from the"

Apart from direct gene doping applications, the Dutch National Bloodbank Sanquin is working on methods for prenatal screening of diseases for which they have shown great interest in our method. On top of this, the RIKILT, the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research, world’s number 1 university for food technology, has shown interest in our method for safe food applications. These are only a few of the variety of extended applications of our targeted sequencing method.  The Stan Brouns Lab at Delft University of Technology is so enthusiastic about our project that they want to develop our method of targeted sequencing for broader applications. Nevertheless, the fight against gene doping might be continued as well depending on a big grant application we started. Read more on the steps we have been taking towards the future applications on our Entrepreneurship page .

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We"
Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," a dependency on non-standard amino acids for their proper translation, folding and function, as described by Mandell et al. (2015).
The kind of synthetic auxotrophy described by Mandell can be considered a more advanced and secure method of biocontainment, and in particular if combined with still other containment strategies, it would make it highly unlikely that our yeast could bypass the biocontainment. As multiple genes would be dependent on the synthetic amino acids, escaping biocontainment via mutagenesis would require mutations in a large number of genes. Horizontal gene transfer could be prevented by engineering the synthetic amino acids into any protein-coding sequences we want to prevent from transferring. In addition, as the synthetic amino acid couldn’t be scavenged from the environment, the GMOs would survive only as long as they are externally supplemented by the amino acids.
Our degradation enzyme capsule, on the other hand, would not contain any living cells - only commercial lysozyme and enzymes derived from the genetically modified microorganisms. The enzyme has a specificity for the Adda-arginine bond, which is only present in cyanotoxins. As such, the enzyme does not pose any direct threat to any form of life, even when released in the open environment. However, there may be certain organisms whose growths are kept in check by microcystin, and if large quantities of the enzyme were released into open ecosystems, the microbial ecology in the water might be severely affected. In high concentrations, lysozyme could also have drastic effects on the ecosystem, as it can can lyse the cell walls of many bacteria. However, as our plan would be to use the capsules for small quantities of water (bucket-scale), releasing this capsule in just one bucket of water alleviates such concerns; as the enzymes are scaled for such a small quantity, they would be extremely diluted when released to the open environment.
“ Cyanobacteria range in size from 0.5 to 60 micrometers in diameter, which makes them one of the largest prokaryotic organisms. ”

A software tool is defined as ""a program that is employed in the development, repair, or enhancement of other programs or of hardware."" Under this definition, the model devised by the SBR iGEM team ought to be eligible as a software tool, as it enhances the function of other programs. The main tenet of our collaboration with DTU was our ""cohesive"" process: that DTU's two programs form the ""beginning"" and the ""end"" of the transition of mycelium from spore to plug and from brick to freestanding structure, while SBR's program forms the ""middle""--the transformation of plug to brick. In that the SBR model enhances the function of DTU's two models, it ought to qualify as a software tool.
To read more about our model, please see the modeling entry here.
To read more about our collaboration with DTU on the model, and how these two may work together to produce a software tool, please see our collaboration entry here.

Week 26
This week we decided to work out the laboratory ideas in more detail. We divided our project into 4 ""subprojects"": production, transport, activation and characterization of Mgfp-5. Tania, Janneke, Carsten and I each worked on one of these subprojects. I wrote a laboratory manual for characterization of Mgfp-5. Hope to get started in the lab next week!
Week 23
After the general meeting I had a wiki meeting with Conrad and a PR meeting with Janneke. Together with Carsten I did some more research on companies that perform gene synthesis. I also put online everybody's notebook.
Week 22
On Monday we had a general meeting with the team and supervisors. After that I had a meeting with Conrad for the wiki. In the evening we presented iGEM to the DreamTeam board of the TU Delft. After that we went to the city center to have diner and drink some beers. On Tuesday Janneke and I generated ideas for PR and human practice which we worked more out on Friday. On Wednesday and Thursday I did research for gene synthesis companies.
Week 21
On Monday we presented our ideas to professors of the Department of Biotechnology and we discussed the possibilities with them. After the general meeting we we ate pancakes in the Botanic Garden for lunch. In the afternoon I had a wiki meeting with Conrad. On Tuesday we had a meeting with Han de Winde, the chairman of the Department of Biotechnology. The same week I requested bio-bricks of Berkeley Wetlab 2009, Tokyo Tech 2009 and SDU-Denmark 2010.

Professor introduce two safe ways of using biosensor: paper based biological circuit and glucose metabolism relative reporter  HXT.Paper based biological circuit can keep cell function but is cell free. If  the reporter gene HXTis used,  the change in the glucose concentration of the culture of yeast would be easy to detect by glucometer .
Investigate customer's feedback on biosensor
We went to the Beijing Foreign Studies University, to interview some professors and relatives of teachers. Do you really know about copper contamination? What are their opinions about our products? One professor told us, he really wants us to keep going what is us doing now, it is about human and environment. So we feel so proud of our product. Most of them care about the safety of biosensor, we explained paper based biological circuit, and HXT reporter gene to them. Later they are excited about synthetic biology.
Investigate supplement containing copper
 
Our Human practice group went to the drugstore, asking and finding some health products which is about copper. A waitress answered and introduced some of our questions of which is the best copper health products.In real life, there are many things that are prone to copper poisoning, such as copper supplements in pharmacies. So we went to the pharmacy to investigate.
Propagandize our project
 
On October 8th, our team went to Beijing foreign studies university affiliated middle school to tell students who are interested in biology and synthetic biology about iGEM.
First of all, Tina and Tom introduced to students what iGEM is and what iGEM is about. Then, they introduced the development history of iGEM, the spirit needed to participate in iGEM, the distribution of awards and the requirements of awards. At the same time, it also introduces what kind of sub-projects iGEM will do, and what you have gained in previous years during the competition. After all, the results are not important, but the spirit and knowledge learned in the process are the most important. Although we have not introduced our own projects yet, students have developed a strong interest and actively asked about the details of participating in iGEM competition, such as how to form a team and how to complete the experiment of their own team. I believe that our answers can help them very well.
 
After that, we told the students about the projects we participated in, such as the background introduction, experimental methods，and social activities. Will we brainstorm the ideas presented to the students, and we will build our genetic chain told the students, although most of the time we looked at all of"

Concordia,2013,Team:Concordia#Interface_-_-_TEXT.html,"R), a cis-repressor that binds the ribosome binding sequence (RBS) at the mRNA level, preventing its translation into protein, and one of three AHL synthases. Only one of these three cassettes, exists in any given cell type at any time. The synthase found in that cell represents its own state (Center) so it can produce its own distinctive AHL as a directional signal for its neighbors (Right and Left). The active AHL’s are produced from their respective synthases only when all of the following occur in the same generation:
The Gas Clock input (TetR) is not produced: TetR is made only when Ethylene gas surpasses the threshold, activating its promoter PompC. Synthesized TetR then goes and binds the promoter of the ASC and represses transcription.
The Bistable Memory input (taR12) is produced: taR12 is only produced when the state of the cell is “ON”.  taR12 can then go and bind to the inactive ASC gene transcript (cis-repressor + AHL) cleaving the cis-repressor and freeing the RBS for subsequent translation.
The active AHL’s can only perform their expected signal process when the Interface input (Signal Processing Cassette) has been synthesized: As we now know, the AHL’s require their respective receptors in order to alter DNA transcription. The receptor cassette is only synthesized when Ethylene gas surpasses the threshold since it also has the promoter PompC. This therefore separates signal formation and signal processing temporally.
Signal-processing Cassette (Receptors)
The signal-processing cassette consists of all three Receptors present in all cell types. This cassette is regulated temporally as a function of gas concentration, as explained previously. All cell types require all three receptors since each given cell will be receiving all three AHL types as an input. For example; Center- its own signal OHL, Right-its right neighbor BHL, and Left- its left neighbor OHHL. Since all three AHL’s will eventually be present in the cell the colony must be able to ‘process’ all three when needed.
Temporal Regulation of AHLs (Graph)
Below is a simulation of the gas clock and how each informational step (synthesis and processing) is regulated via the gas clock. Note how AHL synthesis and AHL processing are out of phase and never truly overlap significantly. This allows for the reliable processing of all AHLs generated in one generation and one generation alone. To achieve this pattern of expression, we needed to alter the promoter strengths of the Ompc promoter controlling AHL Synthase genes. This will be verified in"

The opportunity to interact with and get to know other teams and their projects, along with the fantastic talks given by a variety of speakers, made the meet-up a very enjoyable and beneficial experience.
FredSense
We were very fortunate to speak to David Lloyd, CEO of FredSense Technologies - a leading biosensor company based in Canada. He was able to advise our team with regards to the business side of our project. On his advice, we decided that our sensor should not cost more than 0.50 USD per sensor, in order to successfully target the developing world. When estimating manufacturing costs, David recommended considering pre-treatment requirements, such as purification of the RNA and the freeze-drying process, as well as any hardware needed. His general guide figure of the overall cost of production was less than 30% of the resale price. He also proposed additional applications for our sensors, including testing mine runoff and domestic wells in developed countries.
David identified numerous issues that FredSense determined may affect the success of biosensors. Illiteracy and poor governmental structure may prevent success in developing countries, while lack of available treatment may render identifying health hazards potentially pointless. To tackle these problems, the team proposed a colorimetric sensing system that could be supplied to charities and governmental aid associations. However, he did warn that colour is subjective, and so for application within more developed areas, such as supplying environmental consultancies, we determined that a more quantitative measurement would be more helpful. We also considered further developing our product by combining the sensor with a water purification treatment.
After more detailed discussion, the team gained a greater insight into the potential interference resulting from other metal ions present in the sensing solution – potassium for example, interferes with the detection of lead. FredSense found they had to take preventative measures to reduce the effects of arsenic on antimony detection in particular, an interaction which we had not previously considered. Following this, we decided to combat any potential interference issues we may have by treating sample water with 18-crown-6 ether. This reagent specifically binds and masks potassium and sodium ions in solution, preventing their interaction with our sensor and reducing the chance of false positives.

We collected feedback from public on the idea of DNA information storage. The comments and advices are vital input to our final design of Bio101.

Please see the Human Practices page for more details.
√ 2. Improve the function OR characterization of an existing iGEM project (that your team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.
DNA information storage is a promising direction of Synthetic Biology, there were some scientists and iGEM teams that had opened the way for us. One was CUHK’s project (https://2010.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong-CUHK ) in 2010. Their system aims to store text information into DNA. We appreciate their achievements, but there are some limitations in their solutions.
(1) It can only transform text files.
(2) There are too many homopolymers (i.e., repeated consecutive bases or repeated bases fragment, such as AAAAAA or TACTTACTTACT) in the encoded DNA sequences.
(3) It does not provide an appropriate error correction component in their system. If a small part of the encoded DNA sequences goes wrong, its influence is deadly for the whole system.
Our system solved these problems. The comparison between the two projects are given in Table 1. In addition, we proposed a DNA editing protocol based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system.
Please see the Features page for more details.

√ 3.Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
Bio101 has been tested internally and externally. We and our collaborators carried out a series software tests from its usability and stability and the results were documented in a detailed testing report. The distributions of A, G, C, T and higher-order combinations of the nucleotides are similar and homopolymers are rare. We also use massive data to test limit of homopolymers the max number eleven and the most of the longest competitive bases between eight to ten. To identify fault tolerance capacity, we damage artificially the encoded sequences by deletion, insertion, and replacement. But we can still recover the information successfully.
In addition, we went through the whole process"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters,"

Bioethics
When conducting biological experiments, it is imperative that scientists and researchers conduct themselves in an ethical and responsible manner. According to Michigan State University, bioethics is the discussion surrounding how scientists, researchers, and the general public must conduct themselves in regards to biological issues. In recent decades, bioethics has brought about significant changes in regards to the treatment of the sick and the manner in which biological research is conducted. For example, it is imperative that any participant in a research trial or any patient in a clinical setting be informed of what is being done to their body by the scientist or doctor in charge in terms that the participant can understand. This is because in order to consent to a particular course of action, a person must be informed of the risks, less he/she be taken advantage of.
In regards to the sensing of estrogenic molecules, there are a variety of ethical issues which must be considered. For one, announcing that a particular body of water has detectable levels of estrogenic molecules opens up a lot of potential privacy issues. For example, our sensor might potentially be used in a college dorm bathroom. The sensor could report the presence of birth control and thus compromise the privacy of the individuals using the restroom. Another potential issue is the fact that the results from the sensor could put farms at risk, as many times runoff from farms is a source for estrogenic activators. Thus, without ethical standards to guide the usage of the sensor it can be used in ways which are detrimental to the general public.
