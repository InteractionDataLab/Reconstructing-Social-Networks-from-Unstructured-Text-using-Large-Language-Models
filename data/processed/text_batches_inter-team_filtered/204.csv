ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," DIY syringe pumps.
For the mass transfer of the target molecule from air into medium, we designed and built a bubbling device , allowing the integration of this step on a small scale.
Software
For the read-out of our engineered biosensors, we developed an image processing software. It can analyze obtained microscopy data (i.e. luminescence or tumbling frequency) and compute the respective input.
For controlling our whole robot, we further developed a software package that takes care of autonomously planning its movement and controlling its components such as our syringe pumps, bubbling device, microscope and actuators.
As our overall aim was to detect sources of pollutants, we also designed an algorithm which allows AROMA to reliably track molecules to their source, which we iteratively refined with the help of our integrated model.
Biology
We successfully employed E. coli’s highly sensitive and rapid chemotaxis system to sense molecules of interest in a matter of seconds by tethering them to a glass surface and analysing their rotational direction.
We devised an additional very fast biosensor design that employs split luciferase complementation upon binding of a transcription factor to DNA.
We established an assay for efficiently screening very large mutant libraries and optimized protocols for library generation in order to lay the foundations for tailoring the specificity of the Tar receptor.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the unique order of the chain list. However, it is not always so: equal chains in the above sorting may be equivalent or not. It is due to the assumption that two bound parts are taken as equal if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those parts: the details are hidden in the nodes of all trees. Hence, similar to the chain sorting, we need to find another strategy to sort nodes as well as trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bound state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of nodes' weight of trees makes it possible to sort all children of each node, which is a prerequisite for generating Huffman codes (see below). And then the tree order in the forest could be uniquely determined by sorting the root node of each tree.
Exchange of the first and second chain. The tree structures are different before and after exchange: the two chains are not equivalent.
Back to the question above, if two chains are equal in the first stage sorting, which should be arranged in front of the other? The answer could be obtained by exchanging them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees and subsequently the tree and forest structure. If the forest structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know"

Short Summary
In order to generate our toolbox , we used mutated variants of two different aminoacyl tRNA/synthetases complex pair. We proved that the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids through the amber codon poses as a major metabolic burden for the cells. In addition, we demonstrated that the aminoacyl tRNA/synthetases we used in our toolkit are very different in specificity, leading to inefficient incorporation of non canonical amino acids (ncAA). Therefore, we decides to generate  our own aminoacyl tRNA/synthetase variants and enabling so the most efficient selection of aminoacyl tRNA/synthetase candidates.
Comparison of Different Aminoacyl tRNA/Synthetases
Generating our Toolbox, we used variants of two different aminoacyl tRNA/synthetases (aminoacyl tRNA/RS), namely tyrosyl and pyrrosylyl . While apllying our toolbox, we recognized that the Escherichia coli cells containing different aminoacyl tRNA/RS plasmids had different characteristics. We could further confirm this"

-minimal medium [salts, Mg, ]
-minimal medium + Casamino acids (which doesn’t contain Tryptophan)
-minimal medium + Casamino acids + Tryptophan
Results
Density
The cultures were grown overnight. In the morning, the absorption was measured to compare population growth. All tubes were cloudy with cultures apart from the control.  Both strains in minimal medium grew at the same rate, proving that the indole-free strain was a vigorous. For both strains the min.medium + casamino Acid contained approximately twice the bacteria concentration as the min.medium alone.  This was expected as the lack of amino acid restricts the growth of bacteria. There was no significant difference in population concentration between the Tryptophan and Tryptophan free medium for the Ecoli-T strain. This is understandable as these bacteria cannot use this added amino acid either way. There was a slight increase in population for the Ecoli + T strain. This shows Tryptophan does limit to some degree the growth of bacteria but not very much.
Odour
To compare scent given off, all cultures were grown to a same OD (optical density). When this was achieved, the tubes were smelt blind by different people outside our own lab. The Ecoli-T strain had a pleasant smoky odour, very distinct from the wild Ecoli+T strain. The Ecoli+T strain smelled only very mildly in the Tryptophan free medium and had the full pungent smell with Tryptophan.
Conclusion
1- Ecoli-T (indole free strain) grew as efficiently as the standard E-coli strain, thus demonstrating their virulence. This strain did not produce the pungent smell thus proving that indole is indeed the culprit.
2- E-coli grown on minimal medium produce significantly less indole and therefore have less pungent smell.
The culture took 6h longer to reach the same population density as the E-coli optimum medium.
3-We recommend using Ecoli-T (indole free) strain to have lower smell and prevent over masking other volatiles.
4- As a more accessible alternative, we suggest to other teams who would not have access to Indole free E-coli strains to grow E-coli on minimal medium (protocol described above) with up to 6h more of incubation (however this is not essential to get adequate yield for a miniprep)

The 6th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference
In summer, we attended The 6th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference hosted by NCHU Taichung. The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session, which not only serves as a drill for the coming jamboree, but also inspires us with new ideas and valuable advice we can make good use of.Taking an active part in the conference, we shared our ideas and studies in synthetic biology and made a great deal new friends with different backgrounds.

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," before miniprepping.
While the reduction in plasmid level above shows that control of copy number is possible, more exciting is the possibility of total plasmid loss. It is in fact the possibility of reducing copy number to zero which gives copy number control its appeal: it forms a permanently settable switch, which will always be off even if the inducer levels later change, as well as reducing background expression of genes on the plasmid to zero. In Figure 10 below, we have looked at plasmid loss by measuring the loss of antibiotic resistant cells after a period of nonselective growth. The results are consistent with the copy number results above: the number of cells containing the Lac-Ori plasmids is reduced, with a greater reduction for the medium and weak promoter versions; and similarly for the Tet-Ori plasmids. The largest difference is for the medium-strength TetO origin; which is reduced by about 104. This is consistent with the only plasmids remaining after overnight growth being the plasmids which were introduced in the initial innoculum- a near-total repression of plasmid replication.
                        
Fig 10. Bacterial cultures were grown at 37oC in LB broth overnight under selective conditions that favoured plasmid maintenance [chloramphenicol (0.3 uL/mL) and either IPTG (0.05 mM) or ATC (1.07 nM)]. As a starting point, the number of viable cells in each culture was determined by spotting 5 uL of 10-fold serial dilutions ranging from undiluted to 10-6 (7 spots/culture) onto LB-agar plates containing chloramphenicol and either IPTG or ATC at the concentrations cited above. Cell count/mL of culture was determined by counting (or estimating) the number of colonies at the highest resolvable dilution and multiplying by the dilution factor. Fresh cultures were then made by inoculating one uL of the original cultures into 5 mL of LB broth under conditions that favoured plasmid loss (no antibiotic or inducer, -/-) or plasmid maintenance (with inducer but no antibiotic, +/-; or with both, +/+) and grown as above. The number of viable cells remaining under non-selective conditions were determined as described above.
Finally, we wanted to demonstrate that we could control plasmid copy number and cell survival in a spatially controlled manner. For this we plated our copy control plasmid strains on inducer gradient plates with antibiotic. The results are shown in Figure "

OVERVIEW
The core of our scientific project is to use synthetic biology approaches to create new cellulose-sourced materials. This project is definitively ambitious and likely to have broad implications in people's everyday lives. As such, human practices were the bedrock of our efforts (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Topology of the human practices during the Cerberus project
First, public and professional needs for such new materials were explored to refine our project. We also investigated their expectations and fears about biotechnologies and what functionalised cellulose could change for them (we also answered the same questions as did fellow iGEMers from Canada and Singapore!). Since we are not full-time scientists (yet!), we needed help from synthetic and structural biologists, chemists and specialists in biotechnologies to choose the best approaches. With this key information, we defined an ethical matrix to identify the most challenging societal issues of our project. All these considerations were used to conceive and to position our project.
We are truly convinced tomorrow's fabrics will be functionalised (for clothes and more). For us, iGEM is only a first step and we are therefore committed to a detailed entrepreneurship effort. We sought help from companies to ensure the relevance of our manufactured products on the market, and from business developers to go beyond science and processes and move our project towards becoming a start-up.
Last but not least, we engaged deeply in educational efforts since it was clear from our Integrated Human Practices that only knowledge could help people to understand and accept our innovation. We used educational visits on local and national scales involving children, high-schoolers and the general public to explain what we do, how we do it and why we do it.
INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
The Cerberus project was designed to offer countless new possibilities for cellulose functionalisation and beyond, so that it should impact a lot of people in their everyday lives. Our first priority was therefore to meet these people and talk over their fears and expectations and orientate our project accordingly. We conducted interviews with manufacturers and created surveys for both professionals and"

3. The cultures were subsequently induced with 1 mM IPTG and left to grow for 6 hours in a shaking incubator at 20oC.
4. They were then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4200 rpm at 4oC.
5. The pellets were then resuspended in 5 ml of ice cold 50 mM 7.5 Tris and transferred to a 50 ml falcon tube and then topped up to 40 ml with 50 mM 7.5 Tris.
6. They were then spun down again at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4oC, the supernatant discarded and pellets stored at -20oC.

What the team accomplished：
We start in the lab and our brainstorming of HP in May 2018. Most importantly, we started working on our project in November 2017 – inviting well-known iGEMer and professors at home and abroad to give lectures to help students know and understanding the synthetic biology engineering design and construction ideas, so that students really feel the wonders and creativity of this field.
1 We conduct public communication with video and interactive activities at the campus culture festival to promote IGEM and synthetic biology
2 We learned more about hyperuricemia from Hospital through expert interviews, affirming the value of this project.
3 We set up the “IGEM Classroom” and went to Dalian Xianglujiao Primary School in June 2018, and went to the affiliated high school of Dalian University of Technology in September 2018. What worth mentioning is that It is worth mentioning that this time we have established a long-term human practice base with high school and distributed course materials free of charge. After this 2018 competition, we will continue to go to high school to start theoretical and experimental courses on synthetic biology. Here is the syllabus.

Figure 3: Chromatogram of wash and elution fractions from FLPC Ni-NTA His-tag Purification of BHAL produced by 12 L fermentation of E. coli Rosetta Gami 2 with <partinfo>BBa_K863022</partinfo>. BHAL was eluted by a concentration of 50 % (equates to 250 mM imidazol) with a maximal UV-detection signal of 123 mAU.
The chromatogram shows two distinguished peaks. The first peak was detected at a Ni-NTA-equilibration buffer concentration of 5 % (equates to 25 mM imidazol) and resulted from the elution of weakly bound proteins. Contrary to our expectations, the chromatogram shows the second distinguished peak. This peak was detected at a Ni-NTA-equilibration buffer concentration of 100 % (equates to 500 mM imidazol) and resulted from the elution of bound protein. Earlier measurements of other bacterial laccases showed that the elution of these laccases begins with a elution buffer concentration of 50 %(equates to 250 mM imidazol). One explanation of this result could be a low concentration of the produced BHAL. Consequently all elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect BHAL. In the chromatogram no further peaks were detected. The following increasing UV detection signal by increasing concentration of the eltutionbuffer results from the rising imidazol concentration of the Ni-NTA elution buffer. The corresponding SDS-PAGES are shown in Figure 4.

2. Weaknesses
Not as experienced in business development and management as competitors might be.
The research and development pipeline depends on cutting edge high-technology, which increases the difficulty of research and engineering.
The growing pace may be slow at first, as large amounts of initial sequence to function data is required to be collected to reach a certain breaking point in enzyme engineering.
3. Opportunities
Accelerating demand in the synthetic enzyme market.
Collaboration with already established large enzyme engineering or pharmaceutical companies.
4. Threats
Harsh competition in the catalytic biomolecule engineering and similar industries.
Extremely long incubation times for life science startups and spin-offs.
Conclusions
Our research and development pipeline consisting of CAT-Seq for data acquisition and ReactionGAN for novel enzyme generation has a tremendous potential to disrupt the synthetic biology and enzyme engineering markets. We have taken the first steps by analyzing our business case. Moreover, we have submitted a patent application just before the iGEM competition in order to protect our intellectual property.
There’s is a great amount of toxic chemical catalysts used every day all over the planet, and there is only one reason for that - the lack of catalytic biomolecules for various reactions. For that reason, we believe that it is important for us to continue developing CAT-Seq and accelerate the production Novel, Synthetic and Environmentally friendly Enzymes."

Our Team Leaders
Shanti Ricke
Teamleader and jack of all trades.
Did you know that Shanti is one of the most known persons in our faculty? (Even though iGEM HQ called him ""Shampi"".)
He can barely walk around the campus without greeting every other person he meets. Which makes it difficult to accompany him if you lack the time to do so. But if you need anything or anybody he is your man. As our girl for everything he is involved in every aspect of our project, starting from a major part of the project design, over human practices, organizing laboratories and guest speakers, the moderation of team meetings, managing social media accounts, coordinating the scientific divisions and public representation. In his free time he studies Molecular Life Sciences, when he finds time with all his other responsibilities, mainly iGEM at the moment.
Alina Nicolai
Teamleader
Alina was one of our two primary team leaders this year, studies biology in the 5th semester and will finish her Bachelor next year. She worked in the S1- and S2- lab and was together with Shanti the master-brain behind designing our parts. She was also involved in sponsoring, our wiki and human practices.  In her brilliance and urge to follow the protocols she stands in nothing behind Hermione Granger. For safety she owns her own special Sneakoscope!
Elisabeth Orlowski
Deputy Teamleader
Elli is studying molecular life sciences, finally in the Master program after being stuck between her BA and MA for some bureaucratic issues for quite a time. Therefore she is involved in the biochemistry and microbiology lab work.
According to our team, Elli must be a reincarnated niffler, snatching everything that looks shiny or sparkling. However she lacks the quality to squeeze herself through doors and the like, an ability which could solve our financial problems easily.
In the lab Elli is our queen of toxicology and responsible for killing the bacteria and hopefully not the human lung cells.
On a sidenote Elli drinks most likely the most coffee on our team, funnily this does not help her to get woke so she is often late in"

WORK FROM OTHER IGEM TEAMS
The following teams have used some component of our phage system previously.  No other teams have used our method of polyphage with incorporated leucine zippers for polymerization (nor is it present in the literature).
In 2006 the McGill team attempted to use leucine zippers fused to split YFP to display on cells and cause the cells to adhere via the split YFP.
The 2009 Freiburg Bioware team used Fos/Jun for a 'programmable enzyme' using Fok-fused Fos/Jun as factor in DNA cleavage.
The 2009 Paris team attempted to use Jun/Fos as a snare; Jun on signal vesicle, Fos on membrane of receiving cell.
This year, Duke's team is using Jun- and Fos-based synthetic leucine zippers for genetic regulation.

Troubleshooting: Are adaptors/barcodes attached properly?
During the library prep, usually about 20% of material was lost in the beads purification step. Interestingly, 50% of all material was lost in the final purification of the library. This step should potentially be optimized as this could be one of the reasons for low throughput.
Hypothesis
It was not certain whether the barcodes and adaptors were attached properly. If some of these steps fails, all the subsequent part would most likely fail as well and therefore lead to low sequencing throughput. In order to test if the library preparation has been done correctly, we prepared a library of standard lambda phage DNA (provided with the kit for troubleshooting). Table 2 shows the yields at the various steps. Interestingly, large amount of material is lost at the adaptor ligation step.

Results in figure 1 suggest that there is relatively small amount of DNA (low sequencing throughput), which can be caused by loss of material during the bead purification step.
Figure 2. Quality score of obtained reads.
Graph shown in figure 2 shows that reads are of high quality. In our actual sequencing runs, reads were always of very low quality. This result suggests that low quality/amount of passed reads is most likely due to input material (cDNA library) rather than to the library preparation itself.
We have seen that when library from genomic DNA is performed, sequencing is of decent quality. The throughput is also rather low, but quality of reads is high, something that has never been achieved with our library. We can therefore assume that in general, library preparation has one issue which is common across all experiments. The issue is most likely loss of material during bead purification which leads to lower throughout"

CVode Wrapper
Fig. 1 Comparison of CVode speedup. Picture taken from Vanlier J. 2010
When every evaluation of the posterior requires solving a set of ordinary differential equation, generating several thousand samples can be quite time consuming. Hence speeding up the solving routine is desirable.
By replacing the Matlab ode solvers by C++ scripts one can achieve a speedup of the calculations of up to two magnitudes.
A Wrapper to easily migrate from Matlab ode code to c++ scripts is easily done with the CVode Wrapper provided by the Systems Biology group from TU Eindhoven [Vanlier, 2010] .
Sensitivity Analysis
To assess in what magnitude changes in parameters are reflected in the simulation, one can perform sensitivity analysis. Absolute sensitivity is obtained by computing the total differential of the right hand side of the differential equation with respect to each parameter.
The solution to this matrix valued differential equation gives us the absolute sensitivity for every species with respect to every parameter. Multiplying every entry of this matrix with the value of the species and divide it by the value of the parameter for every point in time gives the relative sensitivity.
Vision
Bayesian Inference fits into the setting of BioBricks very well: Priors are small parts that are added to your simulation, and either you improve them by performing inference yourself and adding the resulting marginal distribution of the parameter as new, improved prior or you only use them to simulate the system.
As the number of teams increases every year and more and more data is generated over the years, the incremental nature of the method will great improvements to the quality of models.
The repertoire of methods displayed here represents only a small fraction of the methods available via Bayesian Inference. Bayesian Inference also offer powerful tools to

Construction of E. coli base GFP injector
Fig.5
Conceptional figure of the project
   We have made a T3SS test construct on the tetracycline resistant plasmid [pSB1T3] and transform it to the E. coli (K-12) carrying pBAC-SPI-2 as shown in (Fig.5). It was reported that N-terminus 191 amino acid residues of SlrP (one of the natural effector protein of SPI-2 encoded T3SS) function as a T3 secretion signal domain in Salmonella [6] . And it was also reported that GFP can be secreted through T3SS of Yersinia [5] . So, we fused the N-terminus 191 a.a. of SlrP with the N-terminal of GFP. In addition we located triple NLS (Nuclear Localization Signal) repeats between the T3 secretion signal and GFP so that the injected GFP would localize inside of the nucleus in the target cell. This [T3signal-NLS-GFP] fusion gene is under control of inducible arabinose promoter. In contrast RFP reporter gene, which is joined to the down stream of the GFP construct, is under control of a constitutive promoter. So, if arabinose is added to the culture medium, E. coli produces both GFP and RFP so that the bacteria become yellow. However, if arabinose is not added, only RFP is produced so that the bacteria become red. We have registered the T3SS signal domain mentioned above as a new BioBrick part.
Bacteria and cell culture condition
   To perform the injection assay, we used LB medium (1.0% Bacto-Tryptone,  0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 1.0% NaCl) and magnesium minimal medium (MgM) [11] containing 170 mM MES-NaOH buffer(pH=5.0 or 7.2), 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 8 uM MgCl2, 38 mM glycerol and 0.1% casamino acids. We named these medium as MgM5(pH=5.0) and MgM7(pH=7.2). Also we used the acidic cell culture medium"

According to the Table.1, we could easily found that there is an obvious difference between experimental group and control. Under the anaerobic condition, L-lactate dehydrogenase, coding by LdhA, acts much better ability than under aerobic condition. However, the final pH value of culture fluid is bigger than pKa of lactic acid. We suppose that the bacteria take advantage of lactic acid, due to the lack of carbon source.
○ Conclusion
There are too many kinds of acid, so we didn’t have enough time to verify them. However, we chose LdhA, coding lactate dehydrogenase which converts pyruvate to lactate, as our model gene to test in our whole system. According to the result, we could confirm that our acid production part is working. However, it’s not difficult to find that most of acid production genes are related to oxidative respiratory chain, and others verified them through gene silence. So we prefer to introduce CRISPR/Cas to make this part work better.The summary of acid synthesis library is shown below(Table.2).

Error-Prone PCR
○ Background
Similar with Polymerase chain reaction(PCR), error-prone PCR is also a powerful method to produce linear DNA fragments, but results in random mutagenesis. This mutagenic PCR, which introduces random mutations by reducing the fidelity of the DNA polymerase[25]. This process is similar to standard PCR cloning of a target sequence except that, for constructing a diverse mutagenesis library, a much larger pool of transformants are needed to increase the diversity of the library, making the process tedious and inefficient[26]. As a result, various processes have been developed to streamline the methods.

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," at the University. Food Nation is a social enterprise based in Newcastle with a vision to inspire people about good food, they have extensive knowledge about consumers views on food products.
Listening to Food Nations story and learning about the good food initiatives they’re involved with led us to re-evaluate the values of our own project. The food companies we visited prior to Food Nation ( GrowModule365 , Growing Underground , GrowUp Urban Farms ) were all commercial enterprises – but we loved Food Nation's approach to social enterprise, promoting initiatives owned by local communities and businesses, any profits of which go back into the community. Prior to this, our proposed economic model for the tunnel would have looked something similar to that of the commercial enterprises; however, we began to see the potential of the Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm as a resource that could be owned and maintained by the communities that use it: an educational tool, an accessible source of fresh produce, or perhaps even a food bank.
If we take this project further after the Giant Jamboree, Food Nation have the contacts to enable us to conduct thorough public consultations as well as the relevant contacts within the local council who could potentially make a concept like the Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm possible. By engaging with Food Nation we have started a conversation locally about the adaptive re-use of the Victoria Tunnel as an urban farm.
Conclusion
Our thorough approach to stakeholder engagement has had a huge impact on the outcome of our project. The Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm concept was our way of bringing it all together: stakeholder engagement, safety, hardware, and wetware. Moreover, it gave us the opportunity to demonstrate our vision of what a sustainable urban future may look like for Newcastle – a future that uses land efficiently, a future that reduces the pressure on the agriculture industry to use synthetic fertilisers... a future for sustainable agriculture.
Human Practices
Step 4:  Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm
A trip to the tunnels demonstrated their size and potential as a growing environment and we began to consider the possibility of our design becoming realised.
The Victoria Tunnel is 3.9 kilometres in length and runs under many urban 'hubs’ that could utilise an urban farm (For example: Newcastle and Northumbria University campuses & The Royal Victoria Infirmary). See the Key for more urban hub examples.
Human Practices
Architectural Representations
The east context city section shows a fraction of the Tunnel running underneath the city. With a maximum depth of 85 feet (26 m) it drops 222 feet (68 m) from entrance to exit. It remains largely intact. Isolated environments such as the tunnel would pose little risk to the"
Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project Gene Testing_-_-_TEXT.html," miniprep. No DNA was yielded in this miniprep. It is therefore likely that the plasmid was not transferred to these bacteria but that they either possess natural antibiotic resistance or were able to survive on plates that whose antibiotics had already been depleted by the presence of resistant engineered bacteria.
A possible experiment could be using all three samples, the sample from the sterile plate, and the two from the non-sterile plate showing E. coli-like and non-E. coli-like morphologies for 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing (using commonly used primers[1]) to determine the bacterial species.
This result is extremely important as it shows that plasmids can be retained in E. coli for a very long period of time even in the presence of competition when inoculated in soil. This gives us an indication of the life-span our chassis would have in the soil in its implementation stage. In addition, long retainment of the plasmid means that the chance for horizontal gene transfer increases, rendering this result very important for the Gene Guard module.

1.2 Plasmid retainment
After observing survivability and growth of E. coli in soil, we assumed that the plasmid containing sfGFP ( BBa_K515105 ) had been retained in the cells for 7 weeks either due to the bacteria being in static state or due to very slow growth of the cells. In order to test this assumption, we wanted to observe the retainment of plasmid within our chassis in optimal growth conditions without the presence of selective antibiotics. For this observation we required cells which would be continuously dividing. We grew cells in LB for a number of days and supplied the bacteria with fresh LB medium each day so that the microbes went through the different growth phases of bacterial maturation every day. In addition, a small proportion of the culture was plated on an antibiotic-containing agar plate each day and grown overnight to observe the extent of plasmid loss.
Figure 3: E. coli cells grown in LB without antibiotic and subsequently plated on the selective plate have been imaged using Fujifilm LAS 3000 Imager. The samples have been plated after a) 1 day, b) 14 days. In sample after 1 day growth single colonies can not be observed due to high cell density which was plated. In sample after 14 days of growth, decrease in the bacterial density and decrease in fluorescence can be seen. The bacteria were imaged using GFP excitation and emission wavelengths and the picture was kept in the original greyscale format. (Data by Imperial"

Operations and Manufacturing
Another important aspect of our business is how we will manufacture and distribute our product. It is important to consider factors such as cost, location and timeline. Through a partnership with a local manufacturing group, we have established an operational plan that we hope can achieve our production goals at low cost.
Manufacturing: Prototypes
Developing Prototypes and Manufacturing Models
With a technology implementation plan in place we have developed drawings and plans to be able to optimize our prototype system and prepare it as a product for delivery into the market. We have created detailed sketches of several potential designs for both the detector and cartridge components of our system. We have developed lower cost models using technologies such as microfluidics devices. Microfluidics offers a distinct advantage in terms of price per unit that must be produced.  Because it is on a micro scale, it uses less of each reagent and component making them more simple to handle and effective to use. Please note, that the numbers reported on this page however reflect a cuvette style cartridge.
In order to protect our intellectual property, we have not presented these sketches here. Please feel free to contact us for more details however!

EPFL were also working with toehold switches, and they gave us great advice on how to overcome our problem homologous miRNAs. We designed a second series of switches having read the paper they recommended, and the advantages of these switches make our sensor better suited to clinical use. Take a look at our design and integrated human practices pages for more.
Oxford (see cruzi)
Oxford ’s modeling team checked our MATLAB code and differential equations. They pointed out that our parameters were not dimensionally homogeneous, which we fixed. They also sent us Karzburn’s 2011 paper, ‘Coarse grained dynamics of a protein synthesis in a cell free system’, where we found a value for our constant of translation. They also ran stochastic simulations for us - take a look at our modeling page to see the results.

High school teams guide
We’d like to thank the high school teams who kindly completed the survey about their iGEM experiences. Their input was vital to the high school guide we produced.
We explain the common problems and how they can be overcome, providing actionable advice on everything from fundraising to lab work, including tips from a PI’s perspective. We hope that it inspires new high schools to take part in and succeed in the competition.

UK iGEM Meetup
On the 17th and 18th of August,  we attended the UK iGEM meetup hosted by the  Westminster, UCL and Warwick iGEM teams. This was a great opportunity for us to present our project to others. We delivered a formal presentation, and explained our project at poster sessions. We were also able to find out more about other teams’ projects and their work.
We were able to set up links with some of the teams there  which led to some of our collaborations. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams with more experience and get advice on things like poster design or presentation skills.

Based on the digest, it was concluded that all samples except CP2 (BBa_J23119) and PalcA (BBa_2092002) gave us a positive conformation of the plasmid. We repeated the digest for CP2 and PalcA with several other enzymes and managed to get a positive verification of CP2 but not PalcA.

We then proceeded to send two biological replicates of PalcA (BBa_K678001) for sequencing to confirm that the part obtained is correct. The sequencing results confirmed that two restriction sites – XbaI and SpeI are absent from the BioBrick Prefix and Suffix .
Table 3. Table outlining the sequencing results of 2 PalcA biological replicates (a) and (b). It can be concluded that restriction sites XbaI and SpeI are absent.
Figure 5. Multiple sequence alignment between the original PalcA (BBa_K678001) gene sequence adapted from the iGEM Registry and two biological replicates (a, b) of PalcA BioBrick we received sequenced by Eurofins Laboratories Ltd. It can be concluded that restriction sites XbaI and SpeI are absent.
Hence, we decided to add another element to our project – an improved BioBrick by adding the two missing restriction sites on the Prefix and Suffix.
Constitutive Promoter (CP) Characterization
Our choice of constitutive promoters comes from the constitutive promoter family created by iGEM Berkeley 2006. We tested two of two constitutive promoter variants, variant 1 (CP1, BBa_J23100 ) and variant 3 (CP3, BBa_J23110 ) that are present in the BBa_J61002 backbone that contains mrfp1 gene downstream of the promoter, which encodes the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1).  CP2 (BBa_J23119) , however, comes in a different backbone psB1A2 and does not have the mrfp1 gene"

The * notation stand for the significance of difference in a group, the more * a group has the more significant the difference in that group would be. Significant difference only occurs when SpyCatcher-CotA was used to fix onto the biofilm or the negative control group. Which means that SpyCatcher-CotA can combines effectively with CsgA-Spytag.

Furthermore, Lim provided some feedback on our idea to combat skin infections with lysostaphin and shared some requirements our device should fulfill. Most importantly, the patch must be user-friendly such that it can be applied by a nurse at home. It must thus be safe and easy to handle. Koen Lim liked the ability of our patch to be freeze-dried. He also said we should aim to kill the major bacterial strains contributing to wound-infections rather than one strain only. We will thus examine the option to make our bacteria produce more proteins than only lysostaphin.
Insights
Wound care is no medical specialism, which means that care is poorly coordinated. Due to a lack of standards, the quality of treatments differs between hospitals.
Currently, no proper treatment exists for complex wounds. This makes wound healing a “desperate market: one dies with their wounds, but not due to them.”
Wound care is estimated to cost the Dutch health care system 1.5-2 billion euros annually.
Home care nurses play a crucial role in wound care, as most of the treatments take place at home. It must thus be easy for nurses to work with our plaster.
Almost all diabetic wounds are infected. Almost everyone uses antibiotics for that reason. Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, treatments are less effective. A clear need exists for alternatives! An additional reason why an alternative to systemic antibiotics is demanded, is the disturbance of the gut microbiota caused by antibiotics. Diabetic patients generally already have a disturbed gut microbiota, and this is worsened by antibiotics.
The most difficult wounds occur in older people with poor blood circulation. This makes that wounds barely heal, particularly in the legs and feet, regions which suffer most from reduced blood flow. These older patients are usually diabetic patients, as diabetes affects blood vessels. At the same time, the reduced blood flow affects the nerve system, making that patients feel less pain. They may not notice that they have a wound on their feet. In the worst-case scenario, feet"

How would iGEM CMUQ team collaborate and benefit the TecCEM team ?
We would characterize their plasmid. The plasmids sent would already be cloned in the backbone of pSB1C3. We would have to transform the pSB1C3 plasmids in E. coli strains and characterize the protein expressed. The TecCEM team would provide us with the size of the proteins. The type of column that would be used in the characterization would be Ni column (if available). The team would send their linearized plasmids to CMU-P then CMU-P would send the linearized plasmids to  CMU-Q. This would hopefully shorten the time taken for the plasmids to arrive.
How can TecCEM team benefit iGEM CMUQ team ?
Saliva samples from the local people would be sent and analyzed using the fluorescent device. In the project description,  “In middle eastern populations many carriers are unaware of the mutations that they can pass on to their children and the risk that their offspring are born with the disease.” . TecCEM team can help us test different ethics and populations of the world by sending saliva samples from Mexican people that are carriers of the disease.
TecCEM team would characterize the Cas12 protein. We would send the sequence cloned in pSB31C plasmid to them and they would characterize the Cas12 protein.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," structure of FPP the precursor for nootkatone.
The precursor FPP is converted into valencene by a valencene synthase (ValS). We chose the one from Callitropsis nootkatensis because of its comparably high efficiency in microorganisms. It achieves greater yields in yeast than the citrus valencene synthase. Furthermore, the product specificity is relatively high, while production of byproducts is low Beekwilder et al. (2014) .  The valencene synthase was also chosen because of its robustness towards pH and temperature changes Beekwilder et al. (2014) .   Our modelling approach revealed that for optimal yields an overexpression of valencene synthase is necessary because of its slow conversion rate (Model) . This is why we chose the strongest promoter of the yeast toolbox (Dueber Toolbox) for this attempt.
Figure 7.2:ValS lvl.1 PTS1 plasmid
Figure 7.3: The structure of valencene, an intermediate of nootkatone
The intermediate valencene is then converted into nootkatol by a P450 monooxygenase as well as into small amounts of our desired product nootkatone.  The P450 monooxygenase we chose for this project was taken from the bacterium Bacillus megaterium. In this  case it is not only a simple P450 monooxygenase, but an entire P450 system, consisting of a soluble P450 fused to a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) enzyme, making an additional reductase obsolete De Mot et al. (2002) .     Unlike eukaryotic P450s, which are mostly membrane bound, this prokaryotic BM3-P450 is located in the cytosol facilitating an easier transport into the peroxisome, as membrane integration of proteins is a more difficult task to achieve than import of cytosolic proteins Girvan et al. (2006) .   BM3 normally catalyzes the hydroxylation of long chain fatty acids Narhi et al. (1986) , which in our case could inhibit the conversion of valencene. For that reason we used a mutated version of BM3, which is called AIPLF. This variant is an enhanced version of the BM3 AIP version, which has a ten times better substrate oxidation rate for valencene than the wildtype BM3 and produces less byproduct when valencene concentration is saturated. Additionally to previous named benefits the AIPL"
Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane AptamerPurification_-_-_TEXT.html,"), we could biotinylate it, attach it to a solid streptavidin surface, and use the resulting  surface to concentrate the pABA out of cell lysate for further processing. To that end we set out to create an aptamer against pABA. To read about our team's efforts to over express pABA and its relevance to Kevlar, see here.
The main problem was pABA's size. The normal process by which aptamers are generated is called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment or SELEX. In it the binding target is immobilized to a surface, a large library of about 1015 or more unique candidate aptamer oligos are flowed over it, and motifs that bind are iteratively selected and enriched [2]. From there directed mutagenesis and characterization of the most represented motifs can be done if desired to further enhance both the specificity and the affinity of the isolated aptamer. This generic SELEX process works well for targets that can be immobilized easily. pABA is not such a target. Even by comparison to other small molecules that have published aptamers, pABA is extremely small, and thus not readily able to be adhered to a solid surface for selection.
Accordingly, we searched literature for alternate selection techniques, and settled on one called capture SELEX. We picked capture SELEX because it  has been used successfully by other groups to isolate aptamers against very small targets: nucleic acids, other small biological substrates [3] and even perchlorate [4]. The difference between capture SELEX and normal SELEX is that the former uses a candidate aptamer library with a specific constant region in the middle, so that the candidates themselves can be attached to streptavidin beads via a biotinylated capture oligo. In this setup, free target is added to the bound oligos, and whatever oligos elute off the column to bind the target are PCR amplified, PAGE purified, and iteratively enriched. To generate our candidate motifs, the library was sequenced after round 10. Although the timespan of this project exceeded the time available in the summer, in the next section we've published our detailed experimental protocol for this procedure in hopes that future iGEM teams can build on this research.

We also concerned ourselves with the second part of the Gb3 mimic story – expressing the peptide and detecting its presence in the extracellular space. We     chose E. coli N99 as the strain of our choice because of existing evidence in literature about successful expression of small peptides using it as a host.     We ordered N99 cells from the Yale Center and they, ever so generously, accepted to ship it to us free of cost.
Towards the end of the week, our administration finally managed to draft the official Purchase Order (PO). We wasted no time in communicating this to     GenScript. The shipment was finally on its way to our lab!
M03W11: The One With The Double Joy: (11th -17th Aug)
The N99 cells from Yale were delivered surprisingly quickly and their timely arrival invigorated the team. The day we received the cells (a lyophilized     powder on a filter paper), we plated them (very carefully and beautifully) on LB agar-streptomycin plates for use in the future.
This week brought with itself some more good news. Mr.Shreekumar, another notable alumnus of IIT Madras, responded positively to our request for funding     and offered to help out with the financial aspects of our project! It gave a much-needed boost to the team and it also coincided with the Indian     Independence Day – now that’s called a double whammy!
M03W12: The One With The Modelling: (18th -24th Aug)
N99 cells had to be cultured in a minimal medium, favorably the M9 medium. We spent the first half of this week finding the composition of this medium and     then scavenging for the chemicals to prepare it. We prepared 500mL of this medium and stored it at 4oC.
Over the past few weeks, we had also been pondering on the feasibility of a bioinformatics approach to further enhance our project. We got a mini-team in     place and decided to go ahead with it. The mini-team managed to model the Gb3 mimic pentameric peptide and consequently, create a PDB file for the peptide.

We miniprepped the cultures of pC13BC, pC13BV, and pC13CE from the weekend. We added antibiotics to CYM plates, and intended to inoculate them for the growth experiment for testing G. lucidum’s antibiotic sensitivity, but the plates were too wet for reliable inoculation (that would spread in a circle of constant diameter), and inoculation was postponed so the plates could dry.
PpelA preps were quantified and the G. lucidum promoter was amplified and gel screened. We are preparing our pC13CO, pC13BA, and pC13CL cultures to sequence. The correct insert is in pC13BA based on a gel screen. We digested pC13L and dephosphorylated the pSB1C3 digest from yesterday.

After picking up our pieces from the Clark Hall machine shop, we focused on cutting our insulation to the proper dimensions.  Initially, we tried cutting it with a razor blade, but after some rather sloppy results, we decided we needed a more efficient cutting method.  Our next attempt involved heating a thin wire and melting through the insulation.  This produced better results than the razor blade, but was way too slow.  Finally, we decided it would be best if we just resorted to power tools.  We bought a jigsaw from Home Depot and cut the insulation like it was cheese.  After, we gazed fondly upon the jigsaw and reminisced about high school woodshop.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," responses to target molecules which were comparable to traditional whole cell sensors. Therefore, a 3D, spatially explicit, stochastic model was constructed, in which each cell was modelled as a separate agent containing kinetic equations specific to the biosensor components present in that cell type. To enable the application of experimentally derived rate constants, an IPTG sensor was designed according to our platform and modelled. This design was later used as our proof-of- concept in vitro system. Additionally, in traditionally engineered biosensor systems, biosensor components are often present in equal amounts, mostly one detection device to one processing device to one reporter device. However, other than ease of production, there is no evidence that a component ratio of 1:1:1 is optimum for all systems. An unexpected side effect of splitting biosensor components into different cells was the production of a new design space in which biosensor behaviour could be altered by varying the ratios of cell types, and therefore biosensor components, in a multicellular system. We wanted to harness this new method of fine-tuning biosensor circuits through the in silico exploration of cell type ratios and subsequent in vitro confirmation of optimum component ratios.
Background Information
Simbiotics is a novel 3D multicellular simulation tool developed by Jonny Naylor at Newcastle University [REF]. This tool uses stochastic agent-based modelling to simulation interactions between different cell types within a defined 3-dimensional space. Each cell type defined in the model can run its own deterministic SBML model, which gives each cell its own behaviour. The simbiotics tool can give certain molecules defined within the SBML models (e.g. quorum sensing molecules) the ability to pass through the cell membrane, diffuse across the defined space, and enter another cell type. This enables the simulation of communication between members of a multicellular community.
Simbiotics was an obvious choice for modelling the Sensynova development framework , as it is a multicellular community with three defined cell types which communicate via quorum sensing molecules.
Deterministic SBML Models
A model for each cell type in the Sensynova framework (the detector, the processor, and the reporter) was initially made using SBML and COPASI [REF]. A parameter list and downloadable files for these models can be found at the bottom of this page .
Detector Cell SBML Model
The deterministic SBML model for the detector cell was tested separately from the other two cell types in COPASI. Figure 1 shows the model schematic. When IPTG is absent, LacI is produced constitutively and inhibits the pLac promoter. This prevents LasI from"

As the concentration of protein 3 increases, the induction of gene 4 (restriction enzyme or fluorescent protein) starts. In order to make a longer or shorter delay the protein production and degradation rates have to be considered. For the former, we can “play” with the ribosome binding site (RBS) and promoter strength. The degradation can be controlled by protein stability, induction of degradation and up-down regulation of degradation enzymes.

An overview of our system
This is a diagram summarising our system. It consists of two parts: the production of Ab against NoroVirus and the gene guard.
Concerning the gene guard, CymR inhibits the T5 Cumate Operator Promoter avoiding the production of the T4 Holin (permeabilizes the cytoplasmatic membrane) and the LL 37 cathelicidin (human antimicrobial peptide able to disrupt the outer membrane).
When the cumate is given, it binds and inactivates the CymR, derepressing the T5 Cumate Operator Promoter and allowing the expression of T4 Holin, that permeabilizes the cytoplasmatic membrane, allowing the secretion of LL 37 that disrupt the outer membrane.
Moreover, the horizontal transfer from our Nissle into another bacteria is avoided thanks to our gene guard. The receiving bacteria do not produce the CymR repressor, so the T5 Cumate Operator Promoter is activated allowing T4 Holin and LL 37 expression. Bacteria die!
Our favourite parts:
BBa_K875001 , T5 cumate operator:
We demonstrated that this promoter is very strong and strictly regulated. Thanks to its rapid responsiveness it's one of the first candidates for the toxin expression and production in case of necessity.
BBa_K875003 , CymR:
We expressed succesfully the CymR. We also showed his stringency as repressor of the T5 Cumate Operator. Together, CymR and T5 Cumate Operator, create a safe and tightly regulated gene guard system, which keeps under control the bacterial growth.
BBa_K875004 , LPP-OmpA-scFv:
We verified the production of this protein at high yield. LPP-OmpA system is a very powerful method for protein display on the outer membrane, in this case the antibody scFv 54.6"
Austin_UTexas,2016,Team:Austin UTexas#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"Kombucha Strains
One of the earliest goals of our project was to identify a specific set of microbes responsible for the production of kombucha. To do this, samples of store-bought kombucha were plated onto a variety of media with various dilutions to isolate microbes. Then, morphologically different colonies were cultured and frozen in glycerol for further use. Once we obtained a collection of microbial isolates, each microbe was sequenced and identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a particular ribosomal RNA gene. The 16S gene was selected for bacterial strains, and the ITS gene was amplified for the fungal samples.1 After the samples were sequenced, we utilized the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) SeqMatch Tool to identify our isolated species of bacteria and yeast. By identifying these kombucha strains, we were able to use our own experimentally isolated strains for our future kombucha experiments.

Conjugation
In order to demonstrate that we can genetically engineer the bacterial strains that we identified, Gluconobacter oxydans and Gluconacetobacter xylinus, we attempted to conjugate various plasmids encoding fluorescent devices, such as GFP and E2 Crimson, into these bacteria using a DAP (Diaminopimelic Acid) auxotroph strain of E. coli.1 To assist in this process, we also conducted minimal inhibitory concentration studies with each of these bacteria using spectinomycin, kanamycin and carbenicillin.  Ultimately, we determined that G. oxydans is able to survive the standard E. coli antibiotic concentrations we have been using for both spectinomycin and carbenicillin. However, G. oxydans was successfully inhibited by the normal amount of kanamycin. With this data, we can improve our conjugations by either using more concentrated amounts of spectinomyin and carbenicillin, or only using donor strains with kanamycin resistance. The plasmids pBTK518, pBTK519 and pBTK520 (given to us by Jiri Perutka of The Ellington Lab) contain GFP and either a carbenicillin, kanamycin or a spectinomycin resistance gene respectively. Once the bacteria are successfully conjugated, we can introduce"

Logic gate
    For proving our feasibility of AND gate, we used lactose promoter and arabinose promoter as the inputs of AND gate, and used GFP as the reporter gene. We designed a series of experiments to verify its precision and did research about its response time and response concentration.     First, we did four parallel experiments: the bacteria solutions were added by IPTG of 10^-4mol/L, arabinose of 10^-3mol/L, both of them, and neither of them. Following is the result.
        As is shown in the figure, solutions with no inducers or only one inducer can produce little GFP fluorescence which verify the precision and feasibility of the AND gate. But, GFP fluorescence is high when only adding IPTG. This may because the leak of Pbad. Considering the principle of AND gate, it is reasonable. Only the protein T7ptag can activate the gene controlled by  T7 promoter, though T7ptag has two amber mutations, some E.coli endogenous tRNA may also identify the stop codon, which causes the leaking of Pbad seemingly.         Next, we designed experiments to verify the response concentration. Through these experiments, we can also conclude under which concentration can the AND gate have the best effect. We designed a series of gradient about how many inducers should be added. The concentration of IPTG and arabinose varied from 10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5, 10^-6, to 0. Following is the result.
        Seeing from the right figure, with the increase of the inducers’ concentration, the fluorescence intensity also increases. This figure has met our expectation. As the absorbance value (shown in the left figure) indicates the amount of bacteria, we can make sure that the increasing of fluorescence intensity is not caused by the bacteria growth.
        We measured the sample every certain period after adding inducers, and make the response curves in the figure. We found that after adding arabinose and IPTG, the fluorescence intensity satisfies a linear growth curve. However, the fluorescence intensity of the group with no inducers flattens after 2 hours. The difference of fluorescence intensity between two groups becomes apparent after 2 hours. Thus, we estimate that the response time of logic gate is around 2 hours.         In general, we have verified the feasibility of logic gate. We successfully simplify the three-plasmid"

Citrobacter freundii Characterisation:
Growth in sea salts
Since synthetic biology is a rapidly developing field, we think that it will see a lot of innovation in the years to come. We also think that the use of fresh water for large scale experiments and industrial applications will eventually become limited as fresh water supplies will be scarce, or salt water will be more accessible to people. This is why we think that a novel chassis should be able to grow in seawater/salt water. The following experiments serve to characterize the ability of Citrobacter to grow in water containing varying concentrations of sea salts. Note that the average salt concentration of seawater is between 20 and 40 g/l.
Methods (expand)
As we have mentioned previously, we urge everyone to talk about their failed experiments, as if nobody talks about them, a lot of time could be wasted by different people trying to do the same thing to no avail. As such, the following experiments can be considered an example of how we started out with a failure but then modified the circumstances to get meaningful results.
1.1 First, we wanted to asses growth of C. freundii on media plates. For this purpose, M9 minimal medium was made up, using glucose as"

- Discussed results from tittering experiment (preliminary experiment 1)
Contamination mostly likely resulted from the step involving suspending phage in LB – obvious contamination in the LB bottle
One of the stock phage solution had contamination as well
- Discussed step of attack with Dr. Grose
Decided to go with T7, if necessary Qbeta
Need to learn to make top agar at various concentrations
Need to do more background research and decide whether to assemble phage capsid in vitro (plasmid + E coli) or do direct mutagenesis of phage genome
Need to correspond with the isolation team
- Sequencing will be for individual genes to cut down cost
Need to design primers and get to know the genome of the phage
- Learnt about Mega5 to compare genome and protein sequence

Background research to determine in vitro assembly vs altering genome – look into specific techniques
Comparing genome of phage and decide on possible site-directed mutagenesis options
- Start working on designing our site directed mutagenesis
Qbeta vs MS2
Look for places where sequences are significantly different
Might be worthwhile to look at capsid structure to identify the regions where interactions between subunits take place
Qbeta vs T7 major
No real consensus – more worthwhile to compare capsid protein sequence of T7 with those that have similar size to it
T7 major vs minor
Minor is longer, but not necessary – the tail overhang is due to ribosome moving two codons downstream instead of three
Suggest we can direct mutation to the poly-U site and prevent ribosome slippage
Qbeta major vs minor
Just continue transcribing after it reaches the stop codon. What does the stop codon code for?
- Research into in-vitro assembly vs direct mutation of phage genome
It seems that we’ll need to clone the genome of the phage into a plasmid and let it assemble in an E coli
Using chemicals we can induce random mutations in phage – might be worthwhile if selection in agar is not working as well.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html,", MlrAYa - MlrA with mating factor alpha.
Based on the localization we were able to say that MlrA resides in the plasma membrane, but we were unable to conclude the localization of MlrA with the mating factor α. Anyhow, after the enzyme activity assay, we are able to conclude that since both constructs were localized in the P2 fraction (and MlrA additionally in the P3 fraction) and since both had activity, it is most likely that they both reside in the plasma membrane in an active form.
Discussion
In the degradation part of the project, we met our goals partially: we were able to produce the active enzyme in yeast with two of our constructs, but the enzymes didn’t localize as expected and we weren’t able to purify them sufficiently. Nevertheless, we are content with the results we obtained as they show that our project has great potential to be developed further in the future.
When expressing the yeast constructs, we made some interesting observations of the enzymes’ sizes. When the MlrA construct without the mating factor α was expressed in yeast, it was detected on the Western blot as a 28 kDa band. This is the same size as in E. coli , which had been established already by Dziga et al. (2012) who discussed that this might be due to some E. coli specific protease activity, since the calculated mass of the enzyme is 37 kDa and their heterologous production of MlrA in Staphylococcus aureus did not result in a protein of 28 kDa. The results from Dziga et al. also showed that the enzyme was cleaved from the N-terminus, as they had the His tag on the C-terminus and were able to detect it with anti-His antibody in western blot. This was also the case with our results, as we, too had the His tag on the C-teminus; the cleavage happens in the N-terminus. Our results therefore indicate that there might be similar proteolytic activity in S. cerevisiae as there is in E. coli in regards of this enzyme.
Expression of MlrA with the mating factor α signal sequence and propeptide resulted in a protein of about 38 kDa, which corresponds to the calculated size of MlrA. It might be that the secretion tag in front of the enzyme protects it from the proteolytic cleavage, even though the secretion tag itself is apparently cleaved off during processing as it should be; otherwise the protein would have been about 47 kDa"

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Sustainability#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html," differentiation is induced and the cells start to produce vitamins in high quantity. The battle against contaminants is now a fair fight.
caption
We protected our product against foreign organisms, but one threat remains: our organism's own mutants. If a mutation occurs in the active site of an enzyme, or in the promoter of an operon, the functionality of the organism might be impaired. How can we prevent our organism from mutating?
Fortunately, our friends at the Vanderbilt University iGEM team worked precisely on that problem this summer. We worked hand in hand with them to see what a real-life application of their invention would mean practically. They invented an algorithm to scan the sequences looking for regions that are likely to mutate, and proposed alternative versions of our sequences.
As they worked on this project while we were working on ours, we obviously could not use their optimized sequences for our constructs. However, we relied on gene synthesis for a lot of parts, so it would not have been a problem to use the optimized sequences instead. Their algorithm is therefore a valuable tool for any synthetic biologist willing to create durable products, and we applaud their work.
An extendable system
Our differentiation system is inspired by the Brainbow system, initially developed for tracking the axons of neurons in mammalian's brain. We modified it so it becomes extendable (A).
This system is randomized on a single-cell level, so each cell produce one —and only one—, vitamin pathway. In most research work, metabolic engineering has been done only one target compound at a time, and little is known about what happens when production pathways are used simultaneously in the same cell (B).
Having one cell expressing only one pathway should theoretically preclude unexpected interactions between different pathways, thus making an extendable framework where every synthesis function is decoupled (C).
The different vitamin-producing pathways can be prototyped separately on a classical lab strain, and it is then easy to put them all together in the same chassis for a multi-functional organism.
The chassis
Let us see how it works under the hood.
Before addition of any metabolic pathways, this is what our empty chassis would look like. The following cassette is integrated in the chromosome.
All proteins' coding regions are preceded by a RBS (Ribosome Binding Site) and followed by a transcription terminator.
Constitutive promoter: Thanks to this promoter, a RNA transcript of the cassette will be produced until the first terminator is reached.
The Lox Array: The original LoxP site comes from the phage P1. When an enzyme called the CRE recombinase is expressed, all the DNA between two Lox sites is"

4/ The last example here comes from another fellow iGEM team: iGEM Aachen 2014. Its design is somewhat similar to DI-lambda. They also measured fluorescence. We believe that our design can improve the overall accuracy.
Overall, while there are very promising projects, it looks like they most of them have been abandoned at early stages, after the initial limited success. The PublicLab spectrometer stands out here, has build instructions, is open-source, and can be purchased as a kit.
Figure 4: picture of the iGEM Aachen 2014 spectrophotometer.
Design
DI-lambda is an ​Open Hardware spectrophotometer, designed to be accurate, easy to modify, and extremely cheap. We achieve this by using LEDs instead of an optical refraction system.
This design choice (Fig. 5) means that the device is limited to one or a few pre-selected wavelengths, but most biological applications only use a few. It is also possible to select a different wavelength by populating a spare LED board, but since it's so cheap, it might be easier to just buy one for each task. Another disadvantage is large spectral width of LEDs, typically 15-25nm, compared to 1-5 nm for traditional spectrophotometers.
All this means that DI-lambda is not always able to replace a traditional spectrophotometer, but works great for a majority of biological applications.
The design files are available on Github: https://github.com/lopenlab/OSS-Spectrophotometer/

Using these strains that we know contain lytic phage, we’ve transformed pIG87 (CRO behind an arabinose-inducible promoter in a pLAT vector backbone) into 9901 and 9907 through the electroporation technique …
We plated them on arabinose, overexpressing CRO, but saw no plaques!! But even more mysteriously, when we perform a top agar H202 plaque assay on these post-electroporation strains, we see no plaques!  Is lambda gone?  Does the CRO protein actually inhibit, rather than initiate, lambda’s lytic cycle?  Or does an excess of arabinose inhibit lysis?

After incubation, we heat shocked the culture in 2 mL aliquots at 43 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes.

As a future line, we would create a package that integrates scoring system code. It would allow any development team to integrate our scoring in a easy way, installing only one component, and being always updated thanks to package manager. For the moment, we have splitted application layers and processes engine in front-end routes and API routes, we have separated the front-end back-end applications as two complementary but independent parts, We have fitted out an API public rout with the intention of consulting our scoring system. Therefore, any web server can make requests to our system score and get the results by sending a data packet in a given way to a web address established API.
Other package manager advantage is the certificated components that we have used in our development software, such as ‘passport’, a component to log in in a safety way creating cookies in web browser, or ‘pdfmake’, a component to create packages. Those open access components are highly tested by developers and ease the software development.
Finally, we have developed our site with cloudno.de hosting, a service created with the intention of promote those kinds of technologies. It is free access, so that maintenance costs would be zero.
To developw the frontend side, we bought a template developed by stepofweb ( http://www.stepofweb.com/ ). It guarantees a friendly user appearance, a complete responsive and fluid design and compatible with  IE9, IE10, IE11, Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari.
All in all we have created a web application with the most innovative technologies, integration in an easy way all HYPE-IT tools, that encourages ideas exchange about plant synthetic biology in a community workspace.

Our maximum achievement referring to plant’s synthetic biology is our scoring system. This utility receives a gene and returns the possible targets scored and ordered, the standards our scoring system works with are:
The system is designed to return the primers to amplify the target with the overhangs to be used as standard GoldenBraid (GB) parts. GB is one of the plant assembly systems of reference validated by iGEM. It was developed by Diego Orzáez team at IBMCP in Politecnic University of Valencia. Our aim is to promote the use of this standard by using it in the Software.
The scoring system can process as an entry field one gene in FASTA format or a base text file.
Our scoring system is based in five criteria; for each one of those criteria, independent literature-based algorithms evaluate different"

We FINALLY got growth! Last Friday, Professor Twaddle discovered our wonderfully transformed (we hope) cells. He took our best colony and placed it in growing broth. Today, we purified and isolated the DNA in order to test the transformation. We will run electrophoresis on our purified DNA next time we meet: this Thursday.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#unnatural base pair#uptake and biosynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html," to use PtNTT2 to facilitate the transport of unnatural nucleoside triphosphates into the cell. Therefore, our plan is to construct several versions of PtNTT2 under control of the lacUV5 promoter, including the native sequence PtNTT2(1-575), two truncated versions PtNTT2(31-575) and PtNTT2(66-575), as well as two versions with heterologous signal peptides, PtNTT2-Tat and PtNTT2-pelB. While PtNTT2-Tat features a signal peptide targeting the twin-arginine translocation pathway, PtNTT2-pelB features the signal peptide of the pectate lyase B of Erwinia carotovora, which targets the general secretion pathway. By characterizing all of these versions we hope to identify the best suited version for our purpose, the efficient uptake of unnatural nucleoside triphosphates.
Sec- and Tat Secretion Pathways
PtNTT2 comes from an eukaryote and is integrated into the plastid membrane in its native algael host. Therefore, expression of PtNTT2 in E. coli might not lead to efficient integration into the inner membrane. Therefore, we wanted to test different signal peptides to find the one best suited for efficient integration of PtNTT2 into the inner membrane.  In E. coli , proteins can be secreted via two main pathways, namely the general secretion (Sec) and the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway . Proteins which are intended to be secreted are targeted by signal peptides which are located at the N-terminus of a pre-protein and share one common tripartite structure: a positively charged N-terminal domain (N-domain) followed by a nonpolar hydrophobic domain (H-domain) and the more polar C-domain (De Keyzer et al., 2003; von Heijne, 1998). Signal peptides vary in length, but are usually between 18 and 30 amino acids long. During the translocation process, the signal peptide is cleaved from the pre-protein by a signal peptide peptidase, which recognizes a cleavage site within the C-domain of the signal peptide (De Keyzer et al., 2003). Signal peptides targeting the Sec pathway do not feature a common consensus sequence or motif (Caspers et al., 2010). However, the binding of the secretion specific chaperone SecB or the signal recognition particle SRP  (which represents the first step of the"

The system is inhibited by 434 cI, which represses the RFP production, and λ cI activates the RFP production. In Figure 7 you can see the balance between the 434 cI and λ cI amounts that are present for the output of RFP. To understand how changing the Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS) impacts RFP responses, we simulated the system for different combinations of transcription rates. From these simulations we found:

To confirm that our model represents biological behavior we analysed the RBS library.  We can conclude from these results that the RFP concentration qualitatively corresponds to the Figure 7 Because as you can see in the Table 1 the highest RFP responses are when the λ cI and 434 cI are present in the same amount. The lowest responses of RFP when there is a is a big difference between λ cI and 434 cI. This is also shown in the heatmap we got form the model.
Combined System
Figure 8: Schematic of the quorum sensing system attached to the subpopulation network. The arrows indicate activation of a part and the flat bars indicate inhibition of a part.  The quorum sensing system consists of two parts: LuxR constitutively produces a transcriptional factor that binds to AHL, and LuxI produces an AHL autoinducer that diffuses  freely through  the cell membrane, from cell to cell. LuxR forms a complex with AHL that inhibits the subpopulation system, where 434"

Which might be the case if VioD and VioA are induced by different inputs that are not reliably equal.
What are the dynamics of the flux through VioC?  Would analyze by producing cyan, and then switching on VioC and measuring absorbance.  Considerations for biosensors - if presence of whatever the biosensor is sensing causes cyan production, and then low rate of VioC expression slowly turns cyan into violet, violet being an indication that the sensor is old and past its shelf life .

Pyocyanin is a green pigment that diffuses out of the cell, the red pigment also diffuses out of the cell.
Currently waiting for the arrival of plasmids containing PhzM and PhzS; if they do arrive, hoping to explore logic gate construction.
Planning a Processing System
Amplification:
An amplifier consists of a ribosome binding site, a protein coding region, a terminator and a promoter. The protein produced in the device binds to the promoter as an activator, such that an incoming gene transcription will be amplified to various levels with appropriate choices of activator and promoter. The Cambridge team in 2007 looked at these devices.
We are taking this idea forward.
Population Control:
If we had three different pigments in a single plate, we would like to make sure that the colonies all grow to the same size.
We therefore looked into an AHL-regulated arrangement, where the slowest-growing strain would produce signalling molecules, allowing the faster strains to grow. The medium speed strain could also have a signalling molecule for induction of the fast strain.
The idea has a good chance of working in a liquid medium, where the relevant signalling molecules can easily disperse. However, on a plate, spatial effects have to be considered. Due"

Tired of designing primers manually? Fiddling with primer lengths to get the Tm just right? So were we! Use our (revolutionary, and wheel-reinventing) tool to design the primers for you. Simply put your sequence in the ""DNA"" field and select which kind of primers you want. Scroll down to see the results! The Tm is specially tailored for use with the NEBPhusion polymerase (which is, totally coincidentally, the one we use), but should be comparable to most others.
The code is open-source, by the way.
Results
Comments
Warning: This is a very basic tool and should not be seen as a replacement for your brain. This is in no way a complete     tool for primer design and shouldn't be trusted! Always check the results yourself. The Tm calculation is based on     Belsauer et al. 1986 (with some small modifications, inspired by http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc.html )     and has as a goal to stay close (in principle it should be the same) to the results found by the NEB Phusion HF-PCR reference (the kit we're using).     The tail is ignored in the Tm calculation.     Also take a look at iGEM's primer design page .
Known limitations are: only A, C, G and T are accepted as input, the concentration of salts(50mM of Na+),     and the primer concentration (500nM) can't be set.

PROTOCOL
The protocol for plate reader stated in the iGEM Headquarter was used. All details were followed except for the OD measurement and the E. coli strain in use. OD595 was employed rather than OD600 due to the limitation of the plate reader in the HKUST. E. coli strain DH10B which is highly similar to Top 10 was used.
Calibrations of the machine, EnVision multilabel reader, and the OD595 reference point were done before the measurement.

CONCLUSIONS
From the results obtained through the measurement, device 1 showed the highest overall green fluorescence level while device 3 showed the lowest fluorescence. This outcome was mainly due to the differences of the promoters of the three constructs. With the strongest promoter, BBa_J23101, the GFP produced by device 1 would be the highest among all three.

Homing Endonuclease Method
The last method of maxicell production was also suggested by the Leach Lab, and uses an E. coli strain - DL2524 - that contains an 18 bp recognition site for the homing endonuclease I-SceI, and the I-SceI gene under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter. When the cells are cultured in 0.5% arabinose, I-SceI is expressed, which then cuts the chromosomal DNA at the recognition site producing a double strand break that leads to complete degradation of the chromosome.
Quantifying Maxicell Timeframe
After we established that we could reliably produce maxicells, we attempted to get a quantitative measurement of how long they could be metabolically active. This would have obvious applications in the field, as you would know the time-frame in which maxicells can be used for your desired process. We took a three-pronged approach to this quantification, beginning by looking at their ATP levels over time, the level of protein retention, and their ability to functionally express a gene at various times after their production.
ATP Quantification
We added the enzymes D-Luciferin and Luciferase to the maxicell and cell samples in order to produce luminescence by hydrolysis of ATP by the enzymes. This luminescence can be directly correlated to the level of ATP in a cell. After calibration with known ATP levels, we used a luminometer to determine the levels of ATP in our maxicells over a 72 hour period at 4 °C, 21 °C and 37 °C. We picked these temperatures as they are often used in the lab and are therefore would be most commonly used in experiments. We also thought these temperatures related quite well to temperatures in the world. Average of 21 °C during the spring and summer in the majority of countries; 4 °C for the winter months and 37 °C for hotter climates around the world. We also thought if we can show the differences in ATP levels at different temperatures it will allow us to better visualise what climates around the world will be best suited for our chassis.
Protein Retention
We next looked at the protein levels within maxicells at various time points and concentrations. We figured that the half-life of proteins would be much longer than in non-maxicells, as the half-life would no longer be intrinsically tied to the rate of division; in normal cells the level of protein"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#NicoleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"). Any colored cubes can introduce color into any Plasmid cube, which can introduce its color to any E. Coli cube. I'm not sure if it's only for the simulator, but each E. Coli cube cannot play animation (that's been started at different times) simultaneously. The previous E. Coli cube's animation has to finish before another E. Coli cube can run the animation. Updated Orit with current progress. We'll now be working on the ""handshake"" between the cubes and the surface, which should be finished by Thursday's pilot test with the high school students. Working on Friday's presentation (organizing the slides/making sure we know what to say).
Day 36: July 18, 2012
In the morning, high school counselors came to learn about our HCI lab as well as view the projects that we have been working on throughout the summer. For the rest of the day, I worked on refining the communication between the surface application (server) and the cubes (client). Goal: when an E. coli cube is placed onto the surface, in that same location the surface application creates the same colored E. coli which starts traveling around the screen. Each of the cubes have a byte tag on their bottom sides. The surface application detects these byte tags and establishes the connection, which the cube completes when it is flipped. This is to assign a byte tag to a specific cube, so only one cube at a time is able to be flipped. Ideally, once finished refining the code, the communication should be left open between the surface and the cubes and the surface has a local variable associated with the tag (i.e. a specific cube) that records its color. Because the connection remains open, the local variable is updated when the color of the cube changes. Moreover, when the surface application receives the color from the E. Coli cube, it sends back a confirmation string as well as a command to start the animation on the cube (of the E. coli leaving that cube).
Day 37: July 19, 2012
Consuelo and I were able to communicate what we wanted between cube and surface and so have the first working demo for Synfluo art project. Eight high schoolers came in for the demo today and I was happy with how cool they thought our installation was. They were very excited about playing with the Microsoft Surface. Kim started off with an introduction of synthetic biology then kids split into two groups, half of whom I showed the working demo to and the other with Kim for a discussion about risks involved.

Applications Summary
    In summary, the controllable co-culture system that we have developed has a broad range of impactful solutions in industry and research. Although we have only listed a few applications of our project, any system that requires the use of a stable ratio of two or more bacterium for research or process optimization can benefit from our work. In the future, groups interested in expanding on or implementing our co-culture system will be able to pursue feasible paths, as outlined above.
Scale-Up Challenges
    The current system that exists poses challenges for scale-up in the future. Maintaining the ratio of the co-culture is effective, but requires a sample from the turbidostat to be run on a flow cytometer to observe the current ratio, and make adjustments to the light system as necessary. The frequency of these observations is dependent on how stable you want the co-culture to be, however each iteration requires about 15 mins. This poses a challenge for scaling up this process because there is no easy way to increase the frequency or speed of these observations and thus requires someone to monitor the system over long periods of time. To address the scalability of our system, we came up with an idea that would eliminate the need for someone to monitor the co-culture and that can make continuous observations (however, the automated system was not implemented this year).
The Proposed Solution
    The thought process was simple; why have someone monitor the system when a computer can do it? And if a computer can monitor it, why not have it make observations every minute, or every second? Expanding on this idea, we got as far as to designing an improved system that could continuously monitor the ratios of the co-culture and automatically adjust the lights based on each observation at any arbitrary frequency.
    Had time and resources allowed, we would have explored the implementation of ejecting a sample from the turbidostat into a fluorescent microscope, which could be used to measure the ratio of the co-culture. Following that, we would have the data be read by a computer that is used to control the turbidostat, such as a Raspberry Pi. Using a program"

   3. During this phase we also need to rule out unknown influences on the device caused by switching to new assembly conditions, such as switching to fermentation flask instead of tightly controlled experiment chamber.
   4. During this phase preserving microbes will greatly affect the cost of production, and affordability is one of the most important characteristics of JACOB.
Medium Scale Tria
   1. Duration: 4-5 months
   2. When the production of microfluidic chip is resolved, how to prepare it for using will be on the agenda. Currently the chip we used for final packaging needs to be soaked in ethyl alcohol and acetone for about one hour, which pose a question for mass production.
   We asked CapitalBio Corporation mainly on how to control the cost of microfluidic chip production¬. From their experience we found that chips cost much more in the early development, but its cost diminishes quickly in later stages when mass production is reached, ranging from $0.1 to few dollars. However, there exist a conflict of material. In the iGEM version we picked optical cement instead of PMDS for its advantages of adequate solidification speed, feasibility, bio-inertia, and precision of altitude. However, PMDS production industries are much more matured. There is currently no companies offering mass production of optical cement microfluidic chips. Thus, we must decide the better material.

So, why does it matter that different chassis are used, anyway? Well, beyond their different growth requirements and quirks about competency (the ability of an organism to take up DNA), different chassis have different innate abilities. These innate abilities may make the chassis more worthwhile to work with than another microbe, e.g., E. coli. Because while E. coli is the best researched microbe, it may simply not have a trait you need for your project."" - http://umassigem.blogspot.com/2009/02/concepts-cellular-chassis.html”

We found that the amino acid serine is abundant in the water of the bioreactor and is not present in the effluent. We also found that the serA gene is essential to Nitrosospira multiformis production of serine. By removing the serA gene Nitrosospira multiformis will be unable to produce its own serine, which is essential for growth outside of the bioreactor.

Christian Boekweg, Tanner Robinson, and Mark Murdock
The focus of the auxotrophy team was to knock out the gene responsible for the biosynthesis of serine. We found the serA gene to be crucial to Nitrosospira multiformis production of serine.

1. Vector for genes stacking
To assemble these four genes of astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway in rice endosperm, a modified multigene vector system, TransGene Stacking II (TGSII), was used. This system consists of a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC)-based binary acceptor vector (pYLTAC380GW), together with two donor vectors (pYL322-d1/ pYL322-d2). By using the Cre/loxP recombination system and two pairs of mutant loxP sites, multiple rounds of gene assembly cycles were carried out with alternative use of the donor vectors, and multiple genes were sequentially delivered into the TAC vector(Liu et al., PNAS, 1999, 96: 6535-6540; Lin et al., PNAS, 2003, 100: 5962-5967; Zhu et al., unpublished). By this way, multiple genes and a maker-free element can be easily stacked into a TAC-based binary acceptor vector (Figure 3) You can read more details by click here! part and protocol

2. Experimental design
Firstly, the nucleic acid sequences of four genes have been codon optimized and directly synthesized for stable expression in rice. Then, these genes were subcloned into endosperm-specific gene cassettes of two donors. Secondly, these genes and a marker-free element were assembled into a TAC-based binary vector by using a transgene stacking II system. Finally, the obtained marker-free multigene vector was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 for rice callus transformation. The transgenic plants were identified by analyses of PCR, RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and HPLC. The schematic diagram of our project was shown in Figure 4.

time butyric acid: 7h
Acid/Base Balance
Another parameter has to be taken into account: the acid/base balance. For each of our two acidic molecules, the bacteria will actually produce the associated base. However, it is the acid concentration that we are interested in. The formula below is used:
$$pH = pKa + log\frac{C_b}{C_a}$$
pH: the medium used is buffered so for low acid concentrations pH = 7 is considered
pKa: 3,7 for formic acid and 4,81 for butyric acid
Cb: base concentration
Ca: acid concentration
Finally, it should not be forgotten that FBA methods rely on a stoichiometric model. This implies that some biological realities might be overlooked.
For example, it has been demonstrated that PFL (Pyruvate Formate Lyase), one of the enzymes involved in the production of formate, is inhibited in aerobic conditions [3], a fact that is not taken into account by the Flux Balance Analysis. This can result in the model predicting a higher formate production than what will actually be observed.
BUTYRATE
Under the described conditions, our first objective was to try to optimize butyrate production flux. As was said before, the support file of the stoichiometric model was modified to add the lacking butyrate biosynthesis enzymes.
As expected, when we optimize the objective function  (butyrate production), it shows an optimum when all  the carbon available is used for butyrate production,  and none goes into biomass growth. So when there is no  growth, butyrate production is equal to ~0.02 mmol.L-1, see Fig.1 (~ Flux value of 0.3 mmol.gDW-1.h-1).
Figure 1: Butyric acid produced (mmol/L) depending on growth rate
If we set a minimal value for growth rate, butyrate production drops (Fig. 2), as it can be seen on the graph below obtained for different FBA simulations. We have tried different minimal growth rates up to 0.025 which is the maximal value obtained when the objective function under FBA simulation is biomass production.
Figure 2: Butyrate flux depending on minimal growth rate
Finally, to understand the effect of the initial glucose  concentration on the maximum butyrate quantity we can expect,  we tested different glucose concentrations between 0.4 and 15  mmol.gDW-1.h-1"
IONIS-PARIS,2017,Team:IONIS-PARIS#applied-design#chassis-selection_-_-_TEXT.html," provide additional beneficial services for our product.
We believe that our chassis selection could be made with metagenomics, the science of genome analysis, that permits               to know what organisms are in a given environmental sample and what are their functions. For example, we could sample leaves from a vineyard, then analyse the genome of its microbial inhabitants and try to assess their functions, relying               as well on proteomics, metabolomics and many other interesting sciences4. The analysis will permit us to select the most interesting organism for any vineyard and maximise efficiency and               biosafety. We hypothesise indeed that by selecting a phyllosphere specific organism, we will reduce its impact on               other environment such as soil and water, because it will not be adapted to them. We hence will need to analyse the               target plant's surrounding environment to choose an organism that is specific only to its phyllosphere.
Figure 3: Our chassis selection strategy relies on metagenomics and the identification of the ideal candidate according to the target’s phyllosphere and environment.
With such science, and as the phyllosphere varies with plant species and geographic localisation, we want to prove that we could use personalized treatment for each farmer by selecting a specific chassis for each. That way we will adapt to the farmer rather than he adapts to us. In a time of controversies raised by monopolisation of seed market by big companies, such strategy could help raise confidence from the farmers to GMOs and synthetic biology.
