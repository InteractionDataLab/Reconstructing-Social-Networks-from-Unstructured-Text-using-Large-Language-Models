IvyTech_SouthBend_IN,2014,Team:IvyTech SouthBend IN#progress_-_-_TEXT.html," The first attempt was fruitless, but on our second attempt we had success and we now have a stock of our part on a chlor-resistant backbone.
Unfortunately, We no longer have any stock of our original part. So, now we are again following the 3A Biolabs Biobrick Assembly Manual to reconstruct our parts K1477014 and K1477030. Our first try yielded nothing.
Our second run through of the protocol resulted in the growth of red colonies on chlor plates after electroporation of our part into Top 10 cells. However, we need white colonies to grow because this will point towards the rfp being repressed when the three parts come together. Red colonies are a sign that we did not have a successful assembly of our parts.
Week of 7/6/14 through 7/12/14
Last week Lyuda and Kevin ligated the composite part from the pSB1AT3, to the pSB1C3. We had difficulty getting the plasmid backbone to take the transformation. We then emailed the IGEM FAQ section and got an almost immediate response stating that the chlor backbone had a really low transformation efficiency. We tried again on 7-20 the ligation of both K1477030, and K1477014 with success but it takes like two days in the incubator.
We are in the process of running a gel to prove our parts are the right size in base pairs to show proper replacement transformations.
We have resuspended our composite parts in LB and the appropriate antibiotics to begin mass producing for concentration testing. We are awaiting the arrival of viruses for furthering our virus titering protocol. We now have duplicate lines of all composite parts growing and in suspension all prepared for moving into concentration testing. PROGRESS!!
These are the first successful transformation plates of transforming the plasmid backbone from pSB1AT3 to pSB1C3 for the purpose of submitting to the IGEM registry.
Week of 6/29/14 through 7/5/14
Last week Lyuda and Kevin ligated the part K1477014 with J23102(constitutive promoter) I732020( LacZoperon Mutant) into pSB1AT3(destination plasmid).
The plates had a 1:7 ratio of white to red colonies. Transformants were selected from TET plates expanded in LB with the appropriate antibiotic, rolled in the 37 Celsius incubator overnight. The next day we plated on TET and 2 % X-gal plates. 2% X-gal plates were made by Kevin using the"

JANUARY - JUNE
Start of iGEM!
 January 2016 - May 2016
The TTU Raider Research Team began member recruitment and team selection for the 2016 iGEM competition. Members began discussions on synthetic biology literature and identified a potential project to pursue. Full time and part time researchers were identified. Start of fundraising.
iGEM Bootcamp - Day 1
 June 3rd, 2016
On the first day of iGEM Bootcamp, team members were given commitment forms, discussed individual schedules, and were assigned teaching roles for the following day. Members began to design a fundraising brochure, created a timeline of our goals, sent out thank you letters to sponsors, and brainstormed ideas for fundraising, human practices, and future discussions with actors and regulators. Members who were assigned a teaching role began to work on their powerpoint presentations.
iGEM Bootcamp - Day 2
 June 4th, 2016
On the second day of iGEM Bootcamp, an ""Introduction to Biology"" presentation was given by iGEM members Ellen Wilson and Cody Fell; DNA structure, DNA replication, information flow (central dogma), the genetic code, mutations, proteins, transcriptional control, translational control, RNA regulation, Bio-engineering, and more were reviewed to accommodate members studying other STEM fields. An ""Introduction to Model Organisms and Microbial Interactions"" presentation was given by members Zachary Nguyen and Alejandra Duran; history strains, growth and maintenance, plasmids, transformations, and etc were covered. Following lunch, an ""Introduction to Synthetic Biology and iGEM"" presentation was given by members Holden Fried and Brandon Palomo; history, DNA parts and assembly, circuits, standard registry, BioBrick design, methods, and technology were covered. The last presentation of the day, ""Research and Basic Lab Review"", was given by members Marilyn Mathew and Gregory Knox, which covered how to search and read a scientific paper, keep a notebook, and stay organized; assignments, required safety training, BLAST and Ape, and other programs algorithms and programs we covered.

Since the PPAR-alpha promoter coding sequence could not be obtained from human genomic DNA, further experiment could not be preceded.
Glucose Regulated Protein (GRP78) Promoter
The commercial plasmid pDRIVE_hGRP78 (InvivoGen) was treated following manufacturer instructions (see manufacturer protocol ). GRP78 promoter was extracted out by polymerase chain reaction with engineered RFC10 prefix, suffix, AseI upstream of prefix and XhoI in downstream of suffix to facilitate cloning into pEGFP-N1 backbone (Addgene). pEGFP-N1 is a mammalian vector that contains constitutive CMV promoter and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as a reporter. We replaced CMV promoter with inducible GFP78 promoter by digestion and ligation. Since GRP78 promoter contained illegal restriction sites, two kinds of mutagenesis were conducted (see Mutagenesis protocol 2 and 3 ) for the elimination of XbaI. Due to time constrain, promoter activity in mammalian cell could not be characterized.
Fatty Acid Metabolism Regulator Protein (FadR) and pFadBA Promoter
The FadR (BBa_K817001) and pFadBA (BBa_K817002) DNA were obtained from 2013 distribution kit, submitted by NTU-Taida 2012 team. For expression in mammalian cells, pFadBA was cloned into mammalian vector (BBa_J176171) with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as reporter. After successful construct of pFadBA – EGFP – BBa_J176171, the plasmid was transfected into HEK293FT cell.
For the promoter regulation, we cloned FadR into BBa_J176171 backbone, with Kozak sequence and Nuclear Leading Sequence (NLS) for transcription and translation efficiency in mammalian cell.
After confirmation of the construct, Kozak Sequence – FadR coding sequence – NLS was cloned into pEGFP"

So finally we got to use the filter plates that helped us to carry out the activity measurements and then stop the reaction at a precice point of time via centrifugation. Team Immobilization gave us enough samples for 7 measurements after different reactions times. We chose to stop the reaction after 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 minutes, respectively, to check the behavior of the immobilized laccase in relation to the time.

Design:
Selection of chassis organisms:
The choice of chassis organisms is very important to our entire experiment. It determines not only the feasibility of our experiment, but also the difficulty of our experiment. We chose the chassis organism as Nissle e. coli because its genetic manipulation is relatively simple and it is also a intestinal probiotics without damage to the host. The exocrine system of Nissle e. coli is relatively mature, and some breakthroughs have been made in recent years [1,2]. Therefore, Nissle e. coli is one of the most promising engineered strains currently used to deliver proteins to host cells. This is also why we choose Nissle e. coli.
The plasmid we use is pet-22b. We commissioned CPT to synthesize our gene fragment at the polyclonal site of pet-22b and used Amp resistance genes on the plasmid to screen our transformed strains. We initially used the BL21 escherichia coli strain to express our protein and used the dh5-e escherichia coli strain to store our plasmids.
Signal peptide selection:
In order to successfully secrete our uric acid oxidase outside the cells, we used 4 different signal peptides for secretion experiment, and selected the signal peptides with the best secretion effect to be added into the sequence. We used the signal peptides to deliver GFP and measured the fluorescence data of GFP to compare the effects of 4 different signal peptides.
We decided to use 4 signal peptides (OpmA, PoLB, phoA, ST11) for secretion test, and designed the following 5 sequences to test our secretion system:
Design of uric acid response system
We used transcriptional regulator HucR[3] to sense uric acid concentration. Transcriptional regulator HucR is from d. radiodurans strain, belonging to MarR family of transcription"

We transformed them using Zymo cells and overloaded the reaction using 50 uL of cells and 4 uL of DNA. We picked 4 colonies for each transformation the next day and ran a small diges with X,P to check the sizes. However, they were incorrect, and we are in the process of troubleshooting.
We quantified the ones that were correct and streaked plates for running Flow Cytometry experiments.
For the Level 0 MoClo parts that didn`t show the correct sequences we picked two new colonies from each plate we had.  MoClo 36, 37,  38, 39, 40, 10, 32, 27, 26, 6, 7, 8, 2, 3, 29, 23, 24, 30, 11, 43, 44, 16, 45, 4, 47, 33, 48 and 49. We ran small digest with x and p and ran them on a gel to check the sizes.
We submitted the samples that seemed to show the correct band for sequencing.
Also, we worked on streaking plates for the samples we are submitting to the registry.
October Week 1
We miniprepped the samples we are sending to the registry and they are ready for submission :) The list of parts can be seen in the section Parts Submitted.
We picked colonies for the Flow Cytometry Experiment: All the Moclo L1 parts that worked (L1.2, L1.4, L1.5, L1.6, L1.7, L1.8 L1.10) along with their Biobrick counterparts. We ran the Flow Cytometry Experiments and the results can be checked at the section Results Summary.
We went over MIT to drop off the samples for the Registry.
Wiki is freezed! See you at the Jamboree :)
October
Week 2
One problem that we found out was keeping us from creating Level1 parts was because we mislabeled tubes, and were using incorrect Level 1 destination vectors to ligate with the parts.
We transformed with bioline cells level 2 destination vectors, but there were not many blue colonies upon blue white screening.
We continued to convert biobrick promoters of the J series into level 0 moclo parts and also set up moclo level 1 reactions. They were transformed and picked using blue white screening. The next day, we prepared cultures and then ran prep."

Conference: Community labs and synthetic biology
Figure 1 The poster for our conference 'community labs & synthetic biology'
In 2012 our team held a public panel discussion about bioethics. Moreover in the last years we had a lot of debates about the future of synthetic biology and the chances and risks of community labs, during our work for Synenergene and the german iGEM meetups. Since a new biohackerspace is forming in Darmstadt, with close connections to our team, we decided to lead a panel discussion about these two topics.  As a first step we had a round table discussion with the iGEM team of RWTH Aachen. Here we talked about the pros, cons and possible trends of community labs (please visit the wiki of RWTH Aachen for further details and results). This formed the fundament for our panel discussion.

Expectations:
The luminometer values from the Renilla plasmid provide an indication for the efficiency of transfection of the experimental plasmid. The Firefly luciferase values indicate the strength of the tested promoter.
The promoters of TIMP1(pTIMP1) and STEAP4 (pSTEAP4) were amplified and cloned into the pGL3 plasmid that contains the luciferase reporter gene (Luc). As the prmotoer is cloned proximal to the Luc, it allows to test the activity on the cloned promoter by the amount of luciferase expression. 
In this experiment, wells 1,2, and 3 contain reactive astrocytes co-transfected with pGL3+pTIMP1 and Renilla plasmids. According to the literature, we expect to see high levels of luminescence from the firefly luciferase3-6.
 Wells 6, 7, and 8 contain reactive astrocytes co-transfected with pGL3+pSTEAP4 and Renilla plasmids. According to the literature, we expect to see high levels of luminescence from the firefly luciferase. This would indicate that the TIMP1 and STEAP4 promoters are expressed strongly in reactive astrocytes (C8D30 cell line)3-6.
Wells 12, 13, and 14 contain reactive astrocytes co-transfected with pGL3 without a promoter (empty vector) and Renilla. These wells act as a negative control for this experiment. We expect to see negligible levels of luminescence from the firefly luciferase when compared to the luminescence in wells 1-3 and 6-8, as this pGL3 plasmid does not contain a promoter. The luminometer values of these wells serve as the reference for the background\noise of the experiment and will be used for calculating the relative activity for"

We had a poster session to introduce the details of our project to other teams. Meanwhile, we also got this chance to listen to the presentation from the other teams and gained many great ideas from them.
8. Exchange of ideas with other Asian team leaders
Our team leader also got a great chance to interact and exchange ideas with other teams on the lab method and the promotion of synthetic biology. This was a precious opportunity which we can know the progress of other teams and their methods in doing lab. We also received some great suggestion which we consider seriously in order to improve our project. Through these interactive sessions, friendships were developed among us, and one of the other team's team leader even travelled all the way to Hong Kong to visit our lab.
9. International questionnaire
Report of International questionnaire
CUHK was honoured to be in cooperation with 10 various different universities to conduct an international questionnaire on synthetic biology and on our respective projects. The universities which participated were Technische Universität Berlin, Beijing Institute of Technology, Universidade de São Paulo, Chang Gung University, University of Leicester, Université de Toulouse, Tianjin University, Kungliga Tekniska högskolan, Karolinska Institutet and University College London. Responses were collected from the location where the universities are located. This helped to collect opinions from around the world, not only confined to Hong Kong. We can distinguish the importance and acceptance of our project in a much larger scale of different places worldwide.
10. City University presentation and exchange of ideas with their team members and professors
We have also had a chance to visit the City University of Hong Kong and communicated with their team members and professors. During the visit, we have reached an agreement on collaboration of which we would help them to do characterization on the expression of the lacY gene. And they offered to help us with part of the modeling of our project.
We have gained informative and constructive advice from this visit.
11.  UCSF iGEM Team wikiflicks
To enable people worldwide to further understand synthetic biology and our project, we also collaborated with the UCSF iGEM Team, which composed of students from UC Berkeley, San Francisco State University, and recent graduates from Lincoln High School in San Francisco. Through this collaboration, we were able to present our videos on the UCSF iGEM Team’s wikiflicks. This enables us to spread the message to a much greater number of audiences.

ComED58E
The phosphorylmimetic comE mutant, comED58E was sent by Martin et al., the pKHS plasmid. pKHS is an expression vector, which contains a T7 promoter and kanamycin   resistance gene. T7 promoter is induced by isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
S. pneumoniae σx Promoters Module
Overview
The activity of Com-Box promoter is turned on by a specific sigma factor that is produced by a regulatory gene comX. The σx will bind to the Com-Box promoter region and activate gene expression. σx serve as an inducer with high specificity as it binds to an area of several specific 8 base pairs (TACGAATA) on the Com-Box promoter. This σx-Com-Box system could be used as a highly specific reporting system in our S.pneumonia detection platform. However in nature, ComX protein will be degraded by ClpXP enzyme which exists in E. coli and some other bacteria. Hence, to ensure the induction of Com-Box promoter by σx, ComW protein is needed as it functions to protect σx from being degraded by ClpXP. ComW protein will be degraded instead, increasing the amount of σx produced.
Construct
The three main components of the construct are comX gene, comW gene, and Com-Box promoter. We assembled comX and Com-Box promoter in one       vector plasmid, while comW in a different plasmid. The system will be fused with a tagging protein and a reporting protein. Tagging protein is essential       for detecting the σx and ComW protein expression by means of western blot. Reporting protein which is fluorescence protein is needed for       reporting purpose, hence σx-Com-Box system could serve as a specific reporting system that will be useful for many synthetic constructs. σx generator and Com-Box promoter construct will be assembled separately in different plasmid before being combined into one plasmid.

British_Columbia,2017,Team:British Columbia#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," wanted the ability to search multiple guides at once and compare them directly. Another design requirement was a matching nucleotide location of the guide to the genome, so the site could be found easily after modelling. Finally, we wanted it to be user friendly, working directly file inputs instead of re-writing code every time a guide needed to be run.
Model Development
Rather than having model users choose their guide sequences based on their nucleotide sequence, we wanted our model to provide a list of all potential protospacer sites in an input gene, ranked by their partition functions (how well the sgRNA binds to the target protospacer compared to the binding efficiency of the guide to all other protospacers). To accomplish this, we first developed a code to search a gene for all potential protospacers.
Initially the code had been developed to search a single sgRNA sequence against a short DNA input (that did not necessarily contain a protospacer matching the sgRNA provided) and rank the PAM sites with a partition function used as a measure of the amount of off target cuts that occur outside the target gene. While this is useful, it lacked the functionality we wanted.
An initial adjustment to the model allowed us to search larger DNA inputs (to include genomes). This was done by expanding the file types to include fasta and allowing the files to be appended to the processing queue. Next, we wanted the ability to input a number of DNA sequences to search against. This function would be useful when plasmids have been added to the system that we want the program to consider - either to avoid cutting a useful plasmid, or to target a plasmid region of interest. Our own project is proof of the utility of this feature, as our CRISPR/Cas9 design is targeted to a plasmid in Agrobacterium. Next we added increased functionality by automating the sgRNA candidate selection process. Our script will now generate a list of all potential protospacer cut sites based on a gene or sequence supplied to the system. This list also attaches a location tag of the top protospacer match for each sgRNA generated. Finally, we wanted to combine all this information in a simple and easy to interpret table, so that guides can be easily selected based on their partition function, target location, and specific sequence.
The first step was to make a user input command so the gene to generate guides from, the DNA sequences to search, and model processing conditions could be set. Code was written with this in mind and values are taking as command line parameters and passed to the corresponding functions.
The model starts by searching the gene"

Efficiency of the Database Entries
86% of participants would like to see a ranking/rating      system for the parts by the other iGEM users which will be one indication      of if a part is working and how well in different laboratories. Few had concerns about how well the rating system will work for      rarely used parts while the widely used parts would even more popular      due the the rating system. Still many believes this would be one      futher towards a peer-reviewed quality control system for the parts.
61% of participants agreed that parts should be updated      regularly by the designers, where most agreed at least when there      is new information on the parts. It has also been suggested      to give permission to all the users of that part for updating information.
73% of participants have been agree with us that excluding      the low ranking parts or the parts with negative feedback from the      future plates will increase efficiency of the system. The      major concern about excluding any part is losing the variety of      parts in the database. Few recommends excluding only the parts that      are not working.
“Efficiency shouldn't be top priority in a database. First and foremost,     data is the top priority. Excluding those parts would make the system     more efficient”
“Some parts may be rare or new and have low efficiency, but can be     very important! Getting rid of them would eliminate any chance of improvement     to these parts, which not only a qualifier for an iGEM gold medal, but     also one of the focuses of biobricks.”
We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or with     negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still archive     them and make their data available through the parts registry. So the     while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated, fully     working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on a more     exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the"

According to experiment results done by TUDelft, the temperature threshold of the part we choose is 37°C for FourU and PrfA, and 42 °C for Rose. So we set the culture temperature to 28°C, 37°C and 42°C, and if the RNAT work well, we could observe bacteria containing plasmid with FourU and PrfA cultured at 37°C and 42°C and the one with Rose cultured at 42°C changes to red and no change in the bacteria cultured in 28°C, that means these three RNAT change their conformations to the open state so that the ribosome could access the SD sequence.

According to the results, only the bacteria containing the plasmid with FourU element cultured at 37°C and 42°C become red, so we choose the best RNAT-FourU element. So the expression of PⅧ could be regulated by FourU element tightly responding to temperature changes.The structure of FourU element is showed in Figure 3.

Further verification the working effect of FourU element as temperature-controlled switch.
For further verifying the working effect of FourU element, we tested the fluorescence intensity of RFP protein to measure the expression level of the reporter protein regulated by FourU element as temperature-controlled switch. So we shake the bacteria containing plasmid with FourU element and the positive and negative control groups in the LB with chloramphenicol and set two culture temperature: 30°C and 37°C. After cultured for 24h, we test the fluorescent of RFP protein at excitation wavelength-584 nm and emission wavelength-607 nm.

PROOF OF CONCEPT
Lycopene Probiotic
Lycopene is an antioxidant naturally occuring in tomatoes, giving them their rich red colour. This antioxidant is also known to be lacking in the elderly population, meaning there are higher levels of unregulated oxidative stress. This BioBrick is induced by oxidative stress and produces lycopene as means to 'mop up' the oxidative stress in the environment, in the form of a probiotic.

Day 1 was mutiny. Five students had met with a sponsor in the morning and when the two captains returned to the room, the students were milling around, whispering under their breath, and fidgeting. The problem was with motivation towards the project, as some students felt that it wasn’t novel enough. We had found a 1998 paper by Duport et al. that explained how their team developed yeast to produce pregnenolone and progesterone - the things we wanted to make. It turns out though that the paper didn’t lead to anything, the strain has been lost, and it was a good proof of concept for our idea. From the uprising we learned to communicate thoroughly.

UI-Indonesia,2014,Team:UI-Indonesia#Human Practice#Expert Talking#yohda#_-_-_TEXT.html," ago, a professor in TUAT has succeeded to crystalize the PCR, and developing it towards becoming an important drug target. After all, we need to find a method to make these ideas really works. For example, a newest invention is inserting the dog’s olfactory sensing gene to cells to detect drugs at the airport. It’s very robust and easy to work with. The idea is nice, but we need various breakthroughs to achieve it. We need ideas––yet we need breakthroughs if we want to achieve more.
One of the things that make Synthetic Biology hard to scale up is because of regulation. What do you think?
Well, regulation can changes by the time. Government has to know and notice that Synbio is a part of Science & Technology Development and it can contribute towards better future.
How about in Japan?
There are difficulties, especially in medicals. People are very robust about medical and drugs so they don’t use new ones. You know IPS cell? To use it we need much money; it costs a lot. It’s very nice but we can’t pay that much money––it just costs too much to be applied to many people. It’s a hard battle if we involve money on it.
Is Synbio developed in Japan only involving medicals devices?
We have many projects, such as in food and agriculture, but the government focus only in medicals and some other devices like IPS.
Is the lack of Synbio development only caused by the high cost?
Well, it is also in our mind. We are very nervous on genetically modified tools. Despite the nerve, we still consider the genetically modified foods because the product will be reduced if we ban it. Another thing causes it is also about education. We depend on science and technology but many people in the government and mass communication don’t understand science and the rather conservative. They think science and technology would be dangerous––yet the people are powerful so we couldn’t do anything about it. Even though we depend on science and technology, we have to do something to be applied in our real life. We’re really nervous on safety. We think safety is the most important. I think safety is important, but there are no 100% safety. So, they don’t allow risks. Government always want 100% safety, but they’re wrong. There won’t be anything 100% safe. In the real world there’s always risks.
Is the research being restricted too? Or is it restricted in the application only?
Synbio is very preliminary in Japan, have not been really applied. We couldn’t apply it because the technology is not allowed."

16 Post-Summer Session Update
May 30
I’m only two weeks into my summer research and I feel like I’ve already learned so much! I started a week before everyone else, along with Dan, so we’ve had a bit of time to learn how to use the zSpace and Unity. For the record, zSpace is a machine that can turn a PC into a holographic computing system, which basically means that 3D objects in zSpace actually seem tangible. With the stylus, you can pick up and rotate object to see the entirety of them. Cameras on the machine interact with 3D glasses in order to track head movement and allow the user to see the objects in 3D. In order to make programs that will run on the zSpace, one needs a program that allows them to interact with 3D objects, so we’re working with Unity, a video game development tool.
Most of the first week was spent learning Unity and getting into the flow of working at Wellesley’s HCI Lab. We watched a few tutorial videos, looked through some code, and googled a lot of terminology. Our attempts to learn Unity were so that we could build on a program that was already started by previous HCI students. The program, zMol, intends to provide an interactive way to model the building of molecules without the many plastic pieces that students use now.
After a couple of days we felt more comfortable and started trying to make the buttons on the screen of the program interactive with the zSpace stylus. We made them"

The iGEM Hub
This report or article was collaboratively written by Alto-Helsinki and Stockholm about the iGEM Hub which was setup by Stockholm and used and edited by Alto-Helsinki and Institut Pasteur. Below you'll find out the reasons behind it, a bit on how it works, and why we think it is needed.
In the beginning there was social media
In team Stockholm, in a meeting before lab work had started, the question of communication via Facebook was raised. Facebook was their team’s main means of communication and a lot of important information regarding iGEM was mixed up with more typical Facebook material. This situation was not considered optimal. The communication on Facebook was spread out over different groups and chats; a group for our whole team, individual chat groups for each sub team and other collaborations, events for events, etc.
Why social media may not be optimal for internal communication
Several members expressed their will not to use Facebook for various reasons, and along with personal reasons the fact that Facebook lacks key functions for streamlined collaboration and possibilities to customize. Discussions regarding other means of communication started and the idea of the Hub arose as a common place for teams to discuss and collaborate both within the team and with other teams.
In Aalto-Helsinki, the team from last year had managed to continue a sponsorship to use Flowdock communication platform in 2015. They had started with it in 2014 and found it a good way to keep on track about the project. It does not have similar problems as Facebook: as all of the team members were new to Flowdock, there was no extra clutter: everything that happened on Flowdock, had to do with the project. Emails and Tweets could also be forwarded to different subforums called “flows” to keep on track with other platforms as well. Some problems did however rise: as Flowdock was new to everyone in the team, it took some time to get used to checking it on a regular basis as well as organizing the information. You can create separate flows on Flowdock to discuss different things and tag people as well as discussion topics, but conversations have a tendency to get lost when many ongoing topics are discussed at the same time. For this reason, some of the team members tried to initiate the use of Facebook instead of Flowdock, but as the team was afraid of the same issues that Stockholm had run into, Aalto-Helsinki stuck with Flowdock. Another problem with Flowdock was that"

Conclusion and perspectives
To conclude, we designed a biosafety system based on thermal control. We could imagine tailoring this system for different temperature ranges to meet the user’s needs. The cI repressor could be mutated at different positions to try to modify the transition temperature, as could be the switch temperature of the RNA thermometer. In addition, our project is designed to provide the iGEM community with biobricks that could easily be integrated in the chromosome of any Escherichia coli chassis with a safety system on it. In principle, it could be adapted to other bacterial chassis. However, one biological containment system is likely to be insufficient, and to reduce the likelihood of an environmental contamination, it would be better to multiply the biological (auxotrophic selection, toxin/antitoxin system) or physical (such as the silica beads presented below) security systems. Nevertheless, an increasing number of bacterial modifications may seriously impact the bacterium behavior.
Physical containment
Considering the non-negligible risk of escape of a GEO, we wanted to add an extra layer of safety in our project.  Therefore, we devised a way to physically contain E. coli and other bacteria without hindering it to perform its main function. Indeed, the system we designed is a porous glass beam in which bacteria can grow, survive and carry out their function. The nutrients of the external medium  (sugars, amino acids, etc...) can penetrate inside the devise but the bacteria cannot escape from it.
Thus, the SafetE.coli chassis can be in a safer manner in contact with natural environments, which is an important aspect when the project competes in iGEM competition tracks such as Environment or Health and Medicine.
Some teams include in their project a devise, more or less sophisticated, in which the GEO or their products will perform its function. Here we can cite the 2014 project of NCTU Formosa where we can found an example of such devise: The Pyramid Trap containing PBAN (Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide) produced by a Genetically Engineered Escherichia coli. However, other teams do not have the time or means to do as well.
Thus, the 2015 Paris Sa"

Master of SOE PCR and SDS-bubbles
Marie is one of the few remaining diploma of the TU Darmstadt and the only one of their kind that made it to our iGEM team.
If you need someone to keep a cool head and a bunch of testosterone driven menfolk in control there is no way around her.
She is skilled in all kind of genetic methods and even knows how to play the piano.
Jascha Dimer M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Master of SOE PCR

Overall project: Bacterial Dosimeter
Radiation of one form or another is a constant presence throughout our every day lives. Radiation, or the transmission and absorption of energy over a given distance, has proven an invaluable technology useful in applications for everything from heating our food to diagnosing and treating diseases. Some forms of radiation, however, can be detrimental to the human body, as they are a common cause of such diseases as radiation poisoning and cancer. All types of radiation can be divided into two categories: non-ionizing and ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation (consisting of radio, micro, infrared, and visible electromagnetic waves) contains less energy and has a relatively small effect on living organisms that has only recently been studied. Ionizing radiation, however, contains a much greater amount of energy capable of ionizing atoms which can lead to harmful effects on living tissue. This category of radiation encompasses alpha and beta decay as well as neutron, X-ray, and gamma radiation.
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team. Future applications of our genetic system could be in regards to bio-remediation.

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.   Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental"

Is synthetic biology the best solution?
Not yet. The low viability of pure cultures of PHB-producing bacteria in wastewater has been deemed too costly. Current research indicates mixed cultures best balance efficiency and cost. Our engineered E. coli could not survive in a mixed culture, as they would likely be outcompeted for resources.
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
Demand
In developing countries, our team envisioned PHB production incorporated into smaller-scale wastewater treatment systems in communities that lacked established treatment methods. There is a large demand for wastewater treatment of any kind in developing countries. Current waste management strategies in some areas of the developing world are a hazard to human health. Thus, implementing our system in developing countries would improve sanitation, as the waste can be remediated after our E. coli use it. In addition, biodegradable plastic would help with the problem of plastic waste disposal in these countries (as bioplastics would degrade without need for landfill space, while current petroleum-based plastics are a major pollutant worldwide).
Cost
To gauge cost, we compared PHB production between genetically engineered bacteria and natural bacterial communities in sludge, which have been previously used to feasibly produce PHB. Assuming a community size of 2000 people, solid waste generation of 3.113 x 10-3 m3/day/person (Palanivel & Sulaiman, 2014), COD content of 601 mg/L, COD to PHB conversion of 0.11 for mixed cultures and 0.88 for pure cultures (Rhu et al., 2003) and a price of $5 per kg of PHB (Choi & Lee, 1997), we found that using pure cultures results in additional $2,000 in revenues. However, the cost of sterilization of the waste stream before inoculation with pure culture was estimated at $100,000 (Choi & Lee, 1997).
Impact
Our project would empower communities by providing them the opportunity to produce a high-value product, positively impacting their economy. There will also be profound environmental and health impacts as this system can help decrease water pollution and the spread of disease.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," a biological temperature sensor, we used chromogenic proteins from the DNA2.0 paintbox and from the iGEM registry (Figure 1). Chromogenic proteins or chromoproteins are colored proteins that have been extracted from a variety of organisms such as the sea anemone, Actinia equine [2] or have been synthetically produced (as was the case for the chromoproteins from DNA2.0). Like all proteins, chromogenic proteins are sensitive to heat; however, their sensitivity to heat is coupled with a visible color loss or change. Our research has shown that different chromoproteins respond to different temperatures by either losing their color or changing to a different color. These differential responses to temperature allowed us to build a biological temperature sensor.
Figure 1: This shows the colorful liquid cultures of some of the DNA2.0 chromoproteins.
The basic structure of a chromogenic protein consists of a large beta barrel and a chromophore which is supported by the beta barrel. The chromophore interacts with light and gives the protein its distinctive color. Additionally, the shape of the beta barrel is supported by water molecules that interact with the side chains of the amino acids that the beta barrel comprises of. These water molecules are essential for the chromogenic protein to maintain its structure. In response to heat, our hypothesis is that these water molecules are released from the beta barrel, thus allowing the barrel to collapse and the chromophore to no longer be supported enough to produce color [3]. Because planetary exploration requires a sensor that can function in a variety of environments, we tested our chromogenic proteins in a sealed environment and in an open air environment. The following sections details those experiments.
Closed System: chromoproteins in vivo
To test our chromoproteins in a closed system that did not allow them to interact with anything in the air, we spun down 5 mL cultures of each of our chromoproteins and added 30 µL of the pellet cells to a PCR tube along with 1 µL of 0.165 M EDTA. We then heated these PCR tubes for 5 min at a starting temperature of 40 °C, removed them from the thermal cycler, took a picture, then returned them to the thermal cycler for 5 more minutes at a temperature that was 5 °C higher than the previous. We repeated this process until we reached 100 °C. As can be seen in Figure 2, groups of chromoproteins lose their color at specific temperatures. Additionally, CupidPink and DonnerMagenta change from"

Compare Tinker Cell results against MatLab simulations (Amplficiation model).
Compare SimBiology package (in Matlab) results against equations we have derived. (amplification model).
See how we could explore the problem of false negatives in Protein Display model.
Discuss the protein display false positive.
Prepare presentation for the meeting.
Compare the catechol colour response (cells alive vs. immediate cell death).
Discuss with Matthieu on the issue of negative concentrations, volume approximations made in protein display model and the idea of modelling the false positive case.
Update Modelling section of the Wiki.
Update list of experiments (especially for Protein Display Model) and discuss with Chris and Wolf.
Keep modifying wiki.
Keep writing little bits that were left out previously.
Completion
Tinkercell is not very good at dealing with very high or low values.
SimBiology package generates same graphs as our manual simulations. The interface is quite easy to use.
Decreasing absolute and relative tolerances is becoming accpeted as a solution to a negative concentrration problem.
Modelling of false positive in display protein is postponed as more research need to be done on the affinities etc.
Presentation was given - feedback is to be implemented.
It was deduced that we should model the cells as alife, because of the slow cell death induced by addition of catechol.
Matthieu was consulted and the feedback is posted here.
Restructuring modelling wiki is now on!

Meow-Ludo Meow-Meow
I've got a team in mind.
Nick Coleman
USYD iGEMers- what do you think?
Team DISCO
We can do that! iGEM is an international competition where teams across the world create and deposit genetic sequences into an open source registry, so that the global community can follow on from a single team’s work.
Meow-Ludo Meow-Meow
That’s fantastic! Keep me updated throughout the project, I’m more than happy to help with this process if I can. Also, good luck with the competition!
After researching insulin a little further, we’ve come to realise that there are a few issues we’d like to address.
Firstly, Human insulin purification takes a long time and, depending on the method used, can be very expensive. We investigated alternatives to this process, and we came up with a few expression systems that could be used to improve the folding of insulin inside Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
Secondly, insulin is currently stored at 4°C to preserve its activity. Keeping insulin at this temperature in cold storage chains while it’s being transported is incredibly difficult. This is especially so in lower economic countries, where we hope our insulin will be able to be sold.
So we thought, what if we designed our own, single chain, open source insulin that is also thermostable?
Peter Arvan
I have designed a single chain insulin that I won’t be patenting, would you like to improve upon what I’ve developed?
Team DISCO
That would be so fantastic, thank you so very much Peter. We will try and improve the functionality, especially to try and improve the thermostability of insulin.
Neil Donelan
Hi! As a part of the not-for-profit group Insulin for Life , I currently work to export insulin from Australia to all corners of the globe. We haven’t had any issues with the activity of the insulin we distribute, even though we don’t use any cold chain transportation. I think that any insulin you design, just like the human insulin you’re looking to produce, will be thermostable enough for global transportation without cold storage.
Team DISCO
Oh wow! Thanks Neil for your input. That gives us a lot of confidence to say that our insulins should be able to be distributed without cold chain transportation!
Jeni
Also, just be careful with how much you adapt the insulin you design. Endocrinologists are hesitant to put their patients on biosimilars"

Hi there, my name is Joanna Chen.  Welcome to my notebook for iGEM 2009.  I am on the UC Berkeley Computational Tools team.  This summer we will be working on improving and adding to Clotho, a tool last year's team started making.  I'm excited to be working on this project, and hope the team will have plenty to show by the end of iGEM.  When school starts in the fall, I will be a senior majoring in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley.

Monday was the first day of iGEM.  We met as a team at 9am.  Then, we went to a lab safety training, so we can go into the wet lab to work with the Berkeley experimental iGEM team when necessary.  Following that, we had a pizza lunch with (almost) everyone at Berkeley involved with iGEM this summer.  There, the computational and wetlab teams got to meet each other and hear both team leaders talk briefly about plans for the upcoming weeks.  In the afternoon, Doug gave the computational team a brief overview of EDA (Electronic Design Automation) - his area of research - before showing us two webpages about Clotho and having each of us get an account on Bugzilla, the bug tracking tool we will be using.  He then gave an overview of projects we could work on this summer to improve Clotho.  We ended the day by setting up CVS with Netbeans so we could download the current source code for Clotho.

Week 7 (23"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," introduced our attendees to the competition before moving on to the basics of our project. We explained the essence of synthetic biology, emulating engineering disciplines and what we use bacteria for in the laboratory. Wanting to amaze the students with Vibrio natriegens we set up two different growth experiments together. The goal for the three lab groups was to find out whether they worked with E. coli or Vibrio natriegens.
Figure 3: Our pupils redrawing the growth curve they obtained during their experiment day on a cork board
The students used their specialized laptops with our provided data sheets and explanation to keep track of the data they obtained for the optical density over time.
Most of them had guessed the result even before the final analysis of the growth curve. So even blind high schoolers can tell the benefits of V. natriegens over E. coli. To make the results even more tactile, we weaved an enlarged wire grid on a cork board and used thumbtacks for the individual data points. These were then connected with string - so you could practically feel the growth of V. natriegens. Although we like to emphasize that the visually impaired can handle their way around a laboratory, we enhanced the experience for the students by addressing other senses than just the eyes. We implemented equipment with acoustic outputs like optophones and chemophones into the workflow of the experiments.
Figure 4: We explain how to meassure a growth curve to our pupils
Bleeping Conductivity - Chemophones
A chemophones is a device that registers the changes of conductivity in a solution and translates the current to a buzzing           sound similar to how a Geiger Counter works for radioactivity.
Colour to Sound - Optophones
An optophone translates different contrast to sound, changing between a high pitch and a low pitch tone. The one we used was even capable to say out loud the color that was present in a solution.
However, adaptations needed to simplify existing labware can be easily done by everyone:
Marking pipettes with different number of textured stickers
Highlighting volumes with rubber bands or tape
Locking syringes with thumbtacks at the right volume
Using different temperatures to tell apart two different solutions
Use tape as guidelines on your bench for the positioning of lab equipment
but many more tricks are available with some creativity and practical thinking.
Our second day chemistry experiments were inspired by the dual nature of 3-hydroxypropionic acid, our metabolic engineering target, as both an alcohol and an organic acid. We familiarized the students with the physical and chemical properties of acids"

Single colonies of M15[pREP4] E.coli containing pQE80-L encoding hHBB were used to inoculate 5 ml of fresh LB growth medium supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin. Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, they were induced with a range of IPTG concentrations. They were left to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1 ml sample was taken and the cells pelleted. The cells were resuspended in 100 µl of Laemmli buffer, 20 µl of which was separated by SDS-PAGE. The cells were resuspended in 100 µl of Laemmli buffer, 20 µl of which was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-His antibody.

We wonder if the products made from recombinant Metarhizium anisopliae are convenient and useful.
Previously, emulsifiable powder as the product dosage form and non-woven fabric as the carrier suggested by Dr. Wang Zhongkang, can be proved that our product has stronger storage stability, UV resistance and thermal stability. Besides compared with spore spray, non-woven fabric use less material and small-scale use.
For now, we have taken a step forward to verify our product has the functions including the ability of producing a great amount of spores, high mortality, and necessity of using GreenGround.
Ability of producing a great amount of spores:
In order to ensure that we can produce emulsifiable powder in large quantities, Professor Wang took us to visit the Chinese largest fungal pesticide factory. The production process is shown in the figure.
Fig 1: The emulsifiable powder production flow chart
It can be used after the emulsifiable powder is produced and brushed on the non-woven fabric.
High mortality
We designed an experiment to investigate the difference between lethal period and mortality of our modified transformant and wild-type M.anisopliae. (According to the non-release principle, the experiment only tested the virulence of modified transformant and wild-type M.anisopliae in the laboratory.)
In group infected by wild-type M.anisopliae, we used 10μl emulsifiable powder in a dose of 10^9 conidia/mL to infects 10 cockroaches individually. And in group infected by modified transformant, we used the same among of powder to infect 10 cockroaches individually.

Two paralelles of our supercompetent TG1-cells and two paralelles of TG1 (felles) were made. 10 μL of pgRNA and 10 μL of dCas was added to each of them, and they were growing for 3 hours before plating on LA-petri dishes with CM and AMP.
Results
Transformation was successfull.

Swimming agar assay with L-aspartic acid
We conducted a second swimming agar assay with E. coli MG1655. This time, we added paper discs that were soaked with a L-aspartic acid solution. We wanted to observe whether the bacteria are attracted by the amino acid. We tested again different parameters:
- agar concentrations of 0.15 %, 0.3 % and 0.5 %
- incubation temperatures of 25 oC, 30 oC and 37 oC
- inoculations depths of ""on the surface"", ""under the surface"" and ""deep in the medium""
- aspartic acid concentrations of 0.2 %, 0.1 % and 0.01 %
Photos of swiming agar were taken and travelled distances measured. 0.3% agar was found to be the best for an overnight culture and a temperature of 37oC was too high, since the swarms spread over the whole plate. All plates showed swarm spread at different levels giving inner and outer rings. Unfortunately, we observed no different movement/growth towards the L-aspartic acid compared with the control (water). It was assumed that this is due to the low concentration, but it wasn't possible to made a 0.4 % solution.
The swimming agar experiment was repeated. Since the OD"

Integrated Human Practices
At the beginning of our project, we participated a seminar called ""Synthetic Biotechnology"" supervised by our secondary PI.         In the course of this lecture, we repeated the most used and popular cloning methods. The much more interesting part         was learning some new cloning methods, which are on the cutting edge of gene technology. Subsequent to the seminar,         we started to work out our project idea, finding a way to connect bacteria with a robot. At first, planning everything         was really difficult, because we did not know how and where to begin. Nevertheless, we benefited from the long lasting         experience of our secondary PI and got useful hints for designing of our constructs and how to start them to work         in E. coli. Our secondary PI also suggested to work with the novel gene editing method CRISPR/Cas9. To get familiar         with this system, we got offered an internship in the working group of CRISPR/Cas9.
Skype conference organized by University of Uppsala
Due to our project we took part in a skype conference about safety organized by the University of Uppsala. The discussion         was about general safety in the lab, as well as the risks of the designed constructs and what might happen if they         were released. To evaluate potential risks, we interviewed different experts about the safety aspects of our project         and how to improve our constructs. However, we were able to enhance our designs according to their input and increased         our knowledge in the field of genetic engineering.
Expert Interviews
Horizontal gene transfer, HGT, always represents a certain risk factor. In the course of the interviews, we evaluated,             among other things, the safety assessment of our construct with various professors. The talks focused on the             importance of incorporating deficiencies and discussing different options. Finally, we decided to use the following E. coli strains because of their deficiencies: BL21 DE3 Gold, XL1-blue, TOP10 and DH5alpha. After much discussion,             we decided that these strains are the safest variant for our planned experiment.
Another problem we solved with the aid of an expert was the"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," asked the opinion about using ELECTRACE as a detection system for landmines and how feasible would be to detect landmines by taking samples from the groundwater were the samples are supposed to leak.  Mr. Brady confirmed that there is a leakage, but that is difficult to attach a number to it, or to say how much. However, our sensorial system will work on the same principle as the dog detection. What is sure is that  there is enough leakage, as none of them are 100% sealed. But how much goes into the soil and can be detectable in the ground water is hard to say.  Yet, Mr. Brady see our device as a great potential to identify areas where there is contamination and then that area can l be further process. Currently there is a long process trying to discard areas, if there would be a device that can tell about the contamination and quickly discount areas, and the effort could go toward areas where there are heavy contaminations.
To conclude the interview, we asked his opinion about using the synthetic biology approach to detect landmines. The response was positive and encouraging:  “If we can get a tool that can help people ( …) personally I don’t foresee any principle objections from the community at all ”.

2g sodium alginate was stirred in 100 mL sterile LB and subsequently autoclaved. This seems to improve dissolving the alginate, the solution is much less viscous. Chloramphenicol (100μL) was added to keep it sterile. The cells, GFP (I13522) and RFP (I13521) are both in the pSB1C3 backbone. Dropping LB alginate into CaCl2 leads to gel formation, but it seemed to take a little bit longer since bigger droplets were created, nevertheless stable ones. Patterns were drawn to print the cells the next day.
10/08/2015
It turns out, autoclaving breaks down sodium alginate. Since a hydrogel is still formed, 4% w/v sodium alginate is dissolved in 50 mL LB and autoclaved to check for improvement of gelatinization. 2g alginate was dissolved in 50 mL LB and autoclaved.
LB agar is tested containing CaCl2 at a concentration of 0.1M for hydrogel formation.
10 mL was plated and tested for gelatinization with both 2% w/v sodium alginate dissolved in water and in LB.
0.1M CaCl2 in the agar results in efficient gelatinization of both normal 2% w/v sodium alginate in water and in LB. 4% w/v sodium alginate is less homogeneous than 2% and does not show improved gelatinization compared to 2%. 2% is fine to use.
11/08/2015
Patterns (logo, fb, twitter, cells) were printed at 0.1 mL/min on LB agar CAM + 0.1 M CaCl2 plates. Both line thickness and precision were improved like this. They were kept for 2h in the fridge before imaging.

A little extra about our project:
Food Spoilage ­ What your mom doesn’t know about! Food spoilage is a common kitchen disaster hiding behind a closed shelf or buried deep within   refrigerator which all of us have been frustrated with. It is one of the most important reasons a   lot of quality edible food product go to waste. Spoilage is characterized by any change in a food   product that renders it unacceptable to the consumer from a sensory point of view. (Lone Gram,   2002)  In reality it is a vibrant problem though pictured individually this picture does not zoom   out beyond minor negligence in kitchen – leaving yogurt out in open, cauliflowers pushed too far   behind in the chill tray.  However these food spoilage incidents do happen at industrial and farm   level  too  where  a  lot  of  quality  raw  product  can  go  to  waste  before  it  can  be  made  fit  for   consumption. Expenses which would have to be taken into consideration because of it would   include:  medical  care,  including  hospital  costs;  laboratory  investigations;  the  cost  to  the   economy generally of production and wages lost through illness; loss of production and market   share  for  food  manufacturers  implicated  in  outbreaks,  and  legal  expenses  in  the  event  of   prosecution or claims for compensation (Eley, 1992). All of this accounts for a large economic   loss. There are two main reasons for food spoilage: ­ “Naturally occurring biochemical changes” and   “Microbial Activity”. Similar to human’s digestion microbes – bacteria and fungi break down the   food particles into simple derivatives acids and similar other waste products may be released   changing the physical properties and chemical structure of our food. In severe cases they can   cause food poisonings and in extreme experiences have also resulted in death!  Between 1980­  1989 Cases of food poisoning bacteria in England and Wales rose from 10856 to 25818. (Eley,   1992).
When food gets  spoilt we generally tend to identify it by tasting or detecting  change in  color,   texture"

Has a positive tone, reporting that synbio is young, no serious threat yet, and has “more promise than peril”.   - “America cautious, but okay, with synthetic biology”, Elizabeth Weise, Sept. 10, 2010. Talks about the new field getting exposure to the American public. The synbio project did a survey revealing that people like synbio for some purposes, but not others.    - “The human genome: Big advances, many questions”, Steve Sternberg, Aug. 10, 2010. How the human genome project very naturally led to the new field of synbio. Concerns about when the technology leaves the hands of top researchers and trickles down to grads, undergrads, and the public.   -"
Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," therefore a relatively extensive screening process is needed to find the colonies that carry the designed fragment.                  Additionally, we had ongoing support by Jérémy to fix upcoming issues, which we had a lot of.
Alina, who was in charge of our security level 2 lab, contacted Jérémy for further troubleshooting, hence we had starting issues with the protocol. Continuous communication between our team and Jérémy helped us to fix our issues. We needed to tweak the PCR reactions due to some chemicals, enzymes being unavailable to us, being inexperienced with the method we needed council to make sure our changes would not alter the outcome.
Eventually Alina was able to troubleshoot the Golden-Gate-Assembly with Jérémy’s help so that we were finally able to amplify the whole construct with 6107 bp. Which we were able to verify by colony PCR and sequencing.
Since we were unable to find a proper solution to our problems with HMWP2 ourselves, many thanks go to Evry for their dedicated support.
TU Delft
A collaboration with iGEM Delft felt natural to us for multiple reasons, first in the current lineup from Delft is a former student, Isabell, from our university, which prompted us to contact team Delft early. While we were visiting Delft for the European meetup we met the  team multiple times. During our stay  in Delft we had multiple occasions where we exchanged ideas and spoke about each other's projects.
Second our projects are basically designed to work together, Delft worked on a crispr-cas based detection method for multiresistant bacteria, and we developed a new antibiotic compound to target some of those. Sadly, this would involve both teams completing their projects before we start a collaboration. Which might have worked, in reality we both found out that synthetic biology often takes a lot of time and the verification of the own experiments has to be prioritized.
Nonetheless we made plans, even though they never came to fruition. The planned cooperation involved Delft identifying enterobacteria that are carbapenem resistant, identified strains would then be tried with our novel antibiotic compounds and tested for siderophore receptors. All in all we would have been able to identify and eliminate multiresistant bacterial threats.                  Many thanks to iGEM Delft who were great partners in developing important ideas to change our world for the better, and of course for the organisation of the European Meetup!

Safety considerations are very important when conducting any research with recombinant DNA technologies to control or prevent possible adverse outcomes of the research. When designing our project, we asked ourselves if our project ideas would raise safety issues in terms of researcher's safety, public safety or environmental safety. While it is not necessary to steer completely clear of research agendas that might pose safety risks because of their possible positive benefits, it is important to account for those risks by implementing safety protocols to protect the health of the researchers, public and environment.
Because no organism or biobrick part we used is from an infectious organism, we use no human cell lines or cultures, no biological toxins or toxin coding regions and do not release our organisms into the environment for testing, the safety considerations of our project are less than the projects of many other teams.
Our project is done in two phases. First, the construction of genetic constructs through biobrick parts in DH5alpha bacteria and Second, the transformation of the completed constructs into trp- FY4 yeast for intrabody library screening and production. While some strains of E. coli are more suitable to recombinant DNA work because of genomic deletions that make them less stable in the wild, the DH5alpha strain is important to our work because of its very high transformation efficiency. Because this strain is slightly more hardy, certain safety protocols have been instituted to prevent escape of biological agents into the environment: All petri plates deposited in biohazard waste collection which is incinerated before disposal, all liquid cultures are kept under 5 mL and are combined with 10% bleach and left for 30 minutes to kill all biological agents before disposal. The trp- FY4 strain of yeast is unable to survive in the wild due to its incapacity to synthesize tryptophan, but the same safety procedures are still used.
The inherent danger of the genetic constructs in our system is minimal. The constructs entailing the most thought of biological safety are the gene expression control elements, the diversified iDab library constructs, which affect transcription of the yeast genome. Because these constructs are only active in the genome of the organism with Lex operators, it is very unlikely that even direct human exposure to yeast translating these proteins will have"

On Tuesday 21th of September we had a second gathering entitled  “Safely continue with synthetic biology” with all Dutch iGEM Teams, the RIVM and the Rathenau Institute. Here we presented our project and what our final implementations were of “Safe-by-Design”. The purpose of Safe-by-Design is to make sure that all the safety aspects have been considered during the design stage of your product. This made Safe-by-Design the topic of the day.
Figure 1. Photo taken during the meeting on 21th of September.
The afternoon was initiated by prof. Dr. Erik Lebret,  Risk Assessment researcher at the RIVM and Dr. ir. Melanie Peters, director of the Rathenau Institute. Erik Lebret gave the kick-off by stressing the importance of incorporating risk management from the beginning of the manufacturing process development. Whether Melanie Peters emphasized the responsibilities after fabricating, because safety isn’t only a matter of engineering.
This day we also spoke about the ethics side of safe by design in the application of biotechnology. According to Sabine Roeser, ethics professor at TU Delft, emotions and art are the sources of ethical in Safe-by-Design.
At the end of the day we had workshops about previous iGEM projects and discussed several important safety aspects of these projects. Perhaps we should sometimes consider whether biotechnology solutions are the best solutions.
This day highlighted a lot of safety aspects iGEM, and compelled us to consider safety and security while working on our project.

Light-off system
We use the light-off system from 2017 SSTi-SZGD to kill our bacteria after effecting.
It contains two parts.
The switch
One is a light-repressed system containing a single light repressor LexA-VVD, and a ColE promoter containing an SOS operator sequence for LexA binding, regulates the expression of target genes.
Upon light exposure, the light-switchable repressor LEVI[1] is induced to form homodimers, which then bind to the operator sequence and repress the activity of a promoter by blocking the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter. Removal of blue light results in gradual dissociation of the dimers and transcription activation. I repressor, which can repress the activity of the R-O12 promoter, is under the control of the LightOff system. Upon light illumination, LEVI homodimerizes, then represses the expression of cI repressor and initiates target gene expression.
The Killer
Another is for the target gene to kill the bacteria, there we use a suicide gene that encodes Supernova[2], which is a mutant form of well-known KillerRed, the first engineered genetically-encoded photosensitizer. Photosensitizer contains chromophores that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon illumination, and it is commonly used for illumination-induced destruction of targeted cells.
In general, it forms a light switch and a killer to control the lives of our bacteria, it confirms the safety of our whole project.
After our bacteria are released in the gut environment for several hours, they can be eliminated by our immune system. Our project uses this method to ensure the bacteria to be dead the time they are released into the environment. It can be safe for humans and friendly to the environment.
Then we conduct some experiments to verify the kill-switch's function.
However, the amount of the P. aeruginosa does not show significant reduction after the lighting. We indicate that the plasmid electrotransformation may be not quite successful. Or may because the type of bacteria--Pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been used in this method before, and the pl"

Restriction Digest
Purpose: Digestion takes advantage of naturally occurring sequences in order to cleave DNA at specific sections. This is often utilized to isolate specific fragments of a plasmid so that new genetic material can be introduced.  Restriction sites are usually a six nucleotide sequence and it is important to choose restriction sites that are unique to the vector if cloning is being attempted; otherwise, it is possible that the plasmid will cut in multiple locations. Restriction enzymes can also be used to check and see if plasmid has the desired genes in it by choosing a enzyme that will produce multiple DNA fragments and then running it through gel electrophoresis to see if the experimental bands match the desired lengths of DNA.
Procedure:
1. The necessary restriction enzymes were identified by using ApE.
2. The following solutions were added to a PCR tube, adding the restriction enzymes last.
10x Appropriate Buffer - 5 µL
PCR Product - 2 µg
Restriction Enzyme 1 - 1µL
Restriction Enzyme 2 - 1 µL
ddH2O - to 50 µL
*The buffer may change based on the restriction enzymes that were being used. The Double Digest Finder was used from the New England BioLabs website. https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/interactive-tools/double-digest-finder.
3. The Double Digest Finder was used to determine the temperature at which the digestion would take place.

Week 24 (June 11 - June 17)
Synthlab Overview
The first day in the lab was used for creating media of different types and concentrations for the species to be grown on for two reasons:
To illustrate an examine the growth rate (for modeling)
To multiply our pure species for use in liquid media
We used different PDA and MEA media for the species. It was also the plan to create Vogel's medium as well as a mineral salt medium as certain species had shown in the previous study to grow well. However, we did not have the proper materials to create those two and discarded the idea. We also came to this conclusion as we were recommended not to spend time on specific media just yet.
