PAM sequence: NG
sgRNA length: 20 bp of target sgRNA
Off target possibility (seed to target): 10 bp (50 % adjacent to PAM should be identical)
As seen in figure 20, the algorithm detected several PAM sequences close to exon-exon junctions and found the minimum number of necessary guides for each one.
Figure 20. Results from the model to find the possible PAM sequences and the minimum number of sgRNAs needed at each exon-exon junction in the EPO gene coding sequence.
Figure 20 clearly shows that in junction 3 there is the optimal PAM sequence with smallest number of sgRNAs possible. This way, the algorithm generates the sgRNAs and gives an output with the position of such sgRNA. In this specific case, there were two PAM sequences near Junction 3 that had the same minimal number of possible sgRNAs necessary (12 guides each). The algorithm does not ignore one or the other, but outputs both options (or more if available). This array can be used to generate the library of sgRNAs for targeted next generation sequencing of gene doping.
3.2 Gene Doping Model
The concentration of EPO gene doping DNA in blood increases rapidly in the first 1.5 days after injection before decreasing exponentially. Due to the rapid clearance of the adenoviral vectors from the blood and muscle, the majority of the infection events occurs right after injection. As more infected cells die, the number of infected cells decreases. This decreases the amount of doping DNA released into the blood over time, as seen in figure 21.
Figure 21. Concentration of doping DNA in the blood over time after a single intramuscular injection of 141 billion viral vectors. The estimated detection limit of 1000 copies per mL of blood is based on the loss of DNA that occurs during sample preparation and targeted sequencing preparation
Using regression, the half-life of EPO gene doping DNA in blood was determined to be around 41 days.. While the half-life of cfDNA in blood is around 10 minutes, the slow release of the gene doping DNA from the dying infected cells significantly increases the detection window. EPO gene doping cDNA administered to cynomolgus macaques using adeno-associated viral vectors was detectable for up to 57 weeks after injection in infected white blood cells ( Ni et al. 2011 ). The concentrations ranged from 333 to 500 copier per mL. While the target cell of the study was muscle cells, the DNA was found in white blood cells due"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," environment und this genetic material can used for nutrients, to repair the genome or to promote horizontal gene transfer when integrated it into their genome by homologous recombination (Antonova et al.2015) . There was identified multiple environmental cues sufficient to induce natural transformation. For the most Vibrio species the phenomenon of natural transformation is induced by Chitin (Meibom et al.2005) . In the natural aquatic environment of for example V. cholerae there are many chitinous shells of crustacean zooplankton which induces the expression of the competence regulator Tfox (Meibom et al.2005) .
For natural transformation several steps are necessary: At first the DNA has to be transported into the cell. After the DNA is bound to the cell, the Type IV Pillus (T4P) picks it up and transported it through secretion pores in the outer membrane into the periplasm. From there the DNA is translocated across the membrane by using a conserved membrane pore into the cytoplasm. If the DNA is arrived in the cell, it can be integrated by homologous recombination (Mellet al.2014) .
This process is dependent on some cellular structures, including type IV Pilli or related pseudopilli and many competence-related proteins and various regulator systems. The regulator Tfox activated the Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) and that allows bacteria to inject directly into prey cell membranes or cytoplasm. It is a nanomachine that have many functions, one is a part of the natural competence regulon. Although much process has been made in this area, the molecular details of natural competence is not understood completely (Wu et al.2015) .
Is Vibrio natriegens - a member of the vibrio species - natural competent, too?         At the moment it is not so much known about the functionality of this process in Vibrio natriegens. However, it was discovered that it is natural competent and the Tfox regulates this property. But, it is not clear how Tfox is induced. It has been shown that in V. natriegens it is not induced by chitin as is the case with most Vibrio species. It was shown that you can express Tfox on an IPTG-inducible plasmid and there you get a high rate of natural transformation. In 2017 the group of Ankur B. Dalia showed that it was possible to integrate a linear PCR product with an antibiotic cassette that replaces the gene encoding the DNA endonuclease Dns in V"

asRNA
Inhibition system
Inhibition system
asRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that can inhibit mRNA translation by binding to the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of that mRNA. This, therefore, can be an effective way to inhibit the expression of a great amount of genes.
That is the case of the Salmonella OmpN gene, whose translation is inhibited by the conserved RybB asRNA, which forms a short duplex with the ompN CDS. Bouvier et al.(2008) , studied this inhibition of ompN gene by RybB asRNA and they concluded that RybB does not sequester the ompN SD or AUG sequences, but the interaction takes place inside the CDS. Using probing experiments, supported by prediction with the RNAhybrid algorithm ( Rehmsmeier et al. (2004) ) they determined the interaction model.
Figure 1. Taken from Bouvier et al.(2008) .
As we can see in Figure 1, RybB forms a 4+11 bp RNA duplex with the ompN CDS, that inhibits its translation. Furthermore, by chemical synthesis of the first 16 nucleotides of RybB, they proved that this fragment was enough to inhibit the translation of ompN, this inhibition being even 4-fold higher than that with the full-length RybB RNA. The remaining nucleotides of the asRNA form the rho-independent terminator of the RNA transcription. In Figure 2 we can see the full-length RybB RNA.
Figure 2. Full-length RybB aligned with two chimera asRNAs. The ompN target site is also shown. Taken from Bouvier et al.(2008) .

Additionally, medicines have strict criteria, whereby each package needs to be equal and have the same dose. This is difficult to realize when working with living organisms. An option is to store the medicine in compartments in the bacteria. Another problem which has to be taken into account in future research is the presence of DNAses and RNAses in the intestines. These proteases are able to go through the pores of the alginate beads and will break down the aptamers.
Even though there are still many obstacles, it is believed to be the prospective manner of taking and secreting medicine. Therefore, permissions to do research with GMOs in the intestines are given more often these days. For example, the COGEM has given permission to perform an I-phase trial on a study about the secretion of IL-10 by GMOs in the intestines, to target treatment of Crohn’s disease. The first tests on humans are already done with promising results [9] . Another example is the study of programmable bacteria, which can detect and record an environmental signal in the mammalian gut [10] . These studies offer good prospects for our COMBs in the future.

There were also people who brought the K'NEX to us, and could immediately have a look at the printer we’ve got so far. We’d like to thank Ronald Kest, Ina Venema and Iris Meijhorst for their donation!
Sorting the K’NEX
After we received everything, we started to sort through thousands of parts, some of which we didn’t know existed. We founds lots of useful parts and after sitting for a few hours with most of the team, we were done. The result was amazing, we had a sea of K’NEX to chose from for designing the perfect DIY 3D printer.
Donating to Charity
The K'NEX we received have been put to great use, as shown on the hardware page .Thanks to the generosity of so many people, we received far more K'NEX than we required. We would therefore like to put the ""left-over"" K'NEX to good use. We have already donated one of the printers to the Science Center of Delft , but we want to do more. Therefore  we have decided to donate the K'NEX to a suitable charity, so that others will be able to use their imagination and creativity to make whatever they desire.

Collaboration with Macquarie University
We assisted team Macquarie by making a graphical user interface (GUI) on MatLab. The GUI that was made is a graph which shows how the concentration of various intermediates including ALA (on the Y-axis) changes over time (X-axis) in chlorophyll. Team Macquarie provided a list of specifications for the interactive graph they wanted. These specifications include:
1. Creating an interactive display that plots the Chlorophyll concentration as a function of time.
2. Increase or decrease the time duration with the help of a slider.
3. The maximum duration of time should be 16 days.
4. Users should be able to zoom in and out of plot.
The GUI was created using Matlab’s built in app, GUIDE (GUI development environment). GUIDE was ideal for this problem as it allowed for complete customisation of the of the interactive graph according to the specifications of team Macquarie.
The GUIDE interface allows the programmer to easily place plots, sliders, texts and buttons, amongst other handles, in the exact position that is needed. Figure 1 shows the GUIDE interface as well as the layout that was designed for Macquarie according to their team’s specifications. These included allowing the user to enter the initial total enzyme concentration as well as the ALA concentration. The user can also set the number of days using the slider. The plot is then generated automatically upon each input.

Staff, Department of Biology U.Va.
Ms. Christopher was incredible guide for our team as we traversed us through our team's summer WetLab adventure.  From helping us set up our lab and summer and fall experimentation to providing us with insight as the team was conducting procedures, Ms. Christopher's contributions to our team were incredibly useful to the success of our team over the summer and fall.
The people mentioned here aided us in the design and execution of our project. The lab work, modeling, human practices work, and web design was completed by members of Virginia iGEM 2017.
Wastewater
Tim Castillo was extremely kind to give our team a tour of the Rivanna Wastewater Treatment Plant and gave us deep insight into its operation. He also provided us with a year's worth of monitoring data from RWTP which helped us inform our project, especially the Bioreactor design.
Preparation and Beginning Dates
Our PI, Professor Kozminski, teaches an introductory Synthetic Biology course that all members of the team are required to take.  This class meets for three hours every week.  Basic synthetic biology concepts were introduced and literature was discussed.  Our final project consisted of us teaming up to identify a world issue and then find a synthetic biology solution.  We started this class in January when our spring semester began.
We began brainstorming for our project on May 23rd, and we began our lab work on May 24"
ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Experiments#Anti Cancer Toxin_-_-_TEXT.html," time point where gene expression seemed to have stopped according to separate characterization experiments (see here link to bfr). Samples from each culture were transfered in a 96-well plate and both their absorbanse at 600nm (Abs 600nm)  and their sfGFP content was evaluated in a plate reader. In the same plate we also included several concentrations of purified sfGFP allowing us to create a standard curve of sfGFP concentration (Figure 3). This standard curve, eventually allowed us to quantify the expression of sfGFP in the culture samples (Figure 4). A detailed protocol is available in Protocols.
RESULTS
The mean sfGFP concentration per cell was plotted for the biological samples under examination (Figure 2).
Figure 3. A standard curve of sfGFP fluorescence was obtained as the fluorescence of different purified sfGFP concentrations was measured via a spectrophometer. Based on this equation we can convert the fluorescence intensity into actual sfGFP concentration in our sample.
Figure 4. Concentration of sfGFP per cell for different bacterial cultures under different AHL induction conditions in biological triplicates. Upon induction with 10-4M of AHL (+) both the operons expressing sfGFP are producing almost up to 90 - 100 mg/L of sfGFP in comparison with the DMSO mock-induced cultures  (-) which produced less than 10 mg/L due to promoter leakiness. The bacteria carrying the empty vector control showed no fluorescence as expected, due to the lack of the sfGFP expressing operon.
The overexression and accumulation of sfGFP only after AHL induction was also verified via:

Organization of our modeling projects
On this page, we describe our main modeling project, which was integral for our whole project.       However, besides this complex modeling, we also conducted and applied several straight-forward stochastic and statistical models       to support and guide numerous steps of our laboratory work. Some of these modeling projects are briefly described in this box; however,      we recommend reading the linked pages for further information.
Discriminant function model for the ICG prediction:
We conducted a discriminant function analysis for the classification of nucleotides in Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads    at a specific position. This model is part of our iCG software module and enabled the successful detection of unnatural bases.
Calculation of the required library size for the selection system:
We applied combinatorics and statistics to calculate the optimal library size for the tRNA synthetase selection process. This was a trade off between putting lots of efforts into constructing a very huge library and missing diversity in a too small library.     Therefore, we predicted the optimal library size. Experimental validation of this prediction was done via MiSeq analysis of the diversity     of a subset of this library.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Notebook#Microbiology_-_-_TEXT.html,"As you can see, none of the strains are able to degrade Quercetin except our positive control.
The issue is that these strains were collected from M9 Quercetin plates, so at least we were expecting some Quercetin degradation.
We suggest that it was a problem with the dilution factor. Indeed 10^-3 is maybe not enough. The other problem is that it is quite hard to streak small and isolated colonies from these plates, because of the quercetin green color on plate. Thus, we are just able to see big colonies.
The other important point is that some strains are not able to use Quercetin as a carbon source to grow. These strains won’t be selected with this technique using a single source carbon. But these strains maybe able to degrade Quercetin as a substrate for other metabolism.
Here are the first 16S PCR we did for strains 52 to 104. We have to notice that 16S rRNA is present in every bacteria, which means that this PCR is really sensitive : if there is contamination of the strain, usually e.coli in a lab, it's 16s rRNA can be amplified instead of the desired strain's.
Knowing that, we did numerous negative control to ensure that our PCR were pure, and that no contamination interfere with our sequencing procedure, following exactly the same PCR protocol but without adding bacteria to the mix. Thus, all the PCR were maid under the hood, which was anyway essential for our safety, as we were working with unknown bacteria isolated from soil, in order to identify them
All the PCR were made at the same time which explain why the negative control don't necessarily appear in the same gel of all their related PCR products. Of course, it is essential to check.
C stands for control : here, you can see that they are completely negative, which means no contamination should have interfered with our samples.
Week 19th-25th September
For the next assay, we chose to increase the amount of cells in the media.
We inoculate 500 µl instead of 100 µl of overnight culture in 5 ml of M9 Quercetin liquid media.
Also, concerning plating, we noticed that we most of the time had more or less 4 species of bacteria on non-selective agar. That is annoying because our aim is to have a maximum of bacterial diversity for the database.
Yellow plots are some contamination with some fungi in it. But we have at least 3 strains that seems to be very efficient in the degradation.
We took these strains and"
Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," experiments produced fluorescence, but the experiments with the test cell produced no  fluorescence. which means  (no breakdown of signaling molecule should occur).
Expected Benefits
Thanks to bacteria’s ability to make quick and profound changes in gene transcription, quorum sensing can be used to detect a low amount of signaling molecules and report their presence quickly.  With further research and thorough engineering applications, it may be possible to detect other antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are unknown until now.
If it is proven as valid and effective through sufficient tests, this technique could be disseminated to  hospitals and clinics to test the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We hope that this technique, if properly adjusted for functional advancement, can detect antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a relatively short time with only a small amount of sample secured from the patient. This would provide an advantage over the traditional detection methods, culture-based approaches which require one or several days of incubation period.
Because chemicals involved in species-specific quorum sensing is very specific, it might be possible to  dramatically resolve the problem of overnight incubation.  Because an initial sample from a patient is usually contaminated and has only a small concentration of the wanted bacteria, it is often  impossible to detect any antibiotic-resistance without purification and amplification through overnight incubation.  But because species-specific quorum sensing involves biochemical that are highly specific, and the quorum sensing chemicals are not affected as much by the contamination, the method utilizing quorum sensing might be applied with relatively less purification processes.  Also, because some quorum sensing mechanisms have built in positive feedback, with the right engineering, the mechanism could work with only a little amplification process.
More innovative detection methods such as quantitative PCR(qPCR) or microarrays, and advanced molecular  detection (AMD) are based on accumulated previous data and, thus, render very accurate results, but they require complicated  procedures and heavy equipment.  On the other hand, this quorum sensing-based detection method will provide benefits to patients with handy procedure and quicker detection results. We believe quicker and easy detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will lead to better containment of such dangerous bacterial strains.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html,"Hey, I’m Adam a second year Chemical Engineering student at the Schulich school of Engineering. This year I helped iGEM Calgary primarily on the bioreactor subgroup making the bioreactor prototype and helping with the Maya animations. This is the first time I have been a part of iGEM and I had a wonderful experience. In my spare time I like to play soccer and video games. I also love traveling with friends and exploring the world. My favorite place in the world is Grenada, Spain because of culture and history of the city.
Ali Honarmand
Hi I’m Ali and I’m starting my third year of biological sciences this fall. iGEM is my first research experience and so far it’s been awesome: Learning about synthetic biology, being part of a great team and having fun. This summer I was part of the desulfurization subgroup mainly mutagenizing genes. I think the best part of iGEM is being able to test new ideas. Besides university I play soccer, bike, run, volunteer, read and snowboard.
Anya Kornilo
I finished my 3rd year as a joint major in Biological and Computer Sciences. I am looking forward to participating in the wet lab component of iGEM this summer. This will be my first time trying out independent research in the lab. I'm excited to be a part of such diverse group of students and can't wait to see what we can come up with! In my spare time I am involved in swimming, gymnastics and enjoy many kinds of music.
Asim Chawdhry
I am an undergraduate student pursuing a double major at the University of Calgary. I am currently in my fourth year of a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Biological Science, and my third year of a Bachelor of Commerce degree with a specialization in Marketing. This has been my first experience working with iGEM, and I have primarily been involved in the wet lab with the hydrocarbon decarboxylation team. I believe that iGEM provides a great opportunity for students from several different disciplines to get together and combine their knowledge and interests, and work towards a common goal. Whenever given the opportunity, I love going out to the mountains to ski! I am also an avid car enthusiast.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#proof2_-_-_TEXT.html," Luckily, we found that we can confirm the expression of biotin and its expressing percent under Flow cytometer.
We use FITC-streptavidin to stain Saccharomyces cerevisiae and use 488nm exciting light to excite it and detect fluorescent signal at 525nm. As the result showed here, the fluorescent peak shifted towards the direction of stronger fluorescent, which means positive sample express more biotin acceptor peptide(BAP)  Compared with the results of empty sample, we can ensure that BAP is displayed on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Above the threshold, there are 48% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the positive sample. While in the negative sample and empty sample, the percentage is only 28%.
Fig 2.5 the result of FCM for yeast
Fig 2.5.1 the x-mean level of FCM result
Fig 2.5.2 the CV of FCM result
Under the same CV, the mean fluorescence of BAP-biotin expressing S.cerevisiaeEBY100 (positive) is 1.5 times higher than that of S.cerevisiaeEBY100 with an empty plasmid (negative).Considering the wild type S.cerevisiae(empty), the fluorescent of negative control is almost zero.(the slight fluorescent of it may come from the residue of PBS)
Co-cultivation verification
We aimed to build an adhesion platform of E. coli and S.cerevisiae. Therefore, first we need to select a culture condition under which the heterogeneous cells can both grow happily. Taking into account the expression of the BAP in S.cerevisiae, galactose is required to induce protein expression. And to avoid diauxic growth of yeast when changing a new carbon source in the medium, we ultimaytely selected the YNB-CAA galactose medium. In order for the optimize expression of INP-MSA fusion protein, the in-ducing expression of BAP, and the growth rate of two heterogeneous cells, we took 28 ℃ as the culture temperature.
We characterized the growth curve of E. coli with JIM target gene and that of S.cerevisiae containing BirA & Bap under the mentioned culture condition. And the dry group wonder some parameters of the growth of E.coli and S.cerevisiae, as well as the consumption of galactose.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Overview
As the name International Genetically Engineered Machine describes, iGEM is a competition that harnesses the use of molecular and genetic techniques for innovation and design of novel tools and devices for real-world applications. In order to harmonize the newly emerging field of nanotechnology with genetic engineering, iGEM Concordia’s 2016 team has been experimenting with effective methods of nanoparticle synthesis and attachment to different cell types, including  Escherichia coli bacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. In order to work toward nanoparticle synthesis and attachment, molecular cloning methods were utilized, and several BioBricks parts were improved in the process. iGEM Concordia has successfully contributed parts: BBa_K2045000 and BBa_K2045003 to the iGEM parts registry.
BBa_K2045001 FhuA-GBP: Ferrichrome Iron outer membrane transporter-gold binding peptide
In order to effectively bind gold nanoparticles to E.coli, Ferrichrome Iron outer membrane transporter was used as a binding intermediate between the E.coli cell and gold nanoparticles. This was done by improving iGEM BCCS-Bristol’s part, BBa_K259000, by fusing a gold binding peptide with their part which was FhuA. We sought to synthesize and display the gold nanoparticles on the surface of E.coli cells. A gold binding peptide is a series of amino acids that have an affinity to gold, mostly sulfide based amino acids, since sulfide groups have a natural chemical affinity to gold. This property makes it a vital part for iGEM Concordia for effective attachment of gold nanoparticles onto the cell surface of E.coli. In order to accomplish this; gold nanoparticles were displayed by fusing the gold binding peptide with FhuA. FhuA is a ferrichrome Iron outer membrane transporter which we"

Quantitative App
DNA binding to TALEs
The positive DNA's are colored red, negative DNA is green, TALEs are black and after binding (i.e. saturation) they turn blue. The sliders under ""global settings"" are parameters needed before the simulation runs. Given that a simulation can take 30 seconds to complete, they should not be changed frequently as it will take longer to show the results. The sliders under ""display settings"" are parameters needed after the simulation runs. Their responses are much faster and are best played by clicking on the plus sign to the right and hit ""Play"". If you only see a grey box, you may need to install the Mathematica CDF Player. The download link can be found here . Otherwise, the data from our model, as well as images of the app we designed, can be found on the quantitative modelling page .

Don't worry, everything is under control. For the DNA binding to TALEs agent based model, wait for at least 30 seconds. If the problem persists, reset the current time to 1. For the kinetic models, use the plus/minus sign to change the parameters, or simply hit auto-run on the upper-right corner.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Educating Program
The background of the TKES educating program
We all know that the future depends on our next generation, and the next generation depends on education. However, we saw some problem in Taiwan’s science and mathematic education. Trends in Mathematics and Science Study(TIMSS) will investigate the 4th           grades and 8th grades students achievement and attitude in science and mathematic
Achievement

3rd place in 39 country
37th place in 39 country
35th place in 39 country
2015 TIMSS result of Taiwan student
In the 2015 TIMSS report, you can find out that Taiwan student is doing great in the science achievement, getting 6th place and 3rd place in 4th grade and 8th grade respectively. Surprisingly, Taiwan student is lack of confident and lost their interest           in science. In 4th grade, student’s confident in science and like learning science are still in the average, nevertheless they drop to the bottom in 8th grade. This is because we learning through a lot of memorization, homework, tests and pressure.           We study hard in science is basically because we have to, not we like to. For this reason, we want to try our best to change this circumstance.
To do so, we contacted with TKES, a school next to our university. They have been working hard on special science education program for many years, and gave us three classes of fourth grade students to do this educating program, each class have approximately           30 students. Before we started our progrm, it is our honor to meet “Grandpa” Chen, former director of Tainan’s Children Science Museum, who gave us many useful advices:
Teach them with fun and games, prize is sometimes necessary
Other then teaching them pure knowledge, talk about their life and use children’s language
Separate them into groups, the stronger one will learn how to teach others, and he or she can improve in another way
EXPERIMENT! No one likes to keep sitting their and doing nothing.
After many discussion and revised, this is our plan:
We are going to do a five-week program, every week we will have two hours to do"

After preparing enough, we invited our instructors to attend the 2nd reply. Compared with the last time, instructors’ attitude was more positive. They supported our whole idea and experimental design. The most inspiring thing is that we discussed the human immunity prob-lems with immunologist Hu Hongbo. He directly pointed out that although the bacteria in the dialysis device are indirectly contact with human being’s blood, once the bacteria debris or metabolite flow into blood, furious immune reaction will happen. He suggested we can try to avoid such risk by optimizing our dialysis device, increasing its leakproof ability and knocking out some gene of our engineering bacteria to decrease its toxicity. In addition, we can use animal experiment to mimic the leak of bacteria and find out the superior limit of the extent of immune reaction that we can accept.
Those valued opinions helped us to improve our project’s design in the parts of hardware, engineering bacteria and animal experiment. Human being’s immune reaction is always the biggest problem we confront, and professor Hu’s suggestions guided us to a brighter way. We do appreciate professor Hu and other instructors’ contribution.
Integrated HP with Clinical Doctors
1. West China Hospital Visiting for the 1st time With Dr. Yi Liu
After determining the main content and purpose of this project, we began to search for more related references to replenish our design. However, through this period, we found we shouldn’t only rely on references to design our subject. The data we researched on the Internet might not be real-time or specific enough, and a better way to know whether our design is meaningful to the clinic is getting close to it. Hence, we went to hospital and talked with doctors to get some first-hand clinic data and explore the real problems which they are facing with in the real clinical situation.
On 23rd April 2017, we went to rheumatology and immunology department, WestChina Hospital to visit Doctor Liu Yi. Doc. Liu introduced the cure situation of gout to us from many aspects, including patients’ condition, current clinical treatment methods, general drugs, etc. She also pointed out the argument on whether patients with hyperuricemia but no gout symptom should take medicine. Moreover, during the conversation, we knew that the biggest problem in the progress of decreasing patients’ uric acid level is that patients refuse to take medicine or can’t insist, for the cure progress is long and painful.

Waste Management
In 2012 the global population passed 7 billion. It is estimated that it will reach 8 billion in 2026 and 9 billion around 2040. The increasing population of the world brings with it a number of challenges, not the least of which is management of the increasing waste generation.
Europe, and Denmark in particular, have worked on this for many years. One of the major goals of the  European Union is to work towards a circular economy. A circular economy, as the EU defines it, is an economy with zero waste. This, of course, doesn't mean that waste is eliminated, merely that the entirety of our waste is recovered and recycled.
Denmark has been recycling and recovering waste for a long time. For more than a century, Denmark has incinerated waste and for many of those years, it has been one of the major heat and electricity sources. In recent years, great strides have been made towards recycling still greater amounts of waste. In 2015, 35% of our waste was recycled. Exact numbers for recovery are unfortunately unavailable, as the Danish system of incinerating both for energy recovery and to get rid of waste muddies the picture significantly, but the number likely exceeds 50%.
A caption for the above image.
The EU(28) recovers approximately half of their waste, excluding energy recovery. The greater part of the remaining waste is incinerated.

Diabetes
With the rising population, the number of diabetics worldwide is increasing as well. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that in 2015, there were 415 million adults with diabetes. This is estimated to rise to 642 by 2040.
The increase of diabetics

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", there is a possibility of higher standard regulations that will have to be prioritized and addressed before adopting any new technology.
In addition to these findings, Dr. Thomas also challenged us to think beyond the water industry and to come up with other business plans, such as selling our technology directly to the customers. These customers may be farmers that may appreciate our technology to take up phosphate from the rivers for fertilizers or other companies (chemical, agricultural) that treats their own waste water to save money (avoid “penalties” for untreated heavily polluted waste water).
*Interview was conducted by Owen, Adam, and Theodore*
Interviewing Yorkshire Water - Professor Issy Caffoor 07/07/2017
To confirm the information gathered during our interview with Dr. Thomas, we set out to contact several water companies. Dr. Andrew Balmer helped us to reach out to Professor Issy Caffoor, who is an Ex-Innovation Manager with decades of experience in Yorkshire Water. We contacted him via e-mail with questions relating to innovation and adoption of new technology in Yorkshire Water. The key points from our contact can be seen down below.
Three ways Yorkshire Water adopt new innovation/technology for water treatment:
1. Through its R&D activities where equipment may be codeveloped with universities or manufacturers and tested in water company operations before being commercialized by a manufacturer and sold to water companies
2. May be offered by a design and build company as a cost saver or performance enhancer as part of the whole treatment plant offering
3. May be offered within a framework agreement by a supplier if it provides significant benefits over other solutions
Factors that are involved in determining strategic innovation and treatment procedures of water companies:
1. The treatment type is never a mandatory regulatory requirement but the end of pipe limit is often set either by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) for drinking water and Environment Agency (EA) for wastewater
a. If the technology comes into contact with drinking water Drinking Water Inspectorate has to approve the materials used
b. Similarly if it involves contact and release into wastewater Environment Agency needs to approve
2. If it involves GMOs in any way, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) approval is required
3. If it is likely to offend the public (religion, custom and practice etc) then local groups and the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) should be consulted
Lastly, numerous solutions that are involved in phosphate management have been tried. Some involving biology and chemistry but none that involve synthetic biology

Furthermore, iGEM Team TU Darmstadt was working with this tRNA and the OMeY-synthetase. Our Team is using the tRNA in this project to incorporate the canonical amino acid tyrosine with Y-RS in response to an amber stop codon as well as an ONBY with an ONBY-RS in E. coli. Furthermore, DMNBS synthetase variants undergo screening for incorporation efficiency and fidelity, which are done by using this BioBrick. These variants are proven to work with the tRNA and are all listed in the section Parts Collection . Incorporation of ncAA: The tRNA contains an amber anticodon for incorporating the ncAA in response to a recoded amber termination codon. It has been used previously in an amberless E. coli strain C321.∆A.expb as well as in BL21 DE3 gold. When working with a recoded amber codon in BL21 DE3, the tRNA is competing with the release factor1 at the amber stop codon. As amber stop codons add up to only about 7% of total stop codos, amber suppression still works appropriately. An application of the tRNA is either the incorporation of the ncAA into a protein or usage with a reporter plasmid (for example pFRY ) for probing ncAA tRNA/synthetase pair variants regarding efficiency and fidelity. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of ncAA:

To make it easier for everyone to follow the project I'll try to give an update on what has been going on this week.
First of all we have had two meetings, one group meeting and one meeting with the supervisors. Summaries of the meetings can be found in dropbox in the management folder.
We have spent a lot of time on getting an overview of the project, and we have tried to make a phase diagram of what should be done for next two months.
Juliet got the Wiki up and running and is trying to work out how we can do the modeling with fictional data. She is also having a meeting today with Steen to get an overview of the economy. Remember to let her know whenever you spend some money from our account!!
The characterization of biobricks have a really high priority at the moment. So mainly Malthe and me (Maya) are trying to come up with several stragtegies on how to do this and which biobricks we should focus on. We hope that by next week we have a long list with some thought out projects. The idea is to distribute the projects among the lab group so that each person/group of two gets his/her/their own project. The responsible persons should then finish the design and start on the lab work. Some of the mini projects are most likely not going to work, so that's why it's a good idea to have several.
We have also come up with a new naming system for all our parts as this is really needed when you work with the parts in the lab. This list can be seen in the research group folder-> ""our biobrick list"" All the parts found in the list should be registered in our ""sandbox"" in the partsregistry. When we start working on our biobricks, all information should be typed directly into the sandbox. When characterizing a BB Biofab, drew Andy's company have made a data sheet see our wiki

Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," art is aimless, why of all times, men made art and attempted to protect it?
In other words, is it really necessary to save art? Indeed, one may think that science is useful only when it is in the service of health or the environment. But why limit oneself? Combining science and disciplines based on beauty and aesthetics for example is an interesting combination. Art has existed for as long as we did, and has always seemed to be associated with what makes us humans.
However, isn’t a work of art destined to disappear? In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Buddhist conceived mandalas (support for meditation and visualization, symbol of the universe) in the sand (very sensitive material overtime). These disappear with the tide and weather. For Buddhists, a work of art made of sand then destroyed allows the artist to understand and accept the transience of material things and to detach oneself. Even today, ephemeral art is practiced for example in the Landart. This is a trend of contemporary art that uses the framework and materials of nature (wood, earth, stones, sand, water, rock, etc.). Thus, at any time, ephemeral art persists. Does it really make sense to save these frescoes? Moreover, despite all our efforts, the world tends toward entropy (second law of thermodynamics), which means that the universe tends toward disorder and disintegration. Will we actually counteract this law of nature by saving the frescoes in the cave? Or maybe, we could be satisfied with the survival to transmit this work as long as possible to the future generations? Humans have used art to fight oblivion and leave a trace of their passages on earth. Therefore, Art is an important part of our humanity. It is a proof of our intelligence and our necessity of expression. It is through the power and intelligence of men that we can organize the formless and chaos of the real world in a style, an expression. Thus, Nietzsche promotes art as the purest and spiritual entertainment. Although it is not directly useful, art can be engaged, be a witness and memory. Some works also have a decorative goal. They exist for their beauty, even though beauty is subjective. For the artist, art is also used to escape and to express themselves. Generally, art is a means of timeless communication. Thus, the Lascaux cave is a work of art, it deserves to exist, to be maintained and protected. It carries a message and a memory of the Paleolithic man.
Some philosophers of aesthetics, defined art as ""sensitive knowledge"": an autonomous knowledge which is opposed to knowledge through concepts. In this"

Transformation of R0040 (promoter) +pCS26 (vector) into XL Gold cells
From the overnight digest of R0040 with XhoI and BamHI, the promoter was ligated with vector, pCS26.
These plasmids were transformed into XL Gold cells and was plated on Kanamycin plates overnight.
Team meeting:
Lab:discussed about promoter library and the failure to see the expression of luciferase. Also, discussed about the primer design of R0040, so that we can clone the constitutively ON promoter in front of luciferase. This will show us what the luciferase expression will look like.
Modelling: Discussed about Robustness. The three things that we decided to look at for robustness is: 1. PQ expression (the selection of the 'best' sigma 70 promoter) 2. Temperature Alterations (to see if changes in temperature (from 37oC to another temperature would affect expression) 3. Type of media (LB vs. LM)

T.atroviride proof
Highlights:
Confrontational coculture experiment proved T.atroviride biocontrol effects.
Successfully finding the specific promoters related to mycoparasitism.
Designing and Building the Homologous Recombination Kit in T.artovireide.
Biocontrol effects of T.atroviride
Introduction
As described above , T.atroviride is a common biocontrol fungus, usually inhibiting the phytopathogens growth by multiple ways.Therefore,we firstly tested the inhibition function of our strain from two layers.
Experimental Design
Considering the complicated and disturbed environment condition, we planned to keep asepsis during inoculating the fungi on the plants. Howerver, it was not easy for us to do plant tissue culture in MS medium because of the limited time and instruments. Luckily, UESTC-China connected with us after CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Community), they used tobacco cells to do transgenesis operation this year.So we had built deep mutual collaboration,they assisted us in cultivating a set of tobacco seedlings in sterilized culture medium.After the seedlings have root and leaf differentiation,inculating T.atroviride, P.nicotianae and both of these two strains on the root of the seedings.(Here we selected Phytophthora nicotianae as our antagonizing phytopathogen for its great damage in tobacco culturing in a very short time.) Culturing these seedlings for a month, taking photos everyday and observing the differences.
On the other side,we did confrontational coculture experiments[3] to see the inhibition ability of T.atroviride. T.artoviride and P.nicotianae were inoculated on the either side of a PDA medium and then incubated on 25°C for two weeks.Hypha growth condition on this medium can reflect the interaction between these two strains,we also model the growth"

As result, a PoPs input (Inducer) generates a PoPs output at a higher signal. PoPs is equivalent to the flow of RNA polymerase molecules along DNA ( Julien and Calendar, 1996  ; iGEM Team Cambridge, 2007 ).

Purpose of Sensitivity Tuner application
We presumed weak expression rates of our reporter luciferase indicated by pretesting the native system <partinfo>K389015</partinfo>. For having a broader range of quantification for our prototype test system, an amplification device was implemented.  For amplifying the output signal of luciferase induced by acetosyringone, three sensitivity tuners, distinguished by the amplification factor, were combined with our detection system. To modify the sensitivity tuner for our purpose we took BioBricks with amplification factors from 10 (<partinfo>I746380</partinfo>) to 35 (<partinfo>I746390</partinfo>), removed the pBAD/araC promoter (<partinfo>I0500</partinfo>) and GFP read out (<partinfo>E0040</partinfo>) and replaced it by the reporter gene luciferase <partinfo>K389004</partinfo>(Figure 9). This enhanced luciferase BioBrick was assembled to the VirA/G signaling system BioBrick. The benefits of luciferase as reporter gene instead of GFP are a broader range of measurement, higher sensitivity and low half-live making cinetic tests possible ( Williams et al.1989 ).

Receptor modification strategy
The smartest way of receptor-modification is initiated by a silico approach based on a 3D structure of the native receptor. Followed by primer mutagenesis of the computantional gained results a precise adapted peptide emerges. This concept has been proven by Looger et al., 2003 .
Because of time limitations within the iGEM competition and a lack of biological data in literature - no x-ray cristalography structure data for VirA linker region available- this strategy was not applicable.  Therefore we developed two different stragies in our MARSS project:
The first strategy was an error prone PCR approach by building a mutant data base for selection. The second strategy was a primer mutagenesis based approach.

Highlighting the biological significance of dimerization:
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied downstream responses and distinct cellular fates…
Yes, we know which proteins dimerize. We understand how proteins dimerize as well, by interaction of domains like leucine zippers and so forth. But why? What is the point of dimerization?
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. [citation needed] The influence of dimerization in noise propagation is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems. This is exactly what we do.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process.

NJU-China,2017,Team:NJU-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"As (siRNAs), and by the activated RNAi pathway, siRNA can silence the expression of any genes with high efficiency [11].
RNAi silencing is initiated when double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is processed into siRNA between 19-26 base pairs in length by an RNase III enzyme called Dicer. Subsequently, siRNA unwinds, one of the strands is degraded, and the other strand is incorporated into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) and guides the complex to recognize messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences with perfect or nearly perfect complementarity, resulting in cleavage and degradation of the target, thereby interrupting protein synthesis of the target gene.
The RNAi process. dsRNA is processed into siRNA by the endonuclease Dicer. The siRNA is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), followed by cleavage and release of the passenger strand. The guide strand then associates with a homologous mRNA strand by conventional base paring, and the mRNA strand is cleaved by RISC and released for further degradation within the cytoplasm.
RNAi is a promising applicable mechanism that has the potential to spark a revolution in medicine.
In the few years since biotechnologists have adopted RNAi, this technique has already earned a place among the major technology platforms. This powerful RNA-based mechanism by which cells can perform sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing has great potential for therapeutic application in diseased cells. Initial studies were conducted in diseases requiring localized delivery. To date, locally delivered siRNAs have been used in clinical trials for diseases primarily involving the eye, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and glaucoma, and a small number of other diseases involving respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, pachyonychia congenita and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Later, with improvements in nanocarrier technology, systemically delivered siRNA-based therapeutics outnumbered locally delivered siRNA-based therapeutics, leading to a greater number of medical breakthroughs [12].
In the meantime, RNAi is already profitable. Although still in the proving stages as a therapeutic method, RNAi is providing a number of business opportunities. John Berriman, a director at the venture capital firm Abingworth Management Limited (London), estimates that such therapeutics could eventually capture as much as 10% of the drug market. He and others believe that this possibility could translate into billions of dollars in a market that sees revenues of hundreds of millions of dollars"

Collaboration with the Technion iGEM group
Detection of allergens and toxins in food and water has been one of the  most major global challenges in recent years, mainly because its detection must  be done at very low concentrations. In order to tackle this challenge, the  Technion-Israel team is designing a bio-sensor system that can accurately  identify a substance of interest at extremely low concentrations. The system  consists of E.Coli Top 10 bacteria which are able to sense the presence of a  specific substance and process the signal to produce a green light. In order  for the green light to be visible to the naked eye, the system involves a  quorum sensing-based acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signal as well.
The AHL  signal is passed on from one E.Coli to its neighbors in order for them to  follow suit, causing a chain reaction which enables the magnification of the  green light signal.
To  determine whether their E.Coli Top 10 bacteria do produce and secrete AHL, we  offered to characterize their system using the reporter strain chromobacterium violecium 26 (CV026) which we have in our lab. In the presence of AHL, CV026 produce a  characteristic purple dye marker. In a qualitative experiment that we conducted  by seeding their E.Coli Top 10 on soft agar and LB agar plates containing  CV026, we found that their bacteria do produce AHL as a result of purple  colonies that appeared on the agar plates. Such result helped the  Technion-Israel team to insure that their system does secrete the AHL signal.

Then, when they express enough cECFP and nECFP, we lyse the bacteria with ultrasound and mix them up to emit cECFP and nECFP to a same system. At last, we measure the fluorescence with plate reader compared with negative and positive controls. Figure 1 shows that our attempt does succeed and it might be reliable for more complicated conditions.
Figure 1. The sketch map of BBa_K2886013 & BBa_K2886012 and the result of their interaction in E. coli induced under 4 ℃. (a) BBa_K2886013 & BBa_K2886012 can bind with each other through the electrostatic attraction of leucine zipper and emit fluorescence. (b) The background fluorescence of nECFP , cECFP and their average value (average(n,c)). Fluorescence emission of the mixture of nECFP and cECFP shows a 4.19 folds of intensity. And the original ECFP shows a 5.7 folds of intensity compared to original ECFP (BBa_E0020), exceeding the less than 10-fold result reported in literature.
Moreover, to further demonstrate the reliability of our BiFC system, we also do some similar things in Hela cells. The difference is that we add outer-membrane and transmembrane domain to it as well as substitute the leucine zipper with GS linker. We transform the cells with these plasmids and then induce them with the ligand VEGF. When we observe the cells under fluorescence microscope, we also see the fluorescence, which is showed in Figure 2.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," reactions were performed with different dNTP and substrate-dCTP concentrations and the amplified DNA was analyzed on agarose gel. Results shown on Fig. 8 hint that large concentrations of substrate bound nucleotides might inhibit the reaction, as the the amplified DNA band fades as more substrate nucleotides are added. The DNA smear seen in the gel is a characteristic part of the rolling circle amplification. The final concentration of substrate bound dCTP molecules was chosen to be 25 µM in the amplification reaction.
Figure 9. Phi29 amplified DNA dependence on the concentration of nucleotide concentrations. DNA, amplified using multiple displacement amplification was synthesised using 750 - 100µM dNTP concentration with or without 25µM substrate nucleotide concentration. Decreasing the concentration of nucleotides decreases the amount of DNA amplified only when concentrations lower than 200 µM are used. Red dashed line highlight the chosen condition for MDA reaction.
Next, we seeked to determine the lowest native nucleotide concentration for the MDA reaction usable with the corresponding 25 µM concentration of substrate nucleotides. While substrate dCTP concentration was constant, the concentration of dNTPs was gradually lowered. In addition to this, reaction without modified nucleotides was carried too, to determine whether the nucleotide concentration or ratio to substrate-dCTP is the product limiting factor. The results indicate that 200 µM and 100 µM final concentrations are too low to be used with 25 µM sub-dCTP, therefore 300 µM was chosen to be the final working dNTP concentration (Fig. 9).
Figure 10. 50pL droplet MDA reaction emulsion brightfield and fluorescence image.     Circulized DNA templates were encapsulated into 50pL droplets together with MDA reaction reagents. The emulsion was incubated off chip at 30oC for 6 hours. The amplified DNA was stained with SyBr green and imaged using a microscope. Pictures show brightfield and fluorescence at 488 nm of the same spot.
In bulk reaction conditioning allowed us to quickly screen the required concentrations for the workflow, as droplet microfluidics and require separate, time consuming experiment to try out the each setting. After the initial in bulk conditioning followed the experiments in picoliter sized droplets. First of all, the chosen dNTP concentrations were tested in water-oil emulsion environment by encapsulating single circular DNA templates into 50 pL droplets with the same MDA reaction mix.

Blueprint
theophylline sensor passage
The ribozyme fused with an aptamer was put in front of a GFP sequence. When theophylline is added, the cleavage is induced and the expression of protein declines, the whole RNA use a Lac promoter.
YES-gate
The ribozyme which lost its activity for secondary structure was set in front of a GFP, promoted by a continuous promoter, while a short RNA, the key-of-yes, was promoted by a Plac. When lac is added, the short RNA is expressed and activate the ribozyme. The cleavage is induced and the expression of protein declines
NO-gate
The ribozyme is activated while the short RNA, key-of-no is no added. When lac is added, the short RNA combines with the ribozyme and restrains the cleavage, thus the level of GFP is increased.
AND-gate
The ribozyme’s activity must be activated when the short RNA key-of-and-1 and key-of-and-2 is both transcribed, induced by lac and arc.
OR gate
The ribozyme’s activity needed to be activated when the short RNA key-of-or-1 and key-of-or-2 is both transcribed, induced by lac and arc.
Future
The RNA logic gates is expected to replaces some passage ways in our logic gates. In the future, improved programmes will be developed and every lab will be able to create parts that they need. For the arrange of sequence is various, the limit of varieties of logic gates parts will be overcome and more categories of RNA elements will be developed.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," linearize Z0421 as we are currently in the process of inserting its reporter (Z0507) into a yeast shuttle vector.  We will linearize this part along with its promoter and the LexA activator parts (Z0279 and Z0842).
Both BstEII and PstI have concentrations of 10 u/uL. Thus, 1 uL of each should be able to completely cut 10 ug of DNA in 1 hour at 37 degrees.  As before, use 5 uL BSA and 5 uL 10x buffer, which would be H for PstI and either D or Multicore for BstEII.
During linearization, use PstI for pRS304*, BstEII for pRS305, and PstI for pRS306.  BstEII is listed as having best efficiency at 60 degrees Celsius, so we placed it on a heating block at that temperature.  PstI, on the other hand, is most efficient at 37 degrees C.
Both spent roughly 1 hour and 9 min at their respective temperatures.  Placed parts with PstI on heating block at 65 degrees for 25 min. to help inactivate the enzyme.  Note:  due to some misordering of the tubes, it appears that the digest of Z0277, which contains BstEII, was accidentally placed on the heating block for an additional 25 mins, meaning that it received almost a full additional half hour of enzyme activity.  Hopefully this will not affect the outcome too greatly.  Placed all linearized DNA in the freezer in preparation for the yeast transformation.
We also decided to start cultures of parts that we were going to culture last night (pRS306, Z0842, Z0507, and Z0279).  In addition to these parts, we decided to miniprep the 19 remaining parts that were successfully transformed last night.  As such, we made cultures for these parts as well.  Note that all cultures are grown in 16 mL culture tubes with 10 mL of LB except for 8 parts, namely P0450, P0453, P0454, Z0375, Z0378, Z0379, Z0402, and Z0038.  These parts correspond to the binding sites for Zif286-HIV, Gli1, and YY1 (P0450-P0454), the entire repressor proteins minus the MET25 promoter (Z0375-Z0402), and the"

Kinetic model The relationship between residual antigen concentration and                     time
In order to optimize the antigen fixation time, we did the relationship between the remaining                         antigen concentration and time when the antigen was immobilized.
In our step of fixing the antigen concentration, we can get the reaction formula                         \(\mathrm{\alpha}\) and give the                         pattern diagram ω1, where \(A\) is the antigen and \(M\) is the reaction site concentration                         on the                         slide. Since the addition liquid fixation and treatment methods are unchanged, \(M_0\) does not                         change.
$$A+M\overset{K_a}{\underset{K_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}A-M \tag{ α }$$
If \(\theta=\frac{[A-M]}{M_0}\), that is, the position occupied by the immobilized antigen                         accounts for the percentage of all positions of the entire slide. Then by the dynamics                         relationship, we can list the relationship:
$$-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=K_a(1-\theta)[M_0][A]-K_d\theta[M_0]$$
If we determine a \(\theta\), that is, we want the percentage of the fixed position on the slide,                         generally the maximum concentration under the premise of disturbing the liquid crystal. It is                         given by our experimental data that \(\"

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Before completing the system to produce cytokinin in E. coli, we determined the retention times of the authentic samples of iP and tZ by using UPLC. In addition, we confirmed that iP and tZ were able to be detected from the mixture of the E. coli culture medium and the cytokinin solution (Fig. 2-3-15).

5. Hybrid promoter for temporal pattern generation
In order to achieve the natural plants' temporal pattern for producing plant hormones in E. coli, we introduced an incoherent feed forward loop (Mangan et al., 2006) to our circuit, including a new hybrid promoter part ( BBa_K1139150 ).  Plants produce their hormones transiently rather than steadily (Takei et al., 2001).  Moreover, continuous overexpression of hormones is harmful to plants (Thiman, 1937).  Thus, we thought that it should be important to achieve this transient temporal pattern for producing plant hormones in E. coli, too.  Our designed system with an incoherent feed forward loop is shown in Fig. 2-3-16.  We newly developed the RM/lac hybrid promoter, which is activated by CI and repressed by LacI (Fig. 2-3-17).  We planned to ligate a hormone synthase part downstream of this hybrid promoter.  Our mathematical model (Fig. 2-3-18) shows the pulse wave which the temporal pattern for plant hormone production should achieve.  While the RM/lac hybrid promoter activation by CI is a single-step reaction, the repression by LacI is a two-step reaction.  Thus, the activation of the RM/lac hybrid promoter is faster than the repression.  This time lag between the activation and the repression is important for generating a temporal pattern of plant hormone production (details about our mathematical model can be found here ).

Metabolic networks
One of the aim of our project is to create a biological system capable of producing two naturally occurring molecules: butyric acid and formic acid.
Before starting modelling, it can be helpful to get a panoramic view of both all known metabolic pathways and those specific of E. coli. The following metabolic network represents all known metabolites and metabolic pathways for E. coli K12 MG1655 (best known model) as of today.  It was obtained from the KEGG database . Our first step was to identify the pathways from which our molecules will be derived, in order to have a clear understanding of their potential role and effects when produced or overproduced.
Figure 1: Kegg Metabolic pathways - E. coli K-12 MG1655
Formate network
Formate is naturally produced by E. coli but at low levels. Our project requires that Apicoli produces quite high yields of formate.  Hence in order to optimize formate biosynthesis we studied the genes coding for the enzymes involved in the pathway. We decided to focus our efforts on the Pyruvate Formate Lyase (PFL), the enzyme that causes degradation of pyruvate, thus yielding formate.
The  enzyme Pyruvate Formate Lyase catalyzes the transfer of coenzyme-A on pyruvate, leading to the conversion into formate and acetyl-CoA.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Law&Patents_-_-_TEXT.html,"ing and using a certain technology is inherently wrong regardless of the results of doing so’. The others are “extrinsic objections” involving claims that this technology (or action) is not inherently wrong but can be wrong if it causes or contributes to morally unacceptable situations or outcomes [3].
The K.U.Leuven 2011 iGEM team remarked that they learned a lot about extrinsic objections like environmental impact, agriculture; while the people have a lot of intrinsic objections. What is the scope of governance here? What are the consequences, Benefits, Risks? And, how is the European Commission handling this?
The intrinsic objections have been also addressed during the GMO debates. One of the mistakes that was made during the GMO debate was to totally focus on risks. The evaluation made by the people is based on a broader set of issues than just risks alone. The lesson that was learned was that it is a bad idea to inform people what the risks are and use their reaction to decide which direction is more favorable to pursue. The value judgment of the citizens plays an important role and they have intrinsic objections either from a religious, spiritual or from a philosophical perspective. There were many societal groups that have a problem with biotechnology, because they thought that it was meddling with nature or they were playing God and some even thought it was wrong to interfere with life at such a fundamental level.
Obviously the same type of objections could arise with synthetic biology, as at the moment so little is known about synthetic biology, there is no real active debate on either the extrinsic or intrinsic objections on this matter. However it is particularly difficult for the EC to deal with such matters because Ethics as such is really an area of concern that is not so much within the mandate of EC to address. Ethics fall under the commission mandate as subsidiary, which means that the member states themselves should make their own regulations on these topics.
In a certain sense the EC doesn’t touch this area of intrinsic objections, at least not in a formal way. These kinds of objections were also central in the agricultural and GMO debate. There is also a big objection from people towards the development of an organic form of agriculture and who perceive   GMOs as a big threat to their livelihood.
In the end it turns out to be a political debate as it is tied to deeper fundamental values and viewpoints like:, “What is the good life?”. It is not up to EC or to the member states to decide this. In any Western Society, there is a general recognition that it’s up to each individual to decide “What his or her own good life is?” It’s even very hard for a country"

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," most of the DTU Biobuilders team went to Lund in Sweden, where the team from Lund University had invited us to the annual Nordic iGEM conference (NiC) together with all the other Nordic teams. The weekend was filled with iGEM related events, such as workshops on how to effectively communicate and work in a team, and a workshop about the possibilities of bioinformatics. However, most of the weekend was spent connecting with the other iGEM teams and hearing about their projects in a mini-jamboree, where we all participated in poster and presentation sessions.

It was great to get to share the research with people more directly involved in the field, and fantastic to experience the enthusiasm they conveyed in the discussions!
Corpus Pocus
September 2, 2017
Corpus Linguistics...Just like magic
For advancements in science to have an impact, it is important that they are communicated in a way that the largest possible audience can access and engage with. That is where the thought of using corpora to investigate science communication stemmed from- corpus linguistics is an efficient method of investigating large bodies of text to draw summaries.
I like to think corpus linguistics can be related to a kind of magic– enter your search, and quick as the wave of a wand, the corresponding words are pulled out of the corpus. See some screenshots below from the BYU corpora collection, created by Mark Davies (https://corpus.byu.edu/) for a look behind the magic curtain. Corpora from this collection were used in the research which will be discussed!
For the corpus research, I determined four key terms to search: synthetic biology, genetic engineering, GMO and biosensor. I then started the corpus research with some questions in mind. Firstly, how much is synthetic biology actually talked about in publicly accessible publications? Secondly, how is language used in discussing these subjects, and how does the language use reflect attitudes towards the subjects?
Frequency is your friend
COCA– the Corpus of Contemporary American English- is a large corpus of English and American English, comprising of texts from a number of genres. It contains more than 520 million words of text, from 1990-2015.
The corpus is really useful for organising results based on frequency– the number of times your search occurs in the corpus, per million words. COCA has been used to compare how much synthetic biology features across different years. On the graph below, the frequency of genetic engineering and genetic modification in the corpus are also shown. This provides a reference so the significance of the frequency of synthetic biology across the years is clearer.
Collocates are close neighbours
Another thing which a corpus can show you is the top collocates of your search term. Collocates are words which frequently occur around each other. The News on the Web (NOW) corpus features texts from web based newspapers and magazines, and this corpus was used to identify collocates. By looking at the adjectives which collocate with each of the search terms, insight was gained into how these terms are frequently discussed in the media.
So after discovering the collocates of each search term (the top 20 for"

MAB
Until now, mab is composed of mouse's antigen injection, splenocyte seperation, fusion between splenocyte and myeloma cell, and antibody making cell selection.
Myeloma cell, which is myelogenous leukemia, doesn't have antibody produce ability, because it is immobilized, when it fuses B-cell in splenocyte, it can take a culture and make strain to produce antibody.
But, because of cancer cell's unique lability, if it take a long period culture, it can be cloning again.
Most of all, fusion of after fusion selection spends lots of cost and time.
Because B-cell activation needs T-cell, it is hard to take mouse's antigen injection process in vitro.
So to save time, elemination of fusion is needed.
To use transfomation protocol, if cell growth division gene insert it, it is possible.
Leech anticoagulent
Long since leech was used to pluck out the blood from people because they though blood reducing relieve the hypertension.
Even now, it is used to relieve swelling of injury.
Leech also have a effect which continues bleeding because it secrets anti-coagulent enzyem.
In mechanical heart valve implementation or thrombosis, to prevent blood clot of vessel people use anti coagulent.
But this obstructs body defense mechanism. If we use leech's anti-coagulent enzyme, we can make medicine.
Hemostasis
Undesirable clotting is one of disorder of hemostasis.
Thrombus is a clot that develops and persists in an unbroken blood vessel.
Embolus is kind of thrombus that breaks away from the vessel wall and floats freely in the bloodstream.
These can obstruct tiny blood vessel like arteriol or venule.
How about making a bacteria which eliminate them?
Bacteria Electricity
Magnetotactic bacteria has a magnet in its body. This bacteria has a magnetosome which makes magnet.
If magnetosome has a regular period and it can make or destroy own magnet, to use change of magnetic field, it can make electricity power.
Actually, this bacteria makes voltage like half of AA battery during 48 hours.
To use this, we can also make electricity.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," health system alone has been estimated at US $21 to $34 billion dollars, accompanied by more than 8 million additional days in hospital. Because antibiotic resistant bacteria has effects far beyond the health sector, it was projected, nearly 10 years ago, to cause a fall in real gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.4% to 1.6%, which translates into many billions of today’s dollars globally.
KOREA
In Korea, Korean CDC collected antibiotic-resistance infection  cases from hospitals, which shows that 41,883 patients (about 7% of the total hospitalized patients) were infected by antibiotic-resistant bacteria during the first half-year of 2014 (from January 1 to June 30, 2014).
(Source: Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.go.kr/search/sEngine.jsp?kwd=MRSA%EA%B0 %90%EC%97%BC)
KARMS released annual report in 2014 containing antibiotic resistance infection data gathered from hospitals as well as long term care facilities and small & medium sized clinics.  Publishing such data is a clear evidence that the Korean government is keenly aware of the hazards of the antibiotic resistant bacteria and also shows its commitment to deal with the matter systematically. The government adopted a law on the Prevention and Containment of Infectious Diseases in Dec. 2010.
In accordance with the executive order of the law, antibiotic resistance infections including VRSA, VRE, MRSA, MRPA, MRAB, CRE were designated as “infections to be contained”. The annual reports deals with S. aureus, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, E. coli , K. pneumoniae , E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa , A. baumannii Following are the results:  (Data from General Hospital (more than 300 beds))

Collaborators
Over the past six months we have collaborated with a lot of people. On this page you will find a list of the people who have helped us and whom we have helped.
The Bielefeldt team - visited us from September 24th to 26th, where we presented our projects to each other. We have sent our ninaB coding sequence (retinal generator) to the Bielefeld team and they have sent us their Lac promoter to be characterized .
The DTU-Denmark team - We visited the DTU team on October 9th where we presented our projects and commented on the power point presentations so that they can be fine-tuned for the jamboree.
The Warsaw team we helped the Warsaw team filling in the inquiry form concerning generale iGEM team questions.
Unisensor A/S - We have been working together with Unisensor A/S for characterizing our photosensor part. At unisensor they are developing a machine that is able to track many microscopic particles in a liquid, which means it is well suited for motility analysis on bacteria. The Thor prototype is able to follow a large amount of microbes at the same time, which makes the results more statistically viable than traditional cell tracking tools. For data analysis we use the unify software, which analyses the videos from the thor prototype and outputs data like: speed, force, path and tumbling frequency of the bacteria. In return we give them feedback in regards to usability and application of their machines and software.

We gave a presentation on one of these “eco-cruises”, introducing our project and synthetic biosensing as platforms for preserving the lake’s water quality. By presenting our project in the context of how it could benefit the local environment, we hoped to connect with the local community and get a sense of the potential impacts of a project such as our own. In the process, we met an incredibly active advocate against hydrofracking in New York; this is discussed more in the Human Practices section.
Sciencenter
The Ithaca Sciencenter cultivates a culture of learning and discovery by providing opportunities for children, students, and adults to explore the vast domain of scientific inquiry. They also incorporate presentations about various scientific endeavors in Ithaca by allowing guest presenters to come in each weekend to foster hands-on learning activities.
We arranged a series of three presentations with the Sciencenter, which has progressed from an introduction to genetics to an introduction to synthetic biology, and will culminate in mid-October with a look into the applications of synthetic biology. The Sciencenter has allowed us to rouse enthusiasm for science among our younger audiences, and simultaneously spark discourse about synthetic biology among adults.
Video Collaboration
This year, Cornell iGEM led a collaboration project with AlumniGEM and the iGEM teams from SDU, UNAM Genomics Mexico, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, Northwestern University, and others. We sought to bring to light some of the ethical, social, and environmental implications of large-scale genetic engineering projects in modern society by creating a series of videos accessible to the general public. This video series is not a solely educational enterprise, nor are we trying to persuade our viewers to hold a particular view of genetic engineering. Our hope is to start a conversation between students, teachers, parents, other members of the public with valid concerns about genetic modification, and ourselves, young scientists trying to make a difference using scientific tools.
We aim to continue the dialogue about new technologies and advancements in the field of synthetic biology by expanding collaboration efforts such as our own, to reach broader audiences and further the spirit of transparent discussion of human practices issues. Our videos can be found on our Youtube channel , and please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns.
