BIT,2013,Team:BIT-China#project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology. In this engine, two complementary systems (figure 2) were designed. The first one is the customized thermo-tolerance system used to improve E.coli’s heat resistant ability and the other is the intelligent quorum regulating system used for controlling the cell density in an appropriate degree. Moreover, the engine begin to work only when it is properly to do so, ensuring the productive efficiency.
The chassis host with I’MHeRE used in the industry may make the fermentation process less depend on the cooling system and decrease the pollutant emission. On the other hand, cells can live as comfortable as in their optimum temperature, because we extend the because we extend the range of their optimum living temperature and make them live in the optimizing density. Owing to this, the high activity of the enzymes in cell could be kept in a wide range of temperature and the efficiency of microbial metabolism can be improved.
Customize thermotolerance system
Different strength promoters control different expression level of different heat shock proteins (HSPs) at different temperature to achieve the goal of Hierarchy Heat-resistant.
Figure 3: Hierarchy Heat-resistant.
Figure 4:Overexpression of HSP will saddle the cell growth
We found that overexpressing a protein may affect the growth of the host to a certain degree. With the help of RNA thermometers, they can not only be expressed in a hierarchy way, but decrease the burden of overexpressing HSPs at low temperature. That is the answer why we use RNA thermometers.
Bacteria use complex strategies to control gene expression in response to ambient temperature changing. Many genes encoding heat shock proteins and virulence factors are regulated by temperature sensing RNA sequences, known as RNA thermometers (RNATs), which are located in the 5’untranslated region of the mRNA folding into secondary structure that shed RBS to influence translational efficiency in low temperature. But when temperature is increased to a certain temperature, the RNATS release RBS and the blocked genes express.
Most of gene expression responding to temperature shock measure not the temperature itself but the consequences of temperature-induced damage. Those reaction are effected by temperature indirectly. However, RNA thermometers response to temperature immediately, precisely, and controllably. So using RNA thermometers to control our heat shock proteins expression is a good choice. The RNA thermometers can be available included two types, the natural RNATS and the synthetic RNATS.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"-synthetase to be used as an orthogonal synthetase in E. coli. Each of them can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA BBa_K2020042 to incorporate DMNBS in response to an amber stop codon.
Incorporation of ncAA: Photo-cleavable non-canonical amino acids offer the opportunity to control protein function on a non-invasive basis. Working with non-canonical amino acids requires an additional, orthogonal pair of a tRNA and a cognate synthetase i.e. which does not crossreact with the endogenous tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA's anticodon is mutated to an amber stop anticodon. Hence, it is possible to incorporate an amino acid at a chosen position in a protein via amber codon suppression. Based on computational modeling a tRNA synthetase for DMNBS in E. coli was designed by creating a semi rational mutant library. Assembly in a plasmid for incorporation of ncAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid. Host organism: This reporter plasmid and the measurement of its corresponding proteins expressed are previously used both in an amberless E. coli strain and BL21 DE3 gold. The latter results in competition of the suppressor tRNA with RF1 at the amber stop codon. Screening Results:
Figure 5: DMNBS graph efficiency
If the levels of optical density of the tRNA synthetase to be evaluated and a working synthetase are equal, a first approximation of efficiency and fidelity can be made by normalizing GFP levels. Thus, one can eliminate the biogenic background fluorescence levels and compare the variants with each other. All details about these parts can be seen on their Registry pages as listed below:

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Our project raises issues of researcher safety with regard to exposure to biohazardous material (ethidium bromide, acrylamide) and ultraviolet radiation.  It also raises environmental safety issues with the disposal of recombinant bacteria and biohazardous material. The parts and devices we made pose no hazards.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
The Biology Departments at Missouri Western and Davidson College have policies concerning general laboratory safety, treatment and disposal of biohazardous materials, protection of laboratory personnel, and safety training of student laboratory researchers. We followed all local guidelines and regulations.
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The Departments at each of our institutions are satisfied that the iGEM project was conducted in accordance with the established policies regarding laboratory safety.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our BioBrick parts raises safety issues beyond those associated with reagents used to manipulate DNA and working with a laboratory strain of E. coli.

Protocols
Competent cell preparation
Throughout the project, the E. coli cells in use needs to be genetically modified, specifically by the insertion of artificial plasmids. This transformation procedure required cells that were capable of taking up plasmids and these were prepared thus .
Transformation of competent cells
Insertion of plasmids into the competent cells we made was done in this way .
Modular cloning strategy
The individual subparts (and in the case of the operon, CDS segments) had to be brought together to create the composite parts. These individual components were all brought together in one reaction in one container. This was done using the MoClo protocol .
SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE and Western Blot analysis was used to characterise protein expression. For SDS-PAGE we used a ThermoFisher NuPAGE Bolt system, the principles of which are described on the following link . The ladder was SeeBlue Plus2 Pre-stained protein standard (ThermoFisher) and gels were stained with Simply Blue Safe Stain (Coomassie blue, ThermoFisher). For Western-Blot analysis we used a PiercePower Blotter (ThermoFisher) for semi-dry blotting onto PVDF-membranes. These were probed using either an Anti-His or Anti-GFP primary antibody raised in Mouse and anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody raised in goat with a ThermoFisher iBind system. Membranes were then visualised using SigmaFast BCIP/NBT (Sigma).
Biofilm formation on tori
We developed over the summer a protocol for formation of biofilms on the polymer surfaces of polypropylene scaffold structures. This was done using the information given by Mike Allen at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory. The scaffold structures were used in the Metal Binding Reactor.

4. Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project, and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
For our project we came up with two reporter ideas for our diagnostics device. The first plan was to use Hemerythrin. Hemerythrin when bound to iron, in the presence of oxygen, undergoes a conformational change. That change results in a colour change from colourless to pink. Our team tried Hemerythrins from three different species. Mc Hemerythrin

Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
The second reporter idea was attaching a ryhB binding sequence to GFP. In the absence of iron, ryhB siRNA binds to ryhB binding site and marks GFP mRNA for degradation. In the presence of iron, the Fur regulator represses ryhB, and GFP is fully translated. We used two different promoters from the Registry [

Meeting with Dr Rob Wilson - Chair of Athena Swan Working Group at University of Exeter
On 27/09/16 we spoke to Dr Rob Wilson, a senior lecturer in Conservation Biology and current chair of Athena Swan working group at the University of Exeter, so we could see some statistics and figures behind the accounts we had heard. We also wanted to hear his opinion on the state of gender inequality in science and what he thinks needs to be done in the future, for there to be a significant improvement.
One of the areas Dr Sharon Dixon focused strongly on in our meeting with her, was how much the University had changed in 7 years. The Equality and Diversity department was once a department that dealt with people who required extra time during exams, yet now is concerned with issues of equality, diversity and inclusivity, trying to ensure the environment at the University is as welcoming to all students and staff as possible. Dr Wilson also commented saying that despite the fact that in permanent staff
twenty-five percent are female
this is a
considerable improvement from where the situation was about five or six years ago
however both ourselves and Dr Wilson agreed that there is much to be improved upon.
If you’re female in Biosciences here, you’re three times more likely to be part time than if you’re a male member of staff in the department
Dr Wilson provided us with some statistics that we weren’t aware of. The fact that considerably more women are working part time at the university than males is shocking when you consider that other than maternity leave, there is no obvious stand out reason for this. Dr Wilson questioned why there is a clear distinction between the number of females and number of male staff working in permanent positions at the University, suggesting that maternity could have a large role in that. However, we have to consider what Dr Eduarda Santos said about the fact that
maternity is an easy excuse
to explain these figures. Dr Wilson gave another account of an excellent female MSc student who was affected by a lack of confidence, echoing the accounts heard from Dr Ceri Lewis. The student said to him:
So whilst I’m doing my MSc I’m deciding whether I should do a PhD or whether I should have children because people have told me that you can’t do a PhD and have children.
The fact that this student was questioning whether to pursue a career in science further, or have a family is shocking and further emphasises what was said in the meeting with Dr Eduarda Santos. Furthermore, if role models and mentors around her were saying that it is impossible to do"

Overlap PCR
Purpose: fuse two or more fragments of DNA using PCR (less efficient)
PCR amplify the fragments
Design PCR primers with 20 base pairs of homology
Run product on a gel to confirm that you have the correct products
Clean up the product
Use the PCR products as template in a PCR reaction where the overlap regions will anneal on their own
Do not use any primers in this step
Run 15 cycles
PCR amplify the fused fragments with the end primers that encapsulate both fragments
 
Colony PCR
Purpose: Determine if cells took up construct after transformation
Take “x” number of colonies from a plate of bacteria and suspend them separately in 100 µL of dH2O
Design primers that amplify a region contained in the target construct (surrounding homology region ideally)
Regions of 200 – 500 bp are ideal
Create a mastermix of forward primers, reverse primers, APEX mastermix, and dH2O (look at table 3 below)
The mastermix should be made for “x” number of reactions without the colony suspension added
Add 1 µL of the colony suspension to 24 µL of the mastermix in a PCR tube and run the samples in a thermocycler
Run the PCR products on a gel to determine if you have the correct construct

Public Activities Collaboration
According to the result of public survey, we found that the understanding of synthetic biology and genetic-modified related works is clearly insufficient for general public. For Team HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS, Worldshaper-Wuhan, Zhejiang University (ZJU-China), Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT-China) and as well as Jiangnan University (Jiangnan), they were also aware of this problem. So we cooperate with each other to hold public science activities for the same purpose.
In Hangzhou low carbon science and technology museum China, our team, together with HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS, Worldshaper-Wuhan, held one united public event to publicize our project and related knowledge of synthetic biology and genetic engineering. We have conducted in-depth cooperation from various aspects. For example, we discussed the activity plan, prepared the materials we needed. When we were understaffed, Worldshaper-XSHS and HFLS_ZhejiangUnited helped us to undertake the DNA extraction experiment and maintain the order, respectively. The event achieved a good response.
We also had lots of fun working together towards a shared goal. On the day of practicing in Hangzhou low carbon science and technology museum, we gathered together earlier than the opening time. After briefly talked about each team’s responsibility in the activity, we started preparing our own tasks. Our team’s job was mainly focused on setting up different stations demonstrating science experiments about our topic and generally Genetics. While the other two teams had their own stations and were responsible for a reward station to encourage kids to finish the activities in every station, we held by giving out gifts for accomplishment, as well as,  maintaining the order in stations. As the main demonstrator of the experiment of gene extraction of bananas, we lectured kids about genetics and the lab procedure. In the end, almost everyone, no matter what team they were in, worked together to help out with each and every level of the experiment.
In Zhejiang science and technology museum, we held a bigger event, called 2018 Shengxi Science Day, on Aug. 19th. In this event, we not only cooperated with two other high school team (HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS), but also cooperated with three university team including Zhejiang University (ZJU-China), Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT-China) and Jiangnan University (Jiangnan).

[1] The pBAD promoter is available from the registry as BBa_I13453 , but team British Columbia 2009 derived two new promoters from this part, responding either more or less strongly to the presence of arabinose (Stronger response: BBa_K206000 , weaker response: BBa_K206001 ). These pBAD derived promoters were selected because of their different arabinose sensitivity. This difference can facilitate finetuning the expression levels of proteins while using a single inducer, which can be further tweaked by combining the promoters with different RBSes.
hybB
The promoter of the hydrogenase II operon. It's also known as the coldshock promoter, because it's inactive at 37°C and activates at temperatures below 30°C. Using this promoter would allow us to only have our cells express CryoBricks when E. coli actually benefits from this, but makes inducing expression in a dose-dependent manner impossible, as it's not induced by a molecule we add. It enables CryoBrick expression to be directed on 'autopilot', which has pros (for example, in large-scale industrial applications) and cons (in case CryoBricks comprising such a promoter cross over to an uncontrolled environment, be it by accident or design). The registry submission of this brick, BBa_J45503 , never made it past the planning stage, but the brick is incorporated in several composite parts.
Final selection
All selected promoters fulfilled the availability criterion, being submitted to the registry, but hybB was only available as part of an assembled construct. The construct was ordered and preparations were made to PCR it out of this construct, but constraints on time and safety considerations caused us to decide against using it in the end.
The project was supposed to include a characterisation experiment to quantify the remaining promoters' strengths at low temperatures. Unfortunately, technical difficulties with cloning, and subsequent assembly of the reporter constructs required for this, made such characterisation infeasible. Even though we couldn't confirm pLacI and pBAD's activity at low temperatures, it was decided to construct our CryoBricks with both promoters. Of the available pBAD promoters, we selected the one that responded most strongly to arabinose ( BBa_K206000 ). It allows for the highest the maximum expression level, and any of the expression levels attainable with the related promoters can be achieved as well, given a finely tuned concentration of arabinose.

Similar to our promoter selection criteria, the ideal"

The beginning of our project
During a regular seminar of virology, we discussed about different possibilities to engage into scientific research as soon as possible. Annabel and Nicole came up with the idea to participate in the iGEM competition. We were motivated by the outlook to conduct our own research project with all tasks and responsibilities but with close supervision by experienced researchers. Mostly we were eager to gain experience working in the lab.
After collecting more information about the competition online and from other participants, we decided to bring iGEM to Wuerzburg and founded the first team of our university. Together with two additional bachelor students we motivated Prof. Jochen Bodem to become our PI. He also provided us with lab space to get started with the lab work. By advertising our project among friends, we soon got more and more students, until we were a huge group of 50 participants.
After various brainstorming sessions we decided to start exploring new methods in the detection of infectious diseases.  This led us to our project, designing a rapid diagnostic test to distinguish different types of Plasmodium, the pathogen which causes Malaria.
Organizing the team in different subgroups meant that every student could contribute to the topic they liked the most. Unfortunately, many students did not spend as much time and passion on our project as necessary, so our team shrank to the final number of eleven student members and three advisors. Our final team consists of an interdisciplinary synergy of bachelor students from biology, biomedicine, medicine and mathematics.
The Beginning of our project
German Meetup in Marburg
As a newly established team we were excited to get in contact with the other teams at the German meetup in Marburg. Especially, we exchanged some ideas about the different projects and talked about problems we had to face in the wet lab. This exchange of experience resulted in a huge benefit for our project in the following weeks.
We were introduced to team Marburg’s project for the first time. Later we established a collaboration with team Marburg by participating in their Vibrio natriegens InterLab Study. Moreover, we learned much more about the iGEM competition itself and got contacts to students more familiar to the"

Aim of the experiment:
Detection of expressed proteins CaDXMT1, eGFP.
Operational sequence:
The western blot membran (having been blocked over the night at 4°C) was washed with PBS- T0.1 four times (4x 15min).  Because of the use of un- prestained protein marker (see Thursday, 6.9.), we stained the western blot membran with Ponceau's reagent and assigned the bands, followed by washing the membran with PBS- T0.1 again (15 minutes, 2x). Afterwards, the membran was incubated for 1h with detection reagent. Detection reagent:

As part of their project, the William and Mary (W&M) iGEM Team were imaging cells expressing a variety of fluorescent proteins, including RFP, CFP, GFP, and YFP. Their constructs are being used for the Interlab Measurement study. As part of the measurement track the W&M team assembled fluorescent constructs, and measured and reported their fluorescence. The samples were sent to us to confirm the correct assembly of the parts by validating their fluorescence. Their interest in seeing how their constructs performed (in terms of fluorescent output) perfectly matched our own need to test OpenScope on cell samples rather than fluorescent beads. In addition, optical components were obtained to extend our imaging capabilities to both GFP and RFP. In particular, RFP imaging has not been tested previously.
The W&M team were kind enough to send us dried DNA samples containing constructs for GFP and RFP expression in E. coli. Details on the protocols used to resuspend the DNA and to transform the cells can be found below.
Transformation Protocol
Context
Using E. Coli K12 Dh5 alpha cells
Dry plasmid for two different GFP constructs in duplicate (so 4 samples total) sent on filter paper
All constructs on Amp resistance backbones pSB1C3
Constructs are J23106 + I13504 on pSB1C3, and J23117 + I13504 on pSB1C3
Constructs generated through DNA synthesizing the insert (J231XX + I13504) and using Gibson Assembly to insert it into the Amp backbone
Objective:
Transform cells with the constructs provided
Image the cells for RFP and GFP fluorescence using OpenScope to confirm functionality of the inserts, and the microscope itself
DNA Extraction:
Adapted from: Extraction protocol
Cut center of circles out of the filter paper
Added 50 µl of EB buffer"

Free redistribution
Meaning, you cannot restrict any person or party from selling or giving away the software as a component of a larger aggregate software distribution.
In the context of synthetic biology, this means that if you make a new system or genetic circuit, you cannot prohibit other researchers from using this system in their projects.
The ability to derive works without penalty
Meaning, a person or party must be allowed to modify and derive new software from the original software
In the context of synthetic biology, this would mean that if you develop a genetic circuit, other researchers would be able to modify and rederive new circuits or applications from your work.
There are other, less significant criteria that go into making something open source and could drag this blog post out forever (and we’re trying to get to the cat videos when we’re done), but the big take away point is that, for an invention to be open source, the components that went into making the invention should be released to the public, be modifiable by the public, and the invention itself must be free for other people to incorporate into their own projects. Again, open source need not refer to just software, although today the most prominent open source movement is in the realm of software. This same idea applies to open source hardware, dubbed Open Hardware, and synthetic biology is also beginning to adopt this idea in the form of a synthetic biology commons. In a synthetic biology commons, patented genes and genetic parts (a.k.a. “source code”) are licensed such that they can be used exclusively in the public domain, and are usable and modifiable by the greater scientific community.
One great example of a synthetic biology commons can be found in the BioBrick Foundation, which aims to create a standardized registry of well documented biological parts. This is the equivalent of having a registry of software tools and their source code, free for other developers to use. In the software world developers aimed to have a open source commons where all new code is shared, modified and redistributed; in the biology world some researchers are aiming to have a commons where all new genetic parts or systems are shared, and these creations can be used by other researchers worldwide to facilitate new research and innovation.  However, we still have a long way to go.

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," Cholera Present
Positive Test
True Positive
False Positive
Negative Test
False Negative
True Negative
Once the data collection is completed, there are two formulas to calculate sensitivity and specitivity.
Sensitivity= true positives/(true positives + false negatives) x 100 [1]
Specificity=true negatives/(true negatives + false positives) x 100 [1]
The purpose of our biosensor is to detect Cholera at the source to prevent contraction. Therefore, we are more invested in a high sensitivity rather than specificity. With a higher sensitivity, it is more likely to have false positives, but it is safer to have false positives and take precaution than to have false negatives and contract the disease.
Color Q
Color Q is a free mobile application developed in Java for the Google Play Store. The app was developed in the Android Studio v3.2.1 integrated development environment. It works alongside the Chrome Q hardware also developed by Lambert iGEM in order to effectively quantify the result of a biological reporter, similar to the function of a plate reader. The app is able to use circle detection in order to find the samples on the base of the Chrome Q hardware and then detect the red, green, and blue values (RGB) of the center of each circle. The way the circles are arranged allow for a range of values to be generated. The first row contains 4 circles. The average RGB values of the first two circles are calculated as the negative control and the average RGB values of the second pair of circles are calculated as the positive control. The distance between the positive and negative control is calculated in the 3D-coordinate plane using the following formula:
The Hough Circle Transform is used as the method of circle detection found in the app. Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) is a library that can be imported into Android Studio in order to perform image analysis-based methods. The image taken by the smartphone camera is converted into a grayscale photo. This essentially makes the image more readable in terms of edge detection and ""round"" estimation. There are several parameters that can be modified and calibrated in order to detect an accurate amount of circles:
Maximum Radius: The smallest value for the radius of a detected circle
Minimum Radius: The largest value for the radius of a detected circle
Minimum Distance: The smallest distance between the centers of any two detected circles
Edge Gradient Value: The roundness of each detected circle
Threshold Value: The amount of memory the system has to store the detected circles
The 6 by 6 grid located underneath the first row can be loaded with experimental samples and a percentage value can be determined"

Future Work
Future work mostly revolves around bringing darwin from a standalone diff-producing executable to an integrated system with a GUI usable by novices. The major challenge with that is parsing the plethora of different file types used to represent DNA although the implementation of other formats such as SBOL, ApE, etc., could be done easily by extracting the actual genetic sequence from the file.
In addition, the current algorithms are unable to deal with introns of any sort in the input DNA sequence, and will attempt to split the file into ORFs regardless. The ability to correctly identify non-coding regions like this would create a far more valuable piece of software, able to deal with prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike.

Improving on MARS
The 2017 Boston University iGEM Hardware team, MARS, created a repository of chip designs called the MARS Repository. The MARS Repository contains design information and files of the nine different synthetic biology protocol chips MARS had designed. The data contained in the MARS Repository is open to the public and allows synthetic biologists to utilize microfluidics without designing a custom microfluidic chip.
A main goal of our project is to increase the accessibility of microfluidics, so we have decided to uploaded the documentation and design files of the microfluidic chips we have designed to the MARS repository. We have created the following chips and introduced them to the MARS Repository:

The TERRA Adapter is a scalable, predesigned chip that is capable of selectively dispensing the output of the microfluidic chip running the experiment into the intended lab vessel. The TERRA Adapter serves to increase the number of and types of microfluidic chips that are compatible with our system. This makes the system more user-friendly, as they don’t have to design a chip that both completes a biological experiment and is capable of selecting the proper output to be dispensed.

Grade 11
Hello! I am a grade 11, 16 year old student at Winston Churchill High School, Lethbridge. I joined iGEM because of my interest in synthetic biology and the idea of creating a biological system to a solve a problem. After high school I plan to go to university and work on a degree toward biochem. In my spare time, I love volunteering for a good cause, because I believe I have the ability to. I also enjoy going on long walks around the lake and interacting with people.

Grade 11
Heylo, it’s Alice here and I am sixteen years young, attending grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. This is my very first year of iGEM and it’s been a BLAST so far. I joined because I thought it would be interesting to get some experience in the lab and in coding. And so far, I like what I’ve been doing. My future after iGEM is undecided but I’d really love to take a year off before post-secondary to travel around Russia. In my normal life, I enjoy drinking chocolate milk, being edgy with my mains and reading. Toodles, bye.

Grade 11
Hello! My name is Michelle and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School this year. I joined iGEM because I really enjoyed biology and wanted the opportunity to experience synthetic biology as well. So far it has been amazing! Though it took me a solid 6 months to understand a majority of synthetic biology, it has been an amazing learning experience. I like to spend time in the wet lab and work on human practices mainly, though modeling interests me as well. I look forward to a future that hopefully involves more iGEM! Outside of iGEM I spend time playing badminton, eating watermelon, and procrastinating (working hard on fixing that, iGEM is proving that this is NOT effective). In addition to that, I like to run (as I have to have an abundance of energy in the worst times), and spend time with family and friends.

Prof. Juliana Chan
Prof. Albert Yu
Overview
Professor Albert Yu is the chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization (HKBIO), and also a professor of the Department of Neurobiology of Peking University, China. As an entrepreneur and a scientist, Prof. Yu gave us realistic insights to our project. Meeting Prof. Yu helped us to evaluate our project beyond the laboratory environment and to think about its possible future application as a biotechnology product. Towards the end of the interview, we also talked about the bioethics and biosafety issues regarding synthetic biology.
Main Discussion
Prof. Yu mentioned that our project is a small step and that we have a long way to go to apply our project as a commercial biotechnology product. He told us that because we are trying to insert genes into a human body, we need to be very careful with concluding how our project could be realistically applied in the future. Inserting genes into a human body can create novel metabolism properties that could lead to side effects. Also, because the general public considers obesity less harmful, people might be reluctant to sign up for invasive treatment if they believe a less invasive means such as exercising can solve the problem. He also encouraged us to look into other plant genes that could be used to cure fatal diseases.
We also discussed about issues on biosafety and bioethics. Prof. Yu said that we need to be responsible scientists and utilize research to improve human life. He also mentioned that to produce a bioproduct, it is very important to consider the ethical issues of the project from the very start.
Conclusion
The interview with Professor Albert Yu helped us to realize the social environment our project would encounter, and the barriers that come with it. The interview also showed that more in-depth consideration of our project’s future application is necessary if we want to see it utilized as a safe bioproduct.

Bordeaux,2016,Team:Bordeaux#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," of donor bacteria and recipients on agar slides at stationnary phase in function of initial cell densities.
Unfortunately, the figures obtained were not conclusive. We did not obtain similar curves between simulation and experimental data. This could be due to two main facts :
first, the simulation time chosen (10 hours ) was not important enough to see likeness between the two sets of data.
second, we set our bacteria into two states ( donors or recipients ) and didn't take into account the « transconjugant » state.
A bacterium becomes a transconjugant when it acquires a plasmid. Its properties are then different from a donor bacterium.
Prospects
As for now, we created a simple multi-agent model for bacterial growth and interactions. This model can be used as a base to more specific simulations on those subjects. Nevertheless, if we could continue this project we would tackle a few issues, such as :
Create a transconjugant state and its repercussions.
Create a plasmid agent with its own properties, that would allow to test more specific cases.
Optimize the memory allocation to obtain results more quickly.
We hope that this project can help future Igem teams to develop bacterial simulation models! If one of you fellow igemer end up on this page (and if you are interested by this project), you are welcome to contact us!
Our code can be found on github , and installation instructions on the software section .
We would also like to thanks fellow iGEM teams for helping us on our model, and providing us with the 3D illustrations! You can find their wikis below :

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html," (Mutalik et al., 2012; Rodrigoet al., 2012), the engineered systems reported to date have continued their reliance on the loop-mediated RNA interactions from natural systems. Although these loop interactions have been selected by evolution in nature, alternative approaches employing linear-linear RNA interactions are amenable to rational engineering and exhibit more favorable reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, factors that could be exploited to increase riboregulator dynamic range.
A riboregulator that activates gene expression must switch from a secondary structure that prevents translation to a configuration that promotes translation upon binding of a cognate trans-acting RNA. Although the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is an important factor in determining the efficiency of translation from a given mRNA, studies have found that secondary structure in regions near by the start codon also plays a critical role (Kudla et al., 2009).Furthermore, genome-wide analyses have revealed strong biases toward low secondary structures around the start codon of mRNAs from a panel of hundreds of bacterial genomes.
Toehold switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the switch and trigger (Figure 1B). The switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. Upstream of this coding sequence is a hairpin-based processing module containing both a strong RBS and a start codon that is followed by a common 21 nt linker sequence coding for low-molecular-weight amino acids added to the N terminus of the gene of interest. A single-stranded toehold sequence at the 50 end of the hairpin module provides the initial binding site for the trigger RNA strand. This trigger molecule contains an extended single stranded region that completes a branch migration process with the hairpin to expose the RBS and start codon, thereby initiating translation of the gene of interest. The hairpin processing unit functions as a repressor of translation in the absence of the trigger strand. Unlike previous riboregulators, the RBS sequence is left completely unpaired within the 11 nt loop of the hairpin. Instead, the bases immediately before and after the start codon are sequestered within RNA duplexes that are 6 bp and 9 bp long, respectively. The start codon itself is left unpaired in the switches we tested, leaving a 3 nt bulge near the midpoint of the 18 nt hairpin stem. Because the repressing domain b (Figure 1B) does not possess complementary bases to the start codon, the cognate trigger strand in turn does not need to contain corresponding start codon bases, thereby increasing the number of potential trigger sequences"

The cDNA is synthesized by reverse transcriptase.
Inactivation of reverse transcriptase
It means, if the primer anneals to C or D, this sequence doesn’t exist in cDNA. And if the primer did not anneal at 3' end, C or D don't exist in synthesized cDNA (linear mRNA). (fig. 3)
Figure. 3  difference in amplification with the change of the binding site
We calculated the ratio made C or D in cDNA each step when we carried out reverse transcription with random primer.
The ratio of random primer annealing depended on only base pairs of RNA.
When mRNA was transcribed from DNA, transcription finished at the same sequence.
There was no shape pattern of RNA without figure 1.
On the step Ⅰ, when random primer annealed the sequence which is cyclized and its 3’ end, the ratio that D is reverse transcribed is the following.
Step Ⅰ (fig. 4)
Figure. 4  probability on the stepⅠ
Step Ⅱ (fig. 5)
Figure. 5  probability on the stepⅡ
Step Ⅲ (fig. 6)
Figure. 6  probability on the stepⅢ
The C/D calculated in this experiment shows the following.
aⅠand aⅡ show the following.
From the above, by examining the C/D, we are able to calculate the abundance ratio of stepⅢ ; the abundance ratio of the cyclization of the RNA.

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#News_-_-_TEXT.html,", so we used parts of their project as a base and integrated parts of other previous iGEM projects in order to propose a new genetic construction capable of detecting different amounts of a certain substance. We call these new types of sensors, “intelligent biosensors”, because they have the ability to react in different ways depending on their surroundings.
With our project we hope to continue with the previous efforts of other iGEM teams, and at the same time propose a new type of genetic circuit for achieving these functions. In the process we plan to develop BioBricks for two new families of phage activators as well as different BioBrick constructons that can make our system easy to adapt, so that the creation of these “intelligent biosensors” becomes just a matter of choosing the substance of interest and choosing the different reporters.

These 4 steps allow team members to have a clear picture of the stakeholders/experts and complete an initial risk assessment.
II. Analysis
*Key things to consider*
A. Selection of panel of experts:
-Identified by team members (Steps 1-4 of the pre-analysis).
-Found by Muses; collegiate ambassadors collaborating with the members to establish a line of communication with experts on an international level.
B. OSIRIS consists of a tweaked 3-round Policy Delphi method. Named after the Oracle of Delphi, it is a forecasting, decision support method that uses the panel of experts to distil responses and build toward group consensus regarding the risk prediction of the proposed project. The method is conducted sequentially in 3 Rounds:
-Open-ended interviews in the form of Q&A for qualitative data collection regarding general issues of the proposed project (via email, Skype, in-person interview).
-Formation of a quantitative online survey after evaluating the answers of the 1st Round. This Round is comprised of 8 sets of questions (each set has 2 categories: Risk/Benefit, Uncertainty).
-During Round 3, after analyzing the concerns that have arised from Rounds 1 & 2, perform a short-round of questioning, internally between team members and externally with the advisors and synthetic biology experts. This round was designed in order to simulate the challenge of iGEM teams to come-up with radical redesigns for their project according to the received feedback.
1. Perform all 3 rounds of the Policy-Delphi study.
2. Calculate an additive risk/benefit and certainty index and ultimately a mean risk/benefit and certainty score for each factor:
3. Visualize the results in octagonal plots that allow for granular assessment of each factor of the OSIRIS protocol in terms of both its risk or benefit profile as well as expert uncertainty of current understanding of that given criterion and its potential management.
4. Follow an exhaustive analysis by comparing the octagonal plots with the Risk Map (Step 4) and the finalized graphs and qualitative answers/data derived from the first two rounds of the Policy-Delphi method. Draw conclusions on the most important risks, benefits and areas  of the proposed project.
Work collaboratively with other teams or research groups in order to reshape your initial approach by integrating several of the aforementioned criteria into decision making and experimental planning.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.

Serial Client - A Windows Desktop Application to Log Data
The methane sensor we built for Team Braunschweig as well as many microcontroller components of our project, including  the OD Device, are capable of frequently broadcasting readings via their serial connection to a computer. For an efficient analysis and testing as well as the collection of online data, we wrote the Serial Client. This is a Windows Desktop app that plots data coming in on a serial (USB) port live and saves it for later export to Excel.
Screenshot of the application window
All important features are available at glance: Not only the connection configuration, but also data acquisition and live-plotting ca be set in a user-friendly interface.
Usage
In the Data Acquisition section in the left pane of the application, the user can specify pre-processing and export options of the data received on the serial port selected above. Whenever online-data is collected, the measurement hardware is often capable of recording multiple readouts per second that are usually discarded. In most cases, however the recording of more data is advisable, because more information can be used for later analysis. Therefore we have implemented an averaging feature that can summarize multiple readouts into single datapoints (including the standard deviation). We have tested the Serial Client on different laptops and were able to receive about 200 readouts per second without major impact on the overall performance.
Multiple export options are available, including but not limited to:
export of the recent 10-1000 data points
export of all recorded data
export of a histogram on all collected data (useful for debugging purposes)
The data-export is exported to the clipboard and can directly be pasted into Excel for convenient analysis.

Tim Walker - Policy and Practice Advisor
BSc Biological Sciences (Biotechnology) Graduate, University of Edinbrough; MRes Microbiology (Distinction) Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Tim is fascinated by the rich diversity of the microbial world, and how this can be utilised for biotechnological and medical usage.
During this time he felt restless and enrolled on the part-time MSc Microbiology course at Birkbeck. Almost immediately he rediscovered his passion for microbiology and the following year he quit recruitment and transferred to a full-time MRes research project. The project was to assess the activity of a light-activated antimicrobial surface. ""Despite blowing my life savings and having to also work part-time to support myself, it was the best decision I've ever made"". He fell in love with research and his hard work has earnt me a BBSRC PhD scholarship to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of Actinomycetes.""
Tim's effort in the Owligos team is around Practice & Policy and Sponsorship. Tim is proud to be a part of the inaugural Birkbeck iGEM team because, without the flexible learning opportunities they offer to full-time working people, he wouldn't have been able to complete a Masters and wouldn't now be living his dream as a research microbiologist. Tim is very excited by the project we are developing and looks forward to showing everyone at the Giant Jamboree everything we have achieved!"

Conclusion
Origin
In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.

Future work
Waste from recovery facilities is a mixture of plastics and cellulosic rich biomass such as fibres and wood. The Resource-full waste module utilises the large variety of materials organisms can naturally degrade to recycle the waste and to provide food for the production of the bioplastic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, P(3HB).
Separating polyurethane and selling its breakdown products
Certain enzymes have the ability to degrade plastics as a result of their evolutionary history, dealing with tough and highly variable substrates such as lignin. Various enzymes have been biobricked to deal with most of the major petrochemical plastics, except for polyurethane. Polyurethane is one of the plastic constituents of this mixed waste. We have designed biobricks containing naturally occurring polyurethane esterases (also known as PUR esterases) to break polyurethane down into its constituent chemicals of ethylene glycol and poly(isocyanate). These valuable chemicals will be separated using specialised filters and sold back to industry.
Using the residual material as a substrate for P(3HB) production
The remaining organic portion of the mixed waste is used as a carbon source for P(3HB) production. P(3HB) is produced by organisms containing the pha CAB oper"

Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from other iGEM teams in China who volunteered to validate our circuit in their own lab, we obtained a large amount of data for modelling and modifying our system (see collaboration).

Background
Project Motivation
Programmers need to track even minute changes to their code exhaustively, especially as the project scales up. Without it, there'd be far too much time spent just on merging in changes from other programmers and far too little time spent actually coding. It's reasonable that an analogy exists in synthetic biology, where complicated structures are modified with the utmost of detail. But because most synthetic biologists work on relatively small logical functions in comparison to the hulking data structures programmers wield, introducing a version control system seemed like overkill. With today's exponentially-increasing complexity of synthetic life, though, it will soon be a grave mistake to not use some sort of change-tracking tool; biologists will soon get caught up in the same logical complexity that plagues professional programmers. Especially as synthetic biology grows as a field, with increasing support from government and enterprise, more people will get involved in these projects and an inability to effectively collaborate could hamper the entire industry.
However, no tool currently exists to support genome-scale changes in a useful way. Existing methods of tracking gene changes don't scale well, and don't incorporate the power of the version control tools programmers are used to. While programming version control tools could be used to cover DNA data, they aren't used to working with that sort of input and are extraordinarily inefficient. Darwin is a way around that. It's built off of version control tools, so it takes advantage of their strength. But it manipulates the DNA data to optimize for these tested and proven methods of version control, producing a much more efficient and secure tracking system. Darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. It's also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems.
Coding
Programmers need to track even minute changes to their code exhaustively, especially as the project scales up. Typical tools used for this process include git and svn, which create ""diffs"" which capture differences between files and send them over a network to collaborators.

Title
BBF RFC97: Genetic Circuit Standard 1.0
1.Introduction
Current, there is well adopted documentation of biobricks. The Registry of Standard Biology Part set the standard documentation for biobrick. However, there is no standard way to document a genetic circuit, what information should be included in a description of a genetic circuit. We have therefore develop the technique standard for recording a genetic circuits. This standard should help the sharing of genetic circuits information among synthetic biology community.
2.Purpose
In order to make a distinct network which aims to help everyone to obtain the necessary information of a Synthetic Biology project, we set up a new genetic design standard---- Genetic Circuit Standard.
3.Relation to other BBF RFCs
Some parts of this paper reference the content of BBC RFC 89.
Here we give a brief comment to RFC 89: This technical standard is a tidy edition of the Biobrick™ standard, but if this standard are serving for the Bio-Search software, probably it need some more information about the projects that the submitted biobricks have applied in. Hope this can give some help to the team.

Tip: For precious strains, storage of 2 stock vials is recommended.
Tip: When recovering a stored strain, it is advisable to check the antibiotic markers by streaking the strain onto a selective plate.
Agar plates
Plates of streaked bacteria can be sealed with Parafilm and stored upside-down at 4°C for several weeks. Bacteria should always be streaked onto plates containing the appropriate antibiotic to ensure that selective markers are not lost.
To obtain well-isolated colonies, streak an agar plate as follows:
1. Flame a wire loop, and cool on a spare sterile agar plate.
2. Using the wire loop, streak an inoculum of bacteria (from a glycerol stock, stab culture, or single colony on another plate) across one corner of a fresh agar plate, as shown in the figure Streaking bacteria on agar plates.
3. Flame and cool the wire loop again. Pass it through the first streak and then streak again across a fresh corner of the plate.
4. Repeat again to form a pattern.
5. Incubate the plate upside down at 37°C for 12–24 hours until colonies develop.

Typical colony PCR reaction Mix together the following on ice; always adding enzyme last. For multiple samples, make a large master mix and aliquot 50 µl in each PCR tube (also on ice).
38 µl sterile distilled water
5 µl 10X PCR buffer (500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.0% Triton X 100)

1 µl 20 µM forward primer
1 µl 20 µl reverse primer
0.2-1 µl Taq polymerase
50 µl total volume
To each cold PCR tube containing the PCR reaction, add a small amount of colony. To do this, use a fine yellow pipette tip attached to a pipetter (set at 30 µl to avoid addition of air into the PCR reaction) and pipette up and down to mix.

Collaboration
Initially, they requested us to do the interlab study with V.natriegens and to annotate how fast it grows but this gave us a really good idea. Why don't we try to use V.natriegens in Printeria? If all goes well, it would mean that Printeria is ready to work with other organisms which grow faster than E.coli, this way we reinforce the biofactory idea of Printeria. 
However, as things do not go as we spect in certain moments, we could not make the interlab with V.natriegens.
Marburg team gave us almost all the elements to do it except the strain. We had to buy V.natriegens in the CECT and unfortunately they arrived one week before the deadline. We tried several times using a leased frozen centrifuge but 3 tries later we could not achieve electrocompetent cells. As we do not have sponsors and the frozen centrifuge was not cheap we stoped trying.  
On the other side, trying V.natriegens in Printeria will have to wait after Giant Jamboree. Then we will have enough time to understand how to do electrocompetent cells. For the moment we leave you the photos of the attempts:  
On the left, our attemps with V.natriegens, on the right, V.natriegens without fluorescense.
Imperial College
Team Project
This collaboration was born when Ismael (Imperial College iGEM team supervisor) came to the Polytechnic University of Valencia to have a meeting with Diego Orzáez, one of our instructors. Taking advantage of that situation we met with him, and he explained us the Imperial College project called PixCell.
PixCell aims to get electronics and Synthetic Biology closer designing an innovative system where the culture is controlled by voltage.  
As they are also using Golden Gate assembly method, we thought that it could be a good opportunity to do what we could not do with Ecuador team: try to assemble their construction in Printeria and compare the handmade results with the ones obtained with our device. 
To do so, we assembled two of their genetic constructions (SoxR promoter-SoxR protein gene and the GFP coding sequence) into the pBR322 backbone. By using a pre-version of the final Printeria design, we were able to successfully assemble their 1-state construction by carrying out the Golden Gate BsaI reaction among our cold and hot PCB areas. This assembly product was then send back to them."

All the bands we need are on present on the 1G ConsCass and 4D LacCass, which means the digest is good for 3A Assembly. All we need now is the kerA and pSB1A3 ligation and the primers.
We need to double-check the sizes of the insert and see if they are on the gel

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Ribosense#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and"

EXPERIMENTS
Our project consists of two main experiments:
Cas9 periplasm-translocation:
In order to direct Cas9 to the periplasm for packaging into OMVs, we cloned and expressed multiple versions of Cas9 fused with different outer membrane proteins and Tat/Sec translocation signal peptides. We investigated whether Cas9 was expressed first in the periplasm and outer membrane of Escherichia coli, and then in E. coli outer membrane vesicles.
Cas9 functionality test:
We designed a customizable gRNA template compatible with Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (saCas9) to validate the functionality of our saCas9 complex and for other iGEM teams to use.
Constructs
Our basic modified Cas9 part consists of a translocation signal sequence or periplasm-targeting protein fusion, a His6 tag to facilitate Western blotting or chromatography, and saCas9 codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. Because BioBricks assembly creates scar sequences containing stop codons, these coding sequence components do not have BioBricks restriction sites between them and are therefore meant to be used as simple parts. We initially tested the part in a plasmid with the BBa_R0040 Tet promoter, the BBa_J61100 RBS, and the pSB1C3 plasmid set of terminators.
We chose the Tat sequence TorA, the Sec sequence Ycdo, and the SRP sequence DsbA. TorA is the native Tat signal peptide in E. coli. The other signaling sequences were chosen at recommendation of our graduate student team or from prior work done characterizing signal sequences into the two respective translocation mechanisms 1 . We referenced these Tat, Sec, and SRP sequences from prior literature, especially from work done by Dr. Danielle Tullman-Ercek at Northwestern University, and had them synthesized by IDT as DNA ultramers.
Protein fusions of saCas9 were made with ice nucleation protein (INP) and cytolysin ClyA, both of which are proteins associated with the outer membrane whose use in chimeric protein membrane-translocation has been characterized in prior literature 2 , 3"

Brazil is still in the planning stages of its  “Regulations and guidelines on biosafety of recombinant DNA research and biocontainment, 2017” and is still open for comments.
This collaboration emphasised to us that biosafety and GMO laws are still varied all around the world, with some countries lagging behind more than others. This would require much more research than we realised if we were to launch our project internationally.

USTC-Software,2014,Team:USTC-Software#develop.php_-_-_TEXT.html," RESTful style. It is a kind of completely public and universal interface and offers detailed documentation. You can develop your own applications based on these interfaces. These interfaces have been optimized a lot for Biopano-client, so the communication efficiency has been enhanced significantly.
Automated Deployment:
Our server has automated deployment capabilities. Server-side applications are bound with the Product branch of Git. All codes pushed to the Product branch will be deployed to many servers over the world in ten seconds. In order to prevent fault codes from being deployed to the servers by mistake, all the testing branches will be deployed to the testing server real-timely to be tested by developers.
Unit Testing:
Our server applies automated unit testing to dealing with uploaded back end codes. It will test the basic legitimacy and function of the codes, including robustness testing with respect to illegitimate uploaded parameters, legitimacy testing on data legitimacy, status testing of the database and testing of function realizaton, etc.
Alogrithm
Pathway Finder Alogrithm:
The software can search for paths between two selected nodes. We used a-stark short-path algorithm to achieve the function of discovering potential relationship in the biological network.           A* algorithm is a search algorithm based on greedy, which can always visit fewer nodes and get a better solution at the same time.           In this way, however, we get the shortest path in graph theory. By giving different and appopraite weights to different edges, the algorithm can find the shortest path in the sense of biology.
BLAST：
We use two packages, namely, NCBI_Blast and the Python package called for NCBI_Blast. Different from NCBI, our alignment database combines RegulonDB and user-define databases. When the user inputs a sequence (such as a BioBrick sequence), Biopano will the node that shares the deepest homology with it in the server database, and show other nodes connected with it. Therefore, Biopano can show the nodes and regulations in the biological regulation network that probably has to do with the sequence (such as BioBrick sequece) the user inputs.

Organisms
We worked in a Level 1 laboratory, because all the organism (Escherichia coli and Clostridium  acetobutylicum) and parts we were using fall into this biosafety category. Both bacteria are  safe to use since they pose a minimal potential threat to people in the laboratory and do not  consistently cause disease in healthy adults. Nevertheless, we were precautious and used  proper disinfectant to clean the laminar flow cabinet and other working areas as some of the  E. coli we were using during our research was of course genetically modified.  Working in a dedicated molecular biology lab our working space is separate from the rest of  the facility. Our lab is a part of a department which again is separated from the rest of the  building by a door that locks automatically, so that the access to the department is  controlled. Work was preformed on an open lab table. Personal protective gear (lab coat and  gloves) was worn at all times and was supplemented with eye and ear protection as needed  (for example for work with UV light or sonication).  All liquid waste was autoclaved before  being discharged. Solid waste was collected separately and disposed by inicineration by an  independent  contractor. A sink for hand washing and 70% ethanol was available for  sterilisation at all times if needed.
Butanol
Butanol as our main product, when produced in adequate quantities, would be used in  standard Otto gasoline engines as a propellant. Since this engine is one of two most common  engines, the other one being the diesel engine, we had to consider several aspects of  butanol`s broad use, including safety and possible impact it would have on the environment.
Butanol is according to the CDC harmful to health.  It causes  damage if inhaled, ingested or if it comes in contact with skin or eyes. Inhalation of vapours  may cause headache, nausea, drowsiness and dizziness and irritation of the respiratory tract.  Ingestion may result in vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dizziness and  drowsiness. Exposure to the eyes and skin causes irritation, redness and pain.

Instead, we’ll just have the Crawler process Parts pages, so next time we have to work on making sure that the rest of the code does just that (e.g. editing some classes to ensure that the lists containing the results to the search queries only contain links to Parts pages).
Day 21: June 26, 2012
Started to connect RegList.cs and RegDataSheet.cs via a method called search that takes a string (the query) as an argument. The first class parses through the search results page whereas the second crawls through the actual results pages. We need to connect it such that the Crawler invokes the RegDataSheet.cs for each link. A lot of troubleshooting needed to be done here, and difficulty was mostly caused because we hadn’t taken all cases into consideration. We’ve continued debugging by looking through the output of our classes and the actual information presented in the pages.
Day 22: June 27, 2012
Encountered problems with algorithm that parses through the search results page, so we spent the morning trying to solve it. Worked with Linda on connecting our back end of the MoClo Planner to the front end she is developing using HTML5 and JavaScript

Reformatted the string returned by RegDataSheet in the order Linda wanted. Continue to find ways to extract other necessary information from the Parts Registry.

Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.
We are working in an isolated environment inside the MFC (anaerobic chamber); The gold ions that we are using in our experiments are potentially dangerous to the environment but we are using HEPES buffer to reduce the ions to nanoparticles, which pose no threat (add a link to the video of HEPES buffer reducing gold ions to nanoparticles by itself); Safety
Also, we did outreach activities to inform people  about synthetic biology and allowed them to think about its uses, advantages and disadvantages.

University_of_Sheffield,2008,Team:University of Sheffield #Project_-_-_TEXT.html," interact with the specially designed E.coli, and those activated by contaminants would produce a distinctive glow visible to the naked eye. The chamber that glows corresponds to an unhealthy level of a particular pathogen in the water sample.
The reusable aspect came from the idea that disposable equipment is environmentally unfriendly. However, it could be cheaper than a reusable option, so if out plan were to be properly carried out, both chips should be developed to provide options. To make the chip reusable however, LVA tags are attached to the GFP in the DNA code, which attracts a housekeeping protease to cleave the GFP more rapidly than if left to degrade in the cell alone. A short burst of glow would be visible in cell, which would disappear by the time the chip dries out/the water passes through it.
Any takers?
This approach requires absolutely no technical knowledge, and could be ideal for its purposes. A future iGEM project anyone?
Parts and BioBricks
After various attempts to use the Biobrick booklet for transformation procedures needed for implied project ideas, we came to conclusion that the booklet shipped was actually faulty. Tests then proved this to be true. Thus the required BioBrick vector for submission of our designed parts was impossible to use from the booklet we were provided. Unfortunately, we ascertained this too late to receive variance approval. Which means we have BioBricks built but no way to send/enter them.
The BioBricks we made, however, were:
1.) CsrA, with promoter
2.) CsrA, without promoter
3.) CsrB, with promoter
4.) CsrB, without promoter
5.) UvrY, with promoter
6.) UvrY, without promoter
7.) CsqS
8.) CqsA
9.) BarA
10.) Red recombinase system!
11.) pKD46 Ori site - temperature sensitive
12.) FLP recombinase

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Customizing Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," the frequency of producing a full-length sequence that we intend to build. This is achieved by adding capping oligos that ligate to a chain where a previous monomer piece fail to attach. Any incomplete or incorrect sequence due to unsuccessful ligations would be blocked from further extending, and thus monomers that are added later would ligate to the right sequences at a higher frequency.
Once the full gene sequence has been generated, the terminator oligo containing the biobrick suffix is added to complete the assembly.  The gene can then be released from the streptavidin beads by heating and disrupting the Streptavidin biotin interaction [5] .
ICA is a proficient technique to standardize assembly of any custom gene sequence. Not only does it provide flexibility in producing custom gene sequence, it is also compatible with the iGEM biobrick system. The initiator contains the prefix sequence of a biobrick and the terminator contains the suffix sequence. These contain primer sites allow PCR amplification of the full-length constructs after the release from the beads. In addition, restriction sites within the initiator and terminator enable the insertion of the complete, assembled product into a biobrick backbone easily using Golden-Gate cloning.
What We've Done
Over the course of the summer, we modified the nucleotide sequence of MaSp1 and MaSp2 so that it is both compatible with the iGEM standards as well as with our ICA assembly scheme.  We generated these sequences by ordering single stranded oligos and doing multiple rounds of pcr to assemble the full construct.  These sequences contain the biobrick prefix and suffix as well as the required Bsa1 restriction sites for the ICA/Golden Gate reaction.    Furthermore, we designed and assembled the other nucleotide sequences necessary for ICA from primers that we ordered. These sequences include the biotinylated initiator oligo, the ICA terminator oligo, as well as the capping oligos (see above for description of each).
We ran some trial runs of ICA by trying to assemble only a few monomers together.  We only were able to run a few trials, and unfortunately, were not able to create the full silk construct.  We were able to ligate the initiator oligo to the terminator oligo, showing that the initiator oligo was successfully conjugating to the streptavidin beads and that the ligation reaction reaction worked.  Hopefully with some optimizations and troubleshooting, we can use this protocol to assemble a full length silk construct in the near future.

BioBrick Creator
Aída Moreno and José Gutiérrez
Week 1
Defining our program
We met up with the wet lab to get a general idea about what should be the functionalities of the BioBrickCreator. We tried to define some key features and what standards our program should met.
Week 2
Jose: My firsts contacts with biological terminology. I started to understand the basics of synthetic biology and how the BioBricks system worked. I had to decide about which language of programming I would use to develop the tool. Finally I chose to use JAVA  because it's a multiplatform way to run the application.
Aída: I made a long searching process in the iGEM parts registry website. I tried to familiarize with all iGEM terminology due to this was my first year in the iGEM.
Week 3
Jose: I got a general idea about how should be the whole design of our program. I also started to work in and develop the independent modules before start designing biological algorithms. Like for example the best way to process string sequences to be modified.
Aída: Once I perfectly understood how the iGEM parts registry worked, I tried to think about how we could implement all those standards in one single program. I thought that the best could be to divide the program into three main modules and I thought about how each module should work.
Week 4
Genetic algorithms design
Jose: I worked in the design of the first’s module main genetic algorithms.  I designed a specific algorithm for each type of genetic input. I learned and understood the process of genes translation. I made the first draft of the codifying sequences algorithm for which I had to implement the genetic code table into the program.
Aída: I tried to explain Jose how all the genetic algorithms"

RESULTS
One of my objectives was to determine how much more GPP is produced using the erg20-2 gene instead of just the ERG20 gene. Below is a graph which illustrates the concentration of GPP produced using the pinene synthases, PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin, found in the simplified biochemical pathway as a function of time with the ERG20 or with the erg20-2 gene. Relatively speaking, my simulation showed that 1.3127 times more GPP is produced with the addition of the erg20-2 gene.
Figure 7: The concentration of GPP produced using the pinene synthases, PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin, found in the simplified biochemical pathway as a function of time with the ERG20 or with the erg20-2 gene.
Next, I wanted to determine what effect K6R-hmg2 and erg20-2 would have on the concentration of monoterpenes produced. I ran 2 separate simulations and merged their outputs on the plot below. My simulation showed that 17.10% more beta-pinene is produced and 17.00 % more alpha-pinene is produced when K6R-hmg2 and erg20-2 are used instead of HMG2 and ERG20 alone.
Figure 8: The concentration of monoterpenes produced using the pinene synthases, PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin, found in the simplified biochemical pathway as a function of time.
I went one step further and also took the time derivatives of the monoterpene output. I plotted them as a function of time as shown below. My simulation showed that the maximum velocity of:
beta-pinene with K6R-hmg2 and erg20-2 is 5.674*10^(-10) M/salpha-pinene with K6R-hmg2 and erg20-2 is 2.372*10^(-10) M/sbeta-pinene with HMG2 and ERG20 is 4.638*10^(-10) M/salpha-pinene with HMG2 and ERG20 is 1.941*10^(-10) M/s
Therefore, the K6R-hmg2 and the erg20-2 genes increase the rate of beta-pinene production by 22.34% and alpha-pinene by 22.21%.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized BBa_B0034 corresponding to mean strength of 1.
Stronger ribosome binding sites increase the yield of translated proteins and in turn increase the number of catalytically converted substrate nucleotides. This increase is inversely proportional to the assigned mean methylation score. Based on this fact, the activity results can be extracted from mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) and correspond to ribosome binding site strength because the same enzyme and substrate nucleotide concentration were used during the activity recording. The catalytic activity sequencing results were compared to earlier measured in bulk RBS strength results. The comparison once again concludes the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The ribosome binding site strength, extracted from the DNA sequence reference nucleotide count correlates with measurements made with accurate standard assays. These results display the validity of CAT-Seq as a method for screening the strength of regulatory sequences and its ability to assign accurate phenotype to genotype linkage.
Toehold riboswitch activity and orthogonality sequencing
The constructed Toehold regulatory sequence library constituted of different toehold and triggers pairs was constructed subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information was extracted and sequenced with Nanopore. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different regulatory sequence were filtered and extracted.
Figure 23. The evaluation of Toehold-Trigger riboregulatory sequence orthogonality using CAT-Seq.         The catalytic activity of esterase genes, regulated by different Toehold switches were measured using CAT-Seq. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded regulatory construct DNA template was filtered and essigned. Low methylation scores correspond to actively expressed protein and are only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present verifying the already measured orthogonality of regulatory parts.
The graph displays the mean methylation (reference nucleotide count) scores assigned to each barcoded toehold-trigger construct read. Based on the results, low methylation score are only assigned to those parts, that are constituted of Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group. This means that esterase enzyme was expressed and catalyzed the conversion of substrate nucleotides. These results correlate perfectly to the standard (not in droplet) measurement results. Based on this fact, it can be concluded that CAT-Seq activity sequencing method can be utilized as a precise and accurate way to screen and assign the activity and orthogonality of regulatory sequences in a high throughput"
