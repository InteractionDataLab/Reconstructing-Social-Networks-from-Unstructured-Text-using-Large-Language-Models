∆HisB∆pyrF∆rpoZ+pSR01 growth results:
When no IPTG was present, the bacteria grew in LB+amp, NM+his, and NM, showing that the plasmid rescues the selection stain's growth phenotype! This implies that our strain had the right genotype all along. However, when IPTG was added to the media, the strain only grew well in LB.  This is very odd, since IPTG was supposed to induce zif268 and thus His3 expression. We will try a couple things to make sure nothing went wrong:
redo cultures in the same pattern as yesterday--perhaps IPTG+/- were mislabeled
inoculate cultures of ∆HisB∆pyrF∆rpoZ +/- pSR01 so that Vatsan can use a plate reader to compare their growths
Joung wrote back and said that the HisB deletion is in fact 6 bases in frame. He also mentioned something about a lac deletion which we are looking into.
MAGE3 sequencing results:
none of the colonies had the stop codons.  This may be because mutS is not knocked out, and it can correct strands that have up to 5 bases mismatched.
Kan-ZFB for lambda red:
Noah did lambda red in EcNR2 and the plate was covered in crystalline patterns that may be cells. We will test this by:
Restreaking some of these ""colonies"" onto a fresh kan plate to get the bacteria more spread out
Streaking a kan plate with pKD46 (from glycerol stock) to see if the kan is effective
Taken a streak off the plate, diluted it in 200µL H20, and used 1µL as template for PCR
KAPA, 1529620-flanking primers, 90 sec elongation and 56 anneal, 25 cycles
Results: 300bp band--the streaks on the plate are bacteria, but they do not have the insert.
1529620 locus PCR of EcNR2 lambda red 7/13/11
We also retried the thio kan-ZFB PCR using some new primer aliquots. Once again it failed.
Thio kan-ZFB PCR 7/13/11
Because this PCR keeps failing, we're going to try a different way and do two separate and shorter PCRs to be joined later in an overlap PCR:

Tuebingen,2017,Team:Tuebingen#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to grasp that antibiotic resistances are indeed a problem for us, ultimately fighting to reduce the over- and misuse of antibiotics. Fortunately, our project and our team have become quite popular over the last years in our local community which is shown by the fact that an interested student contacted us and hoping to get extensive insights into our work during an internship.
It was a pleasure to offer her a two-week internship in our lab. Since she had never worked in a life science lab before, we showed her the basic workflow in a lab and a variety of molecular methods such as PCR, DNA purification, restriction, ligation, Mini- and Maxiprep and Gibson Assembly. She gave us the rare opportunity to take on a new role as educators and gain experience in mentoring students. We were very excited to work with such a motivated student and very happy to hear that she had a great experience as well. She affirmed that she acquired unique insights into the operations in a laboratory and gained valuable skills about teamwork and some ideas about her future career.
This feedback is also gratifying to us, reassuring us that we can make a positive impact by letting people get an intensive inside view in bioengineering work and motivating us to give more students the chance to do an internship with us.
Figure 1: Milena, Madeleine and Lukas from our team with Fan working in the lab.
After this thrilling response, we were encouraged to open our team and labwork for as many people as possible. Around this time we heard “Deutsches Jungforschernetzwerk - juFORUM e.V.” was organizing a statewide meeting of participants of the 2017  “Jugend Forscht” science competition. juFORUM e.V. is a network by and for high school, university and Ph.D. students and other people interested in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
So we invited 22 young STEM-interested students from around Baden-Württemberg to the Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry in Tübingen offering the seminar “Nothing in the pipeline? - The Problem of modern antibiotic research”. The task was to engage in a role-play where participants formed their own opinion in small groups and represented different parties involved in antibiotic research. The following organizations were represented: university research, the pharmaceutical industry, medicine, and health insurance. Additionally, two students guided the discussion and worked out some background information. Every group received material assembled with information from the World Health Organisation (WHO), different scientific papers and newspaper. During the review of the material, many students commented they were surprised by the urgency of this issue. They"

For example, any remaining part of the micro-organism in our product to which the environment is exposed, could in theory make people sick. The consequences of such events would probably be catastrophic for the company. However, since the organism we use are very weak variants of the E. coli bacterium, the likelihood that this will happen, is considered to be small.
It is also possible that we are not able to patent our product. This automatically would mean that external parties are allowed to produce the biological MLA and this can worsen our competitiveness. We consider this as a possible risk with major consequences.
Market related risks
There is always a probability that our product will not be accepted by a part of our possible customers. However, since we have done an extensive customer research, we consider this risk to be small.
An additional possible risk is that our product does make use of a genetically modified organism. The real risks of these organisms are considered to be small, but it is possible that the perception of the risk among the public is different. For example, negative media attention about the use of genetically modified organisms in our product could have a negative influence on the sales volume of our company. The consequences in that case are expected to be moderate. However, since our product is not a food and it is a part of a final larger product, it is considered to be unlikely that there will be negative attention. Furthermore, together with all the iGEM teams and many other companies and organizations we are working hard to improve the acceptation of synthetic biology among the public. This will help the acceptance of our product as well.
The risk of a (new) substitute is also a serious risk. For example, the general chemically synthesized MLAs could become cheaper and more attractive therefore. It is also possible that a totally new alternative will be developed in the future. Therefore it is important to keep investing in R&D in order to keep our product “up-to-date”. We do expect that it is possible that there will be new competitive substitutes for our product, but because of all these measures we expect that the consequences will be moderate for a longer period of time.
Finally, it is also possible that the total market changes. In an extreme situation this could for example result in no need of encapsulation layers any more or an extreme increase of efficiency of solar cells, which make our specific MLA encapsulation layer useless. This could be catastrophic for our company. Fortunately, we expect a radical change like this will be unlikely.
Product and operational related risks
There is a risk that we may not actually be able to deliver the product"

I obtained my doctoral degree in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in Spain. After living in beautiful Andalucía I moved to Florida for my first postdoc position and then moved on to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the Washington, DC area for a much longer second postdoctoral position. I moved back to my country two years ago and when SENACYT asked for my institution, INDICASAT , to help the team, I was asked if I could take charge of the team work in our lab. It has been great to see the independent thinking, great enthusiasm, and pride the students have shown facing the fact that they will be making it possible for our country, Panama, to be in the iGEM contest for the first time in our incipient scientific history

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," easy to use that researchers in synthetic biology will be excited to make microfluidic chips. We want a workflow that interfaces with fabrication protocols that are low cost, such that even DIY hobbyists could make new chips. We wanted a workflow whose hardware could be fabricated with a 3D printer, and whose software is open source so that the entire synthetic biology community can contribute to new features in Neptune. Further, we wanted to ensure our workflow completely and cleanly integrates with current fabrication methods, so that we are still following current standards.
Open Source Software
While this is already an iGEM requirement, we are proud to say our source code for Neptune is licensed as open under a BSD-II license. Further, we are very proud to say that Neptune is public on GitHub, and we encourage developers to fork the repo.
Neptune is free to download from GitHub too, and very soon NONA will provide a distribution method.
GITHUB REPOSITORY
NONA
Simple Design Process
Accessibility means ease of use. Ease of use means simplicity; it means a no-brainer user interface and powerful code to help you design microfluidics with ease. Indeed, the biggest setback to designing microfluidics before Neptune was the tedious, long, and difficult process of hand-specifying all features in the microfluidic device. In Neptune, simple english-language descriptions allow you to specify complex microfluidic designs.
Tutorials, Wiki's, Documentation
Not knowing how to use a new tool can dissuade researchers from ever bothering to learn; poor documentation, lack of support for new users, confusing or nonexistent tutorials- all of these add up to a big headache to a researcher who wants to get into microfluidics.
We targeted this issue by creating a tutorial video for our software and hardware workflow. This tutorial is a complete “Hello World” walkthrough that will guide new researchers step-by-step through the microfluidic creation process. We hope that this will encourage anyone who had been intimidated by microfluidic design to come forward and give it a shot.
A  tutorial video is good, but not complete. We followed up by starting a extensive written tutorial to writing LFR and MINT files (to design microfluidics,) and written tutorials on how to setup the hardware components. We also added wiki into to the GitHub repositories for Neptune and our hardware, providing yet another resource for new users to try.
Integrated, Low Cost Fabrication Protocols
This is truly where the integrated human integration contributions become apparent. We had a clear choice here: We could have made Neptune interface with industry grade, powerful and very expensive fabrication methods using photolithography"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Recombinant_-_-_TEXT.html," the activity of the laccase on the ambient temperature
For our filter modelling we determined kcat/KM from these measurements by looking at the initial gradient. We normalized this by equating the enzyme activity at 20° C with the activity determined by our modeling of the substrate dependence of the laccase. This can be assumed, because in the experimental setup the substrate concentration is a lot less than the KM value we determined, which then simplifies the Michaelis-Menten equation to give, that the initial gradient is proportional to the enzyme activity kcat/KM.This gave us the activity dependence shown in Figure 19.
Half-life of the laccase in river water
Figure 20: Laccase reaction after 0 hours of incubation in river water
Laccase with an initial concentration of 0,3125 µM was diluted with 1:1 steps at the initial time, then ABTS at a concentration of 97.2 µM was added to each dilution and the kinetic of the ABTS reaction was recorded using a photometer at 405 nm. Figure 20 shows the results.
Then the laccase was dialyzed against river water, taken from the local river Isar. After 96 hours and again after 144 hours, the initial dilution experiment was repeated giving figure 21 any 22, respectively. It is apparent that the enzymes activity has been reduced.  From these measurements we estimated the half-life to be 36.3 hours, corresponding to an inactivation rate of 5.3 10-6 s-1, which we then used in our filter model .

The Nano Luciferase (NanoLuc) which was introduced in 2013 by Promega is a new member of the luciferase reporter gene/protein familiy and shows some advantages compared to the other family members. The NanoLuc is very small (19 kDa) compared to the firefly luciferase (61 kDa) and the Renilla luciferase (36 kDa). On the other hand it is also said that the specific activity of the NanoLuc is about 150-fold stronger compared to conventional luciferases and the background caused by autoluminescense of the substrate is said to be remarkably smaller.

After looking for the above-mentioned table, we find that our product has many advantage. Not only does our project has no side effect, but it can also be used for everyone. However, all the products have to pass the examination of legalizing, if they want to hit the market. That's why we visited FDA.
Conclusion
It took us quite a long time to think about how to respond to the questions above, since last time we had a meetup with NCKU_Tainan, one of their team members had already ask us a pretty tough question similar like these problems that we barely couldn’t answer, “aren’t you guys supporting the world to consume more sugar?” At first, we kind of think that they are right. After all, there’s no denying that these  questions just hit the weak point of our project and present the realistic society problems our product might bring, but after a fierce argument between our teammates, we repositioned our project and have the conclusion in addition below :
 
Indeed. It is actually the way that gets straight to the point the most. However, it’s just like the reason why you prefer Mosquito-repellent lotion to wearing long sleeves and trousers when hanging out with friends in a hot day. You don’t like to sweat and become smelly, so you make the choice. Let’s have another example. If you have motion sickness, the most simple and direct way to solve it is get off the car, but that’s too inconvenient. As a result, you take motion sickness pills instead. The two examples convey the same meaning. Sugar is not merely an essential nutrient in our normal life, but it is also added into snacks、afternoon tea… and so on that people enjoy for relaxation. That is, avoiding eating sugar may probably not be very efficient to reach the goal of losing weight. At this moment, our bacteria come into use. 
But here comes a question. Eating sugar without absorbing it? People will definitely run into sugar’s hug rather than resist the desire.  
         Yes. Thus, instead of the medicines put on the shelf that everyone can purchase, our product will be prescription medicines for assistant purpose. Whether patients can take it to help control their weight or blood sugar depends on doctors’ judgment. The customer base we set as target is mostly those who need to"

It is a mammalian mechanosensitive channel. Piezo1 activity triggered by traction forces elicited influx of Ca2+ [3] . Piezo1 has broaden roles in multiple physiological processes, including sensing shear stress of blood flow for proper blood vessel development [4] . Piezo1 has broaden roles in multiple physiological processes, including sensing shear stress of blood flow for proper blood vessel development [5] .
We employed various mechanical forces to stimulate the CHO-K1 cells transfected with Piezo1 plasmid and treated with doxycycline to promote TetON expression.
pBX097-NeoLoxp
Fig. 3 Cre-Loxp translocation
pBX097-NeoLoxp was constructed by connecting the backbone (pBX097) which has PiggyBac sequence with the NeoLoxp fragment.
NeoLoxp is the combination of neomycin antibotic gene with Loxp sequence.
Neomycin gene could be used in later cell screening to get successfully transfected cell.
Loxp is a key component in Cre-loxp system (Fig. 3) [6] [7]
In the lab, we firstly used PiggyBac system to integrate this plasmid containing Loxp into chromosome. After that, quantitative PCR was used to select cells with single copy of Loxp. This Loxp was then used to introduce TRPC5 into cell’s chromosome through Cre-Loxp recombination system (Fig. 4). Thus, we could compare the sensitivity of TRPC5 towards mechanical force quantitatively.
Fig. 4 TRPC5 Construction
TRPC5
One part of TRPC5 was synthesized by IDT, another part was synthesized by Wuxi Qinglan Biotech Cooperation. We used polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion to construct a complete and useful TRPC5 plasmid.
Similar to the experiment of Piezo1 plasmid, we used mechanical force including shear force, ultrasound vibration to stimulate the cells transfected with wild-type TRPC5 channel. Since it’s not so sensitive compared with Piezo1, we’ve done random mutagenesis in the ankyrin repeats of TRPC5, trying to screen the mutated plasmids which are quite sensitive to mechanical force.

Number of Genes Found in Common in Literature and BioBytes Essential Gene Lists
This list gives a much greater chance of success in producing a minimal genome than many of the sources that are presently available.  With this list completed, our BioBytes approach can be used to assemble these genes into constructs and eventually produce the genome.  Together, our modeling work along with BioBytes serve as a genome construction toolkit which anyone can use.
Standardization of Gene Regulation Components
In order to produce a well characterized and standardized minimal genome, numerous components have been standardized including promoters, terminators, and RBS sites.  These have been incorporated into the BioBytes system either as individual parts (as in the case of promoters and terminators) or as components of our unique plasmids pAB and pBA (which occurred with the RBS site).  Microarray data was also used to identify the relative amount of transcript which was produced by each essential gene and therefore which promoter to incorporate with each gene.

Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Design#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," [36] [37] [38] [39]. Thus, they were chosen as the sensory elements of our circuit, as shown in fig. 3.
To increase the selectivity of the sensor and thus the accuracy of the output readings, the input signals corresponding to the sensing of phthalates and organic pollutants must transform according to that of a logic AND-gate, as illustrated in fig. 4. That is to say, the reporter will only be measureable in the instance that phthalates and organic pollutants are both present in the sample. In an attempt to counteract the potential toxicity of introducing and expressing the full-length hER-α in E. coli, the truncated version hER-α LBD was finalized as the phthalate-sensing element to be applied in a complementation assay through domain insertion, in accordance with previous prosperous hER-α biosensor studies as noted in the theory section [29] [30] [31].
Employing the conformational change of the hER-α LBD in a genetic AND-gate can be achieved through a plethora of different approaches. However, in each instance a fusion protein needs to be constructed that capitalizes on the ligand-induced convergence of the termini. Furthermore, rather than connecting the NahR and the hER-α LBD in series in the circuit architecture, implementing their expression concurrently would decrease the reporter synthesis response time. These conditions were met using a tripartite split GFP-protein, as schematically shown in fig. 5. Two GFP gene residues, corresponding to beta-sheet 10 and 11 of the GFP beta barrel motif, were attached to each respective side of the hER-α LBD with appropriate linkers. The remaining GFP, GFP1-9, was put downstream Psal – under regulation of NahR. Cabantous et al. iteratively mined the optimal split sites of the GFP for spontaneous self-assembly upon association [40]. Thus  , upon expression of the GFP10- hER-α LBD-GFP11 and GFP1-9, and subsequent antagonistic ligand interaction with the hER-α LBD, self-assembly of the fluorophore ought to occur. Similar results have been reported with a two-split GFP hER-α LBD fusion protein [30] [41]. The added benefit of utilizing a tripartite split GFP with smaller GFP-tags affixed to the hER-α LBD is that somewhat equidistantly split proteins have generally shown either high levels of aggregation or high background noise [30].

Date: 27/7
Methods: ON, Miniprep
Protocol: MP1.1
Experiment done by: LC & Maria
Notes: PS+B0015 sample Q (1) was eluded in 20 ul to get a concentration over 200 ng/ul, so we would directly be able to send it in for sequencing. All other samples were eluded in 50 ul of elution buffer.
Results: The concentrations were as followed:
PS+B0015 (1): 180 ng/ul
PS+B0015 (2): 130 ng/ul
pSB3T5+J13002 (1 and 2): 50 ng/ul
Sample Q did not fulfill DNA technologies sample specifications for sequencing we waited with sending it in, since we were expecting the results from sample C which was sent in earlier. Since those returned positive, sample Q was never sent in, since we just proceeded with sample C.

Educating the Next Generation
Tarbiryah Academy
Over the summer, members of the lab volunteered at a science fair hosted by Tarbiryah Academy to teach the next generation of young scientists. We had a pipetting and micropipetting lab to teach young kids basic lab techniques. We then had an agar plate demonstration (which was fun to play with!) to teach them what bacteria are and how we can transform bacteria, introducing the current and future potential of engineering bacteria as biological machines to tackle real world problems.
MdBio
Our team also worked with MdBio at a Water Conservation Fair with the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC).  With MdBio, members of our team held pipetting experiments, an activity with non-newtonian fluids, a demonstration of coke and mentos reaction, and an engineering challenge outside their mobile lab. Once again we had a great time interacting with parents and future young scientists.

BL21(DE3) cells carrying the plasmids pETE and pETES-mCherry was inoculated in 10ml of LB and allowed to grow to OD ~0.8 at 37°C. They were then transferred to a 30°C shaking incubator at 200rpm for overnight incubation. The next day 1ml of cells were collected and washed once briskly with 1% sodium cacodylate buffer. The cells were then first fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 1% sodium cacodylate buffer for 20min, washed three times afterwards, and second fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 1% sodium cacodylate buffer for 30min, and washed for another three times. 1% agarose was added to the pre-warmed sample and immediately centrifuged for 2,000rpm for 10min. The set agarose embedment was extracted, cut into 2mm blocks, and dehydr ated with a series of 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% ethanol, finally with propylene oxide. A 1:1 mixture of epoxy resin and propylene oxide was then added to infiltrate the blocks with the resin at 37°C overnight. The next day the blocks were transferred to pure epoxy resin and allowed to polymerize at 65°C. Semi-thin and ultra-thin sections were obtained using an ultratome and collected on water. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and visualized using Philips CM100 TEM.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Blue line shows production of sfGFP by reporter cells over time in the presence of IPTG, and the orange line shows the same in the absence of IPTG.
Integration into Experimental Design
As shown above, the Simbiotics simulation predicted that the system worked most optimally when the reporter cells were far in excess of the detector and processor cells. Therefore, when the system was tested in the laboratory the reporter cells were co-cultured in excess of the detector and processor cells. The wet-lab data showed that the model was correct in its prediction, as a large signal-to-noise ratio was only seen when the system contained more reporter cells than detector and processor cells. Click here to go to the experimental testing for this system.
Discussions and Conclusions
As shown above, the model correctly predicted that the system worked most optimally when the reporter cells were in excess of both the detector and processor cells. One of the reasons that this configuration was the best may be because of signal amplification at each of the quorum sensing communication stages. The quorum sensing mechanism used here is the acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system in gram negative bacteria. This system works by one cell producing a quorum sensing molecule which can diffuse out through its membrane. Once the extracellular space reaches a certain threshold concentration of AHL molecule, the AHL will begin to diffuse into other cells in the community. If the cell the AHL molecule enters has the appropriate transcription factor present (e.g. LasR for the C12 AHL), then transcription of a gene under the control of the pLas promoter can occur. Therefore, if background expression of the AHL is high enough to reach above the threshold level, then expression of the next quorum sensing molecule in another cell (in this case C4 AHL) will occur. By reducing the amount of detector and processor cells present in the system, the background expression levels of C12 and C4 will be lower, and hence expression of sfGFP by the reporter cell will be lower.
Future Work
The Simbiotics tool has many extra functions that could be useful in aiding the design of Sensynova biosensors. One of the features in the ability to organise cells in a pattern on a 2-dimensional surface (figure 13). This would allow modelling of the spatial organisation of the three cell type on a test dip-stick, which could be used similarly to tests such as litmus paper (for detecting pH), or pregnancy tests (for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]). This may or may not provide a more optimal system for the biosensor"

The Establishment of

Co-Culture :
Based on what we have illustrated above, it is our priority to both improve the yields of cellulose generated from G.xy though exploring and optimizing the various condition of co-culture system during the fermentation process and make sure “engineered  bacterial”——E.coli have grown stably and normally.
Since the reproduction speed of E.coli have been much faster than the speed of G.xy, it is significant to calculate the ratio of inoculating both bacterial. Yields of cellulose will be compromised if we inoculate a number of E.coli while little volume of E.coli for which will fail to manipulate the pH.Therefore, it is necessary for us to to explore the best ratio of incubating E.coli and G.xy.
During the process that we utilized culture medium for G.xy to fermented both E.coli and G.xy, the speed of forming the biofilm has been slowed down, therefore we went through the study of growth and metabolism of G.xy and noticed that the glycerol has played a crucial role in metabolic route of G.xy. According to the researches, adequate amount of glycerol  is able to stimulate G.xy to secrete BC in the later phase. Based on what we have in mind, we decided to adjust the combination of carbon source  of culture medium, which is turn the former pattern that glucose as the single carbon source to integrated carbon source pattern which use  the glucose and glycerol to co-provide carbon source.
In addition, we as well as did the trails to measure the impact of yields of BC from other impact factor as ethanol and citric acid etc..(Glu/Gly = Glucose/Glycerin)
We designed the table below and followed the steps to process our experiments, expiring different ratio of incubation  and carbon source. Moreover, we dried the BC from day 7 culture medium and measured both the weight and thickness to obtain relative data.
The comparison of weight and thickness of BC showed that on the condition of"

Then, we are going to fuse these FBD to our candidate enzymes to see if their activity changes. If the activity on liquid is not perturbed, we will test to see whether they optimise their activity by directing it to the fabrics.
We did so, we designed all the new primers and ordered also a new set of GFP proteins to do the testing of the FBD. The problem we faced was that all the GP proteins that we currently have in the lab had bsaI cutting sites, and therefore we needed to synthesise the gene from scratch to get rid of the;. Since we had 8kb left from the IDT free synthesising sponsor, we ordered 8 versions of GFP, each Codon Optimised for E. coli, each fused with one of the 8 different FBDs. We chose one FBS with affinity for just one f the fabrics, one with affinity for cellulose (positive control) and two with affinity for all of the fabrics.
The FBD was added to the proteins in the N-terminal, because the phage display group told us that the domains they chose were designed to be expressed as such. Therefore, we run into a new problem. Some of the FBD did begin with a met in the first position, and therefore we had no problems. But for those which first aminoacid was not methionine, there is now an extra aminoacid, a met to start the protein translation.  This way we do not need to amplify the sequences and can clone them directly once they arrive, into our backbone. After we get the stains, we will perform assays like the ones we performed for the imperial college improvement of the GFP-CBD biobricks.
Week 12th-18th September
This week we had to wait for the designed things to arrive, ad in the meantime, we did some electrocompetent BL21 and BL21(DE3) cells, using the normal protocol that we always use.
We also started working on a collaboration with Evry's team, in which we need to characterise one of their biobricks.
We began by amplifying their GFP, from the backbone they gave us. We decided to amplify with Dreamtaq because it is quite easy to understand if the amplification has gone wrong, given that it will not shine.
In order to build their plasmid we needed to perform old/school restriction-ligation protocols, and therefore we sorted out the common buffer for both enzymes that they told us we needed to cut with, we performed the restriction protocol at "

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Management_-_-_TEXT.html," founders for a negotiable amount. If the remaining founders do not wish to purchase these shares then they will be purchased by the company for the current market value of the shares. If the skill set of the departing advisor is deemed valuable to the company by the board of directors, a replacement advisor will be sought by the company upon unanimous decision by the founders.
Inability to Obtain Required Skill Sets
If FREDsense is unable to attract the required skill sets when needed there are two contingencies that will be attempted in order. The first contingency will be to approach internship programs at local universities to attempt to obtain the necessary personnel before their training is entirely complete, provided they have adequate mentorship from within their university. Failing this, FREDsense will reallocate money in the budget to attempt to attract qualified personnel with a more competitive salary or compensation package, potentially through the issue of shares to the individual(s).
Inadequate Performance by an Officer
If an officer does not commit to the time commitment required by their position within the company, such as part- or full-time employment, then that shareholder will be deemed to be performing inadequately. In the case of inadequate performance the shareholder will be given one full year (365 days) during which they are to meet all required performance goals as outlined by their employment position. If the shareholder does not meet the required performance goals with one year their shares will be purchased by the company for their current market value and the employment of the individual will be terminated.
Incorporation
As a next step for our group, our six members have begun the process of incorporating our business.  This has involved engaging legal professionals to maintain the rights of our company FREDsense Technologies.  We have established a share structure, secured the name FREDsense Technologies, and begun to protect our identity as a corporation.  We have also created an unanimous shareholders agreement (USA) to ensure that our team is working together strongly to build this company up in the future.

During this period, we had a number of discussions on different possible topics. Suggestions included engineering microglia to target and kill brain cancers, targeting HIV surface proteins to bring about their destruction, or modifying microglia to target and engulf prions. Other ideas involved utilizing light receptors for specific purposes, or targeting biofilm formation. However, in the end we decided to focus on the circadian rhythm, with an aim to replicate this system in a mammalian system that could be used in iGEM. After some time developing a plan for this system, we discovered that the parts we required were covered by patents and so we would be unable to send anything we made in to the registry. As a result, we decided to switch to a bacterial system, and source some plasmids from Dr. Alex Ninfa (Michigan University) and Dr. Susan Rowland (University of Queensland).
Summary of Lab Work
Clone Pick-up: We prepared 3ml cultures with ampicillin (100ug/ml) and chloramphenicol (20uq/ml). Colonies transformed with the plasmids pBAD33 and pET16b were picked and placed in the amp and chlor cultures respectively. They were then kept on a shaker overnight at 37C.
Glycerol stocks: for pET and pBAD33, 1.75mL of each culture were added to 0.5ml of LB+50% glycerol.
Minipreps of the pBAD33 and pET16b plasmids were conducted and gels were run to confirm their size.
PCRs were performed on pBAD, araC and lacI to add biobrick sites
3ml cultures of the E coli containing plasmids for GlnAp2, GlnG and the strain 3.3L*G  (has lacI/glnG knockout) were prepared. Plates with colonies were obtained from Dr Alex Ninfa (Michigan University).

Based on information that malate dehydrogenase and malate oxidase reactions had a much higher flux in the N2 fixing cells than in wild type, did a database search to find information about ∆G values for these reactions in order to potentially change their directionality in the model.
Malate dehydrogenase directionality could not be changed.  After some searching, found malate oxidase reaction had been deleted from major E. coli databases in the past year.  Determined that the reaction should be removed from the model.
- Experiments From Jun 24
New maximum biomass and maximum ATP
L_exp17
Obtained new maximum biomass and maximum ATP production values for all strains after removing the malate oxidase reaction from the model.
Values were significantly smaller than before, but are more logically consistent with the model.  Strain DH10B now had the highest biomass and ATP production, but only by .0002 mmol/(g cell dry weight X hour).
- Experiments From Jun 25
Ran FVA and began comparing flux ranges
L_exp18
Ran FVA and began comparing flux ranges at maximum biomass for N2 fixing WM1788 and WT WM1788. Looked for differences in pathways between the N2 fixing and wild type strains.  Also ran FVA for N2 fixing WM1788 at fixed biomass with maximum flavodoxin production, and N2 fixing WM1788 at mixed biomass without maximum flavodoxin (did not find many differences in flux ranges, as before).
- Experiments From Jun 26
Compared flux ranges between N2 fixing and WT WM1788 at a fixed max biomass
L_exp19
Compared flux ranges between N2 fixing and WT WM1788 at a fixed max biomass, looking particularly for reactions whose directionality changes between the N2 fixing and wild type strains.  Assembled a list of these reactions, how much they changed by, and the metabolic systems they belong to.  Next week will need to perform the same comparisons with both strains set at maximum biomass, in order to eliminate wide flux variations in the wild type WM1788 for reactions that contribute directly to biomass.
- Experiments From Jun 29
Continuing flux range comparisons
L_exp20
Compared directionality of fluxes for N2 fixing and wild type WM1788 at maximum biomass.  This eliminates potentially large changes in reactions which are not a component of biomass.
Major result
- Experiments From Jun 30
Finish flux range comparisons

The general public
To reach a wider audience, we collaborated with both Tel-Hai iGEM team and MadaTech - The Israel National Museum of Science, Technology and               Space, to participate in the “European Researchers' Night – 2016”, dedicated for science games.               In this special night, various museums and universities around Europe, including Israel, opened their               gates and invited people from all ages to see the exhibitions and meet scientists from all fields.
We set up a counter, named “playing with genes”, where we talked about synthetic biology, iGEM foundation and about our project. Aside               from the explanations, we offered the visitors a chance to play with genes ,               as we do in our lab. They took a circular ribbon (plasmid), digested it with scissors (restriction enzyme) and added               a new color ribbon (insert) to it. Afterwards, they transformed it into a balloon (bacteria), and inflated the balloon. In 10 minutes the visitors got a general idea about our work in the lab, and learned basic               concepts in biology.
The activity got a lot of attention, and many visitors got the chance to “play with genes”.
To try this activity, see our ""Do It Yourself"" booklet.
Seniors
As seniors have experienced life, we often come to hear their stories and get their advice.
We believe it is time to               give them something back, and grant them basic terms and tools from the world of science.
Understanding the concepts of life and expanding one's horizons is always positive, no matter the age.
As a finale to our educational project, we went to a retirement home in our neighborhood to meet with the seniors               staying there. They were eager to hear our lecture about synthetic biology, iGEM foundation and our project (also available in pptx format ). After the presentation they stayed and asked many questions.
We learned that even after 70 years the mind is creative and ambitious, sometimes even more than some 20 years old minds.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Finally, we started with the most important experiment for our GFP-Sporobeads, the fluorescence microscopy. We developed a sporulation protocol (for details see Protocol for enhancement of mature spore numbers ) that increases the rates of mature spores in our samples. The cells were fixed on agarose pads and investigated by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. While spores of the wild type only showed the known background fluorescence, all Sporobeads showed bright green fluorescence at the edge (on the surface) of the spores. Sporobeads from strain B 53 (containing the PcotYZ-cotZ-2aa-gfp-terminator construct) showed the highest fluorescence intensity"

Not only kids’ games but also a quiz on Tania solium and NTDs and tapeworm-diagnost-x postcards attracted visitors to our stand. With the help of a pipe cleaner toehold switch model, video sequences of the RNA triggered color change and schematic posters we could transfer our main message and project aims to our older guests.
Outcome
Lively discussions were not only enriching our visitors but also us! We got new inspirations for our project and lots of new input in terms of our scientific design, ways of financing our project and in communicating it to the public. We could fascinate new people from our project and its importance since almost none of our visitors had ever before heard of tapeworms! All in all we enjoyed the entire event, the lively discussions and could further strengthen our team spirit and even recruit new people to our team!
Science Slam
What is a Science Slam?
The concept of Science Slams was developed in 2006 by German writer Alex Dreppec in Darmstadt. In only ten minutes, young scientists should present their work to a non-scientific audience in an informative and - most importantly - an entertaining way. And how to be entertaining is entirely up to the presenter: giving the most absurd examples? Excellent! You can even make a whole performance out of it - as long as it does not exceed ten minutes.
Diagnost-x takes the stage at the 57th Science Slam in the SO36 in Berlin
To us of course, the concept of ""Science for everyone"" is really important - after all, we're living proof that anyone, PhD or not, can be part of scientific development! That’s why in March 2017 we took the stage and presented our project to an audience of 500 people through a mixed presentation of acting (the common prejudices of either student projects of failing NTD research projects) and presenting (how we actually perform and build up our project). It was tremendous for us to see how many people and kids enjoyed the event and asked us more specific and detailed questions after our performance on stage!

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," them to persist in the ecosystem. Classical examples of water contamination include tailings ponds, which contain byproducts from the bitumen extraction process of oil sands.  Although the water in tailings ponds is recycled to the extraction process, it is not treated to remove the toxins but kept contained in the ponds.   This creates a susceptibility toward contamination of surrounding areas as a result of these toxic compounds leaching into ground water sources, through spills or through the accidental release of waste products into the environment.
Figure 1: Environmental toxins contaminate air, water, and land masses.  These can consist of various compounds which could be divided into sulfur, nitrogen, carboxylic acid, and phenolic based compounds.  What can we do to solve this problem?
Synthetic Biology As A Platform For Remediation
The removal of these compounds is becoming increasingly important, especially as government bodies start to become more proactive, implementing stricter regulation.  Presently, there are a variety of solutions to remove these compounds from the environment by chemical means.  These methods involve the use of chemical agents or the physical removal of contaminated soil or water samples and storing these products in contained areas (Scott et al. 2005).  There is still however, no efficient, environmentally friendly mechanism for this to occur.  The real question is,
What do we need to remediate these toxins from the environment?
We require a method to be able to easily and economically detect where these toxins are and then look to remediating them.  Interestingly, microorganisms in the environment have evolved to be able to do both of these functions, responding to compounds in their environment and transforming them into food or other products.  Harnessing these natural mechanisms through an engineered synthetic biology thus becomes a viable option.
What if we could detect toxins in our environment using a synthetically engineered organism?  What if we could use a second organism to take these compounds and not only degrade them but convert them into useful compounds like hydrocarbons!
Introducing...
Figure 2: Introducing our dynamic duo FRED and OSCAR! This biosensor/bioreactor team is ready to detect and remediate toxins in the environment.  Not only can OSCAR break down toxic carboxylic acid containing compounds such as naphthenic acids, but we also demonstrated that he can turn them into functional hydrocarbons!
We would like to introduce FRED and OSCAR! Our dynamic biosensor/bioreactor duo is designed to detect toxic compounds such as the ones illustrated above in liquid waste and contaminated waters and to convert these toxic components into usable hydrocarbons.  FRED"

To demonstrate that our test would be cost effective as part of a screening programme we built this cost effectiveness model. To do this it combines cancer prevelance data, the sensitivity and specificity values of our test, our cost analysis data and treament cost data.
We used Tammemägi et al.’s model to calculate the probability of someone getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. It is more sensitive than the simplistic criteria used by the National Lung Screening Trial, and thus a better way of selecting individuals for screening. Tammemägi et al. showed their model would be more cost effective method as more cancers were detected per number screened as it missed fewer cases of cancer. [16]
Although Tammemägi’s model was for lung cancer as a whole, we assume the risk factors put you at equal risk of non-small cell and small-cell lung cancer. As the miRNAs on which our test  is based do not indicate small cell lung cancer, we have built the model around NSCLC. All other figures are NSCLC specific.
A quality adjusted life year (QALY) represents one year in perfect health. The ‘quality adjusted’ part accounts for the quality of life for that year, for example 2 years with a 0.6 quality of life score would be 1.2 QALYs. QALYs can be used to measure the benefit a treatment provides (if any). Treatments costing less than £20,000 per QALY are deemed cost effective by NICE. Treaments between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY may be decided to be cost effective by NICE if there is a high degree of certainty in the cost per QALY or when there are substantial benefits not captured in the cost per QALY figure.

Microfluidics Technology refers to the technology of controlling, operating and detecting complex fluids at the micro size. It is a newly interdisciplinary subject developed on the basis of microelectronics, micromechanics, bioengineering and nanotechnology. The rapid development of Microfluidics Technology in recent years has stricken revolutionary impacts in the fields of chemistry, medicine and life science. Biochips are regarded as an important tool for interpretating gene sequences in the Post-Genome Era and microfluidics chips are also known as ""lab-on-a-chip"", which use MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) technology for mixing the separated purification used in general laboratories and miniaturize devices such as enzyme reactions onto the chip for biochemical reactions, process control or analysis. The construction of this kind of chip is far more complex than microarray chips. According to ranges of its application, the chip can be further divided into three categories: sample pretreatment chip, reactive chip and analytical chip. They can perform complex and precise operations on microfluids (both liquid and gas), such as mixing and separation of microfluids, chemical reactions, microanalysis, etc. Besides, microfluidics chips also play a unique role in the screening of rare cells, the extraction and purification of MRNA, gene sequencing, single-cell analysis, and protein crystallization. They have been widely used in biotechnology research due to their lightweight, less sample or trial dose usage, fast reaction speed, large parallel processing and disposable features.
After the lecture, we conducted a questionnaire survey among participated students. From the feedback of more than 1,000 questionnaires collected, we can see that hundreds of students are full of interest in synthetic biology through this lecture, and students of different majors have made determination to take part in iGEM next year. (the questionnaire is followed)

We did so, and modified our design to base them on these switches which have reduced system leakage. They have shorter loops and no-refolding domain which helped increase sensitivity. Based on his feedback, we also increased the loop size for the 15b-5p switch design. This compensates for its long stem (which reduces on state activity), increasing dynamic range. With his help, our switches were optimized for their application as a diagnostic tool. Read more about our first series switches on our design page .

iGEM EPFL
After speaking to several experts who highlighted the importance of reducing false positives and false negatives (see applications section below), we began to explore ways to improve the design of our toehold switches. We spoke to iGEM EPFL - another team working with toehold switches. We explained the issues we had with homologous miRNAs that reduce the specificity of our sensors. iGEM EPFL suggested that we design our switches to utilize the mechanism employed in “Ribocomputing devices for sophisticated in vivo logic computation”. [1]
Based on this advice we designed a second series of toehold switches that can distinguish between miRNA sequences with one nucleotide differences. This improved our design , effectively reducing false positives, a crucial part of any diagnostic method.
With reduced cross-hybridisation, we could create an effective multiplexing assay: multiple switches that each regulate the production of a different reporter protein with a distinct emission peak. This would drastically increase the efficiency and scope of the test. As the second generation of switches can detect single base mismatch differences the sensitivity and specificity of the entire system would be improved.
Professor David Rubinsztein
Professor David Rubinsztein, Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics at Cambridge University, suggested that we use luciferase instead of GFP as our reporter protein. He explained that it may be able to provide more sensitive readings. We produced 4 composite parts as a result - with 2 being toehold switches containing luciferase. However, the constructs with luciferase were so long that, in combination with our inducible promoter, we were unable to insert them into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone in one ligation step. Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were"

We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.

If the system works, we will find red granules co-localized with green granules in cells under a fluorescence microscope.
Figure. 3A Structure of SUMO3 and SIM. Modification of proteins by SUMO are recognized by SUMO-interacting motifs termed SIMs. In natural process, polySUMOylation recruits distinct interaction partners, such as E3 ubiquitin ligases, that bind to polySUMO chains through tandem SIMs. SIMs bind to a surface patch between the α-helix and a β-sheet of the SUMO protein and extend the β-sheet of SUMO by one additional strand. the SIM either attaches as a parallel or an antiparallel strand to the SUMO β-sheet. Binding is primarily mediated by a stretch of four residues containing 3–4 hydrophobic amino acids (I, V, or L). This core interaction motif is a common property of all SIMs[4]. Figure. 3B Pattern diagram of SUMO-yeGFP and SIM-mCherry. YeGFP is fused to the C-terminus of SUMO and to the N-terminus of HOTag3, mCherry is fused to the C-terminus of SIM and to the N-terminus of HOTag6.

FKBP and Frb
The interaction between FKBP and Frb can be robustly induced by rapamycin. Rapamycin is a 31-membered macrolide antifungal antibiotic. It binds with high affinity (Kd=0.2 nM) to the 12-kDa FK506 binding protein (FKBP), as well as to a 100-amino acid domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), known as FKBP-rapamycin binding domain (Frb)[5]. Thus, we chose these two proteins as a pair of interaction modules and assembled them onto a yeast plasmid the same as in the construction of SUMO and SIM and introduced them into yeast. If we add rapamycin to the yeast, we will see red granules co-localized with green granules in cells under a fluorescence microscope. Synthetic organelles become real!

The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713 at the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession. Pavia was then ruled by the Austrians until 1796, when it was occupied by the French army under Napoleon. During this Austrian period the University was greatly supported by Maria Theresa of Austria and saw a great renaissance that eventually led to a second renaissance due to the presence of leading scientists and humanists like Alessandro Volta , Lazzaro Spallanzani , Camillo Golgi among others.
In 1815, it again passed under Austrian administration until the Second War of Italian Independence (1859) and the unification of Italy one year later.

Cloning: Designing Primers
Our plan is to generate 3 plasmids: one each with AGM1, NAG1, and UAP1. These we will Gibson assemble using the G-bits that Ellen ordered and a Gibson assembly kit sold by NEBiolabs. This part will require noprimers, so we can get started as soon as the DNA arrives.
The part that does require primers is after we have those three plasmids assembled (which will take, with luck, a week?). We want to use these plasmids to amplify the genes with overlapping sequences. These three genes (with overlapping sequences) we can then gibson assemble onto one larger plasmid. Don't know how Gibson assembly works? Refer to this website: https://2010.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/Gibson/Mechanism
How do we design primers with overlapping sequences? Recall that DNA open reading frames are read 5' --> 3'; in other words:
5' ATGnnnaaannncccnnnaaannncccnnnTAA 3'
and because DNA is double-stranded, the complementary sequence would be:
3' TACnnntttnnngggnnntttnnngggnnnATT 5'
When designing a primer, it is ABSOLUTELY VITAL that the 3' primer end has the identical sequence of the DNA you want to copy. This is the end the new nucleotides will be added to as the piece of DNA is synthesized. You need approximately 20 base pairs of your target sequence"
UCLouvain,2018,Team:UCLouvain#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," best solution to the problem.
Some African countries such as Congo, Benin and Togo and many others are subject each year to the rainy season. During this period the river water ruiselle into the rains and there is no drinking water. The epidemics of                   salmonellosis and cholera then occur.
At the moment, in a crisis, the Ministry of Health acts on two levels. First, to warn the population about the rules of hygiene and to make prevention, but this is not easy for the most remote villages. The second level of                   action is the sale of aquatabs, chlorine tablets that filter the water. Unfortunately, it is not always easy for people to use it. Each tablet filters 30 liters of water and makes it drinkable for twenty-four hours. However,                   there are some areas where people have not been to school and have difficulty assimilating this.
The solution would be to directly treat the water at its source so that we can help illiterate people and remote populations who do not have television as a means of prevention.
This was the best link we could made between the lab and the real life!
This emotional journey prompted us once more to work the best way possible to find an affordable and effective solution to this problem! We are all very concerned and this journey gave us the final motivation to keep working!                   This also why our team won’t dissolve after iGEM, we are committed to the problem and we have still a long way to together!"

Maaike van den Berg showed told us about the current policies on antibiotics and how she as a veterinarian uses the formularies. Also, she gave us insights in her tasks as a veterinarian and how she prescribes antibiotics based on the results of the diagnostic center. Diagnostic centers do pathogen detection and determine the sensitivity for antibiotic resistance subsequently. In two to three days, the results include the pathogens sensitivity for all potential antibiotics. As we only could detect one kind of antibiotic resistance, we decided to scope our detection method on the most common mastitis pathogen, which is Staphylococcus Aureus.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration, doesn’t significantly influence the production of mCherry. It means that the PsiR amount in the cell is constant. Our hypothesis is that this phenomenon is due to the pTacI promoter leakiness, leading to the steady production of PsiR. Since our biosensor is carried by a high copy plasmid ( pSB1C3 ), the number of lacO sites of pTacI is much bigger than the number of LacI molecules available in the cell. Even if this finding isn’t an issue for our experiments, this has to be considered.
This issue can be addressed by performing the characterization of this biosensor in our improved backbone, the pSB1C3_LacIq plasmid ( BBa_K2448038 ), that we designed for exactly this type of situation. pSB1C3_LacIq has a built-in LacI coding sequence under the control of a mutated version of its own natural promoter known as LacIq which leads to a 10-fold increase in LacI expression compared to the natural promoter.
Figure 12. Graph of the measure of florescence over fixed psicose concentration (1 mM) in the media with different concentrations of IPTG.
To summarize, at the end of this step, we have 7 different psicose biosensors well characterized. We know that the best of them is pPsiA Agrobacterium tumefaciens – PsiR Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( BBa_K2448025 ) for its dynamic range, perfect fold change and linearity. Fructose is proven to not influence the biosensor behavior. With 9h incubation post induction, this biosensor is ready to be used in a screening process to efficiently detect and quantify psicose in order to look for the best enzyme activity.

This conference is an annual event at Uppsala University that besides being a place for science enthusiasts to connect simultaneously, fulfills the purpose of communication training at the faculty of science and technology. Students are given an opportunity to give a presentation on a scientific subject in front of a larger audience and receive feedback on rhetorics. The challenge of this talk was adapting it to the diverse audience - students from different disciplines in different stages of their education. However, the public was bewildered by Wormbuster story. Special interest went to phage-display methodology as by coincidence announcement of this years Nobel prize winners in chemistry came the same morning and was pricing the development of the method.

Identifying dependencies
We looked at the probability graphs to determine which amino acid positions on the finger's helix interact with which bases.
Some interactions are fairly well estabilished, while others have been more recently proposed (See interaction map (Persikov 2011) )
To identify these interactions in our own data we looked at which helix positions varied most when you changed the bases. A more rigorous way to do this is to calculate the entropy change as you change the amino acids in each position.
xNN(Vary base 1): Amino acid 6 changes
NxN(Vary base 2): Amino acid 3 changes
NNx(Vary base 3): Amino acid -1 and 2(?) changes
Our program looks at dependencies between amino acids when generating sequences.
We decided on these amino acid dependencies, using both established data and patterns we saw in the OPEN data:
-1 and 2
2 and 1
6 and 5
Because there is not much data for 'CNN' and 'ANN' sequences (with 16 and 29 known fingers that bind to each triplet, respectively), we should use pseudocounts for these sequences, so that our frequency generator is not too biased toward probabilities that may not be significant.

Cultivation
The first trials to produce the Lbh1 - laccase from Bacillus halodurans (named BHAL) were performed in shaking flasks with various flask designs (from 100 mL to 1 L flasks, with and without baffles) and under several conditions. The varied parameters in our screening experiments were temperature (27 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C), concentration of chloramphenicol (20 - 170 µg mL-1), induction strategy (autoinduction and manual induction with 0,1 % rhamnose) and cultivation time (6 to 24 h). Furthermore cultivation was performed with and without addition of 0.25 mM CuCl2 to provide a sufficient amount of copper, which is needed for the active center of the laccase. E.coli KRX was not able to produce active BHAL under the tested conditions, therefore another chassis was chosen. For further cultivations E. coli Rosetta-Gami 2 was transformed with BBa_K863012, because of its ability to translate rare codons. Finally BHAL was produced under the following conditions:
flask design: shaking flask without baffles
medium: LB-Medium
antibiotics: 60 µg mL-1 chloramphenicol and 300 µg mL-1 ampicillin
temperature: 37 °C
cultivation time: 24 h
Purification
The cells were harvested and resuspended in Ni-NTA-equilibration buffer, mechanically lysed by sonification and centrifuged. After preparing the cell paste the BHAL laccase could not be purified with the 15 mL Ni-NTA column, because the column was not available. For this reason a small scale purification (6 mL) of the supernatant of the lysate was"

Current clinically-relevant pathogens have not been seen to exhibit resistance against our antimicrobial proteins of choice. Art-175 has been experimentally shown to be not susceptible to resistance development, likely because it targets the structural element of the bacterial cell wall that is highly conserved across species and difficult to mutate [ 8 ]. The mechanism by which Microcin S exerts antimicrobial activity is still currently unknown, but no bacterial strains except for the original strain of probiotic E. coli which produces Microcin S has been shown to be resistant to it thus far [ 9 ].
Secreting the Proteins
The proven secretion of folded, functional proteins across both bacterial cell membranes is a challenge for present day microbiologists. Our solution requires that we can export DspB, DNase, Art-175 and MccS out of the expression host and into the local biofilm environment. To achieve this, signal sequences are fused to the enzymes to target them for export through natural E. coli secretion pathways. Using this mechanism we can direct our anti-biofilm and antimicrobial agents at a biofilm infected surface as they are being produced.
DsbA
DsbA is a oxidoreductase protein found predominantly in Gram-negative bacteria, which functions as a protein-folding factor [ 19, 20 ]. The 2-19 peptide sequence of DsbA is a signal sequence that can direct passenger proteins for co-translational export via the signal recognition particle pathway [ 21, 22 ]. It has recently been shown that the DsbA signal sequence is capable of mediating passenger protein secretion under a selection of different induction temperatures [ 23 ].

YebF
YebF is a 13kDa protein of unknown function that is perhaps the only protein that has been conclusively documented to be secreted into the extracellular medium by a laboratory E. coli strain. At the N-terminus, YebF has a 2.2 kDa sec-leader sequence which mediates its translocation through the bacterial inner membrane via the Sec pathway, and is cleaved upon translocation into the periplasm to give the 10.8 kDa ""mature"" form [ 24 ].

The teams from NYU Abu Dhabi, REC-Chennai, VIT, Macquarie University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Saint Joseph were a part of the conference call organised by NYU on the fifteenth of September. Once all the teams had joined and checked their connectivity, the rules of the conference call were stated by NYU. The teams were to elaborate on their projects while simultaneously playing their presentations at the end of which each team was asked questions by the others.
Team Macquarie explained their project that involved producing chlorophyll induced vesicles in a modified E. coli. As they explained their project and the uses of a vesicle in a cell, we understood the potential impact that their project could have in synthetic biology. VIT Vellore introduced to us their proposal that aimed to bring a reduction in ocean acidification. NYU Abu Dhabi explained to us their concept of a chip that could detect food borne pathogens and the imperative need for food safety. The high school students from Saint Joseph were working to tackle a problem in the fishery industry of Turkey by introducing a bacteriophage aimed at the lysis of pathogens in fish. Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has been working on a revolutionary technique to produce electricity from degraded plastic. We explained our project and the need for an alternate system from the conventional technique used. We were asked about out HP practises as we were working on a highly technical project.
It was a wonderful opportunity to be a part of the conference call and the projects that were explained to us showed scientific brilliance. We thank NYU-Abu Dhabi for this wonderful opportunity.
