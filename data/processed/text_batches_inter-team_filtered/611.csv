BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and testing. COFCO, one of the world's top                         500 companies with a good reputation in the international grain and oil food market, became our                         first interviewee. The meeting had three parts. Firstly, we introduced our project to the                         COFCO. Then, they asked us some questions about the project. After that, we asked them about                         the market of current antioxidant products. Through communication, we learned that the sales of                         anti-oxidant products are on the rise, and more and more people are pursuing anti-oxidant and                         anti-aging products. Therefore, we have more reasons to believe that our project has a good                         application prospect in the market. We would do our best to make the project more reasonable                         and more beneficial to the world.
Wehand-bio
In order to figure out what we can do by our system, we visited Wehand-bio, a leading                         innovative pharmaceutical company in Beijing. During the meeting, we gave a brief introduction                         of our design to show the idea of our living antioxidant detection device, and they talked                         about their current research. After the discussion, we found that there is another application                         of antioxidants which is used in medicines. As they told us, almost all of the medicines would use antioxidants to prevent oxidation of medicines. So our system could also be applied in                         pharmaceutical production. What’s more, they offered us a good idea about testing whether the                         natural antioxidant products will deteriorate in quality over time. As you can see, this                         discussion had let us take a deeper look at how to use our system more widely.

Phage Genome Annotation
After having a core genome we want to check how many protein-coding genes we can find in the genome.          Two of the programs widely used in the field are glimmer and genemark.
Since genermark has been shown to perform better in benchmark tests, we used this tool for the          genome annotation. We ran the tool on the assembled genome in FASTA format generating a gene annotation file          (gff3) for the genome highlighting all coding sequences.                  For easier and more compact usage, we transformed the genome in fasta format with the annotation in gff3          into the embl flat file format.
In conclusion, we can describe the assembled genomes as follows:

It can be seen that the number of detected genes using genemark is higher than the number of the genes          in the reference. This is most likely due to incorrectly sequenced bases leading to an early stop codon.          More sophisticated polishing steps or higher quality Illumina sequencing reads could possibly avoid this.

This indicates that the laccases are able to degrade the bromophenol blue which is a positive result. (When performing this experiment the frameshift in the HlyA-tag had not yet been discovered and therefore the result in section number 2 is not relevant.)
Figure 8: Bromophenol blue assay. This composite image contains 4 separate plates, restreaked with a single colony of dioxygenase with BBa_J23110 promoter (1, negative control), CueO with BBa_J23110 promoter and Hlya tag (2) CotA with BBa_J23110 promoter (3) and CueO with BBa_J23110 promoter (4)
Removal of the HlyA-tag from ModLac
To ensure that the fused HlyA tag did not affect the enzymatic activity of the laccase, the HlyA tag was removed before characterization of the modified laccase. This was done by digesting with the restriction enzyme Kpn1, ligating it together and PCR amplifying the segments with VF2 and VR primers. This resulted in two main segments: the ModLac without tag and the ModLac re-ligated with the HlyA tag. To separate these two segments, the PCR product was run on an agarose gel, and the shorter segment was extracted from the gel.
Purification of ModLac and CueO (Ecol)
The resulting chromatograms of the IMAC purifications of ModLac and CueO (Ecol) can be seen below in Figure 9 and 10.

BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#Questions and answers_-_-_TEXT.html," time of two promoters used in our basic circuits is half an hour, according to our experiments. More importantly, by error-prone PCR, we selected plenty of promoters which have different pH responsive range and various reaction time. Therefore, we can choose different promoters relying on different regulation needs. Besides, if the regulation circuits cannot quickly react to the changes, we still have resistance system which can maintain the homeostasis of bacteria. Thus the bacteria can have an enough time to sense the change and make regulation circuits function.
Q: Have you ever considered the issues related to biosafety? Do pH Controller need suicide device?
A: Yes we considered the concern for biosafety. Two central aspects of our project may cause biosafety concerns. The first is whether the acid and alkali produced by bacteria are harmful and the second is where the pH Controller will be ‘placed’. For the first concern, D-Lactate produced by ldhA is toxic for human. But we just use it for our basic verification and test the function of our design. Its use will depends on the real fermentation situation since D-Lactate is also an important product in fermentation. What’s more, we have already found functional genes which can produce harmless L-Lactate. Except D-Lactate, most of our functional acid and alkali we used is not harmful to human, and some of them are salutary for us human beings. As for the second concern, we can ‘place’ our pH Controller in engineering strains as well as another kind of strains for co-fermentation or immobilization. In other words, where the pH Controller function is decided by the fermentation situations and regulation needs. If it is used for co-fermentation, we may apply suicide device."

You can see clearly that the cost of gluten-free food is significantly higher for all products checked. Tens of thousands of people with celiac disease carry the burden of disease both in the medical and economic terms. The government’s attitude to this situation must change. Government ministries are ignoring the needs of celiac patients and therefore it is necessary to change the laws.
Due to the background described above, we decided to take action and contact the Children's Rights Committee of the Parliament to change the status quo. As part of our appeal to the Israeli parliament, the Igem Team was invited to a general assembly at the Parliament. The meeting at the general assembly helped propose a bill by a MP who is a celiac sufferer, and is working to improve the attitude towards celiac sufferers by lowering gluten-free food prices. As part of this visit, we met with the Israeli Minister of Education and discussed the issue of students with celiac disease in the country and the ability to help them improve their feeling at school during meal times.
ACTIONS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE DISEASE AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE LAW AMONG CELIAC PATIENTS
Activity Day at ""Meginim"" Primary School 
On Monday, the 8/6 group Alergln invaded combustion. The activity included the subject of food allergies, particularly gluten sensitivity (celiac disease). The school principal, a celiac patient herself opened the day and explained about herself as a celiac patient, and about the society and government ignoring the needs of celiac disease patients as health disabled.
After that we moved to the classrooms with an opening game related to allergies. We gave an overview of allergies in general and in particular for gluten sensitivity. Then the children watched a presentation and learned new things from it, we held a competition between classes. The competition included relay races with challenging tasks and questions on the subject of celiac disease.
At the end of the day, the Team Alergln students posed for pictures with the students and the photo was published in the local newspaper.
Scouts Summer camp Activity
On Tuesday, 21/7/2015 the Team went to the Scouts Summer Camp. Students took fourth-grade students from around the city for a day of fun and enjoyable activities which were engaged in celiac disease (gluten sensitivity).
The activity was based on the theme that the Team is developing a product as part of the Igem competition. In the beginning our group of Team members explained to the students the subject of activity.
Presenting the topic included explaining the disease and its symptoms. As activities progressed"

    September 2, 2016, we went to Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University to participate in 2016 CCiC exchange summit.
    CCiC (Central China iGEM Consortium) is a national iGEM exchange held by domestic universities. Its purpose is to promote the exchange and cooperation between the participating teams ,and take the opportunity to further promote the synthesis of biology to domestic colleges and universities. The CCiC was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University. More than 30 iGEM teams, including Peking University, Tianjin University, Zhejiang University and National University of Defense Technology, participated in this exchange. The event was held just like the iGEM Giant Jamboree which provided a platform for the participants to participate in the research. It focused on the topics of lectures, poster presentations and team-to-team exchanges.
    During the exchange, the iGEM's team members of our university and other iGEM teams conducted the extensive and in-depth exchanges, and carefully studied other teams in team management, project creation, experiment development, mathematical modeling, project packaging, English speech, PPT and poster and other aspects of mature experience.
    On the morning of September 4th, our team presented this year's project - ""Blue Leaf"". We introduced specifically the background of the project, the overview of the project, the experimental process and the results of the project. In the Q & A session, the judges and other teams confirmed the NWPU progressing in the implementation of the project, the experimental results and PPT presentation and other aspects of the work. They also offered valuable suggestions on the overall packaging of the project and the next step experimental ideas.

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Modeling
Granzyme B (GzmB) activity is elevated during inflammation, which can lead to excess cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in human tissue. Aside from causing damage to healthy tissues, this also exacerbates chronic inflammatory conditions, which keeps producing more GzmB and creates a vicious cycle. Our project aims to selectively inhibit GzmB in the ECM in order to prevent damage during chronic inflammation. Since we do not have the means of working with GzmB and directly testing its interactions in human test subjects, we predicted these interactions using mathematical models and data from the literature.
The Hill equation is used to model the interaction between a ligand and its binding partner, a macromolecule/enzyme – in our case, how well a GzmB inhibitor binds to GzmB. It is a function of free ligand concentration, and it returns the fraction of macromolecules that are bound. Two constants are involved in this equation: the dissociation"

Ligations were transformed into 5-alpha resulting in white colonies after overnight growth indicating a successful cloning procedure. Different colonies were picked and inoculated for overnight growth and miniprep.

Well, it’s time for the start of a new journey of a new IGEM team. IGEM seemed to have magic power to attract a number of students to participate in it. At the beginning of November, 2011, with the guidance of some members from the precedent team, 18 juniors stood out of 80 applicants to become the vanguard of the new team. Also at the same time, the new journey started.
During the November, 2011, members of the team were divided into three groups each of which is guided by one group leader, respectively. And every week each group was expected to meet 2-3 times to view and discuss the outstanding works of previous IGEM competitions. And at the end of week, a feast full of innovative ideas and interesting opinions brought by each group to all the team members. Delving into various excellent ideas and works from other universities and colleges, we began to have a more intensive understanding of IGEM and embarked on our own project.
At the beginning of December, 2011, all of three groups had their origin but undeveloped ideas and introduced their ideas to all the members at the team meeting. Of course, we never stopped there despite of the coming of the final examinations of the semester. At the end of the semester, January, each group determined their project and started to collect information and consult relevant documents to device their ways to achieve their targets during winter vacation.
Although during winter vacation, members of the team got separate and celebrated festivals with their family at their homes, they still tried to communicate with each other online. Everyday, new information are provided and new progress is made. And thanks to this long vacation, members do not only have a good rest but also develop their ideas.

Eternal youth? End of diseases on Earth? Designing babies on demand?
It is what comes to mind when we hear about CRISPR-Cas9. But what it is really hiding behind this revolutionary technique?
What is CRISPR-Cas9?
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technique which has revolutionized the world of biology these last months. It all started in 2012 when Feng ZHANG of Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University and Jennifer DOUDNA in collaboration with Emmanuelle CHARPENTIER of the University of California developed this system leading to a new era. This unique method offers an array of possibilities that goes beyond the dreams of both the most internationally renowned scientists that lead them to dream and non-scientists.
Originally, this system was a bacterial defence mechanism against virus attacks. Viruses attack bacteria by injecting their own genome into the bacterial one. Most of the time, bacteria are too weak to resist against these attacks, except when they possess a very efficient anti-viral system called CRISPR. In this case, the virus's genome is kept by the bacterial genome and bacteria keep a part of the foreign DNA in the CRISPR locus of its own genome. If the virus should attack the bacteria again, the CRISPR locus is transcribed, creating the pre-­crRNA which will be cleaved within the repeated sequences and free several crRNAs. Those crRNAs hybridize with tracrRNAs which recruits the Cas9 nuclease. The guide RNA recognizes its complementary sequence, as well as the PAM pattern in the foreign DNA. This recognition induces cleavage of the DNA, and repair mechanisms fill in the gaps left by this cleavage.
The PAM pattern is at the 3’end of the virus genome. Without this PAM sequence, there cannot be cleavage of the DNA. This system keeps the Cas9 nuclease from cleaving the CRISPR locus. In order to use this system in other organisms than bacteria, scientists had the idea to combine the crRNA and the tracrRNA into a single RNA called single"

After several years of being a part of iGEM I have come to the realization that I have grown addicted to it. This makes perfect sense with why I first joined iGEM. The idea that synthetic biology could help me kick my other addictions of smoking and caffeine consumption inspired me to work ever harder on our teams projects each year and helping to improve the synthetic biology field overall. Even though the “how” synthetic biology would relieve me of my addictions was not known at the time, and still isn’t, I have forever been convinced that the field has the power to do great things! I hope that my contribution to this year’s University of Lethbridge iGEM team has a lasting impact on science and society as my contributions to iGEM for six years has now become a new addiction.
Chris Isaac
I joined iGEM in 2012 to take a chance on something new. Since then, I’ve had the pleasure of continuing to participate, mentor, and explore new ideas in synthetic biology. The best part of iGEM is the ability to engage in a meaningful multidisciplinary project and develop solutions to emerging challenges. In the future, I want to be able to bridge the worlds synthetic biology and public policy to make sure that we do the most good possible at the least cost.
Zak Stinson
Hey, I'm Zak, and I am an iGEMmer. I thought I was almost free of my fascination with genetic technologies when I transferred to the neuroscience program at the U of L in 2011 from biology at the U of R, but I lapsed right back when I learned that iGEM existed. I thought I had refocused when I began doing behavioural experiments with rats, but immediately developed and began an M.Sc. project designing a system for reporting gene activity in the brains of live animals. Once I’ve completed my M.Sc. in neuroscience in the coming year, I will likely continue to design synthetic biology projects in my future career as I am dangerously hooked. So I guess I'll talk to you all next year!

Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such"

Once the medium was completely absorbed by the agar (to avoid UV absorption by medium), cells were irradiated inside the TORDEITOR (the device we specially designed for this experiment) with different amounts of UV light (lambda=254 nm). To fine tune UV dose, we used a shutter (similar to those used in cameras, click here to see an explicative video) able to produce UV pulses of less than 1 second of duration. After that, cells were harvested from the agar plate with SOC medium supplemented with ampicillin. Finally, OD and fluorescence intensity were measured at different times. An aliquot of the same culture that was not irradiated was used as control.
As we can see in the graph below, UV exposure does induce the expression of ZsGreen1. Furthermore, longer exposures result in higher levels of protein expression (higher fluorescence intensity was observed, as expected according to the molecular mechanism of lexA promoter), although lethal effects were observed when doses about 5 seconds were applied.
Figure 10. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of cultures that were subjected to UV exposures of different duration in comparison to a control culture (not exposed). Measures were taken 70 min after the exposure.
Figure 11. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of cultures that were subjected to UV exposures of different duration in comparison to a control culture (not exposed). Measures were taken 90 min after the exposure.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," This nutrient-rich layer has to be able to be easily replaced by a new nutrient layer. Just like we argued for the cell layer in the patch, handling of this layer should be made easy by its thickness to enable replacement. Therefore we chose to use a fixed thickness of 1 mm of this layer.
Parameters
Using literature, calculations and results from previous models and experiments, we came up with parameters and variable ranges for our simulation in COMSOL, which can be found in table 1 and 2 respectively.
Table 1: Parameters used for the 3D model in COMSOL Multiphysics.
Calculation 1
To decide what nutrient source we would use, we decided to look at commonly used nutrient sources for the bacteria we use in our hydrogel: E. coli. For general laboratorial growth of E. coli often Lysogeny broth (LB) medium is used, so we decided to take this nutrient rich medium as a first source to feed our bacteria.
The LB we use in the lab of our university is called ‘LB Broth (Miller)’ from Sigma-Aldrich. As stated on their website, this type of LB consists of 10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L NaCl and 5 g/L yeast extract. (8) We neglected the mass of NaCl, since NaCl is not that important to the total uptake of nutrients that is used to produce lysostaphin. Tryptone is a mixture composed of amino acids (AAs) and longer peptides. (9) Yeast extract is not much different since it consists of various growth factors, sources of sulfur and vitamin B complex, but mainly peptides and AAs since yeast extract is mainly produced by digestion of proteins by proteases. (10) Because both tryptone and yeast extract are largely amino acids and peptides we treated them as if they were only AAs and peptides. We then assumed that the mass ratio single AAs versus oligopeptides was 50/50. The average molecular weight for a single amino acid was calculated by averaging molecular weights of the twenty most common AAs in nature as shown in table 2. Values for molecular weight of amino acids were obtained through the database of the National Centre of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) called PubChem Compound.
Table 2: Amino acids with their respective molecular weights in gram per mol.
For the oligopeptides we determined the average oligopeptide MW by multiplying the average oligopeptide length of 13 (2 to 25 AAs) by the calculated average MW of a single amino acid, resulting"

Based on these results, we conclude that both the cheZ expression cassette including a J23100 promoter and the cassette including a J23113 promoter were able to restore motility in a cheZ mutant. It is not clear if an expression cassette containing J23114 was able to achieve the same result. Further experiments should be performed to determine this.
The expression cassette including the Anderson promoter J23100 swarmed to a greater extent than the cassette including the Anderson promoter J23113. This was to be expected, as J23100 is a stronger promoter than J23113. The strain containing the expression cassette including J23100 swarmed to a smaller extent than the positive control, however, which is surprising, given the fact that J23100 is such a strong promoter.
This could be caused by the fact that the number of cells that was applied during inoculation was not normalized by growing appropriate cultures to mid-log phase. The positive control might simply show more swarming, because of a higher cell count. Including the protocol for growth in further tests could show if this is the case.
Wolfe and Howard [4] give another possible explanation. They state that cells that tumble infrequently may move slower on agar plates, as they alter their direction only slowly after running into an agar molecule. A cheZ expression level that is high might in this way restrain swarming, just like a low expression might hinder it. Coupling more Anderson promoters in cheZ expression cassettes, might help find the optimal promoter strength for swarming.

We supported iGEM teams Evry and Ionis-Paris, by attending their European iGEM mini Jamboree in Paris. This big pool of European teams that we all helped create was an amazing opportunity to exchange project ideas, and prepare for Boston. We also joined the Westminster team in their UK meet up in London. In addition, we helped Warwick at their open day at University by visiting them, and providing an activities stall.
We joined team Tel Hai (Israel) in their 65 Roses campaign to raise awareness of Cystic Fibrosis. We also contributed to the “Our iGEM experience” video by TecCEM, along with 4 other countries. We also completed three surveys for teams Aachen, Paris-Saclay, and Groningen.

Integrated Practices Page
The team leaned towards Microbiology, leading us to decide on a project focused on mitigating the problem of antibiotic resistance. We first consulted Dr. Milton Wainwright on his opinions concerning our project. We then interviewed a politics lecturer to gain better understanding of how many stakeholders were involved in this complex matter. Moreover, during the early steps of designing a device prototype, the different end users were explored by approaching hospitals, doctors, patients, and government bodies.
The team also organised two mini iGEM competitions for 17-18 year-old students. In these mini-competitions the students were invited to a science fair where we presented posters of previous iGEM projects."
Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#PolicyPractices#Economics_-_-_TEXT.html," businesses have to be self-financing. In general, these factors are making technical equipment for labs really expensive, and therefore unaffordable for low-budget instutions.
One of the world's biggest producers of laboratory products is Thermo Fisher Scientific . They also offer photometers and other equipment. The image on the left side shows all costs and operating expenses listed in the Annual Report 2013 from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
We follow a strategy to circumvent unnecessary costs for customers by realizing a social vision. In accordance with the principle of open source including both open hardware and open software, information where to get the necessary components, quantities, step-by-step technical construction manuals and circuit diagrams are published online for free. Potential customers can follow our provided instructions and acquire information from our Engineering page . Therefore, our profit is not of financial nature but is instead based on recognition and on motivating other iGEM teams and companies to spread the idea of open hardware, too. In accordance with the motto ""Do It Yourself!"" (DIY) we offer low-budget versions through reducing costs at as many points as possible, except for the basic costs for material. Customers with a little technical dexterity, motivation to try something new and who are keen to experiment can follow our step-by-step construction manual to create their own custom-made devices.
Social vision as economical strategy for creating access to low-budget technical equipment.
To make our product more user-friendly, we considered offering device kits. When offering kits customers do not have to order a lot of separate device parts from different suppliers. However, this introduces the disadvantage of a loss of flexibility. Yet it is very important to have the opportunity to modify the devices, for example, by choosing alternative parts or including add-ons, because research requiring novel techniques advances quickly in the natural sciences. With our concept, improvements and adjustments are thus immediately realizable.
Lastly, we want to mention that our vision is limited because it is incompatible with capitalism which rules the global market. Generally, companies are profit oriented and follow a different economical strategy than our iGEM team. As non-profit concept, our idea is therefore limited to a group of customers with lower budgets.
WatsOn
The measurement device WatsOn for our 2D biosensor has been designed according to our social vision. So far, we have not found comparable devices on the market. Here, we definitely take a pioneer role. Following our DIY concept, you can create your own WatsOn for just $310 using the given construction manual . All components for putting a WatsOn together are easily available all over the world using the following links.

Finally, we also elaborate on how we could keep our bacterium from spreading if it would eventually be commercialised and released into the environment . As well as which specific mechanisms have we implemented to keep our bacteria contained , with for instance, a 'kill switch' . We have also written an ethical evaluation of our system concerning certain safety issues.

Excelling on the world stage
Learning from the best – that’s exactly what a group of research-focused students is doing at the University of Lethbridge.
Members of the U of L’s International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team are part of a phenomenon that began 10 years ago as a course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Today, the annual iGEM contest is the world’s leading undergraduate synthetic biology competition – and each year, U of L students regularly rank among the top iGEM teams worldwide.
University of Lethbridge iGEM students Isaac Ward, Mackenzie Coatham, Harland Brandon and Erin Kelly are among the best young researchers in the world. Courtesy of University of Lethbridge Adancement.
An emerging field, synthetic biology sees cells, enzymes and metabolic pathways as more than biological entities; they’re sophisticated parts that can be programmed like machines to perform specific activities. As a result, research in synthetic biology is opening up remarkable possibilities in such sectors as agriculture, pharmaceutical, medical diagnostics, clean energy and resource extraction. In 2011, for example, U of L students developed a petrochemical-eating bacteria that could be used to help clean up water in tailings ponds, a discovery that placed the University’s iGEM team among the top 16 competitors in the world, alongside students from Harvard University, MIT, the University of Washington and Johns Hopkins University.
This October, the U of L’s iGEM team once again demonstrated its strong innovation abilities. In addition to creating a bioengineering part that works like a zip drive, compressing genetic information, the team developed software that rapidly determines what DNA sequences are compatible to compress together. These inventions, which will allow future bioengineers more flexibility in their research, captured top prize in the 2013 North American iGEM Regional Jamboree held in Toronto.

Induction time to achieve 42ºC state stability
First, we wanted to determine the 42ºC induction time necessary to make the state change from ""IPTG state"" to ""42ºC state"" stable (see the note at the end of the page). For this purpose we induced the state change of a culture previously established in the IPTG state by heat shock at 42ºC during different times: 2h, 3h, 4h and the whole assay (7h aprox.). After heat shocking, bacteria were grown at 30ºC. Red and green fluorescence levels were measured during 7 hours, including the heat shock time. The results are shown in figure 5. This assay was performed using a MC4100 E. coli strain.
Figure 5. Relative fluorescent level of the improved flip flop with different temperature inductions time lapses. These heat shocks start at minute zero and finish at the point indicated by the arrows. In figure 1D, this heat shock is maintained during the whole experiment. It can be seen that 2 and 3 hours heatshock is not enough to maintain the 42ºC state stability, as predicted by the mathematic models. However, we can see that a 4-hour induction shows a higher stability of this state.
42ºC state stability
In order to compare the 42ºC state stability of the basic and improved flip-flop, this state was induced by harvesting bacteria cultures at 42ºC during 11 hours. This long incubation period was used to effectively achieve the cultures in the 42ºC state at the beginning of the measurements.  At the “Induction Stop” point, of the graphics below (Figure 6), the cultures of basic and improved flip-flop"

As a result nothing came out of APBS extension. Even worse we were going for the IMD extension of ePMV for calculating the molecular interactions, but that was not released which we just found out this week.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
Turns out by re-configuring the light source immediately after importing .pdb files into Maya, the ribbon and atom models will render beautifully. Unfortunately this trick doesn't work for the surface models. Nonetheless we generated some really high definition pictures (8192*8192 pixels with 220 pixels/inch) for the website. At the same time Justin has been transferred to work on Maya with us. I taught him everything I knew, from creating simple objects to do basic dynamics.
Rai asked me to do some modelling on β-lactamase, which will likely be the reporter in our system. What she wants to get out of this study is to understand, when given two different concentrations of substrates, at what time will their differences be largest such that we can tell them apart. Unfortunately β-lactamase is very fast enzyme and that reaction mechanism has not been studied in detail. Then I remembered what my chemical engineering professor taught me: when reaction is fast, model mass transfer. For our lateral flow strip system, the substance will spend most of its time diffusing before react with β-lactamse, whose reaction will be rapid. Then by timing when the reaction occurs we have a measurement of the diffusion and hence will tell us how much substance was there initially.
Week 14: July 29 - August 2
Cesar asked us (Justin and I) to divide up our work. So I was working on the quantitative modelling while he worked on the qualitative modelling. The task I was asked to do was to figure out how to simulate TALE binding to DNA, according to laws of physics. We were hoping for using the electrostatics plug-in and derive the reactions from Brownian motion, but I had no luck with any of these. We are still working to understand how Maya will perform for dynamic models. We are uncertain if Maya is the best tool to achieve our vision for quantitative modelling.
Justin has made good progress with animating TALE binding to DNA without any physics. He did the most of the work of creating two animations while I rendered them into .avi files. Together we now understand the entire process from importing .pdb files to output animations to .avi files; we"

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Application#Diagnosis Treatment_-_-_TEXT.html," application we decided to create a specialized nasal spray. The general functionality is the same as for any common nasal spray for medical applications, so no pre-experience is needed to use our BaKillus Spray. The characteristic of Bacillus subtilis to build heat resistant spores, that can be stored dryly gives the spray a very high life period as long as the spores are not activated (learn more about Bacillus subtilis ). To make sure the BaKillus spores do not get activated too early we developed an additional chamber associated to the pump mechanism. This chamber in the shape of an open ring (Fig. 1) will be sealed by a two component lamination. One layer of plastics will tighten the chamber while a cellulose layer will add stability and make the lamination perforable. BaKillus spores will be enclosed within the chamber. In the assembled product  On the first pumping, the lamination will be perforated by being pushed onto the cutting edge ring. The spores will become free and mix into the second chamber below. Inside this chamber, sterile defined media as well as an oxygen-enriched atmosphere will be presented to the spores. Application of the activated BaKillus spray to the nostrils will be identical to common nasal sprays.
Usage of the BaKillus Spray is described below:
Start spore activation by pushing down the pumping mechanism once to break the lamination seal.
Mix the spores and the medium by shaking vigorously.
Incubate at 37 °C for 2 hours to activate the spores to the BaKillus cells.
Apply BaKillus Spray to each nostril every 2 hours. Reactivated Spores can be used for 20 hours before they will yield useless.
Recycle the Nasal Spray.
For the future we emphasize a rent-and-return system for the nasal spray itself in combination with a more dispersed distributional network. For more information about future application scenarios please visit our Collaboration with the Rathenau Institute page.
For a second application, using a similar principle we invite you to visit our collaboration partner's Wiki from Groningen about the Lacto Aid System.
Diagnosis
Pathogen-identification diagnostic tool:
Problem:
Current tests to identify S. aureus are PCR-based detections of pathogene-specific genes. Theoretically, a PCR result could be obtained within three hours, whereas it takes around seven hours in practice. However, PCR-based methods are error-prone. Therefore, verification by a molecular biological test is recommended. Current biological tests (e.g. coagulase) require a time-consuming (18-"
Jilin_China,2018,Team:Jilin China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," approximately linearly with increasing temperature. This is consistent with our own measurement. The results are vital to us because we need to use this positive control when we process the measurement data of each thermosensor. We are very grateful to Fudan-CHINA for the experiment, which is helpful for us to carry out the follow-up experiments and the data processing.
Here is the link to the wiki of Fudan-CHINA.
2.NPU-China
We cooperated with NPU-China this year, a team from Northwestern Polytechnical University in China.
Our team helped NPU-China characterized two parts because their team was short of staff to characterize all parts. The two parts are coding sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial genome. The cob codes cytochrome oxidase b which is the composition of the electron transport chain. And the introns of cob were all deleted. The var1 codes ribosomal protein. We helped them measure the growth curve to verify if the two parts are toxic to cells.
Figure 3. The figure’s horizontal axis represents the time, and the vertical axis represents OD value. The blue line is the growth curve of Blank, the orange line is the growth curve of cob and the gray line is the growth curve of var1.
As the results shows, the two genes almost don’t have influence on bacterial growth. The result indicated that the two genes are not toxic to cells.
NPU-China also helped us a lot. We designed hundreds of RNA-based thermosensors this year. We need to get their melting temperature, intensity and sensitivity. We have measured some heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors by ourselves. Nevertheless, we know that at different laboratories and under different experimental conditions, the experimental results could differ. To ensure the accuracy of our experimental results, we sent 5 samples to NPU-China. They helped us measure sfGFP expression at different temperatures. (The 5 samples: RT1-4, RT1-33, K2541003, K2541004, K2541010 ).
Figure 4. The bar colors blue, orange and gray represent the temperatures 31, 35 and 39°C, respectively. The height of the bars corresponds to the normalized fluorescence.
As shown in figure 4, the fluorescence intensity of K2541003, K2541004 and K2541010 increase with elevated temperatures. While the fluorescence intensity of RT1-4 and RT1-33 don’t increase with elevated temperatures. This is consistent with our own measurement results (figure 5).

Reporter Plasmids
Our reporter plasmids were designed with the iGem’s BioBrick system. The plasmid pSB4A5 and pSB4K5 carrying the Amp and Kan resistance gene. A low copy ORI and the GFP or RFP gene where inserted. (See Experimental section)
Killer Plasmids
Our two plasmids - one targeting the RFP gene, one targeting the Ampicillin gene - where designed from the mobilizable pK18mob plasmid (carrying the KanR gene), received from the C.E.N. The Cas9 gene (and promoter and terminator) was             cutted and inserted in this pK18mob plasmid, followed by an insertion of a synthetic cassette containing a sgRNA (Crispr/Cas9 system), targeting the RFP gene and the Ampicillin resistance gene.
Killer Plasmid : design and construction
Design
We received a mobilizable plasmid (pK18mob) carrying Kanamycin resistance gene and OriT. Our purpose in to combine its conjugative capabilities with the Crispr/Cas9 system, so the final killer plasmid will be able to conjugate and to cut             a target gene (the RFP gene and Ampicillin resistance gene). So, from the pK18mob, we have inserted the Crispr/Cas9 system : the Cas9 gene (with its promoter and terminator), and a synthetic single guide RNA.             We have design two single guide RNA, to target the RFP gene and the Ampicillin resistance gene by Crispr/Cas9 system. The sgRNA sequence was design in Benchling, and carry : cut/ligation sites at extremities, promoter pJ23119, the guide             RNA and the terminator. Three DAM site (GATC) was cleaned, to avoid methylation. This sequence was synthetized by IDT.

2 Protocol
PCR
PCR has three phases:
Denaturation - 1 cycle at 95°C
Annealing - 10 cycles - this is the 'seeding' phase; it occurs without binding of the XbaI and SpeI regions on the primers when binding the template DNA.
Elongation - 20 cycles - this is where the final end product comes from - all regions of the primers bind at this stage.
Aims
To amplify our DNA.
Equipment
PCR machine - we have a set programme - number 40.
Heating block
Eppendorf tubes
P200, P10 and P2 Gilsons and tips
Reagents
10x Pfu Ultra buffer
dNTPs
Forward and Reverse primers
Pfu Ultra II
Template DNA
Protocol
DNA Template
Heat up heating block to 95°C.
Select distinct colonies from plate for testing.
Pipette 100ul sterile ddH2O into eppendorf tubes.
Pick each colony in turn, replica plate the colony on a fresh plate and then mix the loop tip with the water in the eppendorf tube to leave cells as a sample.
Boil the water and cells solution for 5 minutes in the heating block.

TIP: For repeats of the SAME DNA - make up a 'master mix' - multiply the above volumes by the number of samples you have (excluding the DNA for each). Then divide this master mix between your eppendorf tubes and add your DNA (REMEMBER: you will also need a positive and negative control. Your negative control will not contain any DNA - make this up to the total volume with ddH2O. Make up your positive control separately).

Hello!!! Today we used the spectrofluorometer for the first time!!! We used DH5α without genetic modifications as “blank” and DH5α with p26G as positive control, grown in liquid medium LB for 16h.
We used:
Equipment: Hidex Chameleon.
Excitation filter: 340nm
Emission filter: 500nm
For creation of a GFP insanity expression levels curve, we diluted the sample of DH5α with p26G in liquid medium LB for 10-1, 10-2, 10-3. So we’ll be able to compare and calculate GFP expression intensity, our blank should also be diluted. The intensity levels of fluorescence showed by the Hidex Chameleon are:
In what DH5α with plasmid p26G in liquid medium LB grown for 16 hours non diluted shows fluorescence intensity of 283070 and diluted 10-3 shows 1655. Espectrofluorimeter calibrated! Tomorrow we’re going to do our first test with GFP induced by mercury in DH5α!!!
We made pre inoculum in medium LB + chloramphenicol 34ug/ml of DH5α with constructions BB_Essential + E0840 in PSB1C3!! Now is the moment of truth! We also had a meeting with the professor Tereza Cristina from Chemistry department to discuss the possibilities and procedures for mercury quantification, and we could plan the methods to be applied for constructions characterization with the metal binding protein (MBP) and protein that volatilizes mercury (MerA). Was super good to know that we can work with minimum mercury quantities, and that there is a super sensitive equipment that is able to quantify that.

Bacterial Chatter Matters
There is an increasing appreciation of the polymicrobial nature of many bacterial infections, such as those associated with CF, and of the potentially important role that interspecies interactions have in influencing both bacterial virulence and response to therapy. Patients with CF are often co-infected with P. aeruginosa and other pathogens such as B. cenocepacia and S. maltophilia.
P. aeruginosa responds to DSF produced by S. maltophilia and BDSF produced by B. cenocepacia leading to changes in biofilm architecture and increased resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides9. Such interspecies interactions occur in the CF lung where they may influence the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for chronic P. aeruginosa infections9.

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.

BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook-Progress_-_-_TEXT.html,"ick Transformation
The self-made electro competent E. coli DH5α cells were tested twice. The transformation efficiency with pUC19 was 4.45 x 108 cfu/µg and 5.67 x 108 cfu/µg. The first attempt with BioBrick DNA failed, but this might be due to a too low cell amount compared to all the other decanted tubes. In the following transformations, the incubation of the punched paper disc with the DNA was varied in time (3 h and 5.5 h). It seems that a longer incubation increases the transformation efficiency. This has to be confirmed, since the transformations were conducted by different persons. Thereby, next to the yeast ADH1 promoter another BioBrick ( enhanced version of EYFP, yeast-optimized YFP ) was tested because the VF2-VR value of yeast ADH1 promoter we got didn't coincide with the value given on the iGEM page.
Agar Plug Assay
Evaporation and currents that were occurring in previous attempts at the agarose-in-plug assay were eliminated by ensuring water potentials of plug and chemotaxis buffer were as similar as possible. Both the beads and the bacteria were found to sink to the bottom of the chamber shortly after inoculation.  This makes the model much simpler, as everything can be modelled in 2D.  We showed that beads need to be left in bacteria for around 30mins in order for significant bead movement to occur.  We currently have not determined if this is because the bacteria form a layer under the beads which stops them sticking to the slide, or if adherence itself is needed for bead movement. We determined the diffusion speed of bromophenol blue dye (which is three times larger than aspartate), and concluded that by 30mins aspartate would have diffused throughout the slide.
14th August - 20th August
Agar Plug Assay
We repeated the chemotaxis assays and found that the bacterial density surrounding the plug varied and therefore we obtained more valid results by using lower magnification and scanning around the whole plug (as opposed to focussing on one area for the whole time course).  This gave a much better overview of changes in bacterial density.
We tried testing bacterial chemotaxis to 1% serine and 1% aspartate in the plug.  Bacterial density around the plug was monitored for 1hr.  Bacteria appeared to be repelled by both the serine (see below)and aspartate at this concentration compared with the control"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Butanol in Plants Project
The butanol project’s goal is to synthetically produce the enzymes that make up the University of California’s cyanobacteria pathway to produce n-butanol within physcomitrella. Thereby making a plant directly produce n-butanol, an industrially relevant compound that can serve as a more efficient biofuel than ethanol. The project took on another goal when it was realized that an intermediary compound in the pathway could be used to produce (R)-Polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic.

Introduction
Butanol is a four carbon alcohol with several different industrial uses such as the creation of polymers and pharmaceuticals.  However, its most notable use is as a fuel for internal  combustion engines.  Butanol is fairly non-polar due to its longer hydrocarbon chain, and is  more similar to gasoline than other small alcohols such as ethanol.  The fact that it is similar in  function to gasoline means that butanol can be used in automobiles without any changes.  This is  significant because butanol can be synthesized from biomass.  Organisms such as cyanobacteria,  diatoms, and the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum have already been shown to produce  butanol using various methods.
Our other potential product is polyhydroxybutyrate or PHB.  PHB is a polymer in the polyesters class that has many uses similar to other plastics of the same variety.  The reason this  one is an interesting option is the fact that it is nontoxic and biodegradable.  This fact makes  PHB an excellent choice for potential use in the medical industry as well as others.  Biosynthesis  of the polymer is currently achieved using microorganisms.  Our goal was to extend the  production capabilities to plants; specifically Physcomitrella patens.
Background
Our work focuses on the ATP dependent pathway described by the University of  California.  The image below gives an outline of the pathway used.  Refer to the red line.
http://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/6018/F1.large.jpg
We designed three constructs based on the pathways for the synthesis of butanol and  PHB.  The first of the three (Castor) is the same for both pathways and brings the reaction to the  intermediate 3-("

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#halo_-_-_TEXT.html,": Deriving from the obtained values of oxidized ABTS in time at 10 °C and 25 °C the specific enzyme activity was calculated. For the temperatures a difference of 3 U mg-1 could be detected. One unit is defined as the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.
To investigate the activity of BHAL at temperatures that will apply at a waste water treatment plant throughout the year, activity tests were performed at 10 °C and 25 °C as described above. The measurements were conducted for 30 minutes. The obtained results revealed a lower activity of BHAL at 10 °C in comparison to 25 °C (see Fig. 12). The obtained results were used to calculate the specific enzyme activity which was at 4.2 and 7.2 U mg-1, respectively (see Figure 13). The negative control without BHAL but 0.4 mM CuCl2 at 10 °C and 25 °C showed a negligible oxidation of ABTS. The activity of BHAL was increased to about 60 % at 10 °C but nevertheless the observed activity at both conditions was great news for the possible application in waste water treatment plants.
Substrate Analysis
Figure 14: Degradation of estradiol (dark green) and ethinyl estradiol (light green) with the different laccases after 5 hours without ABTS. In the graph it is shown that the bought laccase TVEL0 which was used as positive control is able to degrade more than 90 percent of the used substrates. None of the bacterial laccases are able to degrade ethinyl estradiol without ABTS but estradiol is degraded in a range from 16 %(ECOL) to 55 % (TTHL). The original concentrations of substrates were 2 µg per approach. (n = 4)
The measurements were made to test if the produced laccases were able to degrade different hormones. Therefore the produced laccases were inserted in the same concentrations (3 µg mL-1) to the different measurement approaches. To work with the correct pH value (which were measured by the Team Activity Test) Britton Robinson buffer at pH 5 was used for all measurements. The initial substrate concentration was 5 µg mL-1. The results of the reactions without ABTS are shown in Figure 14. On the Y-axis the percentages of degraded estradiol (light green) and ethinyl estradi"

Biobrick transformations
A series of biobrick transformations (J37015, T9002, E0840 and I731014) were performed using electro-competent DH5α cells.  After several attempts, only J37015 and T9002 appeared to work, but after carrying out colony PCR on the transformed bacteria we found that the J37015 part doesn’t appear to be in its plasmid (pSB1A3).  The T9002 transformation, however, was successful, and this was verified by plasmid mini-prep and subsequent test digestion.  Its activity as a luxR GFP receiver construct was also confirmed, by testing the fluorescence of the transformed bacteria when incubated with two different concentrations of AHL.  (No GFP was produced in the control, un-transformed, bacteria).   Since we have tried several times, unsuccessfully, to transform the other biobricks, strains already transformed with these biobricks were requested from iGEM HQ.

10th September - 16th September
We received strains from iGEM HQ transformed with the following biobricks: J37015, pSB1A3, I731014, T9002, E0840.
The AHL test used to verify the activity of our T9002-transformed DH5α cells was repeated (see protocols page) to test the I731014 and T9002 strains provided by iGEM.  We used pSB1A3-transformed strains as our control.  Both test strains displayed fluorescence at both 10-6M and 10-8M AHL, whilst no fluorescence was detected in the negative control.  The proportion of total I731014-transformed bacteria that actually fluoresced was quite low however.  (T9002 fluorescence, in contrast, was near to 100% of total bacteria in the sample that was viewed).
Plasmid mini-preps and restriction digests were performed to test the identity of the plasmids.  Single and double digests were carried out for each biobrick.  The results for T9002 and E0840 were as expected and corresponded to the part sequence data.   Both the single and double digests for J37015, however"

Cellulose binding domain - attaches to the cellulose substrate and further increases the efficiency of cellulose degradation process
Type 2 dockerin region - attached to cellulosome scaffoldin protein
Type 2 cohesin region - binds to type 2 dockerin region and the S-layer binding module that anchors the cellulosome to the surface of the cell
Figure 2 - Diagram of the cellulosome as it appears in C. thermocellum naturally
The C. thermocellum cellulosome is a good candidate for this project for the following reasons:
The entirety of the cellulosome is located outside of the cell. This means that substrates do not have to be taken into the cell before reactions can occur.
The cellulosome keeps enzymes within close proximity to the cell. This would be ideal for applications in sensitive environments (i.e. within another organism).
The cellulosome significantly increases the efficiency of cellulose-degrading enzymes. The system may do the same for other multiple enzyme processes.
The cohesin/dockerin interactions of a given species are specific to that species; the cohesin of one species will not bind to the dockerin of another.
Project Description
Project Goals
The purpose of this project is to create a BioBrick tool kit that would allow teams to anchor multiple enzymes to the external surface of Escherichia coli. Not only would the use of this kit allow users to anchor their parts to the surface of E. coli but also adjust the anchoring construct to fit their needs. To execute this project, the following goals must be accomplished:
Replace the S-layer binding module of C. thermocellum with a trans-membrane protein that is compatible with gram negative bacteria like E. coli
Reduce the size of the cellulosome scaffoldin gene (roughly 7kb long) to make it easier to work with during PCR and in plasmids
Compile a variety of cohesin and dockerin regions (from other organisms) to give the user more control over how the enzymatic subunits bind to the scaffoldin
Standardize a variety of cohesin regions to allow for easy attachment of enzymes of the user’s choice to the scaffoldin
Project Overview
In order to fulfill the above project goals, the following steps need to be taken:
Step 1: Combine CtCoh2 with the E. coli transmembrane protein LPP-OmpA (BBa_K103006) , submitted by the 2008 Warsaw iGEM team

Since data from simuation and data from experiment have different unit and different period, we choose data of two periods and then have them normalized using their correspondent maximum difference. Then we get the figure that:
In this figure, we can see that curve of experimet data and curve of simulation data is quite close, and residue is almost symmetrically disrtributed. Thus, we can conclude that our data, either experiment one or simulated one, confirms the other.
Furthermore, we use K-S test in these two groups to confirm ourselves. P-value is calculated: P= 0.2827; in other words, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, namely there is lack of evidence that these two groups of data are different.

Organisms engineered by synthetic biologists have the potential to deliver biological solutions to a wide range of problems. However, they must be implemented responsibly in any setting.
Last year the Kingsborough team focused on engineering E. coli, to deteriorate nitrogenous waste in sewage more effectively. However, E. coli can survive in local waterways where treated wastewater ends up therefore introducing foreign genetic material into the environment that can cause irreparable harm to the environment. This year the Kingsborough 2017 iGEM team looked for an environmentally responsible mechanism to prevent such a scenario through the “kill-switch”. With this “kill-switch” we will be able to destroy any escaped modified E. coli from the treatment plant.
This year we attempted to develop a light-inducible kill switch as designed by Ohlendorf et al., that would have the bacteria thrive in a dark environment like a sewage treatment plant and perish in a bright environment like the local waterways.  Other teams have proposed and modeled such switches, but few have successfully built, implemented, and characterized such devices. We will be building upon our past design, as well as improving and completing a previously proposed light-inducible kill switch (the design of team Wageningen from 2016 ).
This year the Kingsborough team faced many barriers to completing the project. For instance, the lab space lacked a red room to grow the light-sensitive E.coli which likely introduced unwanted expression. Furthermore, we lacked a spectrophotometer, and our inability to quantify DNA concentrations this way hindered our DNA ligations and Gibson Assembly. However, we came up with cheap solutions to these technical barriers that we can introduce to the iGEM community."

Figure 19: Standard BPUL activity test applying different amounts of acetonitrile. No considerable impact on the activity can be detected.
Since Regionals: Initial activity tests of purified fractions
After the Regional Jamboree in Amsterdam further BPUL was produced. The most comprising fractions of the purification were analyzed for protein content (10/16), re-buffered into deionized H2O and incubated in 0.4 mM CuCl2. Again, the protein content (10/17) of each fraction was determined because of the loss of proteins through re-buffering. Initial activity tests were done in Britton-Robinson buffer with 0.1 mM ABTS. The protein content of each fraction was adjusted for comparison of the resulting activity (see Fig. 20).
Figure 20: Activity assay of each purified fraction of recent produced BPUL. Samples were re-buffered into H2O and the protein amount in each fraction was adjusted. The measurement was done using the standard activity assay protocol over night. The first number indicates the percentage of used elution buffer, whereas the second number stands for the fraction number of this elution.
Fraction 50% 2 showed the highest activity. The first number indicates the percentage of used elution buffer, whereas the second number stands for the fraction number of this elution. The saturation was reached at ~1 h. For comparison it was stated that this fraction contains 90 % laccase and therefore the BPUL concentration is 25,1 µg mL-1.
Since Regionals: BPUL activity depending on different ABTS concentrations
In order to find the substrate saturation, laccase activity was measured with ABTS concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 8 mM. 616 ng BPUL were used for measurements with ABTS concentrations of 0.1 mM to 5 mM, 308 ng BPUL were used for measurements with ABTS concentrations of 5 mM to 8 mM. Measurements were done in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 25 °C for 30 minutes taking the OD420 every 5 minutes. Comparing the graphs in Figure 21 and Figure 22, both show a comprising substrate saturation with 5 mM ABTS. Higher concentrations of ABTS than 5 mM did not show any other effects on the activity of BPUL. For all following BPUL activity measurements after the Regional Jamborees in Amsterdam a concentration of 5 mM ABTS"

Split luciferase
Split enzymes [5] were selected as the candidates to convert the presence of target DNA sequence into measureable signal. Each protein fragment by itself is inactive; when the fragments are reassembled, the enzymatic activity of the original protein would be reconstituted, thus providing easily measurable readout through enzymatic reaction. Among diverse split enzymes, we chose split luciferase which produces bioluminescence signal (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Illustration of the working mechanism of split luciferase. A functional luciferase is split into two inactive fragments (Nluc, orange and Cluc, yellow).  Each fragment is fused to an interacting domain (gray) that tends to dimerize. The interacting domains cause non-covalent complementation of Nluc and Cluc to reconstitute the enzymatic activity, thus to emit measurable bioluminescence.
Design
We combined dCas9 and split luciferase to obtain a paired dCas9 (PC) Reporter system that can not only extract the sequence information of target DNA, but also quantitatively visualize its abundance through bioluminescence emission. As shown in the schematic diagram (Figure 2), when N-luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complex and C-luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complex simultaneously bind to adjacent sites on a target DNA, the two fragments of luciferase are brought into proximity and the subsequent complementation brings measurable bioluminescence signal.
Figure 2. Schematic of the paired dCas9 (PC) Reporter system. dCas9 was fused with fragments of split luciferase (Nluc and Cluc), respectively, to form two kinds of split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes. In the presence of target DNA, the complexes, respectively, bind to two adjacent recognition sites, bringing Nluc and Cluc into proximity to produce bioluminescence signal.
Results
Validating the functional reconstitution of split luciferase
We began by examining whether our split luciferase could be really functionally reconstituted by protein fragment-assisted complementation (PFAC) [7,8]. For the complementation-assisting partners, we chose rapamycin-binding domain (FRB) of human mTOR that binds with high affinity to FK-506-binding protein 12 (FKBP); rapamycin is able to induce"

Extensibility
The next phase in collaboration is actually extensibility. This would mean adding new functionalities to BioBrick-A-Bot, by developing new Modules. Currently, we have developed only 2 Modules, called ALPHA and PHI. We planned to build a third Module called MU as described in V2.0 of the specification. Other teams are also encouraged to build and share additional BioBrick-a-Bot Modules as well. In the next version of BioBrick-A-Bot, we will implement Single-Master-Multiple-Slaves Synchronization, to support three or more Modules, with ALPHA as the master.
Collaboration with other iGEM Team
Raik's Barcelona Team
One of our external team advisors, Raik Gruenberg , is interested to start a new team in Barcelona next year and replicate the existing ‘bot’ that we have. This is a good first step. Raik has also written some procedures for performing fusion assemblies . We will attempt to collaborate with his team and get our ‘bot’ to automate the procedure above too.
University of Washington Wet-Lab Team
We have also presented BioBrick-A-Bot to the University of Washington Wet-Lab Team (See Picture Gallery ).  Next year we could look into using one of our ‘bots’ to automate some of the mundane tasks in BioBrick assemblies.
The Vision of Future Collaboration
We built BioBrick-A-Bot V1.0 as a prototype and provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that it worked. V1.0 will however, not have the full range of functionalities of a commercial liquid handling robot. V1.0 will be made up of 2 LegoRoboBrick modules, ALPHA and PHI, mounted on a chassis called BETA. We will provide construction details and software so that other iGEM team can replicate and customize their own 'bot's.
In our next version, BioBrick-A-Bot V2.0, we will provide 3 LegoRoboBrick modules, ALPHA, PHI and MU. We will also support user-defined LegoRoboBrick modules too. We provide the mechanism where other iGEM teams can collaborate together to replicate, interchange and extend LegoRoboBricks. Many iGEM teams can contribute and share both Hardware Construction and Software Programs for LegoRoboBrick modules in a Registry, much like the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"". Our vision will be to make the technologies of creating and sharing 'bots' easily available, replacing labour"

These results show that Citrobacter freundii can use all but one of the tested sugars as sole carbon sources – the one outlier, xylitol, got us thinking about developing a selectable marker system similar to the sucrose hydrolase system we used for our E. coli cells – one that depends on sugar use. Similarly to how E. coli K12 is unable to use sucrose, Citrobacter freundii cannot grow on xylitol (as shown by our experiments and quoted in Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology). We have chosen xylitol as the carbon source for this marker and have developed a theoretical protocol for how the development of such a marker could be done. You can read about it on this page .

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

I am fascinated with mechanisms and machines - from watches and trains to elucidation of the mechanisms of action of drugs. I' ve discovered that IGEM reflects the way in which I see medicine – as ‘information science and art of healing’ and gives a unique opportunity to merge multiple interest in one clear idea. I want to act also in the area of mobile health, medical startups and healthcare markets design and contribute to gifted and STEM education.

Meeting Of Young Minds Debate
Meeting Of Young Minds
At the beginning of June, the Rathenau Instituut (a Dutch body which promotes the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology) put out a call for proposals for a debate, the Meeting of Young Minds, to be held on the Friday evening preceding the African-European jamboree.
The first Meeting of Young Minds debate, which took place in 2011 , pitted iGEM teams against representatives from Dutch youth political parties in a meeting of ‘future scientists and future politicians’ to discuss the ‘promises and perils of synthetic biology’. For Meeting of Young Minds 2012, iGEM teams were invivted to submit their own themes for debate.  Our proposal ‘A synthetic biology future, a synthetic biology crisis’ was one of two themes selected.
Our proposal
We decided that we wanted our proposal to have some link to our project, hoping that we might gain some new perspectives from the debate.  At this point in the summer, we knew what our project was going to be, but not how it was going to work, so we came up with the idea of a debate broadly based around geoengineering – deliberate large-scale scientific projects to address or remedy the environmental impact of human activities.
Early ideas included discussion on the ethics of syn-bio geoengineering and the rights and responsibilities relating to such large scale projects.  However, our research quickly revealed that these topics had been already been well-publicized and thoroughly discussed"
Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Project#PC Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"constituted by protein fragment-assisted complementation (PFAC) [7,8]. For the complementation-assisting partners, we chose rapamycin-binding domain (FRB) of human mTOR that binds with high affinity to FK-506-binding protein 12 (FKBP); rapamycin is able to induce the dimerization to form a FRB-rapamycin-FKBP complex (Figure 3a).  A pair of widely-used split firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase fragments (N-luc 416/C-luc 398) was then selected to construct N-luc-FRB and FKBP-C-luc fusion proteins; they are, therefore, subjected to rapamycin induced complementation [9]. Our results of PFAC assay on our split luciferase fragments confirmed that the luciferase activity are able to be successfully reconstituted in a rapamycin-dependent manner (Figure 3b).
Figure 3. Rapamycin-induced N-luc-FRB/FKBP-C-luc complementation. (a) The working mechanism of rapamycin induced dimerization. The interacting protein partners (FRB and FKBP) get closer and dimerize soon after rapamycin is added (40nM) [10], thus to reconstitute the enzymatic activity of luciferase. (b) The experimental data. Error bars denote s.d.; n=3.
The location of His-tag
Despite the fact that His-tag is widely used for protein purification, it is well-known that His-tag might have some considerable impact on protein structure. Hence, we first tested the activity of C-terminally and N-terminally His-tagged split luciferase-dCas9 fusion proteins to see whether the location of His-tag matters. We found that when the His-tag is attached to N-luc or C-luc, the activity of fusion protein would dramatically decrease (See working mechanism of PC reporter in Figure 2); this is probably due to the interruption of luciferase reconstitution by His-tag (Figure 4). When the His-tag is attached to dCas9, the enzymatic activity was reconstituted significantly. Therefore, we chose split luciferase-dCas9 fusion proteins with His-tagged dCas9 for the following study.
Figure 4. The impact of His-tag location on the reconstitution of luciferase activity. When attached to dCas9, His-tag has minimal impact on the complementation of N-luc and C-luc.

As an iGEM veterane Moritz was a great help in discussing our modeling"
Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," This final point does not affect our rule-based stochastic simulation. The inaccuracy in our spectra causes an uncertainty in the calculation of activation rate and a greater uncertainty in the calculation of the cell's absorbtion.
Thirdly the nature of the activation of the light sensors is unknown and the method we use to calculate the activation rate is likely to be errenous. This introduces another source of error in the calculation of sensor activation rates.
Fourthly the rates in our rule-based model are ballpark figures taken from literature and are not specific to the reactions in our model. This is the primary source of error in our pathway simulation.
Conclusions
The multitude and magnitude of error sources in our model mean that no accurate conclusions about our synthetic biological system can be drawn from it.
However our preliminary results suggest that tri-chromatic control of gene expression in E.coli is very unstable for individual cells. This may be due to the small number of DNA blocks in our system amplifying the effect of chance. For large groups of E.coli the average expression is more predictable. This is to be expected in a stochastic system but the degree to which expression varies between individuals under identical circumstances surprised us. This suggests that instability will reduce the spatial control that our tri-chromatic system can have. It is possible that increasing the number of light regulated genes may reduce the instability and increase the potential spatial resolution.
The model itself is a good foundation for future multi-chromatic control modelling efforts. The data that feeds the model can easily be replace with experimental data. The kappa file is well layed out and comprehensible with some understanding of kappa syntax. We think that it has the potential to provide a useful tool for modelling similar systems or as a resource for others to build rule-based models of their own.
Future
Our model serves as a framework for modelling tri-chromatic control in E.coli. The foremost action to be taken in the future is the successful synthesis and testing of a working tri-chromatic control system. The experimental results could be used to update and test the model.
Improvements to the workings of the model include allowing the input signal to change with time. This means updating the rates in the kappa model while the model is being run by KaSiM. This requires either greater integration between KaSiM and mathematics programs like MATLAB or a more powerful mathematics suite in KaSiM. It is possible also to write a program the converts the cell's absorbtion spectrum over time into its colour over time. This is something that we did not have time to do.
Increasing the number of light regulated DNA in a cell reduces the instability. Perhaps in the future"

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," infection, providing ample time for the fungus to spread without notice. Additionally, the fungus remains in the soil in the form of spores for up to a decade, ready to infect the next set of plants. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method of protecting the Cavendish banana from Fusarium oxysporum and eliminating the fungus from the soil.
Our Approach
Many eukaryotes produce a class of proteins known as thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) in response to attack and stress. Some of these TLPs are known to have antifungal properties against F. oxysporum. Among these are the TLP from Oryza sativa (rice) and Arachis diogoi (wild peanut plant).
Current methods of fungal inhibition are too detrimental and cannot be used for extended periods of time. However, recent studies have shown that biocontrol methods using disease-suppressive soils have been quite effective at fungal inhibition. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BA) NJN-6 is a common Bacillus strain found in the Cavendish banana rhizosphere. BA has been found to produce some antifungal compounds that are fairly effective at suppressing fungal growth. By combining BA with compost to make a fertilizer and applying it to soil already infected by F. oxysporum, the susceptibility of the banana plants to the fungus was greatly reduced. While quite effective, the bacteria alone is unable to kill the fungus.
As a result, we propose to transform BA to produce an antifungal TLP. Then we will again combine this with compost to create a fertilizer that is even more potent. Since TLPs are known to actually be able to kill the fungus in addition to being able to inhibit spore germination, this transformed BA has the potential to be more effective against F. oxysporum.
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, a bacterium that grows synergistically with the roots of the Cavendish banana plant, senses Fusarium oxysporum, the fungus causing Panama disease. In response, B. amyloliquefaciens produces TLP, an antifungal, to fight off the pathogen.
Why Choose Our Approach
There is currently a lot of stigma around and distrust of genetically modified foods. As a result, we wanted to focus on creating a genetically modified organism that would serve as a probiotic treatment for banana plants.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Reporter#BetaLactamase_-_-_TEXT.html," β-lactamase fusion   was not present, the solution will remain pink.  We can show that the first four samples which have TALE B with DNA for TALE A and TALE B show a colour change indicating that we are successfully capturing the target DNA and reporting it. Furthermore we can also show that when we add non-specific DNA we do not see a colour change demonstrating that we can successfully capture only specific DNA and report its presence with an easy visual colourimetric output.
Figure 13: TALE capture assay was done with TALE B  ( ) BBa_K1189001 )and TALE A B-lac fusion ( BBa_K1189031 ) and DNA ( BBa_K1189006 ) with both target sequences. If capture is successful, the TALE A β-lactamase is present in the well giving a colour change from pink to yellow when subjected to benzylpenicillin substrate solution within 20 minutes. The only wells that change colour are the first four wells which contain TALE B, specific DNA, and TALE A β-lactamase fusion and our positive control wells which are the controls for our fusion TALE A β-lactamase protein and our positive recombinant β-lactamase. All our other controls including our test using a non-specific sequence of DNA remained pink . This preliminary characterization data demonstrates that the TALEs are able to bind to DNA with specificity. Additionally it also shows that our system of capturing DNA with two detector TALEs and then subsequent reporting of the DNA’s presence works.
This assay shows that we can capture our target DNA with two detector TALEs with specificity . Additionally, we can report whether that DNA has been captured and is present in the sample, which is a very important concept for our sensor system.
Conclusion
To conclude, we have demonstrated that we have built, expressed, purified, and submitted parts containing β-lactamase both on its own and linked to TALE A. We then expressed, purified and demonstrated the final purified products have retained their enzymatic activity. We can show activity for our mobile TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ) for our sensor in two different ways, through pH output (with two pH indicators) and cell growth assays. We have also demonstrated that we can use the TALE A β-lactamase fusion as a biobrick that has been characterized to show both its ability to be a good reporter and its ability to be able to bind to DNA with specificity.

・200 μl of the induced culture was centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 ℃.
・The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was stored at -20 ℃.
・The stored pellet was resuspended in 1 x sample buffer (100 μL), followed by heating at 98 °C for 5 min.
・The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. at 4℃.
・The supernatant was collected into a new microcentrifuge tube.
・20 μL of the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
TLC assay
We analyzed L-aspartate by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The equal volume of the supernatant of synthesis medium was added with 7 mg/mL 5-Dimethylamino naphthalene-1-sulfonyl Chloride (dissolved in acetone) and was incubated for more than 30 min at room temperature. Two microliters of the reactant was spotted on a TLC silica plate, and was developed in a mixture of ethyl acetate, pyridine, water, and acetic acid(162：21：11：6 v/v). It is observed by UV irradiation (365nm).
Chemotaxis Assay
Introduction
Chemotaxis of E. coli against aspartic acis was assayed by two methods. One was ""swarming assay"", and the other was capillary assay. In ""swarming assay"", we have used ""sawarming plate"", a solid culture plate containing lower concentration of agar, on that plate, E. coli can swim. We have used capillary  containing aspartic acid. The capillary was set in chemotaxis medium containing motile E. coli. The number of E. coli attracted to aspartic acid in capillary was determined  by colony formation on LB plate.
Swarming Assay
We assayed chemotaxis of E. coli against cadmium and aspartic acid on soft agar, containing M9 synthetic medium, on that plate E. coli can swim.
