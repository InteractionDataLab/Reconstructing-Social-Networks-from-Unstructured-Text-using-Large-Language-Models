Fit the quorum sensing parameters of our system from experiments
Goal
Once the initial guidelines for the genetic design given in a first step , we need to measure on our obtained biological system whether it behaves as intended. Therefore, we will submit it to carefully designed experiments, in order to fit our model on the obtained data and retrieve crucial parameters. The tricky part here is that in a test tube, our system will behave differently than in a tumor, as the repartition of bacteria is not the same and diffusion of AHL does not take place in the lab experiments. We therefore have to extend our model to take this discrepancy into account.
We then fit three of the most important parameters of our system: the expression levels of luxI and luxR, and the Plux promoter leakiness.
In vitro model extension
Compared to the real-life situation happening in the tumor, during our experiments bacteria are in a very different state: they are in bulk in the liquid culture and not in an open solid medium like they would be around the tumor. Therefore, the diffusion of AHL in the test tube does not take place, and some of our equations used before should be adapted to describe the behavior of our circuit when bacteria are in the situation of our lab experiments: only AHL production and degradation happen in the test tubes.
\[\begin{aligned}         \frac{\mathrm{d} [\text{AHL}]}{\mathrm{d} t} &= P_{\text{AHL}} - k_{\text{deg}} [\text{AHL}]\end{aligned}\]
Therefore, once reached the steady state, and thanks to the still valid equation describing AHL production\begin{aligned}P_{\text{AHL}} &= d_{\text{cell}} a_{\text{AHL}} [\text{luxI}]\end{aligned} the level of AHL is now:
\[\begin{aligned}         \text{[AHL]} &= \frac{d_{\text{cell}} a_{\text{AHL}}"

Testing Promoters
The part is an coding sequence for an anti-microbial peptides linked to a mussel-foot protein-linked to superfolder GFP for localization. The mussel foot protein will anneal to surfaces as a wet glue and the antimicrobial domain is designed to interact with microbial membranes and interfere with membrane stability. In order to use this part you can produce it in a TAG recoded organism simultaneously expressing a Tyrosine supressor or L-DOPA orthogonal translational system. In order to purify you can use the 2X Strep tag and strep column and later cleave with enterokinase to remove the sequence supressing LL-37 antimicrobial action.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Outreach.html_-_-_TEXT.html," in a church in the centre of York. The Church Wardens, Anthony and Margaret, allowed us to use their building to help promote a positive relationship between religion and science. The aim of the event was to meet as broad a range of people as possible and engage in discussions about the sort of research we’re involved in. We wanted to find out if and what they knew about synthetic biology as a branch of science and also to educate them as to what it was we’d been up to over the summer.
We ran a simple demonstration which allowed members of the public to extract the DNA from their own cheek cells and take it away with them in a PCR tube. To do this we asked people to take a 10mL drink of orange juice and swill it around their mouth, chewing on their cheeks a little to dislodge as many cells as possible, before spitting the liquid back out into the beaker. Next we added this to 1mL of salt solution (8g or NaCl diluted in 92mL of distilled water) in a test tube. We then added 1mL of soap solution (ordinary washing up liquid mixed with distilled water in a 1:3 dilution). The detergent lyses the cells and exposes the DNA to the salt which interacts with the proteins surrounding your DNA and causes them to precipitate. We then slowly added 5mL of ice cold 100% ethanol which allowed the precipitated DNA to become more visible and scooped out into a smaller PCR tube which also contained ethanol. We then added a drop of food colouring to make the DNA more visible and then glued the lid shut before letting people take them home as a souvenir.
As well as this we asked people to fill in a simple questionnaire aimed to find out what people knew about SynBio and how it was viewed by the general public. You can see the data we collected here (sample size was 70):
There were a few other things we noticed when speaking to people about the project. First of all, we found that people who had a scientific background, either as a career or as a personal interest, often said they knew less about the field of Synthetic Biology than those with no knowledge at all. It seems that the more people actually know about science the less they feel they know- the more aware they are of the vast expanse of things to learn. Another thing we didn’t expect was the demographic of people who attended the event. We expected a lot of children to participate in the DNA Extraction experiment but in fact it was the adults who enjoyed it the most, especially some of the"

Fig.10 Result of questionnaire survey using WT and recombinant (JM109/GES). Out of 20 persons, two persons (10%) answered the medium A (WT) smelled stronger than the medium B (recombinant (JM109/GES)) and eighteen persons (90%) answered the medium B smelled stronger than the medium A. If we assume that both media smell equally, the probability that the medium A is selected in the questionnaire must be 0.5. From this assumption, p-value of this result was calculated using binomial test. Because the p-value was much smaller than the 5% significance level (0.0004025), the smell of recombinant (JM109/GES) is stronger than that of WT significantly. This result indicate that the recombinant (JM109/GES) synthesize geraniol.

Out of 20 persons, five persons (25%) answered the medium A (recombinant (JM109/GES)) smelled stronger than the medium B (recombinant (JM109/GES)) and fifteen persons (75%) answered the medium B smelled stronger than the medium A. If we assume that both media smell equally, the probability that the medium A is selected in the questionnaire must be 0.5. From this assumption, p-value of this result was calculated using binomial test. Because the p-value was much smaller than the 5% significance level (0.0413900), the smell of recombinant (JM109/GES) is stronger than that of recombinant(JM109/Empty vector) significantly. This result indicate that the recombinant (JM109/GES) synthesize geraniol.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#flagellin_-_-_TEXT.html,"5) gave a comprehensive analysis of the polymerization process using nucleation theory, which, with all the correct parameters given, can predict the concentration of flagellar filaments of every length. However, in the simulation of step two of our design, we are only interested in the number of seeds formed on the yeast surface. The lengths of the filaments are not of our concern, so we do not distinguish between filaments of different lengths.
We treat the nucleation process as a one-step reaction between $s$ monomers:
\[ \ce{s \ monomer -> seed} \]
Then, according to the law of mass action, we have
\[ \frac{\mathrm{d}C_n}{\mathrm{d}t}=k_nC_m^s \]
where $C_n$ is the concentration of nuclei (a.k.a. seeds) in the solution, $k_n$ is the nucleation rate constant and $C_m$ is the concentration of monomers in the solution. Here, filaments of different lengths are all treated as seeds and are considered together in the variable $C_n$. As will be seen the third differential equation, their main effect on the system is reducing $C_m$ by elongation. Note that the elongation of filaments in vitro is not infinite, because there is a probability that an error may occur at the distal end of the filament which can terminate further growth. However, it usually takes about an hour for nucleation to finish (Wakabayashi et al., 1969), and the typical length of the filaments formed in that time is less than $1 \ \mu\text{m}$, which is much shorter than $50 \ \mu\text{m}$, the observed maximal length of flagellar filaments assembled in vitro (Lino, 1974). This indicates that within the simulation period, the termination of elongation can be neglected. Therefore, there is no term in the above equation for the removal of nuclei from the system, which means that once a seed is formed, it stays in the system and consumes monomers by elongation until the end of our simulation.
Similarly, we have

UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#Purification_-_-_TEXT.html," (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types) method for the purification of nuclei from plants (6) . This technique purifies biotin-labeled nuclei using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, without the need for specialized equipment. With this methodology, you generate a nuclear targeting fusion protein, which consists of three parts: a specific domain for nuclear envelope association in plants, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) for visualization and the biotin ligase recognition peptide. The expression of this construct and the BirA gene in plants allows purification of specific nuclei.
The INTACT method supposedly takes 2 days and should be adaptable to any organism that is amenable to transformation. So, we decided to combine both:
- The protocol for the sucrose gradient centrifugation (early steps): Disruption and centrifugation steps and the use of the same buffers in which the carboxysome is stable.
- The INTACT protocol (biotinylation and later steps): Fluorescence visualization and streptavidin- coated magnetic beads isolation process.
Using this method, we were able to create a new methodology for the extraction and purification of carboxysomes.
Our dreamed purification system
Genetic Experimental Design
The general idea was to use: our construct the Carboxysome BioBrick ( Bba_K1113100 ) + RFP( Bba_E1010 ) and to add to the RFP the biotinylation acceptor peptide 5’ GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE 3’. Using this approach,  we could visualize the microcompartment using microscopy (to check the formation and correct induction) and allow carboxysomes to get affinity bound to streptavidin beads.
Construct for the biotinylation of the Carboxysome
Protocols
For more information about the protocols used for the extraction and purification of the carboxysomes, click here .
Further Work
The characterization of the purification system needs to be tested in more detail:
- The improvement on the efficiency between using traditional methodologies and our innovative system of purification.
- A yield quantification of the functional and assembled carboxysomes.
We also need to verify if this system can be scalable for industrial production by checking costs and advantages of the production inside the carboxysomes.

This technological optimism has also been translated into finding solutions for environmental problems as part of the discourse of the iGEM competition. Teams are required to assign their projects to a specific categorical ‘track’ of their choice so that they can “focus […] towards a specific subject area within synthetic biology and […] know who they will compete against for the track award” (iGEM 2014g). As a solution to a specific environmental problem, the Goodbye AzoDye Project of UCL iGEM 2014 has been assigned to the Environment Track, which has been described in terms of “tackl[ing] massive environmental problems [of certain local or regional areas]” by teams that can learn from these problems and become passionate in finding a solution for it. These are the principles that make up a major part of the philosophy of the iGEM competition (iGEM 2014h). Moreover, it is stated in the track description that the health of the environment is directly related to the wellbeing of all life and that this can be enhanced with the help of the biosciences: “The quality of the air, water, and land, both on Earth and other heavenly bodies, limits the happiness of humans and other creatures. Can biotechnology be used to help clean the air, provide fresh drinking water, restore or enhance soil quality, terraform a near-Earth asteroid, or protect, preserve, or enhance natural biological diversity” (iGEM 2014i)? Hence, this view very much corresponds with the way ecological modernisation envisions technology to bring about the necessary interventions to prevent further environmental decline.
Seeking Industrial Innovation
The aim of the project to bring ecological innovation implies to a certain extent a change in industrial practice as well. The selection of the azo dye project was preceded by a process in which team members conceived their own project proposals. By making the project revolve around the issue of azo dye leaching, the team pursues a form of industrial innovation that is indicative of the ecological modernisation framework considering its attempt to match ecological concerns to economic aspirations. Joseph Huber, who is considered to be the founding father of ecological modernisation theory, has coined the rethinking of how industrial production should be realised through advanced technologies, with the term ‘super-industrialisation’. Hence, through various organisational levels, namely the iGEM Foundation and competition, the categorical group of the Environment Track and on the level of the team itself, this discourse of using synthetic biology as a technological instrument for reform"

Modelling Meeting
No lab experiments performed today (have to re-consider methods) - no colonies were found from the transformation that occured yesterday morning.
For the modelling meeting, the following points were discussed:
1. A better organization of our work is required. We have both characterization and simulation from the mathematical team, but the work seems unlinked and not organized. Will have a more organized report for next week.
2. Greater detail was explained to us by Thane Kubik regarding the biochemical details that are behind the signalling pathway.
3. We need to start thinking about how we are going to present our two modelling system that we have created.
4. We will meet again on thursday and Afshin will give us a better overview of membrane computing.

Firstly, we observe that the recombined phage shows a tag difference independently of the fragment of the penton base used compared to the non transformed bacteriophage. Secondly, the recombined phage with the RGD fragment alone (286-393) has a higher fluorescence than the phage with a complete fragment and closer to the adenovirus one (figure 2).
Back to top
Discussion
Even if the tissue vector has not been finished, scientific literature shows that a recombinant phage creation with a protein coding the adenovirus penton base is possible. It demonstrates as well that fragment coding for RGD sequence alone has a higher capacity to infect eukaryotic cells compared to the penton base complete fragment (figure 2). In the case of our application it is possible to use a recombined Lambda phage to insert our therapeutic gene.
Back to top
Conclusion
To conclude the RGD fragment of the penton base alone has a higher efficiency of interaction with integrines of eukaryotic cells. However for our project, it was more judicious to use the complete sequence of the penton base (fragment 1-571) because the use of the cell vector and the induction system by doxycycline give a very fast and target injection of bacteriophages. The use of a highly efficient transfection system is not advised because phages do not have the time to disperse properly and will infect several times the same cell. The use of the complete fragment of the penton base is sufficient for the phage to infect properly eukaryotic cells and let it time to have a bigger dispersion.

In non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, like in all other cancers, the loss of apoptotic capacity of tumor cells is due to the functional loss of various tumor suppressors incoming in the apoptotic pathway.

Autoinduction
Starting the encapsulation process is related to diauxic growth of bacteria under the presence of two carbon sources.  2 models from literature have been discussed and implemented in this section. More information about each can be found in the extra tabs. After analysis of the models, we picked one of them as the best representation for our data. The sections below will provide a summary about each model, and at the end, discuss which one was picked and why. The diauxic growth phenomenon is tricky to understand, and the models we have chosen illustrate different approaches that groups have taken to explain what happens when bacteria switch to feeding from a primary carbon source to a secondary carbon source.

Goal of the models
Provide understanding of the diauxic growth phenomenon
Find out the time taken to consume glucose in the medium to characterize the CRP promoter.
Quantify the switch point from glucose to a secondary carbon source.
Understand which is the best secondary carbon source to power the system after glucose is used up.
Model 1: Kompala et al cybernetic model
This is a cybernetic model developed by Kompala et al [1].
It is based on Michaelis-Menten assumptions for substrate consumption.
The substrates in this case are our carbon sources: glucose, maltose, xylose, galactose...
Rationale:
In a mixture of carbon sources, glucose is energetically more favorable to consume(more on this is discussed in the autoinduction section).
This model includes the effects of enzyme activation and inhibition, as well as competition for metabolism of sugars [1].
Figure 1 from [2]
The red and green lines represent the concentrations of glucose (S1) and a secondary substrate (S2).  As we can see, S1 is used up before S2. During this phase, the population (X- blue trace) grows exponentially and saturates when S1 runs out. Once it runs out, there is a switch phase, followed by metabolism of a secondary carbon source and entering a second exponential growth phase.

Stanford,2009,Team:Stanford#ProjectPage_-_-_TEXT.html," reduced tryptophan levels indicate increased Treg activity and vice versa – the Device 2 sensor must act as an inverter.
Fortunately, there exists such an inverter mechanism in E. coli.  The tryptophan regulon native to E. coli consists of an inducible repressor (TrpR) and the tryptophan operon (Trp operon).  The presence of the Treg signal, tryptophan, induces the TrpR to dimerize.  Up to three of these repressor dimers can bind to the Trp operon and prevent transcription.  This system is an inverter because low tryptophan input results in high output, while high input results in low output.
Nevertheless, the caveat to using tryptophan as the Treg marker is that tryptophan is a ubitquitous amino acid common to many metabolic pathways.  Moreover its concentration in the digestive tract is highly variable depending on diet.  Hence a tryptophan input signal would suffer from destructive amounts of noise.  As such, the team identified a synthetic tryptophan analog, 5-methyltryptophan (5MT), that is also degraded by IDO.  It is neither consumed by any known human or E. coli metabolic pathway nor produced naturally.  5MT is also very weakly absorbed in the digestive tract.  Hence 5MT serves as a stable signal of Treg activity.  The team developed mutant TrpR repressors that exhibit higher affinity for 5MT than tryptophan and mutant Trp operons that are bound almost exclusively by the mutant TrpR repressors in order to eliminate possible crosstalk between Device 2’s sensor and the endogenous tryptophan system.
Linked to the 5MT sensor is the Device 2 generator, which produces and secretes recombinant human Interleukin-6 (hIL-6).  As with Device 1, the genetic parts to the generator were split into two plasmids.  One plasmid contains the hemolysin (hly) gene cluster and the tolC gene.  The hly and tolC parts encode the hemolysin secretion system protein that allow transport outside the E. coli.  The other plasmid consists of the 5MT sensor linked to hIL-6 tagged with the hemolysin signal sequence.  This signal sequence tags hIL-6 to be transported out of the E. coli by the hemolys"

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Today, it will be turns of my younger brothers and sisters, we believe that I should be responsible for helping them. In the early days of this team, we help them to build the team, and introduced the concept of genetically engineering. Not until they had set their own project and carried on did we set them free and let them to explore. Right now, we are in MIT for graduation design. It feels fascinating to return to MIT after a year, and we will meet team Tongji 2016 to witness their success!

Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"

AI-2Sensitive Promoter and LsrR
We got the results of Lsr promoter part from 2013 ATOMS iGEM team. Their results are shown below.
Inducible promoter experiment
To observe inducible promoters response, we co incubated two different bacteria. The first bacteria culture is expressing enzyme system and the second culture is including inducible promoter. At the experiment, we incubated them seperately for 16 hours and mixed them into one flask and 4 hour later, we add 0,1 mM SAH (with 10x PBS containing %1 BSA). Incubate with SAH for one day and, took 2 ml of liquid culture to santrifuge tube.Centrifuged it. We saw the red color at the pellet as you see below.
So, it means the enzyme system is working and inducible promoter is succesfully induced from AI-2.
Toehold-Trigger RNA-GFP
PSB1C3-Toehold-GFP/Trigger RNA CLONING
We cloned these two IDT G-Block genes into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and TnrA-pAlst-RFP G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, Toehold-GFP’s band should be at 1294 bp line and Trigger RNA’s should be at 443.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check as a second control of cloning. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," hours of                             dialysis, trace amounts of unidentified by-products could be observed in the NMR spectrum. After                             one week of dialysis, no more trace amounts of any reactants or byproducts can be observed. The                             obtained spectrum matches with the one reported in the literature (8) . The spectrum of purified                             dextran can be seen in the hydrogel results .
Polymerization of methacrylated dextran
To form the hydrogel, the methacrylated dextran polymers are crosslinked by radical                             polymerisation in water. The polymerisation is initiated by tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)                             and ammonium persulfate (APS). TEMED catalyses the homolytic scission of APS to generate                             radicals which crosslink the methacrylate groups, resulting in the formation of a hydrogel. APS                             and TEMED are both flammable and irritable. Because TEMED is a catalyst, we only work with                             small amounts of the substance (10 microliter at a time) using pipets, reducing the risks                             associated with this compound. TEMED is vital for the liberation of radicals from APS. In the                             absence of TEMED, polymerisation at room temperature by solely APS is slow, so at -20°C the                             polymerisation would be even slower (5) .
Recently, an alternative approach to crosslinking methacrylated dextran polymers into a hydrogel                             is has been developed, using radiation instead of the APS TEMED system. This approach                             circumvents the use of toxic crosslinkers. If the methacrylated dextran monomers are pure,                             the crosslinked hydrogel is devoid of unreacted small molecules and no further purification                             is necessary. Additionally, if a high enough radiation dose is applied, typically 25 kGy, the                             gel is sterilized simultaneously allowing immediate seeding. Crosslinking by radiation is                             therefore a very promising option for dextran hydrogel synthesis on an industrial scale (7) .
Hydrogel leakage test
1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to verify that during storage in                             demineralized water, no dextran or other starting products leak from the hydrogel. Trace                             amounts of organic residue were detected but could not be assigned. Besides the solvent peak,                             there is no overlap between the spectra of DMAP, GMA and that of the storage water as can be                             seen below.

Figure 14: Blueprint for our remediation raft
Such a solution has to be engineered cleverly. Robust to environmental influences, expendable, modular and handy, even when in use. It must provide an ideal environment for the moss to grow and set off an alert if such a setting is no longer provided.
Our answer to that is the remediation raft.
It consists of a triangular shaped tube in which a felt cloth is stretched. As a float, the raft raises and falls with the water level, so the cloth is always kept on the water surface. Our experiments showed that felt is a very good matrix for the moss to grow on and its roots maintain stable on the fibers.  The light weight and handy size make it mobile and and transportable and a higher quantity of rafts can easily arranged to a honeycombed structure. That makes remediation rafts very applicable at any location. In ponds, lakes and rivers; any scale is thinkable.

One advantage of our raft is that it works quite autonomic. Once the moss is installed it filters until it's ""saturated"", assumed that the environmental parameters fit and a proper living space is provided. The main goal of our measurement device is to monitor these environmental parameters in real time.  Since the filter's costs should be kept as low as possible, the usage of ordinary lab measurement tools is limited. Looking one step ahead it is conceivable to use"

Their team had novel ideas on their BioBricks, resulting in their well reputation.  Following was related introduction on the new idea of BioBricks by Jingwei.  In a word, BioBrick standard biological parts are DNA sequences consisting of a cleavage site and a specific function sequence.  (BioBrick standard biological parts are DNA sequences of defined structure and function; they share a common interface and are designed to be composed and incorporated into living cells to construct new biological systems.)  As all our members are the first time to get in touch with this conception, it caused heated discussion about the main structure and the process of constructing and composition of BioBricks.
Later, An gave a detailed introduction on primer design, combining his own experience in the laboratory.  In addition, he pointed out some problems when using those two Endonucleases, which would be of great help in the experiments following.
Based on this background knowledge, we portrayed the blueprint of our research ideas.  Our goal was to improve the Salmonella we have.  In other words, besides keeping its advantage of having anticancer effect, we want to diminish the damage it would cause to normal cells and increase its specifity significantly.  In addition, we aim to make Salmonella a universal element that could be inserted into other bacterial cells.
Guided by the idea above, we decided to divide our work based on several parts: the invasion mechanism of Salmonella, immune mechanism, and chemical reaction mechanism.  We hope that after comprehending the basic knowledge, we could come up with our own unique ideas.
5.29(all) Today, we had a deep discussion with our lead teacher, Pro. Zichun Hua.  He advised us to adjust the way of reading documents.  We decided to divide  our team into 5 groups focusing separately on the following aspects based on the review Engineering the Perfect (bacterial) Cancer Therapy: specific bacterial targeting of tumors, intratumoral penetration, native bacterial cytotoxicity, expression of anti-cancer agents, and gene-triggering strategies detection of bacterial therapies.  Each group has two students to work together on researching on the related documents on that specific project, and show the others their conclusion and comprehension.

(B) Agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis of BBa_K2471000 compared with NEB Quick-Load® Purple 2-Log DNA Ladder (0.1 - 10.0 kb), where the highlighted bands correspond to approximately 3,000 base pairs.
The bacteria Erwinia amylovora was transformed by electroporation, with this new BioBrick. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel (12%) was performed in order to corroborate that the protein of interest was indeed expressed, as this is what was theoretically proposed based on the previous biographical review. The general methodology (to see specifications visit protocols section ) involved a growth curve of the bacteria; also, a sample was taken every hour (0 - 8 hours) and stored in refrigeration to later perform total protein extraction; the protein molecular weight marker used was BIO-RAD Precision Plus Protein™ Dual Color Standards.
To calculate the molecular weight of the protein, the sequence provided by the iGEM Parts Registry for BBa_C0060 was taken and introduced in ExPASy - Translate tool, which generated the open reading frame in amino acids. This peptidic sequence was then analyzed in ExPASy - ProtParam tool, where a molecular weight of 30.32026 kDa was calculated.
Figure 2. SDS-PAGE (12%) of Erwinia amylovora transformed with BBa_K2471000.
As shown in Figure 1, there is a band present at the approximate weight of 30 kDa from the fourth hour onwards. As a point of comparison, SDS-PAGE of wild Erwinia amylovora was also carried out. However, no banding was seen whatsoever. We think that this happened because the protocol used is not specifically designed for this bacteria, and since Erwinia amylovora forms a very complex biofilm (Koczan et al., 2009), the cell lysis was not carried out correctly; and thus, neither did the protein extraction. Similarly, we propose that the SDS-PAGE shown in Figure 1, where the protein of interest is expressed, was carried out correctly because of the protein's"

pPL-PCB from UT Austin successfully transformed into Shewanella (p15a ori)
pCph1-envZ-pprotet did not transform into Shewie (ColE1 ori)
The ligated p45-mtrA plasmid did not successfully mutate and/or transform into the ultracompetetent cells.  This implies that we should focus our efforts on mtrB as it does not require a mutation.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," ) we tried to further improve the TALEs, so that they are more useful to us and the general iGEM community, by codon optimizing the TALEs for E. coli. We also took out the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on the C-terminus of the TALEs.
These parts were also designed in a way so that they could be used for a wide variety of applications. There is a KasI restriction site incorporated immediately following the TALE. This introduces the chemically inert amino acids, alanine and glycine, which are what the linker is made of and would not disrupt the functionality of either the TALE or the protein it is fused to. This allows other teams to easily switch out the TALE in the part with their own engineered TALE. This means that our system can potentially be used as a platform technology. By designing a TALE specific to any DNA target site, any one can use this technology to sense their DNA of interest.
Figure 5: Parts we submitted and used for characterization of TALEs.
Results
TALE Target Sequences
We produced specific DNA target sequences for both TALE A [A] and TALE B [B] . We designed primers that would produce these target sequences in addition to about 480bp of junk DNA (to facilitate cloning) in a PCR reaction. Our target sequences were inserted into a pSB1C3 backbone. Our verification digest of the target sequences is shown in Figure 15. The backbone is the highest band at around 2070bp and our target sequences are represented by the lowest bands at around 500bp. These target sequences were sent for sequencing and have been sequence verified.
Figure 6. Verification digest of minipreps of transformed mutated TALE B and non mutated TALE A and TALE B target sequences and BBa_J04500 cut with AflII and PstI. All of the TALE target sequences lanes except the twelfth lanes show bands at 500bp and 2100bp, the TALE target sequences and backbone are expected at 501bp and 2070bp. No contamination is observed in the negative control without DNA. No unexpected sized bands are seen. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Once the individual target sequences were made, we designed new primers to create a target sequence construct with both the target sequences together. We did a KAPA PCR to produce our linear product. The PCR product consisted of the two target sequences, with about 200bp of junk DNA in between"
Tsinghua,2009,Team:Tsinghua#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," the exact mechanism by which miRNAs bring about translational silencing of their targets. Recent publications indicate that this much-disputed topic might in fact be close to its resolution[21]. Therapeutic strategies based on modulation of microRNA (miRNA) activity hold great promise due to the ability of these small RNAs to potently inﬂuence cellular behavior[6].
Cancer Gene Therapy
As a primary threat of human health, cancer causes about 13% of all human deaths[7]. According to the American Cancer Society, 7.6 million people died from cancer in the world during 2007[8]. Current treatments often have far-reaching negative side effects[9]. The systemic toxicity of chemotherapy regimens still often result in acute and delayed nausea, mouth ulcerations and mild cognitive impairments[10]. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck afflicts approximately 500,000 patients per year. The first-line treatment, chemotherapy, induces a response in only 30–40% of patients, and tumors frequently recur. Alternative cancer therapy approaches have been based on oncolytic viruses, which selectively attack tumor, but not normal, cells. One of these, ONYX-015, was initially tested in a Phase I clinical trial in April 1996. In this issue, Khuri et al. report that ONYX-015, when combined with chemotherapy, promotes tumor regression in patients with recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck[11].

Achievements
We have:
Designed and constructed the first Lightning Cell Display (iLCD) , a fast and responsive digital imaging system based on living cells, which is able to produce an animated image of up to 144 pixels from a given electrical stimulus.
Built the first Light Emitting Cell (LEC) , opening the gate to the use of electricity as a signal mediator in Synthetic Biology works.
Developed an integrative experimental system to control the LECs, which is able to apply a precise voltage (between 0V-24V) during a precise period of time (with intervals as small as 20 ms.) controlled by a computer. The experimental device was integrated with a continuous luminometer in order to measure the light emission as a function of these parameters.
Precisely characterized the LEC , studying the factors that can be tuned (like voltage and shock time) and proving in a wide range of experiments that aequorin-engineered yeast can be stimulated with electric current. From these works we have established that the refreshing time of our LEC is of about 10 seconds placing lots of importance on our thoroughfully detailed BioBrick regarding future works.
Built a model to describe the calcium dynamics in yeast, and its response to electrical stimuli. The model demonstrate its capability to describe the performed experiments and and allows the determination of critical parameters of the process like membrane impendancy or conductance. Additionally, a stochastic model was developed in order to study posible aleatory process that could have an influence in the performance of the system.
Developed an impressive Human Practices part of the project. Resulting in the publication of the book Sins, Ethics and Biology . Result of the review of more than 50 Human Practices articles and the interview to experts.
Achieved the largest survey ever made on Synthetic Biology, which is a good occasion to thank each single contributor to the survey, specially those who described their definition of Synthetic Biology .

Summary 2012-04-20
Attendees: Tom S., Rico S., Tom O., Kevin S., Mario K., Tobias P., Kerstin W., Xenia A., Barbara M., Katharina T., Stefan G., Maria K., Tarek S., Christopher K., Sascha L., Laura R. 1. reminder: all team members have to register for wiki! 2. presentation of wiki page and editing of wiki (Tom)  Presentation was uploaded! 3. deepening of the project
A. magnetosomes (Christopher): idea was rejected, preparation/creation of knock-out mutants would have been too time consuming and can thus not be realized and additionally a lot of genetic know-how would have been needed
B. hypermutation by protein E2 of Hepatitis C Virus (Rico)
protein E2 leads to hypermutation in B-cells by activation of AID via CD81 (activation induced Deaminase) idea und goal of the project:
increasing antibody -activity and specificity + adjustable hypermutation by AID
binding of virus-antigen to antibody on surface of beads have to be selected
cells to be used: CHO
possible stages of the project:
induction of hypermutation
transfection of cells with antibody
transfection of AID + detection/proof of hypermutation
binding of virus particles to antibody on surface
Establishment of selection system
Which steps can be realized during the project?
antibody on cell surface?
can virus bind?
to do:
possible usage of camellid antibody?
is a switchable expression of surface-antibody by Tet on/off- or Cre-Lox-system possible?
C. Adeno-assoziated Virus = AAV (Tarek)
idea:
using AAV as vector, transforming transgenes (GOI) between ITRs (inverted terminal repeats) of AAV
multiplication of transgenes would be possible via helper plasmid and not non-pathogenic AAV helper plasmids
Advantage: good purification possible, expression can be controlled Disadvantage: expression ""without help"" slowly, possible damage of genes by undirected integra-tion

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Application#Rollout_-_-_TEXT.html," in a detectable signal. The already made affinity body library, containing biosensors that theoretically can detect all possible pathogens, is screened for a suitable one for the new disease. This screening can be done within a few weeks. This selected sensor binds to the pathogen with the correct affinity and specificity. You can read here how this screening is performed. That’s it! A new whole-cell diagnostic test is now made.
After the Mantis biosensor is adapted to recognize the new pathogen, this initial strain will be shipped to the place where it is needed, for example to the central cell bank of a country. From there, the strain is maintained and used to grow the biosensor on a large scale. It can then be distributed accordingly to the remote areas.
When using the diagnostic test, the new cells are put into the Mantis device which gives a readout of the signal. This device contains, next to the disease-detecting cells, a negative control, and a positive control which detects IgG. The device can be re-used over and over and costs below the upper price limit the WHO determined. More information about the Mantis device, including a cost estimation, can be found on the device page . We also demonstrated how this device will be used on the Demonstrate page. Below, an infographic can be found describing the benefits of Mantis.
Step 3.  Large-scale production
After the new Mantis biosensor is made, it is produced on large scale. The production of current diagnostic tests is mostly based on enzyme purification, which is costly in resources and time [1]. We learned from dr. Tatiana Mingote Ferreira de Azara, Health Surveillance Secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Health that the current production of diagnostic kits is not sufficient for the whole population of Brazil. A current bottleneck is thus the limited capacity of production, and not the costs. This means scale-up of the production process is an important factor to consider.
Since our biosensor does not need protein purification steps, this decreases its costs and production times. Hence, whole-cell biosensors are relatively easy and cheap to produce [2, 3]. For example, production and purification of antibodies can take up to 100 days [4], whereas a large batch of Mantis cells can be grown within a few days.
Dr. Erwan Piriou
Laboratory advisor Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)

Letting XbaI doing its job during the night, gave a positive outcome. These parts ( J23032 and B0015 ) were then cut with EcoRI, separated on gel and purified. Now that we had some useful digests, we could start some ligations: C0040 + B0015 , J23109 + J23032 , I712074 + J23032 and E0022 + B0015 . After the previous success of the overnight digest with XbaI, we made some new ones: J23032 , B0015 , J23022 , B0032 and F1610 .
The digest of R0084 + B0032 with EcoRI and SpeI was loaded on a gel, but no fragment of 145bp was observed. This means that the ligation probably failed.
We punched out the DNA of the new memory and checked the concentration with the nanodrop. Despite the doubtful results we"

To make navigation as easy as possible, we've used the default iGEM pages and spent a long time thinking about the structure of the rest of our site. The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Gut_-_-_TEXT.html," cell stress. The inability of cells to effectively manage cellular stress over time has been linked to cellular ageing and age-related diseases (Haigis and Yankner, 2010; Poljšak and Milisav, 2012). Cellular stress leads to deregulation of intracellular processes, as both the structure and function of macromolecules are compromised. Furthermore, high amounts of ROS have been implicated in cellular stress and ageing (Poljšak and Milisav, 2012).
We performed an additional assay expressing lycopene under the mNARK promoter, to test if the cells could survive longer under hypoxia-induced stress. E. coli cells transformed with this construct were compared with the wild type TOP10 E. coli (W/T) monitoring growth and division via optical density (OD) at 600 nm, at specific time points – 3 hours and 16 hours following withdrawal of oxygen.
mNARK-Lycopene cells had a higher OD compared to the wild type cells. Cells exposed to hypoxia were also compared with the cells that were grown with oxygen. Most cells still survived despite the presence of hypoxia.
Furthermore, with regards to W/T cells, a depletion in the oxygen concentration caused a drop in cell growth and division, as reflected in decreased OD measurements. However, growth and division of mNARK-Lyco-containing cells was maintained in oxygen-deficient environment during the 16-hour time test period.
This shows that our BioBrick construct (mNARK-Lyco) was able to ensure cell growth and division in oxygen-deficient environment.
The mNARK-Lycopene device is induced by oxidative stress and produces lycopene as means to 'mop up' the oxidative stress in the environment, in the form of a probiotic.
Under various stresses, the mNARK-Lycopene device promotes E. coli growth. Characterisation was achieved by comparing the performance of the BioBrick against wild type E. coli.
Initially, the growth of mNARK-Lycopene was compared with the growth of wild type E. coli. The mNARK-Lycopene cells substantially outperformed the wild type cells, reaching a final OD600 of around 0.45 and, potentially, still rising, while the growth of the wild type cells had clearly levelled off over the equivalent time period and had began to die, reaching a final OD600 of around 0.12.
After carrying out the positive control, the mNARK-Lycopene cells were tested under conditions of simulated oxidative stress, with the LB media containing "

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism to fit our needs. Starting a regular type of plant, we can achieve different final phenotypes. For example, we can have plants with differents flower colors.
Nonetheless, in the integrated human practices, we contacted with Marta Vázquez to obtain knowledge about greenhouse necessities. As it can be seen in its interview  with more detail, it could suppose and advantage obtaining a higher control over the plant. It could be interesting to put all the flowers of a given greenhouse at the same time of its lifecycle. In this case, the ornamental plants have to integrate the optogenetic switch in order to induce the required processes. As a consequence, it is obtained a higher production and a reduction of losses.
SENTINEL PLANTS
Combining control over climatic conditions and Synthetic Biology, ChatterPlant strives increasing to the maximum the control of the crop through distinct color protein expression. In this context, our project could be applied through the innovative concept of sentinel plants. With the aim of controlling those conditions, we propose a diagonal system of sentinel plants in order to cover the maximum area possible (Figure 1). Sentinel plants will be able to warn us if any plant suffers a given stress prematurely.
Figure 1. Graphic representation of a possible sentinel plants distribution.
Pathogen infections are the major cause of diseases in greenhouse crops. Being aware of its repercussions, our team suggests that the entire number of plants located inside the ChatterBox incorporate the pathogen detection system to increase detection control. Bearing that in mind, we solved our problems using a steroid injector in order to trigger a color code genetic circuit that accelerates a response and allows applying corrective measures sooner.
The main problem with current preventive systems is that they normally deal with applying pesticides or fertilisers over crops, without even knowing if there’s a real threat to the plants. This means a major waste of resources. Besides this, residues ultimately pollute and damage the environment. Furthermore, identifying plant damage requires plenty of time. This one is critical since some vectors and deficiencies spread among the whole crop rapidly and produce significant symptoms. Do we have any way to know whether the plants are stressed or not?
Sentinel plants seem the solution: They simplify the stress diagnosis task. Changes in leaves color will make the detection easier. Sentinels would be another plant in the crop, but they react to different stimuli. Distributing them over the land will make easier to know which regions are problematic. According to the number, type and position of sentinels that show a certain color, farmers can decide which solution has to apply and how big the problem is.

Figure 5. Final construct of the plasmid for rTEV protease digestion assay. Linker2 is a 7aa linker that can be specifically digested by rTEV protease. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein domain linker mentioned in Figure.4. The whole INPNC-MVN-mRFP fusion protein is expressed under the constitutive promoter J23105.
To make our results persuasive, we also constructed 3 control groups: C1, C2 and C3. Plasmid C1 has the Linker2 shifted to Linker1 so that it can not be digested by rTEV protease. Plasmid C2 has the INPNC and Linker2 sequence deleted so that MVN-mRFP is not displayed on the cell surface. Plasmid C3 has the whole coding sequence from INPNC to mRFP deleted. We also have a blank control group with no cells added.
Figure 6. Gene circuits of the control groups. (a) Plamsid C1 differs to the original plasmid in that Linker2 is shifted to Linker3, which is a 8aa flexible protein domain linker that cannot be cut by rTEV protease. (b) Plasmid C2 has the coding sequence of INPNC and Linker2 deleted. (c) Plasmid C3 is a plasmid with only the promoter, RBS and terminator left on the vector.
Cells of the experiment group and control groups were cultured to the exponential phase. Afterwards rTEV protease as well as buffer were added to the cell cultures according to the protocol from the company. The cell cultures were co-incubated with rTEV protease and centrifuged afterwards to separate the cells and MVN-mRFP that was cut down by the protease. The fluorescence intensity of the supernatant could stand for the amount of MVN-mRFP and was measured by microplate reader (For experimental details please see the Protocols).
The same procedure was applied to every group for 3 times. The average results are shown in the chart below (see Chart 1), and the fluorescence intensity data is shown in A.

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," subjects: out of about one hundred ideas, we chose twenty of them. The selection was made according to many parameters such as the existing scientific publications on the subject, which ones have already been done in iGEM or what was feasible in synthetic biology and the given time we had.
We also organized our research around an ethical reflection on the realization of our project. For example, we thought of fruits that can synthesize anti-fungal proteins. These would have allowed the fruits to remain of very good quality over a long period. However, we did not want to release GMOs into the environment so we abandoned this project.
February 21st, 2018: Let’s play!
Hoping to develop educational games, we wanted to set up a fun way to do popular science. We thought about organizing an Escape Game and attended a conference organized by Le Catalyseur on the creation and implementation of this type of games.
We were able to talk with an escape game creator, Elise DESPLAS who is a project creator at Délire d'encre (escape GAME Itinerant).
During this meeting, we met two scientifics professors interested in our project, Cathy Metge and Aurélien Despierris, who are working in Sciences and Technologies for Laboratory high schools . We decided to collaborate with them.
LOGBOOK: MARCH
March 1st, 2018: Fight for your topic!
In order to deepen the subjects still in list, we organized ourselves in groups of two to defend as much as possible our ideas. We started thinking about gathering topics.
Very inspired by the game Microbioworld developed last year, we wanted to improve it by making some changes based on players feedbacks but we also tried to develop it as an educational tool at the national scale.
March 5th, 2018: Spread synthetic biology worldwide
After taking into account the opinions of experts met during the convention held by Le Catalyseur, we decided that the escape game was too long, expensive and difficult to transpose to the Giant Jamboree for a team of 8 students. We prefered to focus on a Microbioworld update as well as on a collaboration with STL high schools. These projects enabled us to reach a larger number of people and to disseminate knowledge and information on synthetic biology throughout France.
In parallel, 8 subjects were still in the race! We asked the opinion of many experts to refine our ideas and determine if our subjects were feasible or not. For example, we asked for the assistance of Pili, a company working on dyes for a subject about"

Project Design and Wet Lab Experiments
The BananaGuard project consists of multiple wet lab modules. Jeremy constructed the fusaric acid sensor while Wen and Tjaša worked on the expression of fungal growth inhibitors . Tjaša focused on chitinase expression while Wen dedicated her time to the other three compounds. The fusaric acid resistance in the biological control agent was Rik’s project. Marlène tested the fungal inhibition in vivo in the greenhouse .
Teresa and Kevin worked on the horizontal gene transfer inhibition and Max, Michiel and Marlène (M&M&M) worked on the Kill-Switch . Max was also responsible for in situ experiments and promoter design.
Walter worked in the wet lab to obtain production kinetic data for the genome-scale metabolic model of Pseudomonas putida.
The iGEM team Wageningen also participated in the Interlab study . Marlène and Rik performed the corresponding experiments.
Modeling
Walter took care of modeling aspects related to metabolic stress , while Bob modeled the killswitch and the behaviour of the system under cell division .
Human Practice
The iGEM team Wageningen established contact between the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and all Dutch iGEM teams. Bob was their main contact person and Jeremy organized the national meet-up at which RIVM participated. For the collaboration with Synenergene an application scenario was generated. Miguel, Max, Rik and Wen were involved in this task. Miguel took charge of everything interview related. Bob appeared in both videos for human outreach.

Cornell,2011,Team:Cornell#Protocol_-_-_TEXT.html," and rinse with SU-8 developer, then with IPA and finally dry thoroughly with the air gun under the hood.  A good drying technique is to aim and hold the gun directly in the center of the wafer.  Be careful, gun can be at a high pressure resulting in you dropping your wafer and having to start from the beginning again.
Place your clean wafer into your labeled case and take it outside to the PDMS station.
Those remaining in the clean room must clean up!  All solutions must go into the assigned waste container.  Rinse glass containers with soap and water in the sink.  Set them to dry on clean room paper towels. Remove undeveloped SU-8 50 on your tweezers by wiping it with developer.
Making PDMS
This section is performed in the BME Lab outside the clean room. Safety glasses, lab coats and gloves are required.
Weigh out 5g of hardener (small bottle) in a plastic cup, next add 50 g of base (large tub) to make the PDMS.  A 1:10 ratio (by weight) of hardener: base is the recommended ratio that should be used. Typically, 55g of PDMS is sufficient to cover the bottom of the standard Petri plate that you will use.
Beat the base/hardener mixture with a plastic fork (like beating an egg) vigorously until completely mixed and aerated (at least 5 minutes), the mixture should be white with lots of air bubbles.  To be safe, beat the PDMS until your lab group comes out with the wafer.
Secure your master wafer onto your Petri dish with some silicone glue and place in the 60C oven until PDMS is well aerated.
Pour your PDMS mixture in the center of your wafer for an even coat.  Place your dish in the vacuum chamber to remove air bubbles.
Turn on the vacuum pump and watch your Petri dish.
When the bubble mixture looks like it will overflow, stop the pump.
Close the inlet/outlet by turning the black valve. Unhook the clear vacuum tubing.
Open the inlet/outlet and let the air out.
Restart the vacuum pump and repeat these steps (~3-4x) until all bubbles are gone.
This should take you ~15 minutes.
Make sure your dishes and lids are labeled.

Why iGEM:
I've always wanted to do iGEM. I missed out on it during my undergraduate degree and when I saw that the postgraduate team is being introduced I thought it was an excellent opportunity. I was drawn to iGEM in the first place due to the chance to apply my knowledge and skills learnt at university to do some cool science.
Shahin Heshmatifar
Student at UCL studying a MSc in Biochemical Engineering. Previously studied an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences at University of Westminster.
Why iGEM:
I had followed iGEM distantly during my undergraduate degree. I found  its concept and deliverable very interesting. After starting my post graduate degree at UCL, I found that there will be a post grad iGEM competition this year. I therefore decided to grab this opportunity by participating in the project to apply and enhance my knowledge in molecular and synthetic biology.
Meet our supervisors!

Prof. Chen Gang, the Chef of the School of Energy and Power Engineering, HUST, for instructing our work and supporting our team fund and transportation fee.
Mr. Mo Bufei, for helping us construct our wiki before wiki freeze.  Team WHU, for helping us construct the biobrick.
Special Thanks
Sincerely,we express our gratefulness to all the members in Team WHU-China. As our team is not from the College of Life Science  and Technology in HUST University, we found some troubles while finishing our experiments. When we could not find anyone for help  immediately, however, the Team WHU-China gave us a hand. They provided us a lab and gave us instructions during experiments, and  finally helped us construct our biobrick（BBa_K1551000) successfully.
What we did
Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
-All researchers have been trained with lab safety protocols and conducted the experiment strictly following the safety protocols. No one was injured or infected while working on our project. The microorganisms used in our project are T-roseum ATCC28210, which are not toxic or pathogenic. No lab waste was released to the environment before sterilization,too.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
-No. None of the BioBrick parts we made pose any safety problems we can foresee. None of the parts we made produce toxic or pathogenic protein, and all parts are found in common bacterial species.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
- The OILCROP RESEARCH INSTITUTE, CHINESE ACADEMY OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES makes sure that every project is evaluated of its bio-safety issues before initiation. The head of Institute and our advisors approved that our project would not raise safety problems, etc.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
- iGEM could make every team sign a safety form when applying, in order for all teams to follow a same set of safety rules.
Total Innovation for Synthetic Biology
In the initiation of our Project, we found our target part was not sequenced yet. As a result, the Project got swamped. So we chose to"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#characterization#mls_-_-_TEXT.html," Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin for ImageJ image processing, scatter plots of the green intensities (y-axis) and red intensities (x axis), Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's correlation coefficient were generated.
Result
Figure 1. MLS directs GFP into mitochondria. When MLS is added to the N-terminus of GFP, the GFP was directed to the mitochondria in the cells, giving patches of GFP signal that overlapped with the signals from MitoTracker®. When MLS is not added to the GFP, the GFP signal can be seen scattered all around inside the cell. Scale bar = 10µm.
Figure 2. Scatter plots of fluorescence intensities of green (y axis) and red (x axis) by construct. It showed that the BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP construct had a linear relationship of green intensities and red intensities while the GFP generator alone had no relationship. Pearson's correlation coefficient (rp) and Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) were determined using the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin (French et al., 2008) for ImageJ with a threshold of 0 and listed for each image.
Figure 3. Calculated mean Pearson's (rp) and Spearman's (rs) correlation coefficients for each construct. The coefficients were generated using ImageJ software and specific plugins. For every batch of transfected cells, four samples were used for quantification. Experimental BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP: coefficients were close to 1, good colocalization; GFP: Coefficients were close to 0, poor colocalization. Error bars show standard deviation.
Conclusion
The result shows that the colocalization of GFP signal and mitotracking dye is high for the experimental construct of MLS BioBrick. It can be concluded that the MLS can function well and successfully bring recombinant proteins into mitochondria.

Collaboration with PITT iGEM Team 2018
We have been mentored by the PITT iGEM team since our iGEM program began in September 2017.  They are veterans in the iGEM sphere and gave us  a lot of insight on what the competition will entail.  During our first meeting with them,  they taught us a plasmid game and gave us some insight on the iGEM competition.   Throughout the year, they would visit the lab and help us with some of our experiments and updating our Wiki.  In the winter of 2018, two members of the PITT iGEM team helped us with completing our salt sensor data. The biosensor from the CMUQ 2017  iGEM team was selected for improved characterization (Part: BBa_K2467002).  Dorsin and Vivian came to help us with figuring out the molarities, concentrations of the reagents, and graphing the data.  The experiment showed that the optimal salt concentration for growth of E.Coli, which is an improvement of the biosensor of the CMUQ iGEM team.  During the summer, the PITT iGEM team attended our program practices and would help us with anything that we needed experimentally and technically.  Some of the PITT team members would help us with constructing our Wiki and other PITT team members would help us with troubleshooting our experiments."

Our future plan
1.
We should reproduce all of the experiments that we have done this summer to make sure the results are credible.
2.
We will optimize the whole strategy to enhance the adsorption efficiency by changing pH, temperature, reaction time of crosslinking and clearance. (The efficiency is only about 60% without further optimization)
3.
According to the results for the adsorption of 13nM uranyl, the polymer network exhibited a good ability in a simulated seawater environment. We could thus also look into other usage scenarios of Uranium Reaper, such as bio-mining and uranium enrichment.
4.
Exchange of the SUP module for other functional proteins. For example, we could integrate proteins which could bind other heavy metals such as mercury so that the polymer network could be used to treat other kinds of pollution as well.
5.
We could assemble enzyme systems behind the SpyTag backbone to create a production plant in vitro. In the protein polymeric network, the concentration of enzymes could be increased and the efficiency of biocatalysis may consequently also be enhanced.
6.
If we optimize the number of SpyTag or SpyCatcher modules per protein monomer, as well as the working concentrations of proteins, we may make protein-3D printing using the Spy Crosslinking Network come true.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid"

Analysis of Results
Analysis
The first three lanes produced expected results: pBAD33 and pBAD/HisB being “blank” plasmid backbones, the pSB-1C3-abijk lane giving two bands corresponding to similar sizes (being pSB-1C3 and abijk insert respectively).
All the other lanes seem to be showing only products in the 2kb range, which corresponds roughly to the size of the pSB-1C3 backbone, but the sizes are not uniform. Nonetheless, we know that the plasmid extraction step was carried out correctly as it did yield products approximating what we were looking for.
If it was a matter of the ligation step carried out on 23/06 failing entirely, we should be expecting a uniform row of backbone bands. Instead, there are minor but noticeable size variations between each band which cannot be successfully explained by failed digestion/ligation. It is thus speculated that the pSB-1C3 stock we received from iGEM HQ had suffered from varying extents of DNA degradation such that the restriction enzyme cut sites on their ends were no longer.

Figure 2: MALDI-Results for the purified HA4-RpoZ protein.
Figure 3: MALDI-Results for the purified SH2-cI protein.
MALDI-TOF features two very definite masses for both single purificated proteins HA4-RpoZ and SH2-cI. If we compare these masses with the expectet ones,the masses 22.2 kDa and 24.98 kDa are detectable. But next to them two masses are very present with   about half of the expectet masses, therefore, 11.1 kDa for HA4-RpoZ and a very high amount of 12.49 kDa for SH2-cI. In MALDI-TOF measurement the proteins are ionised by a implemented laser. Through this ionisation it is possible, that beside only one created

charge for your protein, two or even three charges are possible. Whereas on the x-axes of the MALDI created diagramm the mass per charge is plotted, the accurate kDa-size is divided by the amount of charges on the protein. Therefore, the two very high present masses    different from the expectet mass are the same protein with two instead of one charge on it. The MALDI results verificate the results of the IMPACT Kit and evince, that HA4-RpoZ as well as SH2-cI are really purificated with a very high concentration.   If the MALDI results of the purificated SH2-cI are compared with the results of the purificated SH2-cI after the affinity chromatography the digramms are broadly the same except of two peaks. It was detected that the two peaks have protein masses of 22,14 kDa and 11,07 kDa.   A look back to the masses of the purificated HA4 protein, nearly the same two peaks are detected as well.  This is a very big clue on the fact, that some HA4 proteins are also in the same protein solution then SH2"

Difficult technique support
SCAU China iGEM–wiki support
This summer, we contacted with iGEM team SCAU-China and had a meeting with them. In the meeting, the members of SCAU-China shared us some experience about team building, doing experiments, building models and making wiki.
And we learnt about that in their project, rice was used as the material to produce astaxanthin, which was supposed to be an economic way to produce astaxanthin. They wanted to know what will be the cost of the astaxanthin and we also had an interest on this, so we proposed to make a comparison of the costs for astaxanthin productions in different method. Finally, we could find that rice could be a great kind of material to produce astaxanthin because it could lower the price of astaxanthin greatly and made astaxanthin more accessible to the public.

The bands were observed at the expected size of 1600 bp for CsgA_tag_RFP and the empty pSB1C3 plasmid at 2100 bp for all samples. The sample preparation of sequencing was done following the sequencing protocol. Sequencing was done by adding 25pmol forward and reverse primer and 500ng plasmid DNA in 10µL. The CsgA_RFP, CsgA_His_RFP, CsgA_HA_RFP, and CsgA_Spytag_RFP.
CsgA and I13504 were grown from cyrostock in 5ml LB with 5 µL Cam overnight at 37°C.
05/08/2015
We isolated plasmid the overnight cultures CsgA and I13504, with a final concentration of 120ng/µL and 141 ng/µL respectively.
The plasmids and Spycatcher were then restricted by using the following:
Spycatcher:  EcoRI / PstI
CsgA:  SpeI / PstI
I13504:  XbaI / PstI
With a final volume of 50 µL. We left the restriction for 1 hour.
We then did a Colony PCR of the transformations made 03/08/2015 which were the following:pSB4K5_CsgA_GFP, , pSB4K5_CsgA_His_GFP, pSB4K5_CsgA_Spy_GFP,pSB4K5_CsgA_HA_GFP, pSB4K5_CsgA_Mfp5_GFP, pSB4K5_CsgA_Mfp3_GFP, pSB4K5_CsgEFG, pSB1C3_CsgEFGThis was done by using the PCR mastermix (Qiagen), FW2 & Rv primers, dNTP’s and Milli-Q. Reaction volumes were 50µL per sample, with 8 colonies per transformation analysed.
From the transformations CsgA_His_GFP and Csg_HA_GFP both two colonies had correct inserts and were grown in LB+ CAM overnight.
07/08/2015
For the cloning of CsgEFG a alternative protocol was used called the “TA cloning protocol”. We used this protocol to ligate the CsgEFG into a backbone, since previous attempts hadn’t worked.

Furthermore, we introduce HiCT - High throughput protocols for circular polymerase extension Cloning and Transformation - a new standard for the assembly of combinatorial gene libraries ( RFC 99 ).
Introduction
Most modules of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways consist of three domain types: condensation, adenylation and thiolation domain (see Figure 1a ), also called peptidyl-carrier-protein domain (PCP)-domain (reviewed in
)). Remarkably, precisely this order of domains is highly conserved among different NRPS pathways except for the very first and last module of each NRPS. In the initial module, the A-domain is always followed by a T-domain. The last module of an NRPS usually ends with a TE-domain.  During the process of non-ribisomal peptide (NRP) synthesis, a new amino acid is first adenylated by the A-domain and then bound to the T-domain via a thioester bond. The C-domain catalyzes the condensation of the substrate - which is bound to the T-domain of the previous module - and the amino acid of the next module. The T-domain itself shows no substrate specificity but acts as a carrier domain, which keeps the peptide attached to the NRPS module complex. The core element of every T-domain is a conserved 4’-phosphopanthetheinylated (4’-PPT) serine. The 4’-PPT residue is added by a 4’-Phosphopanthetheinyl-transferase (PPTase), which converts the NRPS apo-enzyme to its active holo-form (see Figure 1b ).
Figure 1: NRPS module and domain structure and activation of T-domains.        a) Basic structure of NRPS pathways Typically, a NRPS is composed of 1 to about 10 single modules, of which each consists of a  C-domain (condensation domain), an A-domain (adenylation domain) and a T-domain (thiolation  domain). Moreover, the initial module lacks the C-domain and the last module of a pathway has  an additional TE-domain (thioesterase domain), which cleaves the synthesized nonribosomal  peptide from the last T-domain.  b) Activation of NRPS modules by 4'-Phosphopanthetheinylation of the T-domain. Every NRPS module has to be activated by a "

Results
scFv constructs were created BBa_K2622004 . and checked by colony PCR and DNA sequencing . scFv synthesis was performed in a cell free system. Validation of protein expression was done by running a sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), see (Fig. 3)
Fig. 3 SDS-PAGE of scFv. GFP is used as positive control, C- chaperone DnaK.
Red arrows in the photo indicate scFv anti-vaginolysin (~27 kDa). As successful synthesis was confirmed, the next step was to check if protein folded correctly and was able to bind its antigen -  vaginolysin. We examined this by erythrocyte-lysis test, which was performed by comparing erythrocytes incubated with VLY (erythrocytes burst open) and erythrocytes incubated with VLY that was previously incubated with scFv anti-vaginolysin (less or no erythrocyte lysis). Results revealed that scFv binded to vaginolysin and inhibited cell lysis. Graph in (Fig. 4) demonstrates that scFv indeed attenuated the lysis of erythrocytes. These result prove scFv activity in IVTT system.

We then went one step further and constructed MstX-scFv_antiVLY BBa_2622038 , fusion protein, aiming to increase the stability of scFv having in mind future applications and experiments of exposing it on liposome surface. Fusion protein was expressed in E.coli cells; yellow to red arrows in (Fig. 5A) indicate MstX-scFv expression after induction with IPTG.
Finally, we expressed the protein in a cell free system (Fig. 5B) along with scFv in order to compare how well scFv accomplishes its function alone or bind"
