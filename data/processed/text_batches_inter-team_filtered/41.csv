TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Project#Entrepeneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," is still not to be made public, as this internal disclosure does not provide actual protection on the intellectual property. This meant that it still had to be protected against publication at this stage. As a team we had to decide that we can not communicate the idea to the public unless it has been decided if a patent will be pursued. We soon were invited to meet with Justin Kok, a patent officer from TU Delft, to further discuss the invention and so that he could assess whether it would meet the requirements for a patent application. Upon his approval, the next step could be taken, which was writing the patent.
How was the patent application written?
The writing of the patent application happened in close correspondence with an assigned patent attorney, who was responsible for taking our scientific input and write it in the format of a strong patent application. The legal text of a patent indeed is very different from a scientific text, and quite mind-twisting.
Who owns the patent?
Before the final document is sent it must be clarified who the owners of the patent will be. In our case, the employers of the inventors (TU Delft and NWO) share ownership rights, meaning that the inventors would not have to contribute to the costs of the patent application. As one of the students was also an inventor, things got a little more complicated. When students are involved as inventors in patent applications, they either have to sign to transfer their IP rights to the university, or they should contribute to the costs that come with the filing of our patent. In our case, the student involved chose to sign the transfer of IP rights. This means that the institutions TU Delft and NWO are the owners of the patent once granted, and that the institution will have exclusive rights regarding its licensing and selling. On October 20th, one week before the Judging Form deadline and twelve days from the Wiki-Freeze, the patent application was filed by the attorney and official confirmation of reception was given by the Dutch patent centre. From that moment on we were free to communicate our findings with the public.
Interest from industy
The farm animal sector is committed to reduce of the use of antibiotics. To realize that ambition, our detection system can help. We have presented our detection system to Hendrix Genetics . Hendrix Genetics is a multi-species animal breeding organization that invests in innovation to improve the sustainability of animal protein value chains. This includes systems to reduce the use of antibiotics. After the Giant Jamboree we will continue discussion with Hendrix Genetics on the use of our detection systems in their programs.

We have characterized and submitted 25 BioBricks which could either be used directly or serve as a universal tool ready for potential scientific or engineering use.
      Those BioBricks are divided into four groups.       1. BioBricks in Basic Parts are all basic components of the whole project. They can be assembled to carry out different tasks.       2. BioBricks in USB are our designed sequences. They can help us easily and quickly insert our target sequence and make a whole part.       3. BioBricks in Application are our complete parts.       4. BioBricks in New TAL are our newly designed TAL parts, which are robust and perform better in Golden Gate method.

UVR8
Figure 1: UVR8 as a symmetric homodimer. Upon UV-B exposure the the dimer dissociates into two monomers. [Heijde2012]
UVR8 is a plant protein first identified in Arabidopsis thaliana.  It is a photoreceptor and a crucial part in the plant stress response to UV-B (280-315 nm).  In absence of UV-B the protein occurs as a dimer [Heijde2012]. UVR8 contains tryptophane residues forming a chromophore.  In the dark state they interact with each other and thus UVR8 dimerizes.  UV-B radiation interrupts this interaction and the UVR8 dimer falls apart [Christie2012]. Downstream reactions  triggering transcription of essential proteins for the stress response cannot occur anymore [Heijde2012].
We will make use of that phenomenon by incorporating UVR8 into our system in E.coli as a UV-B responsive transcription factor. Therefore we fused UVR8 to the TetRDBD, the TetR DNA binding domain. The TetRDBD can bind to the Ptet promoter as a dimer only. Thus the UVR8 TetRDBD fusion behaves like a TetR homodimer, able to repress the Ptet promoter in the dark state. As the UVR8 dimer is broken upon UV-B radiation, the TetRDBD occurs as an inactive monomer and cannot occupy the Ptet promoter any longer. Hence transcription of the genes controled by the Ptet promoter can start.

Best Hardware Special Prize
iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.
To compete for the Best Hardware prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#kr_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology all round the world. This map was created at the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
On the map, 5 entries are located in South Korea. Three of them, two universities and one company, are near or in Daejeon, and two universities are located in Ulsan. This map may not depict an accurate picture of synthetic biology in Korea because some institutes such as Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology are not listed in the map. This may be due to the fact that information for the map is gathered from official websites, scientific literature, government reports, and journals etc. If the available information was not in English, it could have been hard for the organization to compile the data (""Synthetic biology project,"" ).
Nevertheless, the growth of synthetic biology in South Korea is still somewhat represented by the map. It had no entries for South Korea in 2009, but that has increased to five entries this year.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Not many Korean universities have been participating in the iGEM competition. From 2004 to 2012, only four Korean universities participated in the competition. Considering that there are 203 universities listed in the Korean Council for University Education website, 4 out of 203 universities is in fact a small proportion (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
The four universities are Chungbuk National University (CBNU), Korea University, Korea Advanced Institute of Technology (KAIST) , Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology. Sogang University registered in 2012, but withdrew from the competition (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
Out of the four universities CBNU has been most actively participating in the competition. It was the first Korean university and also one of the first Asian universities to participate. They first entered the iGEM competition in 2006, but did not participate again until 2009. They have participated every subsequent year. Korea University joined the competition in 2009 and KAIST in 2010, and both have competed regularly since. UNIST competed in 2011 and did not return the following year (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
Biotechnology Industry
A survey about biotechnology market in Korea published by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy, and Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization was available on-line. The statistics provided in the review may not relate directly to synthetic biology, but could provide some insight on the potential development of synthetic biology considering the fact that synthetic biology has wide applications in biotechnology industries (Hranueli, 2013).

Plates showed color for DM, SP, BB, LO, VV, SO. DT and MP are not currently showing color but maybe they will in the next couple days. Because we saw color on these plates we ordered primers to Gibson in the CBD into these constructs.
●
DT from the transformation Thursday now has colonies on it so we ran colony PCR again on this because the sequencing on it from Friday was not correct.
●
We ran 2 ul of the colony PCR on a gel so that we would know if it was the correct sequence being amplified (~1000 base pairs)
9-26-16-ChromoPCR-1his.jpg
This is a gel run of the DT colony PCR. From left to right: ladder, DT. The region amplified in DT is around 200 base pairs which is not the product we were expecting. We will send in for sequencing and see if this can help us answer what we are doing wrong with this particular chromoprotein.
●
We then ran a PCR clean up and sent in DT for sequencing using both forward and reverse primers (VF2 and VR)
●
We used 1.5 ml of the liquid cultures started from Friday to perform a small scale protein extraction. We used the soluble fraction to run a lumio green detection on. Once we ran the lumio green detection protocol we then ran it on an SDS gel and imaged it on the scanner
9-26-16-lumio-chromo.jpg
This gel shows the lumio green product ran on the 4 his-tag chromoprotein cultures started Friday. Order from left to right: benchmark ladder, SP, DM, DT, MP. The primary bands on the SP and DM columns are around 30 kDa which is higher than would be expected for a chromoprotein. All but DT appear to have bands around 25 kDA which is where we would expect to see larger bands showing our product is present.

Protein Production
Model Assumptions
LacI assumptions:
The lac operon represses by constitutively synthesizing the LacI gene product [ref1].
Here we have assumed that all the other complicated dynamical pathways are at dynamic equilibrium [ref2], and we are only considering the LacI gene.
If these effects were included, the dynamics of the entire system will be more complicated, and the outcome of the model will be different.
In a culture grown overnight, levels of LacI expression will have reached steady state. We can assume that this is the case before we add in IPTG.
IPTG assumptions:
LacI and IPTG undergo a secondary set of reactions when IPTG is added in. We assume that 1 molecule of IPTG binds to 1 molecule of LacI, creating an intermediate reaction complex:
We also assume that the concentration of IPTG we put in is below the threshold of toxicity that could significantly start killing our cells.
Literature review on IPTG
In this model we have neglected the degradation rate of IPTG and also of the [IPTG-LacI] complex.
The model
We can describe the behavior of the system with 4 ODEs. In this system, the first two equations describe the expression of LacI protein, and these will be linked to how it represses production of the protein of interest.
In the absence of IPTG the system becomes:
[Introduce system in the absence of IPTG here] click here for explanation of the equations and parameters or click here
When IPTG is introduced the system becomes:
[Introduce full system with IPTG included] and expansion to the model.  [link]

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Contributions#Main_-_-_TEXT.html,"ethics workshop.
Based on our considerations, we answered the questions in the following ways.
Ambiance We wanted to create an open discussion where there was time to progress from superficial opinions to the values that underlie them. To achieve this, it is important that:
The groups are small.
There is enough time per topic.
The groups are guided by an impartial person who keeps asking: “why?”, so that participants are forced to explain what underlies their initial statement.
Furthermore, we stressed that in a discussion:
All views are allowed to exist and be shared.
Eliminate judgments in your head.
Sharing more is better, improvise, ‘cheat the rules’ (for creativity).
All ideas created here are from the whole group, ownership cannot be claimed.
Topics
We decided to cover two topics in rounds of 30 minutes, and to leave the final half an hour open for participants to reflect on their own projects. We covered the two topics Bioluminesent trees and gene drives, because they were both topics that iGEM teams had worked on in the past ( Cambridge 2010, Minnesota 2016 ) and that could have implications that were not limited to a single country or continent.
Topic introduction
We introduced both topics with short movies. The first movie on bioluminescent trees ( van Ekelen, 2013 ) presented a future scenario where bio luminescent trees have been planted in parks, and reflects on the implications this could have. This movie presented a possible opinion, which made starting the discussion a bit easier. The second movie on gene drives ( Empinado, 2015 ), was far less opinionated, which allowed the discussion to move into more diverse directions. After the short movies we asked the bioethics experts present to give a short reflection on what they saw and what questions they would start to ask. We then let the groups start their own discussions.
Groups
We decided on groups of five or six participants with a moderator each, so that there would be enough time to let everyone speak and also to ask each other questions. We hoped this would enable the discussion gets to the value level. We also wanted to expose our participants to as many different opinions as possible. This is why we decided to form new groups per discussion round, and why we decided on a short plenary discussion of 5 minutes after each round. In this plenary part, we asked groups to shortly present what they had discussed and allowed the groups to react to each other.
Guidance
We asked supervisors present at the meetup to moderate each table. They would be impartial moderators that would ensure everyone"

The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]
P(cancer) is the figure generated by Tammemägi’s model, weighted by the probability of stage 1 detection (63%) and other stage detection (37%).
P(cancer) = P(true positive) + P(false negative)
As sensitivity ≈ 100%, P(false negative) ≈ 0
P(cancer) ≈ P(true positive) = specificity * P(positive test)
P(positive test) ≈ P(cancer) / specificity
P(false positive) = P(positive test) * (1 - specificity) ≈ P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
Therefore the probability of a false positive is approximately proportional to the chance of having cancer. P(false positives) always amounted to less 1% of the total cost per QALY so this error of this approximation is negligible.
To recap:
P(true positive) = P(cancer)
P(false positive) = P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
P(true negative) = 1 - (P(true positive) + P(false positive))
P(false negative) = 0
The probability of each option was calculated by multiplying P(true positive) * P(treatment success). In the table, P(treament) represents the chance of the treament being as described by the 2nd column.

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Lab#Methanol_-_-_TEXT.html," of our modeling confirmed the so called ""major MCC"" (Methanol Condensation Cycle) to be the most promising pathway.
From these literature references, we identified the four enzymes that we had to express heterologously in order to complete the uptake pathway:
Methanol Condensation Cycle
This figure shows the coherent enzymatic reactions of the MCC, published by Bogorad et al.[5]
methanol dehydrogenase 2 from Bacillus methanolicus (Mdh)
3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase from Bacillus methanolicus (Hps)
6-phospho 3-hexuloisomerase from Bacillus methanolicus (Phi)
Xu5P - phosphoketolase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis (Xpk)
Using this enzymes, methanol can be converted to acetyl-CoA in an ATP independent way.
Four new BioBricks were designed, codon optimized for E. coli and synthesized as IDT gBlocks.
In order to express the required assimilation enzymes simultaneously, we designed a polycistronic expression construct and assembled it with Synbiota's [6] RDP Assembly method .
To further optimize the efficiency of the MCC pathway by tuning the expression levels of the four genes to an optimum, we developed an efficient cloning strategy for a monocistronic diversity library using the RDP standard by synbiota.
Results
All four assimilation enzymes were shown to be expressed individually in pSB1A30 backbones. These BioBrick-compatible expression backbones made by team Heidelberg 2014 have an IPTG-inducible T7 promoter in front of the BioBrick prefix.
Since the Mdh represents the bottleneck of the MCC, we investigated and proved its functional expression using the Nash Assay .
The polycistronic expression construct was successfully assembled, sequenced and the expression was confirmed.
In shake flask experiments we showed that the strain harbouring the polycistronic expression plasmid is growing with increased maximal growth rate at higher methanol concentrations in the medium (Read more about our characterizations ).
By feeding 13C labled methanol and analyzing the central metabolites, we finally investigated, if our strain incorporates carbon atoms from methanol into its metabolism (Read more about our labeling experiment ).

Our team spared no efforts for this exhibition aiming at spreading knowledge related to synthetic biology and information about iGEM to non-specialists such as primary and secondary school students. Before TJU Campus Open Day, we posted an article concerning IGEM and the science exhibition on WeChat platform, which grabbed more than five hundred people's attention.
Figure2.bring children into the magic biological world
On that day, public were attracted by our Science & Education Exhibition and it's believed that they could resist the charm of synthetic biology no longer. Specifically, we conducted a variety of hydrophobin-related experiments and prepared bizarre microbial colonies exhibitions which could be observed by anyone under a microscope and had a strong appeal to the audience. Besides, we designed fun games about biology in order to attract the crowds. The forms of fun games contained answering biological questions when jumping rope, identifying plant organelles ,  and explaining what iGEM is , what synthetic biology is, and describing our project in more detail after reading our poster about iGEM and our team. Additionally, visitors and students were able to harvest our elaborate theme postcards or badges about iGEM after they completed games and answered questions correctly. We also encouraged the people we spoke to to share their feelings and concerns about the Science & Education Exhibition and synthetic biology.
Figure3 .the elaborate theme postcards and badges about iGEM
The event was a huge success. Over 30,000 people visited the open day, and our stall was constantly busy for at least 8 hours until we handed out all elaborate gifts and snacks. Through our exhibition and individuals' active engagement, more citizens got to know about our iGEM team and more students became more stimulated in learning synthetic biology. Also, some academics discussed about our project with us and we exchanged views. A lot of people complimented the clarity and attractiveness of our poster and loved their elaborate gifts.
Figure4 . our board and poster designed for iGEM
On balance, we held an innovative public perception activity related to synthetic biology and our project, which sparked new scientific curiosity, and established a public dialogue from voices outside the lab.
Science Lecture
On 11th April, our team gave a science lecture to ones who were curious and interested about synthetic biology and our project. Some students of engineering majors and nearly half of freshmen of life science major attended this science lecture. Chenmao told them about what iGEM is and described our project in plain terms. Yige explained to them about what synthetic biology is and some practical and stimulating ideas about synthetic biology. Then, Prof. Yang shared his idea"

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," the same (KR20170143114)”, was rejected on 06/02/2018. The claims referred to a method for treating wastewater in which a magnetic substance-copper-alginate particle had a laccase immobilized [22].
Two of these five patents, whose applications were filed in China, are currently under examination. The pending patent “Method for preparing nanometer-magnetic-particle immobilized aniline degrading bacteria and application thereof to degradation of chlorophenol (CN105624141)” has its priority date on 19/02/2016. The claims are focused on the preparation method of particles immobilized on carrageenan to degrade chlorinated phenol and their recovery method by magnet adsorption [23]. On the other side, the pending patent “Preparation method of chitosan/mesoporous molecular sieve immobilized laccase and degradation method of phenolic wastewater (CN106191023)” was filed on 14/07/2016. The claims protect a method for preparing a chitosan/micromolecular sieve immobilized laccase to degrade phenolic wastewater [24].
The US patent “Chloroperoxidase-catalyzed degradation of pharmaceutical pollutants in wastewater (US9938176)” was granted on 10/04/2018. The claims describe an enzymatic method for the degradation of compounds selected from acetaminophen, carbamazepine, sulfamethazine, diclofenac and naproxen [25].
Lastly, the European patent “Method of degradation and inactivation of antibiotics in water by immobilized enzymes onto functionalized supports (EP3034186)” was granted on 19/09/2018 and with Sweden being one of the Designated Contracting States . The claims include antibiotics such as amoxicillin or sulfamethoxazole to be degraded in an aqueous medium by a laccase enzyme, from Pleurotus ostreatus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, immobilized on moving bed carriers [26].
Overall, the first four patents do not pose a risk of infringement either because they were rejected, they are still in the application process and under evaluation or they are targeting a different market once they were granted. On the other side, in regards to the last patent, we are confident when we claim our invention has differences. We are using a different organism and substrate, and our immobilization surface is broader defined (magnetic particles).

Our Project
Outbreaks of foodborne illnesses are a growing problem in our lives. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, identified 767 outbreaks affecting nearly 14,000 people of foodborne illnesses. Of these, pathogenic E. coli was a recurring theme in many of these outbreaks. In Alberta, we recently experienced our own foodborne disease outbreak in late 2012. This outbreak was the result of pathogenic E. coli serotype O157 and led to significant food recall alongside many hospitalizations, deaths, massive economic losses and an overall loss of consumer confidence in food safety. Current detection methods require long incubation times to amplify E. coli in the sample and followed by amplification to verify the presence of known genes that are associated with pathogenic E. coli.
One of the contributing factors connected with the outbreak in Alberta was the lack of rapid on-site detection systems available. Thus, the University of Calgary 2013 iGEM Collegiate team is using synthetic biology to develop system to rapidly detect the presence of pathogenic E. coli in the beef industry. By using engineered biological nanoparticles and DNA binding proteins we can specifically detect pathogenic DNA sequences. Our biosensor functions at the genomic level to detect the presence or absence of pathogenic E. coli in a given sample. This system allows us to pinpoint contamination during meat processing and also provides the ability to prescreen cattle in a preventative way to limit potential sources of contamination from the processing chain. Our system provides"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," CFPS activity was found at 195 mM potassium glutamate, 6 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. The minimal point was found at 65 mM potassium glutamate, 18 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. This was verified as the maximum and minimum points using the surface profiler function in JMP.
As mentioned before, sodium oxalate is used as an inhibitor of the enzyme which converts pyruvate to PEP. However, pyruvate is also con verted to desirable metabolites during the pathway which generates ATP for protein synthesis, and these reactions should not be inhibited. Sodium oxalate acts as a pyruvate mimic, and therefore at high concentrations it may not only inhibit conversion of pyruvate to PEP, but also pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which would decrease the amount of ATP generate, and hence reduce protein synthesis activity. This may be one explanation for why sodium pyruvate appears to have an inhibitory affect. Using this data, a maximum protein synthesis activity within the range of concentrations used for each salt was found at 6 mM magnesium glutamate, 195 mM potassium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate (Figure 6). A CFPS supplement solution with these revised amounts was made and used to perform CFPS reactions. Two types of CFPS system were used; one which contained cell extract from the same batch that was used to build the SRD model (B1), and extract from a separate batch, but which was prepared in an identical way (D1). The results showed that CFPS reactions using extract from the same batch that was used to build the model (B1) did indeed increase the CFPS activity of that extract, and the activity was within the confidence intervals (CIs) predicted by the model (Figure 7a). For systems using a separate batch of extract (D1), the new supplement solution caused a decrease in activity (Figure 7b). This backs up previous research which suggests that each batch of cell free extract requires its own optimal conditions for high protein synthesis activity. It also shows that a multifactorial Design of Experiments approach can easily determine important factors in CFPS systems, and accurately predict optimal supplement amounts.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

BBa_K1670000 and BBa_K1670004 were ligated into J61002_J23100 and transformed into E.coli Top 10. Transformants were streaked again for plasmid isolation. Correct cloning was verified by digestions with EcoRI and PstI (Fig.1) that should yield bands at 2039 bp (J61002-backbone) and 748 bp for BBa_K1670000 and 772 bp for BBa_K1670004.  Correct plasmids were transformed into E.coli BL21 and E.coli Nissle 1917. Single colonies were streaked on LB-Amp to be further used for characterization purposes next week.
Second fermentations were conducted with E. coli Nissle 1917 pCERI Cells were harvested after 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, and 16h. Total protein was isolated from the cells. A SDS-PAGE was run with this week’s samples as well as with last week’s samples. Even though more protein was theoretically loaded on the gel, all bands of the BL21 samples appeared to be weaker compared to last week’s gel, which might indicate protein degradation in the 20 mM sodium-phosphate buffer (Fig 2 and 3).

Human practices
When deciding what our human practices would entail, we faced the dilemma of what issues  concerning the society are most urgent to address and by which criteria they should be chosen. At  the end, we settled on focusing on four main goals: connecting to the professionals, reaching out to  public, engaging the youth, and addressing the ethics of both synthetic biology in general and our  project specifically.
CONNECING TO THE PROFESSIONALS
We decided to present our people to the professionals with experience in research and the industry  of biofuel and waste elimination, as well as to the other teams who are competing in iGEM in 2015.  With this spirit we have written several articles about ourselves, our project and the status of  synthetic biology in our country for the Newsletter of iGEM Amoy University team.  We held a video conference with Aalto Helsinki iGEM team, which is also working on the biofuel  problematic. We discussed our respective approaches to the problem and the mechanism of our  solutions. We also presented the project to researchers at the National Chemistry Institute in Ljubljana.
CONNECTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY
Our project concerning turning organic waste into biofuel is one with a great potential for  development and for eventual industrial stage. With that in mind we have realized that we would  have to visit a real life company that already does something similar, so that we can better imagine  the scale and equipment with which our project would eventually work. There are no cleaning plants  using bacteria yet in Slovenia and our project is unique in that respect, so we have decided to visit a  somewhat similar company. We  went to an algae water cleaning plant AlgEn, built within the  European project AlgaeBioGas, which aims to clean the liquid part of the digestate sediment from  nearby gasworks (dealing with processing slaughterhouse waste) to such extent that the water will  be able to flow directly to local communal water distribution system. This is the only outside  installation of this size in Europe.  They explained their work and research to us and showed us around the plant, carefully explaining  the purpose of equipment on each stage of"

Today, I continued to follow up with companies to whom I had sent the sponsorship package. I made a couple cold calls to companies who didn't provide an email address on their websites. First I tried to get a hold of the person in-charge of marketing/sponsorship, tell them a little about the project, what iGEM is and why we're looking for sponsors. I spoke to a few company representatives and most of them were very excited about the project. I asked for their email address and sent the sponsorship package to them. I'll follow up with them next week.

Gel of the vector verification performed yesterday
Purpose: to visualise the results of yesterday’s vector verification
Expected restriction digest output:
Biobrick digest (2 fragments)
psB1AC3/psB1AK3: ~3.0 kb
ccdB (p1010): ~675 bp
TOPO digest (2 fragments)
TOPO (T/A and Blunt): ~3.5 kb
LuxOU: ~2.0 kb
LuxPQ: ~4.0 kb
LuxCDABE: ~6.0 kb
LuxOD47E: ~1.4 kb
LuxOD47A: ~1.4 kb
Results:
Gel and lane description is included below. LuxPQ did not work, so it will need to be sequenced.
Sequencing of LuxPQ in TOPO Blunt II
Purpose: As mentioned above, the results for LuxPQ are very questionable. Since they cannot be explained with restriction digests, hopefully sequencing will alleviate some of the confusion.
Materials and methods: We inserted 7.3 uL of LuxPQ in TOPO into a mini PCR tube so that around 730 ng of DNA were present for sequencing. We used the sp6 forward primer and the T7 reverse primer.
Results: Much like our previous sequencing attempts, these were questionable. The electronic copy will be inserted shortly.

E.Coli cells are about 2.0 μm long and 0.25–1.0 μm in diameter, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology with a cell volume of 0.6–0.7 μm3 The periplasmic space constitutes up to 40% of the total cell volume (Wekipedia, 2014). The normal concentration of binding protein in the periplasmic space is estimated as 35 mg/ml [1]. Nearly 20% binding protein in the periplasmic space is INP protein. Since ModA is linked to INPN, we assume that ModA and INP have similar concentration. The concentration is 4.032 * 10-12 mg/cell.
c(ModA per cell) = Vcell * 40% *C(binding protein in periplasmic space) * 20% = 0.6 μm3 * 40% * 35 mg/ml *20% = 4.032 * 10-12 mg/cell
The moderate amount of molybdenum per kilogram dry soil is 1.844 mg/kg(Liu, 2005). According to our computer simulation test, about 20% engineering bacteria are supposed to reach the root system successfully according to our Model. We assume that the efficiency of molybdenum fertilizer increases 120% if “Prometheus” is used. Therefore, only 1.537 mg molybdenum is needed per kilogram dry soil.
The bacteria concentration in OD600 =1 bacteria liquid is about 109. Only 381ml bacteria liquid is needed per kilogram dry soil ("

UCL,2016,Team:UCLA#Super Soldier Bacteria_-_-_TEXT.html,"5-α. Assuming this is successful, we would move on to expressing both CDI systems from Enterobacter aerogenes into DH5-α individually and performing the same set of assays. What is different about this set of experiments is that we would have to construct the plasmids ourselves. What we planned on doing was fusing the CDI system from Enterobacter aerogenes with a switched toxin and immunity region and a pSK33 backbone. All-in-all, this would require the use of advanced techniques like: Gibson assembly, PCR (colony and overlap), and electroporation.
Competition Assay
Our main method of testing whether our CDI systems is through a cell-based competition assay. It consists of the following cell types:
Inhibitory strain (CDI+): Bacterial Strain transformed with designated CDI system
Target Strain (CDI-): Native bacteria from which the CDI system comes from
Positive Control: Something that already has the designated CDI system expressed and can properly inhibit the Target
Protocol
Grow all cells to correct growth phase in appropriate antibiotic
Positive control to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth (LB) with antibiotic at 37 C
Inhibitor to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth with antibiotic at 37 C
Negative control to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth at 37 C
Target overnight (16 hours) in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth with antibiotic at 37 C (Target OD600 is not important)
Mix inhibitor (or control) and target cell at a ratio of 10:1 (determined through concentration relation listed below) in LB without any antibiotic
Multiply the Mass Attenuation Constant for the bacteria with the reading obtained from the OD600 to get the cellular density of the target, use this to prepare a 10:1 ratio of inhibitor to target cells.
Incubate at 37 C at 225 rpm while plating samples at 0 and 4 hours after mixing

BSc Biological Sciences (Biotechnology) Graduate, University of Edinbrough; MRes Microbiology (Distinction) Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Tim is fascinated by the rich diversity of the microbial world, and how this can be utilised for biotechnological and medical usage.
During this time he felt restless and enrolled on the part-time MSc Microbiology course at Birkbeck. Almost immediately he rediscovered his passion for microbiology and the following year he quit recruitment and transferred to a full-time MRes research project. The project was to assess the activity of a light-activated antimicrobial surface. ""Despite blowing my life savings and having to also work part-time to support myself, it was the best decision I've ever made"". He fell in love with research and his hard work has earnt me a BBSRC PhD scholarship to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of Actinomycetes.""
Tim's effort in the Owligos team is around Practice & Policy and Sponsorship. Tim is proud to be a part of the inaugural Birkbeck iGEM team because, without the flexible learning opportunities they offer to full-time working people, he wouldn't have been able to complete a Masters and wouldn't now be living his dream as a research microbiologist. Tim is very excited by the project we are developing and looks forward to showing everyone at the Giant Jamboree everything we have achieved!

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," a major issue in developing countries due to lack of facilities and resources.  We then discovered that typhoid fever has very similar symptoms to malaria such as high fever, headache, stomach pain, and loss of appetite and is often confused in diagnosis due to lack of lab resources and high rates of co-infection.  Due to regular cases of this co-infection of malaria and typhoid fever, patients are often given antimalarial drugs with antibiotics to treat the typhoid fever.  This presents two issues of both increasing unnecessary economic costs as well as the issue of antibiotic resistant bacteria.  If lab resources are not available, physicians often diagnose based on clinical symptoms and the location the patient is coming from. Additionally we discussed the existing diagnostic technologies  and both the economic aspects of the device as well as the accuracy of implementation.  A rapid diagnostic tests for malaria cost less than $1,  and in order to ensure economic success of mass production of a diagnostic device for another infectious disease, it is incredibly important to factor in cost.  The device needs to be able to withstand room temperature as freezers  and other lab conditions for storage might be unavailable.   This device needs to be robust and able to withstand transport and storage before the test itself is administered.  The time it takes to administer the test and receive in a result was advised to be approximately an hour for multiple diseases.  Although the potential for overnight diagnosis for multiple diseases would be useful,  Dr. Bayih presented the scenario in which immediate decisions must be made without time for any test to be administered.  Dr. Bayih was very receptive and enthusiastic regarding the idea of having an inexpensive version of the diagnostic test for home-use, field use, and for use in the hospitals with no lab equipment available as well as a digitalized more expensive version for the hospitals with available lab equipment .  This meeting confirmed that the issue of misdiagnosis combined with overdiagnosis are a pressing issue in developing countries and  multi diagnostic device with different cost models would be extremely useful and provide early diagnosis reducing the mortality rate for these diseases.  We continued to research statistics regarding misdiagnosis and finalize our target diseases for the project. Infectious diseases such as typhoid, malaria and meningitis are commonly misdiagnosed due to overlap in clinical manifestations. A recent study done in Tanzania examined the hospitalization of 500 children with fever. 62% of the patients were treated for Malaria, while only 2% were actually tested positive (Duke Global Health, 2012) . A study from Afghanistan showed that 413 of 414 patients"

We designed the “Prize-giving Quiz” game to give                         the guests a general knowledge of biology. “Understanding Micro-World Activities” provides                         visitors with microscopes and some samples made by the team members which let them to observe                         and understand the microbes we can't see. This part attracted many primary and middle school                         students. We also distributed more than 300 survey questionnaires. These questionnaires were                         mainly designed for people of different ages to understand their physical condition and for                         understanding the market demand of our product. The results showed that a lot of people are                         interested in our program which made the team members more motivated.
Lead Synthetic Biology Into the Campus
In order to propaganda synthetic biology knowledge to primary and secondary schools more vividly                         in Dalian, our decided to work with OUC-CHINA. Their team members will design synthetic biology                         science brochures and we would made into a poster. The poster will be displayed together with                         the posters of DLUT_CHINA_B in several primary and secondary schools in Dalian as well as the                         libraries of Dalian University of Technology. The OUC-CHINA team's popular science brochure is                         called SPACESHIP E.coli, which compares E. coli to a spaceship, anthropomorphizing the ribosome,                         and describing the logic switches and biological components in synthetic biology vividly. We                         hope that more primary and middle school students will grow a great interest in synthetic                         biology through the activities.
In these promotions, we also found that some of the high school attached great importance to this                         competition. High School affiliated to Dalian University of Technology is one of them.
Three members of our team came to the High School affiliated to Dalian University of Technology.                         After the team members explained the principle of synthetic biology, many students have shown a                         great interest in synthetic biology. We learned that the Dalian High School affiliated to the                         Dalian University of Technology had also established the iGEM Student Association during the                         communication. This communication also provided some new ideas for the students of the iGEM                         association, which broadened their horizons and inspire them to learn more about synthetic                         biology.
We hoped that our iGEM"

Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," want to solve the downside of our development. Therefore, we took a closer look at plastic. Plastic is a wonderful product and these days it is impossible to live without it. We looked into the production of plastic. Can we make clean plastic non-polluting plastic? And how do we use this plastic responsibly? On the Human Practices pages you'll found where our journey brought us; from schools to festivals; from start-ups to multinationals.
Carbon footprint analysis
Producing styrene from organic waste
The aim
We are facing a huge increase in global population: from the current world population of 7.6 billion to an expected 9.8 billion people in 2050 [ 1 ]. This projected increase in global population leads to an increase in both food and energy consumption, which in turn in is associated with an increased emission of greenhouse gasses. Right now, we live in a plastic generation. The global production and consumption of plastics have been on the rise for over 50 years now, reaching a plastic consumption of 297.5 million tons by the end of 2015 [ 2 ]. Plastic products from the petrochemical industry have a high carbon footprint (Boonniteewanich, Pitivut, Tongjoy, & Lapnonkawow, 2014). The combination of global population increase and a mass consumed non-eco-friendly product, in the form of petroleum-based plastics, could be disastrous. This is one of the reasons that the Groningen iGEM team’s project attempts to produce (bio)styrene, a building block for many plastics, from cellulose as an alternative to petroleum-based styrene. In this section we have carried out a partial Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to identify the environmental impact of both petroleum-based styrene and bio-based styrene. The main purpose is to provide an insight in the environmental burden that is caused by the worldwide styrene industry in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2-eq) and to showcase our greener alternative.
For our LCA analysis we have used the Dutch Gross Energy Requirements values (GER) Values. These values are used for a ‘cradle to gate’ analysis and include all emissions that are needed to produce a certain product. These process emissions exclude any carbon flux from or to the atmosphere. In the case of a bio-based feedstock this is a complete analysis, because the carbon uptake is balanced with the emissions once the product is disposed of. For fossil fuel based styrene a value of 3,1 KG needs to be added to this  (Croezen & Lieshout,"

iGEM Kyoto
We had a meetup with Team Kyoto. Ryo NIWA, a leader of our team went to Kyoto as a representative of team Gifu. We discussed the progress of the projects and some iGEM regulations. At that time, iGEM Kyoto provided us with KELN, a software which automatically translates a lab notebook into HTML. With the system, we made a calendar and some tables of components of media for cell growth. In return, we offered feedback to team Kyoto about software KELN. Even though you don’t know about HTML, you can use KELN and make some figures for wikis. It is completely workable for anyone and highly recommended to use. Thank you to iGEM Kyoto and Dr. Woltjen, secondary PI of the team.

iGEM NJU-China
One of our members visited Nanjing university on August 26, 2018. Our team leader sent the file of the project before the discussion. We had a small discussion regarding each project. Also, iGEM NJU-China held a lab tour to consider the lab rules for the safety.  Our member was given an explanation about how to use their laboratory instruments safely during the tour. They also offered some talks about their project. During the past few years, NJU-China focused on the ligand-receptor system targeting certain tissues or cells with the exosome containing siRNAs as a new therapy towards certain disorders. This year, they found a more specific element targeting the subcellular structure, dendrites of neurons. The element comes from the 5’-UTR (untranslated region) of a lentivirus, and they made several tests to find the most suitable package of the element. Visit their wiki page !
iGEM East Japan Meetup 2018
We participated in iGEM East Japan Meetup 2018 on August 8 at Tokyo Institute of Technology. Gifu, Bochan Lab., KAIT Japan, Tokyo-Tech and ASIJ (High School team) got together, and each team gave presentations about our provisional projects and team management. After that, we exchanged opinions and gave some advice to each other"

After explaining our project to friends and family, we realized the distance between the academia and the society and found that people are mostly completely unaware of what synthetic biology even is, let alone anything more specific. However, humanities and social sciences relate closely and noticeably to our everyday life, so we feel it’s the time we spread the idea of synthetic biology to the society.
Questionnaire Analysis
Ⅰ.The questionnaire shows that 96 % of people use navigation software in daily life. Concerning the existing navigation software available in the market, 91% of people point out its different disadvantages and have an expectation of a better system. With regard to the bio-navigation system,  46% of people do not know the form of storing information in DNA, 20% think the biological computing system can be applied to navigation while 19% hold the opposite opinion. Through the questionnaire analysis, we can find that people are eager for a new navigation system, supporting the development of biological computing, but knowing little about the related knowledge.
II. The questionnaire shows that people are not satisfied with the existing navigation system due to its many defects, including the high power consumption, inaccurate and incongruent pathways. So most people are  looking forward to a new navigation system. Meanwhile, most people  have an optimistic attitude towards biological computing of its broad prospect because it has a lot of advantages that electronic computing can not  offer. However, many people don't know much about biological  computing, only having heard of it or knowing  little about it.

While many circuits are contained within the SBiDer database, there were new circuits published in the literature that we could not include in our database due to time constraints. However, supposing that circuits contained within the SBiDer database represent the majority of mechanisms by which synthetic circuits can be constructed (which they do), then SBiDer can predict novel circuits that may eventually be constructed and published.   Validating predictions of novel circuits described  by our database constituted a search of relevant publications.  The list of relevant publications that may have explored and validated at least one of our predicted circuits is described by the set of all papers citing more than 1 paper cited by our database. SBiDer gathered circuitry from n=17 publications.  The most recent circuit contained in our database was published in 2012. Interestingly, SBiDer was able to discover several aT"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#thermo_-_-_TEXT.html," Standard activity test for TTHL measured at 10 °C and 25 °C resulting in a decreased activity at 10 °C. As a negative control the impact of 0.4 mM CuCl2 in oxidizing ABTS at 10 °C and 25 °C were analyzed.
Figure 14: Deriving from the obtained values of oxidized ABTS in time at 10 °C and 25 °C the specific enzyme activity was calculated. For the temperatures a difference of 2 U mg-1 could be detected. One unit is defined as the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.
To investigate the activity of TTHL at temperatures that will apply at a waste water treatment plant throughout the year, activity tests as described above were performed at 10 °C and 25 °C. The measurements were conducted for 30 minutes. The obtained results reveal an activity  decrease of about 35 % of TTHL at 10 °C in comparison to 25 °C (see Fig. 13). The obtained results were used to calculate the specific enzyme activity which was at 13 and 15 U mg-1, respectively (see Fig. 14). The negative control without TTHL laccase but 0.4 mM CuCl2 at 10 °C and 25 °C show a negligible oxidation of ABTS. The low difference observed between the two samples is great news for the possible application in waste water treatment plants.
Immobilization
Figure 15: The percentage of laccases immobilized to CPC-Beads. 99 % of ECOL, 97 % of BPUL and 79 % of BHAL and TTHL laccases were bound to the beads.
Figure 15 shows the percentage of laccases bound after incubation with CPC-beads, relative to the original concentration. The concentration of laccases in the supernatant after incubation was measured using Roti®-Nanoquant. The results showed that only 21% of TTHL laccases was still present in the supernatant. This illustrates that TTHL was successfully immobilized on the CPC-beads.
Figure 16: Illustration of ABTS oxidation by TTHL with time compared to the negative control. The increase in ABTS oxidized proves laccase activity.

The final module in our construct is the Recombination module. In this module, we use Cre recombinase to separate the origin of replication from the rest of the plasmid, in which the gene of interest to be knocked out is contained. This would prevent plasmids which have recombined from being replicated, and would eventually lead to the dilution of the gene of interest in the population.
Fig. 2 The Effect of Recombination module
To control the expression in a cell population, it is essential that the action of quorum sensing is fast and sensitive enough!
This aims to control the time for an inserted gene of interest to function before being knocked out by Cre recombinase.
The function of the Recombination module is to knockout the gene of interest from the plasmid.
Our project can be applied to various application in the future.

Each line contains a slot for the date to be written, to help the patient keep track of how much medication they have taken and when. One issue of the system is to contain the reaction to a specified area. This can be achieved by including a wax ring that does not allow water to permeate, and can also help seal in the reaction when the page is folded over.

Safety
Risk assessment is essential to the decision-making process for     commercial release of GMOs into the environment. When GMOs end up     in the environment, they can have unintended consequences for it.     Genetically modified micro-organisms are able to reproduce and     establish themselves as permanent populations and there can be     subtle and long-term effects on the biological communities and     ecosystems. Results of DNA modifications can’t be limited to the     replacement of the specific characteristics of its gene. Therefore,     it is important that when these organisms are released into nature,     they don’t harm the environment or form any risk to human health.     Such problems have led to a broader interest in the theme of risk     assessment in the release of GMOs.
Synthetic biology is a new field, which is different from     engineering genetics and working in the lab. We have to assume that     our target consumers are probably not all familiar with biology.     All in all, a cautious approach is needed. We need to assess the     environmental risks of our iGEM project that might arise from the     introduction of recombinant organisms.
Of course we were wearing our labcoats at all times. Also during labdance.
Safety in our lab
In our lab, where we build our secret message into our bacteria,     we work on a Biosafety level 1. All team members are familiar with the     safe microbiological techniques to work safely with microbiology     and GMOs. The according rules apply in in our lab.
All GMO related work can only be performed by those people      that have permission from the Biological Safety Officer (BVF).      Work according to the rules, even if you believe there is no      apparent risk.
During GMO related work all doors and windows have to be      closed. Verify that insects and other pests are not present in      the lab.
Wear a closed laboratory coat. Do not take this lab coat      outside the VMT area unless it is absolutely necessary for the      experiment. In case of a contamination of the lab cat,      sterilize it first, with bleach or by autoclaving, before      washing.
Clean and sterilize spills immediately. Report serious      contamination immediately to the BVF.

safety concerns
As a software team, our team does not produce any typical biological safety or ethnic issues. However, we still take safety into account from as many aspects as possible:
1. Safety for programmers
Most of our work is mainly done in front of computers, which is not ergonomically to programmers as working in such environment may cause much exhaust and stress. Therefore, we made a series of regulations to guarantee they are not exposed to computers constantly for too long time and recreational area is within 10 meters. What is more, every time our programmers go to web labs, we make sure that there would be safety equipment as well as accompanies for them.
2. Safety for public
We are aware what our software will bring to teenagers or youngsters, and our software is ensured that no violent or sexual scene or content is included. We also did a lot of work to estimate and reduce the possible errors or faults users may encounter in the future.
3.Safety for software
To better protect our intellectual property rights, we have consulted IPRs centre of USTC in case of future problem. We will restrict the use of our software and we will apply for a patent later.
4.Safety for campus
We are quite aware when we perform our work or lecture in campus, and no disorder or turbulence has shown during in the above activity.
5.Other safety concerns
(i) Our team made no new BioBrick parts (or devices), and no safety issues happened from this. (ii)No biosafety group or committee protested our project.
Suggestions for future development of safety in dry lab.
Although a lot of work is done to ensure the safety of programmers in dry lab, a lot of work still remains to be done. And here we present some brief ideas on how we can develop the safety for programmers.
1. In many conditions, programmers in a dry lab have to share places with experiment operators due to limited space, which may lead to underlying health problems. Therefore, we suggest that strict rules should be made to provide independent space for programmers.
2. We take it for granted that not only safety for programmers, but the safety for intellectual property should be taken into consideration. Thus we suggest that all codes and other achievement should be granted with copyrights before sharing.

This year 10 students started the iGEM USTC Software team:"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," On the one hand, the model has to deal with the experimental parameters affinity, expression strength, ampicillin concentration, and portray the corresponding processes in an E. coli cell. On the other hand, the model has to transfer this gained knowledge to the growth behavior of different E. coli strains and predict what happens, if different cultures have to contest for space and nutrients.
The Model
To reach this goal we built two models, model I and model II .  Both models are based on chemical and biological mechanisms. Model I represents our bacterial two-hybrid selection system and model II the [cultivation step]. After careful validation we could finally apply this model conglomeration to predict how long a cultivation must last and how often an inoculation must be done till the desired proportion of the best adapted E. coli culture is reached.
The models can be used separately. In the following the workflow of our connected models is shown:
Figure 1: Workflow of the modeling process.
The interaction of model I and model II are shown. From left to right: The model I produces a reproduction rate r - with every run. After several runs the different reproduction rates are transferred to model II, which translates these rates into growth curves.
First, the selection system was implemented (model I). The basic structure is based on iGEM Potsdam 's modeling work of 2011. The model I represents the bacterial two-hybrid selection system and produces the reproduction rate r of a single cell with a given affinity under selection pressure with ampicillin (amp). The reproduction rate is computed for many different affinities and then transmitted to the competition model (model II). The competition model depicts the growth behavior of different adapted E. colis in one flask under multiple inoculations.

I’ve studied at Tecnológico de Monterrey (Campus Ciudad de México) for almost three years now and I already think of it as my second home. Naturally, GenetiX has become my second family. My teammates have taught me far more than just science or teamwork. From them I have learnt the value of passion, dedication, responsibility and enthusiasm. I have enjoyed that science is not only about lab discoveries, but about what you do with them. This has been an extraordinary experience; one that is just beginning.

I have participated in my school groups contributing to the area of design and display, as well as in projects and logo contests  and images of representation.I'm in GenetiX, first because I love to contribute to the group with what I know related to design, also because I want to relate that, with the rest of the group to form a complete team and we'll structured in each of their areas. As well as learn not only in the areas in which each of ones are involved, I mean to learn as much chemistry, marketing, programming, research and very important area, where you involve human resources in which you involve values and the human practice within each of us with the help of all the members of our team.I like iGEM because it is a foundation that promotes beyond coexistence with our own equipment, to give everything to be the best, promotes the relationship between more teams involved in iGEM with the support of a feedback and learning by what you acquire here. Likewise iGEM urges teens to have a deep knowledge in science with the help of many other areas that complement each of the teams.

Dr. Jeff Gralnick - Microbiology, University of Minnesota
Jeffrey Gralnick has extensively studied the physiology of Shewanella, a species of gram-negative bacteria found throughout the world in aquatic environments. By understanding the molecular mechanism that enables this species to respire a diversity of compounds - including insoluble minerals - he hopes to engineer strains that can generate power in microbial fuel cells or react against certain toxic metals in the environment.
Working in collaboration with Prof. Daniel Bond, Gralnick made a key discovery about how bacteria can convert organic compounds into electricity. It was observed that riboflavin (commonly known as vitamin B-2) was responsible for much of the energy produced by Shewanella bacteria growing on electrodes. Riboflavin produced by the bacteria was able to carry electrons from the living cells to the electrodes, and rates of electricity production increased by 370 percent as riboflavin accumulated. This finding has major implications for the development of scaled-up microbial fuel cells using similar bacteria.
Gralnick is developing strains, tools and techniques for increasing the robustness of using Shewanella for metabolic engineering and downstream applications in both Bioenergy (microbial fuel cells), Bioremediation and Biocatalysis.

Put two gel glass pieces together in the correct orientation  (should be small space between them) and clip into the gel apparatus
Add about 5 mL of separating gel in between the two glass pieces (ensure it does not leak)
Add a thin layer of isopropanol on top of the separating gel to form a smooth line
Wait for the gel to solidify (~ 20 minutes)
Rinse out the isopropanol with water
Add about 2 mL of the stacking gel on top of the separating gel and add the gel comb
Wait for the gel to solidify (~ 20 minutes)
Place the gel into the gel running apparatus and lock it in place. Ensure the side with the larger piece of glass is facing outward. If there is only one gel, add empty glass pieces to the other side
Put the gel into the gel box and fill with 1x SDS Running Buffer. Ensure the middle section between the gels is filled with buffer
Load samples
Run gel at 100V until samples leave the well and increase the voltage to 150V. Or run the gel at lower voltages (~90V) to get cleaner bands
When the gel is done running, fix it with destaining solution (50% water, 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for 30 min
Stain the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 1h
Distain the gel with water or destaining solution

In addition to the two main projects, we have also worked to elaborate on some of the teams earlier ideas during the project:
Multiplicative circuit
The comparator circuit that we have created integrates two different transcription levels in a negative manner (subtraction) to perform a range of functions a range of different integrations (calculations) are necessary to this end we have also designed a system that would allow one signal (transcription rate) to be divided by the transcription level of another promoter. To achieve this we have used the processes of attenuation and the three loop system (in the trp leader). the system has also been mathematically modeled. To find out more please click the image above.
Multisensor
There are many groups of chemical species for which there are no current biological techniques for distinguishing between each of these species and quantitatively analysing its concentration. Here we outline a possible approach for solving this problem using non-specific transcription factors and promoters. We use nitrates, nitrites and nitric oxide as our example group.

From left to right, it is the no induction data, arabinose singal induction data, salicylate singal induction data and the double induction data. Double induction data shows significant difference from that of singal induction and no induction. Although the arabinose induced is to some extent leaky, it shows great difference form the double induction group.
Second Stage Assembly (In Process)
Design
After the first stage assembly was finished, we designed the further step based on what we have. It is shown in the result section of the first stage assembly that the three plasmids assembly turn out to work. We designed the second stage assembly as below:
First the OR Gate-GFP module can be put on the same plasmid of the bistable switch, which has a relatively higher copy origin so that the output can be easier visualized. Actually, there is another consideration for this kind of design. Because the PhiR73 delta system is used by 2007 Cambridge team to make an amplifier, placing the PhiR73 delta(with an amber mutation) on a relatively lower copy plasmid than the output module can gain more chance that the OR gate is activated to the a similar extent when exposed to PhiR73 delta as when directly activated by salicylate. (Detailed description is on the OR Gate and Output page ).
And then, the PhiR73 delta expression set, which is controlled by CI434 repressible CI activatable promoter is placed on the pSB3T3 plasmid together with the T7 promoter-CI construct. In order to reduce influence on each other, we can use the reversed standard to assembly PhiR73 delta expression set. (Learn more about the reversed standard ). We designed the PhiR73 delta expression set on a medium copy plasmid, because the reason we mentioned above, and another reason is that the SupD expression set has a lower copy than the PhiR73 delta expression set. As our earlier experience tell us, supD is much easier to be leaky, while the other half of the AND Gate can be controled by adjusting its rbs. SupD on a lower copy plasmid gives us more chance.
The final assembly introduced another GFP reporter (the OR Gate - GFP set), so we want to delete the GFP gene from the bistable device, while the RFP gene is kept"

Formal Lab Session - 28th July 2009
Introduction
In the past few lab sessions the team has transformed JM109 E. coli cells with five BioBricks from the Spring Distribution and attempted to grow the transformant cells on LB + amp plates. The five BioBricks include BBa_C0056 (cI in the lambda phage), BBa_B1002 (terminator sequence), BBa_C0077 (CinR activator), BBa_C0076 (autoinducer synthetase) and BBa_R0077 (promoter which is CinR and HSL regulated - RBS+).
It was found that when the five sets of transformant E. coli cells were plated out, the cells possessing BBa_C0056, BBa_B1002, BBa_C0076 and BBa_R0077 seemed to produce colonies (although it must be noted that there was a little uncertainty about whether the E. coli transformed with BBa_C0076 did actually produce colonies). Three colonies from each of the four transformant plates were taken and each used to inoculate tubes containing 5ml LB solution (making a total of 12 tubes). These tubes were then placed in the orbital incubator overnight for mini-preps.
Today's plan is to conduct mini-preps on the four sets of E. coli transformant cells

Hey, I'm Dave, and one of the two grad advisors for Calgary this year. I'm currently doing a Master's in infectious diseases, and I wanted to be a part of iGEM because I was on the Calgary team for 2 years during my undergrad. I get to play teacher/troubleshooter/advisor/etc. for the team, so here's hoping I know what I'm talking about. I had to come back to the team now, as iGEM has always been a great experience and a good place to see some really cool ideas, as well as those very cool idea with no real-world practicality to speak of (if anyone remembers the 2007 Calgary project, EcoLisa, I'm proud to say I was part of that Rube Goldberg of an idea). Anyways, I do a lot of computer stuff, at home and at work, and dabble in a little squash when time allows. Cheers!

In this event,not only children but adults also enjoyed the event.   Some people told us that they haven’t doing science for long time so it was nice to do experiments.
Our activity was written on an article of a local newspaper!
On October 22nd, we held an experiment class for students mainly targeted on teenagers. We were quite surprised that one elderly woman also participated in this lesson since she is very interested in biology. We conducted DNA extraction experiments. We let the students extract DNA from broccoli (palnt cells), and from the students’ own buccal cells (animal cells). We extracted DNA, and also used microscope to see the both cells and taught the differences between the two.
＜Public engagement＞
On May 20th and 21st, we participated in ‘May Festival’, the school festival of   University of Tokyo.    In this festival, with KAIT JAPAN team, Tokyo Tech team, Kyoto team, Kobe team, Nagahama team, and Gifu team, we held an exhibition booth and presented our projects with posters.    For more information, look at the collaboration page.
On August 10th, there was an opencampus where many highschool students and their parents come to see our university.   In opencampus, we did a poster session and explain to comers what is iGEM and what is our project about.
We also made a handbook about GMMs, intestine environment/bacteria, and world hunger in Japanese.    We included the contents that people answered that they don’t know much in the survey we took.    We wanted to spread out our knowledge to people around us, especially people who haven’t study biology since we had the chance to study about these themes, so we used Japanese to make it easier for them to understand.

＜Self improvement＞
Before we start any of the experiments, we took a lecture held in our university that all the professors, researchers, and students who belong to a lab take.    Normally, 1~3rd year students don’t take this lecture, and our team members are all 2nd or 3rd year students, but since we’re doing projects mainly by ourselves, we took this lecture.    This lecture is about the safety of using labs and what are the rules and laws on using ‘Genetically Modified Organisms’ including ‘The Cartagena Protocol’, also known as ‘Law Concerning"

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
Researcher Safety?
The WashU team is working primarily with common, harmless chemicals. In addition, the researchers have been trained in proper handling of chemicals for hazardous chemicals such as Ethidium Bromide. For each such chemical, the team has read and followed appropriate safety protocols to ensure the continued health of the team. In all necessary instances, nitrile gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles are used as a further safety precaution. Additionally, all work with volatile chemicals is carried out in a fume hood.  Overall, though, the chemicals that the team deals with on a daily basis are relatively harmless and can be handled by any researcher with ease.
Public Safety?
All researchers in the WashU team have been trained in applicable lab safety and sterile techniques to ensure that no one inadvertently releases bacteria into the environment. In any case, all bacteria are maintained in cell cultures. The products we extracted from the bacteria, safranal and crocin, are safe to work with. There is no danger to the public from the work that the team does in the lab.
Environmental Safety?
All harmful chemicals that we work with are disposed of in compliance with local and federal Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) standards. The EHS disposes of these harmful chemicals in a way that is least deleterious to the environment.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our new BioBrick parts raise any significant safety issues given that they are genes found commonly in Crocus sativus and Arabidopsis thaliana. None of the new BioBrick parts should provide any advantages in transformed bacteria as compared with wild type bacteria. Therefore these parts should be very safe to use and manipulate.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes.
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The local EHS division is active on the Washington University campus. The entire team completed an EHS training course to encourage lab safety. Our project was approved by the biology department which is held accountable directly to the EHS representative. In"

In an insightful discussion, we were discussing not only the scientific requirements for tackling the problem of NTDs but even how science might be a driving force in reaching the sustainable development goals.
Organizing an event involving almost 150 people was no small endeavor to our team – so what was the goal we aimed to reach with the symposium?  Early in our project we realized that neglected tropical disease not only warranted our attention, but needed more general awareness. A broader public should know about these diseases to make a joint action against NTDs possible. We are happy to report that we reached our goals in two different ways: On the one hand, the many students in the audience very visibly curious to find out more about these poorly understood diseases and we even gained new team members. On the other hand, our invited speakers were impressed at the many questions and informed statements from the audience and realized that the topic of NTDs is also interesting to non-experts.  Our partners, NGOs as well as scientific groups, expressed interest in organizing a second NTD lab next year – our plans on making this event involve an even larger audience were favorably met, and the planning phase has already started!"
UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#Coliguard#Differentiation_-_-_TEXT.html," constructions, and associate two different systems previously proposed by iGEM teams: the Slippage random mechanism by team Caltech 2008(4) and the Cre-recombinase mechanism proposed by team Paris 2007(3).
The slippage mechanism controls the basal proportions of both lineages
Slippage is just one of the numerous errors that can be made by DNA Polymerase, and in which the number of tandem repeats of a short sequence (AGTC) could be changed during the transcriptional process.  Our construction will consist of 10 repetitions of the sequence AGTC, with an ATG start codon on the upstream position and the Cre-recombinase coding gene on the downstream position, everything under control of a constitutive promoter. In most cases, the slippage error won’t occur and the 10 repetitions of AGTC will leave the CRE-recombinase out of frame from the ATG, thus resulting in no expression of this recombinase. The absence of this expression in most cases will result in the expression of the Worker lineage characteristics, through mechanism that will be explained later. In the few cases in which the slippage error occurs and leaves a number of repeats that can be divided by three, i.e. from 10 to 9, the ATG and CRE-recombinase gene will be in the same reading frame, thus resulting in CRE-recombinase’s expressions and lead to Killer cells differentiation.
How will CRE-recombinase’s expression result in Killer cell differentiation?
CRE-recombinase is an enzyme that promotes an unidirectional recombination event between the lox66 and lox71 recombination sites(5). Therefore, we intend to adapt Paris 2007’s construction cassettes flanked by both lox sites made by team Paris 2007 by inserting our genes of interest into it.  According to the characteristics of our two subpopulations, the following genes might be necessary in order to promote cell differentiation and must be included in this construction:
• GFP and Resistance Genes: as reporter, necessary only to assure whether or not the construction is inserted into genomic DNA.
• ftsK: essential gene for the maintenance of the full cell cycle. The importance of the cell cycle to our project will be explained later.
• finOP: conjugation inhibition system, related with the recognition and destruction system of the killer lineage.
The general idea is that in the absence of CRE-recombinase expression (most cases), the resulting Worker cell has this construction fully operational, resulting in a cell capable of maintaining its"

AFP normally is expressed intracellularly  to prevent freezing of the cytoplasm, but in our system, it was essential that  AFP was extracellularly anchored at the cell membrane, thereby preventing ice formation outside the cell. Therefore, we merged the AFP gene to OmpA via a flexible linker, thereby ensuring the desired extracellular localization of AFP.  If you like to know more about AFP in nature and how it functions, you can click here .
2.b Expression of INP and Lycopene formation
INP and lycopene are produced as a response to lactose or IPTG uptake by E.D. Frosti from the medium. Lactose/IPTG will interact with the pLac-Lux promoter, so that transcription of CI repressor, CrtEBI and INP can occur. As discussed above, the CI repressor protein will act as an inhibitor of the pLux-CI promoter. The CrtEBI operon encodes the three last enzymes of the cartenoid pathway, that are needed to produce lycopene. E. coli itself is able to produce farnesyl pyrophosphate, which is converted to geranyl geranyl-PP by CrtE, which is transformed to pytoene by CrtB, which finally is modified to a lycopene molecule by CrtI. Lycopene production results in a bright red color, so that we can clearly see that CrtEBI as well as INP are expressed. Many different INPs exist in different organisms and we used the InaZ form from the Pseudomonas syringae. INP already contains a transmembrane domain and its active site is located extracellularly to induce ice nucleation in the environment. Therefore, we do not have to add an extracellular anchor. In fact, in previous iGEM competitions, the Berkeley_wetlab_2009 team has created a biobrick in which they specifically use only the (extracellular) INP-repeats as a cell-surface displayer spacer part, to improve the display of passenger domains: BBa_K197026 . If you like to learn more about INP , feel free to click here !
3. Cell death mechanism
We want E.D. Frosti to be coated with one of the two proteins, but we also want E.D. Frosti to die when we release it into the environment. Therefore, we created a suicide mechanism"

Risk and Assumptions
Synbiologica Ltd has not yet created a functional prototype of BEAR.
Synbiologica Ltd is currently acting under the assumption that BEAR will be functional and produce expected results. The funds from early investment into the company and grants will be directed towards developing a functional prototype and initial laboratory testing.
BEAR is still in early research and development and no technical numbers have been determined. Synbiologica Ltd is currently conferring with potential research partners who are interested in testing the BEAR prototype with the hope of eventually integrating the device into their research. By utilizing university resources we will be able to develop an accurate assessment of our products technical details and capacities.
Synbiologica Ltd does not have a patent on the BEAR product.
Synbiologica Ltd is actively in talks with the University of Lethbridge Technology Transfer Office and Industry Liaison Office regarding patenting and further market assessments of BEAR. Additionally the Technology Transfer office will assist in assessing our freedom-to-operate. The University of Lethbridge has agreed to let Synbiologica Ltd have complete ownership of all generated intellectual property and offered to pay for the patent on a return of cost basis.
Members of Synbiologica Ltd have limited prior experience in the business and financial fields.
When Synbiologica Ltd acquires the financial capacity, the company plans to appoint competent business executives to handle the business administration and management.  Additionally Synbiologica will actively seek to hire certified accountants to assist with financial projections and account management.  For the time being, all members have attended business workshops and professional development courses. They have learned how to do basic financial projections and acquired business management skills. The company is now moving forward in a strong position.
Synbiologica Ltd is acting under the assumption that a larger biotechnology or medical device company is interested in acquiring a licence to manufacture and sell BEAR.

Fig.6 Killing test results
More details can be found at Killing test
IV Improve the gene circuit of warrior I
    According to our results of the orthogonality test and the killing test, we cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter pair we put inside warrior I. (See more at orthogonality test )
    The problem now becomes how to block warrior I’s response to C4HSL secreted by himself. Our model tells us if we design warrior I as below (Fig.7), we can make it only be killed by warrior II by just regulating the RBS of TetR to an appropriate intensity.
Fig.7 Improved gene circuit. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II
See more details at Design of characters
Results are shown below:
Fig.8 Performance of improved gene circuit
See more information at Improved gene circuit
    Therefore, we proved that this problem could be solved by rational design and the further work is hopefully to succeed.
Design a game to make the public more interested in synthetic biology.
    Besides the bench work we did, to realize the educational purpose of our project and to make the public know more about synthetic biology, we designed our game---E.coli War!
    When children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (Fig.9)(See more details at Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
Fig.9 Children are playing E.coli War in CSTM!)
V Discussion and future plan
    Except for a few results in Invertase assay (See more details in Invertase assay ), all of our results are obtained by 3 biological replicates, so they are credible.
    In conclusion, we designed a very general system to study many complex relationships and also a useful model to describe this system. In the future, it will be convenient to investigate some interesting questions with regard to relationships between populations and individuals by using this system.
    What’s more, we designed two interesting games--- Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War to make the public"

Evry,2014,Team:Evry#Biology#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," mapping to one of the 2 strains references. A formidable drawback even considering that in the first place the species was chosen because of its natural denitrification ability (see
toxic compound
) and easy to source at
DMSZ
.
On the other hand Pseudovibrio denitrificans, or strains related to the species, has been shown to be in the majority in at least six microbiomes of sponges in the Mediterranean Sea, where spongia officinalis resides.
Now the thorny question is: can it be easily used  in our lab?
==
A bacterium we  could work with
==
In the literature Pseudovibrio denitrificans is described as a Gram-negative, motile by means of one to several lateral or subpolar flagella requiring NaCl for growth. It exhibits optimal growth at about 30 C°, pH 8 and 3 % NaCl, and a  doubling time of 45 min in rich media. In a nutshell the conditions seem favourable for an iGEM project.
They are known to be capable of anaerobic growth by carrying out denitrifying metabolism using nitrate, nitrite or nitrous oxide as terminal electron acceptors. Being consequently a main reason for our
RNAseq
study to discover the transcripts upregulated by the presence of nitrite and clone their promoters as new sensors.
The following section describes protocols used to optimize (Rich media) & control (Minimal media) growth conditions.
Cell culture
With the help of the 'Molecules of defense and communication in the microbial ecosystems' team of the National museum of natural history of Paris (their web page here ), we succeed to cultivate Pseudovibrio denitrificans and the strain Pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola (that they have generously given to us) in two medium, the marine broth (MB) and the minimal medium M9 added 2% of CASAmino Acid and by 3% of NaCl.
Table1: Composition of used media, Marine Broth and M9-CASA+3% NaCl.
Because of the opaqueness of the marine broth, it was impossible to obtain reliable data of the growth of the bacteria. We try to have a curve of growth in filtered MB but even if the bacteria grow, it's not the same condition. Thus, the growth curve has been made in M9-CASA+3%NaCl 1X, with the TECAN infiniteM200 (cf: Figure1).

Doch anstatt kleine Glasstrukturen zu zerbrechen, wollten wir Bakterien zur Produktion bestimmter Produkte wie Farbe bringen [ 2 ].Wie können wir die Bakterien mit einem Laser aktivieren, und sie dabei zur Expression eines Proteins zwingen, ohne sie in tausend kleine Teile platzen zu lassen?
Aufgrund der schier endlos erscheinenden Möglichkeiten der Optogenetik, wurde sie zur Methode des Jahres 2010 durch die Fachzeitschrift Nature Methods gewählt und wird als einer der Durchbrüche des Jahrzehnts angesehen [ 3 ]. Das Markenzeichen von Optogenetik ist die Einführung von schnellen, durch Licht aktivierten Kanälen und Enzymen, welche zeitlich präzise Manipulation elektrischer und biochemischer Ereignisse in Bakterien erlauben. Nutzbar sind dabei Kanäle, welche von Bakteriorhodopsin, an der Photosynthese beteiligte Komplexe, wie Phycobilin in Algen (für unseren Rotlichtpromoter) oder bereits existierende lichtsensorische Domänen in E. coli (wie unser Blaulichtpromoter). Optogenetik bietet uns demnach einen eleganten Weg zur Umwandlung eines Lichtsignals zu Proteinexpression an.
Als wir stärker über die Idee nachdachten, wussten wir, dass wir die Bakterien auf irgendeine Art immobilisieren mussten, um sicherzustellen, dass wir gezielt einzelne Bakterien anregen könnten. Daher haben wir eine Matrix mit dem Namen GELRITE gewählt, welche das Licht mit nur wenig Streuung passieren lässt. Zusätzlich enthält unser genutztes M9-Medium nur ein Minimum an (potentiell licht-absorbierenden) Nährstoffen, um Wachstum und Proteinsynthese zu ermöglichen und zu regulieren.

Um bakteriell erstellte, drei-dimensionale Strukturen unter Nutzung lichtinduzierter Genexpression zu erhalten war ein präziser Regulationsmechanismus notwendig.

Interestingly this residue is located very close to the interaction surface of the two split T7 domains, suggesting a possible role in T7 auto-reassembly (Figure 9).

For discussion about the obtained, recurrent split T7 mutation and its possible role in split domain auto-reassembly, please refer to the protein interaction subpage. In this subproject, we sought out to set up PACE in our lab. Initially, we aimed at reproducing a previously described experiment

, which turned out to be a non-trivial task, but was – in retrospective view – the ideal model for troubleshooting and optimizing our PACE bioreactor. In fact, it lead to a detailed validation of all of our setup’s functionalities with respect to its ability to maintain host cell at constant OD, enable efficient phage propagation on host cells in the lagoon while avoiding phage washout as well as inducing high mutagenesis over a several, consecutive days. When the principle settings were finally under control, we sought out to apply PACE for directed evolution of a split T7 polymerase to optimize auto-reassembly of the split subunits. After having completed the corresponding run (which was at the same time our final run), we observed a recurrent mutation in a residue closely located to the used T7 split site (T877P), indicating that our experiment was successful.  Importantly, our initial struggle with getting PACE up and running motivated us to create a more simple, alternative protocol – PRECEL (for Phage-related discontinues evolution) -   which can be very quickly set up in standard molecular biology and cell biology lab. Thereby, our journey with PACE finally converged into an idea that became an essential component of our evolution toolbox . Taken together, we demonstrate the first, successful implementation of PACE in context of iGEM.

Evolving a split T7 Polymerase -PACE
Based on the high-potential concept of Phage-assisted continous evolution the group of Bryan Dickinson evolved a T7 RNA polymerase in the ""Evolution of a split RNA polymerase as a versatile biosensor platform""-paper, publicated in early 2017

. We choose this example of PACE as our role model for testing of this highly complex method, needing the set"
