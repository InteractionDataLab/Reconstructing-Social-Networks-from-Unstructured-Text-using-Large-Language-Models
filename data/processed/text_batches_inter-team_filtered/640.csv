Collaboration with NTHU_Taiwan
Collaboration with NTHU_Taiwan
As a team composed of members from biology background, we gladly offer help and troubleshoot the problem on making constructs for team NTHU_Taiwan , being insufficient with members from biology department. Since August 3rd, we had several meetings with 2018 iGEM team NTHU_Taiwan.
Earlier before the meeting, NTHU_Taiwan designed the gene of insert for their experiment. After getting the synthesized gene part from IDT and digesting both the inserts and the vectors, they proceeded to ligation, which failed after times               they tried.
We went through details from their design of the gene, cutting site and protocols. Later we concluded that the major reason for failing to make the constructs is due to low concentration of the inserts left following digestion and purification.
We re-designed primers for NTHU_Taiwan and suggested NEBuilder Assembly kit, so that they can avoid the loss of their inserts while digesting and purifying the DNA. The kit requires lower DNA input and can save time by avoiding PCR amplification               steps.
A few weeks later, we were informed that NTHU_Taiwan still failed to make the constructs. Therefore, we provided our lab for their experiments and kept an eye on them through out their experiments to make sure that there’s no man-made technical               false.
Gladly, after several meetup with us and our assistance in lab, team NTHU_Taiwan successfully made all three constructs they needed-- pSB1C3 - AHL snesor - Anti – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLac – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLux – GFP. It was very pleasant experience               to work with NTHU_Taiwan.
Since we urge to seek help in building wiki page, in return, NTHU_Taiwan also give us host a meeting with us teaching coding and giving us tips that help making wiki page easier for us. We took the wiki pages designed by previous teams as examples to learn and practiced basic coding skills(Fig. 1).

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

It refers to research or knowledge that is done for the benefit of the society but can pose a threat to the security of public safety and health, the environment or living organisms if falling into wrong hands.
Several experts attended the event who deal with biosecurity, laws and ethic on a daily basis and were able to inform us about current regulations and committees. These experts were Prof. Dr. Alfons Bora (Faculty of Sociology, University of Bielefeld), Prof. Dr. Kathryn Nixdorff (Leopoldina, University of Darmstadt), Irina Rais (student at the University of Bielefeld and member of its iGEM Team) and Dr. Tom Hobson (University Bath and iGEM Safety Committee). The focus has always been on the questions: Where are the limits of science and should it be limited? And how great is the risk of misuse of science?  Irina presented us the results of a Germany-wide survey conducted by the iGEM Team Bielefeld. They showed the reason for this panel discussion: Students as well as a lot of researchers often didn’t know about dual use, regulations and appropriate authority.
After this, a discussion between the audience and experts started where it became clear, that the definition of biosecurity and biosafety was still an issue. Also the information regarding the laws are not yet clear.
Everybody agreed upon one point though: Dual use needs to be implemented in educational programs.
After the panel discussion we were invited to a nice restaurant by the iGEM Team of Bielefeld. We had to walk through pouring rain in order to get there, but it was well worth it.  In a comfortable atmosphere (next to a fire place, where our clothes were able to dry) we ordered delicious food and drinks and watched the highly anticipated soccer game England versus Croatia. In addition to that we discussed the results of the panel discussion, our current status and problems with not only the Bielfeld team but also the team of Hamm-Lippstadt.
After arriving home it became evident that we also had to check our project for dual use issues because we had never heard of it before. This is why the iGEM Team Bielefeld gave us informational powerpoint slides that can be implemented in Safety instruction briefings.

Modeling on the sensing device
In the mathematical modeling of quorum sensing, we formulated a system of ordinary equations representing the intracellular and extracellular interactions between the two Agr proteins and AIP (auto-inducing peptide) molecules. Along with numerical simulations, we performed an asymptotic analysis of the time-dependent model in order to characterize whether the AIP molecules produced by Staphylococcus aureus in the intestine would activate our sensing device.
To build the model, we first proposed the following assumptions:
Proteins and mRNA inside the cells are limited by natural degradation.
Housekeeping phosphatases are able to dephosphorylate AgrA at rate αpidi.
Receptor-bound AIP can dissociate spontaneously at rate αunbind.
When an AIP binds to AgrC, we assume that auto-phosphorylation of AgrC happens simultaneously because this process is sufficiently fast. When AgrC transfers its phosphate group to AgrA at rate αpi, it is able to re-auto-phosphorylate.
The resulting equations, together with the definitions of the parameters and variables are shown below.

PROJECT UPGRADE
Last month, we had a barbecue for our iGEM team the day after we had another barbecue with the whole GZMB (the Center for Molecular Biosciences in Göttingen) and aside from the delicious meal, many funny things happened.
First there was our attempt to warm our bread (it was couple of baguettes) on the grill that ended with the bread being actually grilled along with the meat. Then, at some point sambuca was being served in shot glasses and eventually also on the table. And there was also a rabbit. One of our lab mates saw it first and, very discretely, proceeded to shout “A rabbit!, a rabbit!”, and Mr. Rabbit was just chilling on the grass, looking at us humans finally enjoying ourselves after so many weeks of pipettes and Petri dishes –which of course is not to say that we don’t enjoy ourselves with our pipettes and Petri dishes, but only that Mr. Rabbit saw us enjoying ourselves after that-. Some started to get close to get a picture of that shy and wonderful display of nature. A prudent voice then mentioned the risks of getting close to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog, but no one really seemed to listen. Then one of our lab mates got too close and Mr. Rabbit decided to retreat.

Scikit-Learn
We made the classification model using scikit-learn or sklearn. 18 The class used for this model is called the RandomForestClassifier which works by fitting a number of decision trees, in our case 2000, on various sub-samples of the dataset and averaging these weak classifiers to improve accuracy and control for. overfitting Overfitting is what happens when a model follows its training data so well it can not predict anything new with any accuracy because too much of the noise from the training data has been modelled, rather than the underlying relationship. We assess the predictive accuracy of our model by doing a stratified 10-fold crossvalidation technique from the StratifiedKFold class. These 10-fold cross-validation runs were assessed with the roc-curves method. A ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR) The proportion of correctly predicted instances of the testing data. against the false positive rate (FPR) The proportion of wrongly predicted instances of the testing data. 19 These kinds of plots are extremely useful in determining whether or not a Machine Learning model such as RandomForest is well trained.
Venn-Diagrams
All three separate methods give a different output. In order to make an easy visual comparison, we make use of a web tool that can easily calculate and draw custom Venn-diagrams. This tool was made by the university of Gent and can be found here .

Varroa Isolate results
The Varroa isolates experiment found an isolate of interest which warrented more analysis. This potential Varroa-killing bacteria was sequenced using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). According to the 16S analysis results as seen in Lisa's notebook this isolate appeared to be a close match to Lysinibacillus.  From over 17.5 million reads, the pipeline assembled the sequencing results into a genome consisting of 822 contigs. From this assembled genome the pipeline was able to find 4,427 genes, of which 4 were identified as potential Cry proteins. These were further investigated. For the results, click on the button below. More statistics about the assembly can be found in Table 1.

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#what are microcompartments_-_-_TEXT.html," a perfect icosahedron with diameter 120nm as established from literature. Following this, we further developed the model by noting that many of the images taken of pdu microcompartments suggest slight and random deviations from an icosahedron.
Taking this into consideration, we have developed a simulation which generates pdu microcompartment structures by starting with a regular icosahedron and randomly distorting the location of each co-ordinate by up to 5% of total edge length.
Given more time and information, this model could be further improved by studying as many microcompartments as possible and refining the size of the deviation from a perfect icosahedron. The magnitude of structural deformation likely follows a normal distribution for which a mean and standard deviation could be established.
An example microcompartment structure (blue) visualized alongside a perfect icosahedral structure (red).

The number of microcompartments in a given cell can vary broadly, from a few microsomes to numbers that occupy the vast amount of the cytosol. Because of their size and the number of protein components, microcompartments are an extensive strain on the metabolism of cells. We have placed the E. coli ABTUNJK codon under control of the T7 promoter, while that for P. putida is placed under control of the T3 promoter.
Modelling the number of enzymes in a microcompartment
Modelling the number of enzymes in a microcompartment
The aim of this model was to predict a theoretical maximum number of enzyme molecules that can be packed into a single microcompartment. To get a first estimate, without taking into consideration whether this volume of protein would interrupt the biological processes in the cell, we approached the problem volumetrically.
Due to the complexity of the enzyme movements and their interactions, we simplified their structures by approximating them as ellipsoids with axes lengths calculated through modelling the monomers and predicting the structures of the FdhA tetramer and DcmA hexamer respectively.
Oxford iGEM 2014
The ellipsoid packing problem
Once treated as ellipsoids, the problem was then reduced to the classical ‘sand packing’ problem. Because the dimensions of these proteins was substantially smaller than the icosahedron (by approximately a factor of 20 in every dimension), we assumed that the geometry of the container i.e. the microcompartment, was not significant.
Another assumption made in these calculations was that the enzymes could be treated as homogenous. They are of very similar dimensions, varying by no"

Question 5
What do you think is the current situation of global climate?
你觉得目前全球气候的状况是怎样的？
We wanted to find Chinese people’ views on climate change. Results are that over a half people considered the situation of global warming was quite serious and almost half of people felt that climate was changing currently. Particularly, there was nobody thinking the climate as same as that many years ago. Therefore, we can know Chinese people still cared about climate and had similar view that climate was changing currently.
Question 6
Which of the following item do you think is the main cause of greenhouse effect?
你觉得什么是造成温室效应最大的原因?
We asked reasons for climate change, the majority of people thought we destoryed the environment and a few people considered it was the automatical processing on Earth development.
Question 7
Which behavior do you think will intensify the greenhouse effect?
你认为社会上哪些行为会加重温室效应？
Most of people industrial pollution is considered as the most serious issue on environmnet as well as the most significant reason for climate change. Also, people thought the reducing vegetation and the destruction of eco-environment caused global warming. They did not view the urbanization and garbage were the main reasons.
Question 8
Do you pay attention to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and promote low carbon life in your daily life?
你在日常生活中会注意减少自身二氧化碳排放，倡导低碳生活吗？
CO2 is a type of warming gases, its uncontrolled emissions may result in climate change. We wanted to remain people of reducing the emissions of CO2 in their daily life. We found that people would like to enjoy green lifestyle such as riding bicycle, but they need more guide lines.
Question 9
Is it safe or not to display the process of global warming on our biothermomap? Please state your opinion.
你认为在实验室中用我们的生物地图表现全球变暖过程是否安全？
Two third of people thought our project is safe, while the rest of them were worried about safety issue. They argued that biology students may have operation mistakes so that these bacteria could separate into environment and cause danger."

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html," as a priority right now. Therefore we find it unlikely that the wish to colonize Mars will gain significant public support right now. However in the future, as technology improves and the realisation of colonizing Mars moves closer, and the current mayor problems for humanity hopefully takes an end the topic might gain more public interest and awake stronger opinions and more engagement from the public. The result of this could either become a primary motivator for colonization of Mars or the exact opposite.
Especially argument nr 2, can be related to some of the major motivations for colonizing land historically. When looking at the massive expansion and possession of land throughout the era of imperialism, it has later been speculated if the need to possess, explore, and expand is a fundamental human need. As has the argument ""it's the next step for humanity"" also found its way into the debate on whether or not we should colonize Mars. However it is worth thinking about that it is not all of humanity who has come to this step, just as the explorers of ""unexplored"" land often seemed to ignore that there were people living there already. We might be forgetting that there are lots of people on our planet who are on the lower steps in the hierarchy of needs as theorised by Maslow and who does not have the privilege of thinking about the next step for humanity. While that is not an argument against colonization of Mars, it is one for consciously prioritizing our resources and choose the right time to colonize and the argument of demonstrating political power isn't favorable for the good of humanity as a whole.
Part 3
What are the ethical implications for colonization and transport of biomaterial?
Contamination risk and space travel
Another important aspect of potentially colonising Mars, is the consequences it might have for our ability to investigate life on Mars if we contaminate the planet with life forms from earth. In this chapter we will therefore shed light on safety procedures regarding sterilization techniques and discuss whether they are sufficient for avoiding contamination and if the potential risk of contamination is worth taking.
The use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) is a controversial topic terrestrially, with concerns over their interactions with wild organisms and unknown long term impacts upon health. It is therefore logical that there would be even graver concerns with using GMOs in space, an environment where terrestrial life is largely untested and the bacterial reaction to microgravity is poorly understood. There is recent evidence that bacterial response to microgravity could even be considered dangerous due to its persister like reaction making it highly antibiotic resistant.
However, the use of GMOs is now considered a possible solution"

Cell Sorting
Cell Sorting
Summary
The ability to sort cells by type or physical properties is a valuable tool in many synthetic biology labs. Prior to analysis or in order to perform specialized protocols, creating homogenous cell suspensions from a mixture is necessary. In addition to sorting cells, the removal of cell fragments, activated magnetic particles or unwanted debris through sorting also makes up a key part of purification protocols.
This microfluidic chip design carries out cell sorting as a cell suspension is passed through it. Cells are sorted based on size and pushed to the periphery of the channel. These cells are then carried away from the main solution through the two periphery outputs, and the cell-free solution can be collected from the central output.
This chip has been milled, tested and deemed fully fluid functional. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.
The design for this chip was inspired by the following paper:

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#SinceAmsterdam_-_-_TEXT.html," detection with investigated processes including NADH-dependent enzyme reactions. The verification of the selectivity is an important matter to exclude any unspecific reactions which might result in a NAD+-independent fluorescence enhancement. Hence, a selectivity test for LigA was performed with the analytes NADH, NADP+, NADPH, 3-ADAP (NAD+ with an exchanged functional group at the nicotinamide ring system), ATP and ADP, and the relative fluorescence enhancement rates in a NAD+ bioassay were compared with the one for NAD+ (Figure 20).
Figure 20: LigA shows high selectivity for NAD+. The final concentration of all analytes was 100 nM. The responses were evaluated on the basis of the average fluorescence enhancement rate in a range of 200 s after addition of each analyte into the NAD+ bioassay. The dotted line marks the threshold indicating the intensity of background signal. All data are normalized to the NAD+ value (n = 2).
The negative control (H2O) shows that there was a small background signal about 5 % of the signal that was produced by NAD+ when using 100 nM of analytes. This marks the threshold for fluorescence enhancement which is caused by the employed analyte. NADH, NADPH and ATP were similar to the negative control and can thereby seen as analytes that do not enable DNA ligation by LigA. Only the values for the three analytes NADP+, 3-APAD and ADP were above the threshold, but they were constantly below 10 % of the NAD+ signal. This leads to the suggestion that LigA ist highly selective for NAD+ even in presence of structurally similar analytes. This makes the NAD+ bioassay and the associated enzyme LigA suitable for investigating NADH-dependent enzyme reactions or measuring NAD+ in biological analyte mixtures such as cell lysates.
Coupled enzyme reaction
The coupling of the LigA-including NAD+ detection system was performed with a NADH-dependent enzymatic reaction which was in concrete the conversion of pyruvate to L-lactate by lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) from E. coli. For this the LDH reaction was done with an excess of NADH and various pyruvate concentrations. Afterwards, the reaction mix was transferred to a NAD+ bioassay and the fluorescence intensity was monitored. In Figure 21 the normalized initial"

We did a first attempt to Gibson assemble BBa_K1913007 using (unpurified) PCR reactions of BBa_B0015, BBa_C0052, BBa_I0500, BBa_K081007 and pSB1C3 mentioned before. We used NEB GA mastermix and followed the corresponding protocol. We used 0.2 to 2.0 µl of 50 ng/µl dilutions of the PCR product to use 75 ng of pSB1C3 and 2.5 as much moles of the other fragments, except for B0015 where 5 times the backbone concentration was used. After assembly, we transformed the mixture to electro competent cells prepared beforehand by Belwina. The plates were kindly transferred from 37℃ to 4℃ by Alex (supervisor).
We did a colony taq PCR of 48 of the resulting colonies to screen for successful assembly clones. We found one clone (‘colony 35’) that showed a substantially bigger insert than the background found in the other colonies and in the negative control.

Dr. Andre Samuel Dr. Christopher Szent-Gyorgyi
The CMU iGEM team worked this summer to strengthen our ties with the Citizen Science Lab in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The goal of the lab is to ""engage and promote the limitless opportunities that the life sciences offer to the betterment of our community. "" The program is run by Dr. Andre Samuel who is a strong believer in accessible science. Our team interviewed him to get a better understanding of his lab’s platform and to also see how our work could benefit him and his students.  To find out more about the Citizen Science Lab, visit their website , twitter , or Facebook .
What is your background?
I completed my PhD work at Duquesne University on Homology modeling in E.Coli. I studied how proteins in E.Coli cells changed after cold-shocking versus heat-shocking. Before receiving my doctorate, I was a research technician for 7 years working with small organisms such as rodents. I initially wanted to be a veterinarian after completing my undergraduate career, but I realized my passion for giving students the opportunity to open themselves up to science, especially in the Pittsburgh region.
How did you obtain this position?
I currently am the director of New Science Citizens Lab, and they gave me this position when I worked in encouraging DIY science projects on the Duquesne campus, which is exactly what New Citizens Lab is all about.
What is the New Citizens Science Lab?
We operate on a monthly membership of $95/month (similar to Pittsburgh Tech Shop) and are mainly here to educate and provide a space for students to conduct individual science projects. We are funded by Urban Innovation 21 as a nonprofit organization. We also offer public space that people can rent out. The main costs are ideally covered by the membership fees but are also assisted through grants by the National Science Foundation.
How do you get the name of New Citizens Lab out there?
I would walk the streets and hand out flyers, we also have active accounts on social media FB, Twitter, and IG Periscope. We also have a user-friendly website which helps us in networking with organizations around our area. We typically participate in various community events such as the Hill District Back to School celebration and Carnegie Science SciTech Days in"

Why TetR?
In vitro Main | Why TetR? | Mutant TetRs | MITOMI Data | In-vivo & In-vitro outline
After having considered several potential transcription factor candidates, the choice was made to use TetR for our transcription factor development pipeline. TetR has several advantages:
It exhibits a strong affinity to its consensus sequence
It has already been well characterized in the literature. This characterization is especially true of the protein region involved in promoter recognition, the latter having been the subject of substantive review and research. TetR mutants showing an altered specificity have already been reported, which is encouraging news in light of our project topic.
TetR is one of the most frequently-used transcription factors in synthetic biology. To expand knowledge of its engineering and scientific properties would be of significant interest to the synthetic biology community.
It can be easily repressed by adding anhydrotetracycline (ATC) – a relatively inexpensive molecule.
Background Information about TetR
Widespread among bacteria, TetR is a repressor that regulates enzymes essential for resistance against the antibiotic tetracycline. These enzymes are encoded on the tet operon (TetO), which is repressed by TetR in normal conditions. When tetracycline is present, the antibiotic molecule binds to TetR and inactivates it, thus allowing the expression of TetO.
TetR forms a dimer, each part of the dimer being involved in DNA binding. Consequently, the recognition sequence of TetR is symmetrical (the two boxes on the image below), with a base pair separating the two sub-sequences. Orth et al, 2000 The whole promoter, comprising this recognition sequence, is called Ptet.
The binding of each monomer to the recognition sequence has been studied thoroughly; we know which amino acid interacts to which nucleotide, as can be seen in the figure below. The amino acids directly involved in binding to the DNA are found in between position "
NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"FA is not a fixative; it must be depolymerized to formaldehyde in solution and kept in sealed containers at a temperature between 2 and 8oC.
It's widely accepted that PFA is a strong carcinogen which is mainly absorbed through skin. It is also irritating to eyes, respiratory system and skin. Thus, lab workers should wear suitable protective clothing, gloves and eye/face protectors and work in fume hoods. In case of contact with eyes, one should rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical treatment.
Phenol is widely used in laboratory for its high efficiency in extraction of DNA and RNA. However, this reagent is also highly corrosive to eyes, skin, and respiratory system, leading to burning, allergy reaction or dermatitis. Inhalation or exposure of high concentration of phenol may lead to some diseases in nervous and cardiac system. Besides, long-term exposure to phenol is also toxic to liver or kidney due to both hydrophobicity and the formation of phenoxyl radicals.
According to its toxicity, careful protection is required when operating phenol reagents, such as thick gloves, protection suits and eyes protectors. In case of contact with skin, polyethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol or plenty of water should be immediately rinsed before seeking for further medical treatment.
Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is commonly applied in lysing cells during DNA extraction. It is also used in SDS-PAGE to denature protein molecules. Though having little toxicity to the organism, long-term or repeated exposure may still irritate to eyes and skin, or even lead to allergy reaction for certain people. Under this circumstance, protections such as laboratory gloves and eye protectors are still recommended.
Investigating in the lab
In fact we know little about the things actually happening in the labs. So we had to go to many labs and observe the situations for ourselves. We designed a questionnaire and went to observe many biology labs in Tianjin. We talked with the students and got 193 samples for the questionnaire. We did the data analysis and took some pictures in the labs.
All the questions and the results are as follows. To make things clear, pictures taken in biology institutions in Tianjin will also be presented.
Q1. How is the experiment and resting area separated in your lab?
A. There is a separate room for resting purposes
B. Two areas are in the same room on separated benches.
C. Two areas are on the same bench with separated sections.
D. We practically do not separate those two areas.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to test-drive the RDP system with a simple biosensor build. The RDP: Lux + Rudolph device was constructed using the Synbiota Rapid DNA Prototyping (RDP) protocol in order to produce a prototype biosensor that detects L-Acyl-Homoserine-Lactone (AHL) and produces red fluorescent protein (RFP) in response.  This mechanism is as follows: AHL is a small molecule (213.23 Daltons) produced by some bacteria that have evolved quorum sensing circuits to detect the presence of high concentrations of bacteria.   We started with the naturally-occurring quorum-sensing circuit where the LuxR regulatory protein binds with AHL and stimulates promotion by the pLux promoter.  In the wild, this can trigger behavior such as biofilm formation. Since the community around the canal asked us for a biosensor that would produce a visual indication of high bacterial presence, we realized that placement of an RFP translational unit based on the ‘Rudolph’ RFP submitted by Genspace at iGEM 2014 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1429001  ) downstream of the pLux would result in a color change in the presence of bacteria producing AHL.
RDP-compatible parts for the upstream Lux-based device (based on BBa_J37019 ) and the downstream Rudolph RFP (based on BBa_K1429001 ) were created using a protocol supplied by Synbiota and template DNA from the Biobrick distribution kit.  For the RFP translational unit BBa_K1429001 we designed the primer to omit the RBS of the original part, and instead replaced it during the build with an RBS supplied in the RDP kit. The three parts assembled were BBa_J37019 with RDP ends, the RBS from the RDP kit, and the ORF portion of BBa_K1429001 with RDP ends. The build went very well, with a large number of colonies containing the proper construction. The resulting biosensor was characterized  using AHL as the input and red fluorescence (553/570). PCR primers were used to give it biobrick ends, and it was cloned into pSB1C3 and submitted as part BBa_ K1799018 ,
A combination of more than one biosensor system that each detect a different component of sewage would make a much more powerful and accurate sensor.
The next step was to design and order DNA for all the parts of the other two biosensor systems that were not present"

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2015,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," the amount of chemicals that are used on the fields. Even so there are only three crops with genetically modifications that are allowed in the EU (Nicolia, Manzo, Veronesi, & Rosellini, 2013). This can be compared to the US where already 15 years ago 60% of all produced food contained some kind of modification (Ahmed, 2002).
We can see in our survey that the public was significantly less in favor of GMO compared to academics. We believe that one reason for the public's mistrust in GMO products and research is based on lack of knowledge. People don’t like things they don’t know anything about, and that is one reason for why it is important to start talking about these things in school. Education is often the best way to give people a correct image of the situation and to make them see the possibilities with the technology. There have been conducted a lot of studies among high school students about their knowledge of biotechnology and what they think about GMO. It seems like the majority of high school student around the world does not know what biotechnology is, but they are in general at least a bit optimistic about GMO as long as it does not involve animals (Usak, Erdogan, Prokop, & Ozel, 2009). There is also a survey that shows that people in the US don’t see the difference between genetically engineered food and food that contains DNA ( Lusk & Murray , 2015). We decided to do something about that lack of knowledge and got in contact with high schools around Gothenburg.
One ethical problem that is directly connected to our project is that we are constructing a yeast strain that is more resistant to radiation than natural ones. This means that if it got out into the wild, the yeast could be harder to get rid of and could compete with the natural organisms. We have taken that in consideration and have in addition to the repair-system created a Safety Switch that is glucose dependent. This safety switch will kill the cell if it doesn’t have constant access to glucose.

For the genetically engineered bacteria, the product would need to follow special regulation for a recombinant Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP). The current regulations for recombinant LBP leave different grey zones that are key for the successful introduction of a product with these characteristics into the market. Because of this, we have developed a policy that we hope can start the discussion over this subject.
If you want to read our policy please go here!
For our product, the specific steps to follow would be to assess Human Safety, Environmental Safety and risk assessment for the recombinant LBP of our choice.
In terms of human safety, for a LBP the policy recommends:
identification of the genus and species of the probiotic strain by using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic tests as clinical evidence suggesting that the health benefits of probiotics may be strain specific
in vitro and in vivo testing to delineate the mechanism of the probiotic effect, the safety and the efficacy
substantiation of the clinical health benefit of probiotic agents with human trials
patterns of antimicrobial drug resistance
metabolic activities
adverse effects noted in humans during clinical trials and after marketing
toxin production and hemolytic potential if the probiotic strain is known to possess those properties
lack of infectivity in model organisms 44
Additionally, in order to certify human safety, as a recombinant LBP, different extra measurements are regarded:
Conduct a proper risk-benefit ratio where the benefit of using a specific solution should be large enough to exceed the risk of not taking any action.
Conduct Laboratory toxicology studies including 28-day repeated-dose toxicology studies in two species, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests, safety pharmacology, and reproductive toxicity assessment.
Develop and validate a sophisticated bio-containment strategy limiting the growth of LBP to defined environments. A three-layered strategy has previously been described which holds promise but still needs to further be improved.
This sophisticated biocontainment strategy should be properly designed ensuring human and environmental safety.
In terms of risk assessment, different characteristics should be analyzed:
Dose and frequency of use
Short-term and especially long-term effects
Interactions with other substances (including alcohol and medicaments)
Individual characteristics
Characteristics of the social environment45
A Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) is recommended in order to analyze all the factors considered before 46.

School Workshop
Relevance
Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology are two emerging fields of Australian research, both of which have the potential to make significant contributions to the health, environment and agriculture sectors1. In order to reflect this, the Education Department of the Australian state of New South Wales has recently rewritten the syllabus to include ‘Biotechnology’ and ‘Genetics’ modules in its an elective two-year biology course for high school juniors and seniors (American equivalent Grade 11 and Grade 12). Previously, these modules could be chosen as part of an intensive elective study, however, they now must be completed by all students taking the course, which is one of the most popular in the state. As a result, resources relating to the ‘Biotechnology’ and ‘Genetics’ topics are limited.
Universities have been supporting the syllabus changes, running workshops and educational activities to provide support to educators. Our team similarly wanted to get involved with this and as such, have focused on assisting with the syllabus changes by running a high school excursion and creating an educational package. Not only has this allowed us to meaningfully help science educators, but it has given us the opportunity to inspire high school leavers with current biological trends – and thereby encourage the next generation of scientists and engineers.
Research
Previous studies conducted on short-duration science outreach programs highlight the benefit of engaging students to help them develop new views on science and scientists2. Student engagement naturally increases when such programs also present inherently interesting topics, many of which can be found in the fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology. However, teaching these cutting-edge areas to Grade 11 and 12 students has been reported as challenging, as teachers have struggled to find appropriate practical work and students finding concepts challenging3.
Universities running workshops directed at these complex curriculum areas is one well-researched way to help teachers, and this need is particularly acute given the new syllabus. The novelty of different presenters running engaging and hands-on activities with authentic science materials and equipment can enable previously challenging science topics to seem new and appealing – and thus inspire further effort2. Past iGEM teams have also shown an interest in innovation in this area, with other local Sydney teams, such as the Macquarie University and University of Sydney 2017 iGEM teams running practical investigations for younger students.
However, our team has decided to follow the lead of the University of Melbourne 2016 iGEM team, who focused on targeting students in the final years of high school. Given the local context of a"

3 mL of this solution was pipetted into seven 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
The Petri dishes were then labeled and put into an incubator for 24 hours at 37℃.
After 24 hours, the solution was poured out of each dish into a bleach container. The dishes were then rinsed with distilled water twice.
___ drops of crystal violet were placed around the rim of the Petri dishes. If a biofilm had formed, a ring of crystal violet would be seen.
Testing with home cleaners:
Once we knew that we could grow biofilms, we decided to test out the effectiveness of home cleaning products. The products we tested are Mr. Clean, Fantastik, Truly, Windex, Tilex, Bleach, Lysol, and GreenWorks. The protocol that we used for this is as follows:
Using biofilms made the previous day with protocol 1, the experimenter removed the contents in the dish in the bleach container. Then the experimenter rinsed the Petri dish with distilled water twice. The Petri dishes were laid out on paper towel to let the excess water drip out.
After the Petri dishes were thoroughly dry, 3.2 mL of one of the listed cleaning products was pipetted into a Petri dish. The cleaning product was left in the Petri dish for 30 minutes (If bleach was being used, only for 15 minutes).
The cleaning product was then disposed of in the bleach container. The Petri dish was then rinsed with water once.
To see if a biofilm was still remaining, 100 μL of LB media was pipetted onto the inside edge of the Petri dish.
The LB media was then pipetted back into the LB media tube along with 5 μL of KAN.
This was then put into the shaker for 24 hours at 37 ℃.
Testing Antibiotics:
We also tested antibiotics to see if they could get rid of biofilms as well. We used this protocol:
Biofilms made using protocol 1 were rinsed twice using distilled water.
In twelve 2 mL tubes, 1.65 mL of double distilled water was pipetted into each of them. Into two 2 mL tubes, 3.3 μL of AMP was pipetted into them.
Step 2 was repeated using CAM, TET, and water as a control.
Two of the 2 mL tubes for each of the antibiotic and control"

In the lab, we made some more cells competent, and ran yesterday’s minipreps on a gel, with mixed results.
Wednesday 2nd July
Today we had a meeting with some artists who are keen to be involved with the project. After a pizza and beer fuelled discussion, we met with Fraiser, who is keen to produce a piece of art that would tie in with our project. The idea of an actual exhibit event sounds fantastic, and everyone seemed enthusiastic. This sounds promising!
Otherwise things continued in a similar vein as previous days – transformations were carried out and paperclip primers were designed.
Thursday 3rd July
A new aspect of the project entered the lab stage today, as Mg1665 cells were made competent ready for the actual metabolic wire mining to begin – very exciting times.
Friday 4th July
The population control system moved closer to reality today, with the discovery of the Rcd short RNA mediated division checkpoint, which looks like it can induce exactly the kind of quiescence we want. A minor setback appeared in that it’s pretty heavily patented, but a very recently discovered possible mechanism of action for it involving DNA gyrase is not (yet) patented and so might provide a potential avenue. Still looks like very hard work however.
Some genomic extraction was done in the lab today also, ready for gene harvesting – soon our metabolic wires will be forged from the resultant gloop.
Weekend 5th-6th
A sunny weekend this time, which Anna nonetheless spent reading up on degron testing and part characterisation entries. What a hero.
Week 7 (7th June – 13th July)
Monday 7th
Another new week, another week closer to the end. Today was spent largely on paperclip primer design, circuit diagram creation for population control, and degron characterisation.
Tuesday 8th
We started to try and get some Human Practices balls rolling today, with the ‘Big List’ of ideas transformed into a rudimentary action plan, and more research into previous projects’ endeavours.
Meanwhile various lab tasks were got on with – the sugar logic components were miniprep’d out, primers were designed for the aromatic wires, and some sequencing was ordered.
Wednesday 9th

Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"

On the way to make a better world.
Meetup with Head-quarters from iGEM
Get motivated from IGEM Headquartes
On May 19th, SZU-iGEM took part in the meeting with iGEM Headquarters along with Southern University of Science and Technology of China and Xiamen University. In the meeting we raised the questions regarding to team communications worldwide and giving some suggestion related to  the judging part. The words and experience Mr Randy Rettberg shared about the reason he set up iGEM did give us great motivations to create a better world.
Get Started Synthetic Biology
The Festival exhibit of College of Life Sciences of SZU
Biological graduates are once considered to be one of the groups with lowest employment rate and biology has since been left out in many students’ mind. However, synthetic biology open a window for the university student to look deeper into the fantastic aspect that various biological parts can be synthesized like a computer. The Festival exhibit the last year and this year project of our team attached with the synthetic biological information. Surprisingly it receive some praise. Some literal students even the exchange students grew strong interest in our project and would like to join us in the lab.
The Juvenile Biology Maker in Primary School
Asking an adult a question,you may receive a certain answer but asking a primary school student you will receive even more questions. Primary school is where the curiosity and interest fosters. On Sept 11th, we extended our footprint to primary school to talk to those little scientists who has affinity for nature and science. In the meetup, we demonstrated how our system works as well as the related knowledge about bladder cancer. After the lecture, students came to us with lots of questions about our project and cancer. With laugh and passion, the idea spread in every corner of the room and the love for science passed down to the new generation. After that we decided to be their biological mentor and give them lectures once a month. It can never be more pleasant to be the one to sow the seed and make a little difference.

We attended a number of workshops and talks of speakers, some of them being Dr. John Collins, Dr. Tom Ellis, Dr. Piers Millet, and Dr. Karen Polizzi.
Hosting Meetup with Newcastle team
If you have ever heard about The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (the world's largest arts festival) you probably know how crazy it gets with hundreds of thousands of people hanging around. Thus, on 20th of August, we decided to step back for one day from wet lab work and invited Newcastle iGEM team to talk and discuss our projects and then to see some comedy shows afterwards. Both teams had some comments for each other, and we were very happy to share the experience.
Bits and pieces
Besides meetups, labwork, we also had talks and chats with many other iGEM teams, as it always nice to have a chat about something different.
Mike the Microbe
Mike the microbe from Carroll iGEM team visited us. It was so nice to have a picture of a beautiful sciency bacteria on our lab bench that kept reminding us of importance of lab safety!

The NOS terminators were amplified in preparation for assembly of PhaC and Castor.
June 23-29
The DNA arrived, was hydrated, and a preliminary CBAR reaction was completed to assemble the two constructs. The desired product was then PCR amplified from the CBAR reaction.
June 30-July 6
A gel of the PCR amplified CBAR did not yield either of the constructs.
July 7-13
The PCR amplification of both CBAR were again run on a gel, but again yielded nothing. The CBAR were run again, but were heat killed this time. This did not solve the problem and the CBAR were still unsuccessful. Two new vector plasmids were also cultured. A gradient PCR was also tried for PhaC.
July 14-20
Pollux was optimized for synthesis. This required breaking it into two major segments that would later need to be assembled. It was also suggested that PhaC and Castor be assembled with intermediates instead of all at once. New primers were designed to implement this idea.
July 21-27
Intermediate components of PhaC and Castor were prepared via PCR. These were then run through a CBAR to assemble them into their final constructs.
July 28-August 3
PhaC was digested and ligated into its final construct, minus the NOS terminator.
August 4-10
The PhaC construct was transformed and colonies were picked for a screen.
August 11-17
The screen of PhaC looked promising. Castor was digested and ligated into its final vector plasmid. Colonies were picked and cultured for a screen.
August 18-24
PhaC was sequenced and found to be correct.
August 25-31
The PhaC construct was digested and the NOS terminator prepared previously was ligated. The screen colonies for Castor were digested and run on a gel. The results looked promising for Castor being in the desired construct.
September 1-7
Castor was submitted to sequencing and found to be correct. However one of the sequencing reactions went poorly and will need to be re-run. Primers were also designed for amplifying parts to be submitted to the registry.
September 8-14
The failed sequencing reaction for Castor was repeated and confirmed the sequence. Parts were also amplified and prepared to be submitted to the registry. The PhaC and Castor constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium.

With the Carnegie Mellon iGEM Team, we also participated in the Pittsburgh iGEM meet-up on September 6, 2014, along with teams from Penn State, University of Michigan, and Montgomery High School. The meet-up consisted of practice presentations and information sessions on creating a poster, public speaking, and constructing a wiki.
We also participated in the University of Virginia’s survey “Synthetic Biology Global Acceptance and Awareness”.  When researching the skin probiotics market, we found AOBiome, a company devoted to products that restore the skin’s microbiome. We reached out to them for their thoughts on the skin microbiome and probiotics and presented the information in a blog post published on August 29, 2014.

Then, in order to overexpress foreign genes in the cyanobacteria, the intrinsic promoter of Rubisco large subunit (PrbcL) was chosen as the target for vector construction.       PrbcL regulates the expression of the most abundant proteins in photosynthetic species and has been proven to have a high activity to express foreign genes, so we chose PrbcL as the promoter of our pigment gene.1
The strategy we chose to construct the vector is to fuse B0015 and AmpR together first.       Secondly, we fused 5’- and 3’-ends of the neutral site II (NSII) with PBR322 replication origin (ORI) together.       At last, we ligated two parts together.       The vector (pPIGBACK) is used to transform into PCC7942 with the inserted pigment gene in our experiments.      After mass reproduction in E. coli DH5α, PCC7942 were transformed through the uptake of plasmid DNAs extracted from E. coli DH5α.       The transformed strains (transformants) were usually successfully obtained after 2 to 3 weeks and survived the ampicillin treatment.

Indigoidine (IndC)
Indigoidine is cyan pigment produced by natural-existing bacteria. Due to the resemblance of Indigoidine and industrial dye indigo, we believe that Indigoidine will find uses in both industry and biology fields. In nowadays studies, an Indigoidine synthetase Sc-IndC and an associated helper protein Sc-IndB were identified from Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BAP1 to produce the blue pigment2. The IndB gene codes for a putative phosphatase and the IndC gene codes for Indigoidine synthase. Together, these enzymes convert L-glutamine into Indigoidine. Recently, it has been shown that IndC alone can produce Indogoidine, and the inclusion of IndB expression in the system will increase yields significantly3.
As we know, L-Glutamine is the direct biosynthetic precursor of Indigoidine, and it is a key amino acid in primary metabolism and thus naturally exists in S. elongatus PCC7942. Because glutamine related products are already existed in S. elongatus"

Synthetic biology
The drive to develop 'a technology of the living substance' has fascinated scientist for centuries and has led to several moments in history when scientists claimed they were about to 'create life in a test tube', produce 'synthetic new species', or otherwise engage in the engineering of genes and chromosomes. Synthetic biology takes an engineering approach to building artificial biological systems, taking the tools and experimental techniques of genetic engineering to a new level. The focus is often on ways of taking parts of natural biological systems, characterizing and simplifying them, and using them as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system. The individual parts are standardized by engineers to facilitate exchange and reuse of parts, for example as DNA BioBricksTM. Synthetic biology already has many accomplishments to its credit.
iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate synthetic biology competition, first held in 2003. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. They will make use of known BioBricksTM and develop new BioBricksTM that will be added to the registry. The organization promotes the advancement of science and education by developing an open community of students and practitioners in schools, laboratories, research institutes and industry. The research described on this site is the research done by the iGEM team of the Eindhoven University of Technology in 2012 and will be presented at the European iGEM Jamboree on 5-7 October 2012. Hopefully we will also be invited to present ourresearch during the World Championship Jamboree at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.

Results
This experiment has recently been completed, though the data analysis remains to be completed.
That said, given the therapeutic effects observed in Experiment 3, we anticipate that our findings will be consistent with that of literature, and thus, by extension, that our hypothesis will confirm that PPIX is a safe therapeutic which does not exhibit any adverse health risks to the target population. Validation of this outcome, again, is still forthcoming.
Conclusion
Upon answering our questions, through experiments 1 to 3, Team UAlberta obtained promising results that suggest APIS is a feasible method to treat Nosema ceranae infections in vivo. Our team anticipates that these experiments provide an experimental foundation which justifies continued experimentation with the finalized genetic construct. As shown in our Wetlab results here, we are close to demonstrating that our genetically engineered device successfully functions as a dedicated PPIX-producing machine. In subsequent work, we anticipate that the completion of Experiment 4 and the other methods described above will serve as a successful framework in which we can test the finalized construct’s therapeutic ability, and hopefully demonstrate that this technology is a promising solution to the threat of Nosema ceranae, whether via direct introduction into the bee diet, or as a tailored biosynthetic means of high-level production PPIX production. The latter feature may be made possible via incorporation of our design into a large-scale bioreactor to fill the gaping hole in apicultural antifungal therapies.

We cloned dnaQ gene from E.coli BL21(DE3) by PCR and utilized overlap extension PCR to introduce mutagenesis in dnaQ by the following protocol.
Firstly, we used E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain as template to amplify dnaQ gene by PCR with mut-F and mut-R primers, respectively. After purification of PCR product (the 〖E.Z.N.A.〗^TM Gel Extraction Kit, produced by Omega Bio-tek), it was used as template to introduce point mutation by two parallel PCRs with the following two sets of primers: mut-L73W-F and mut-L73W-R (generating L73W); mut-A164V-F and mut-A164V-R (generating A164V). The three PCR products were gel-purified and combined by 5ng,respectively and assembled with mut-F and mut-R primers. The resulting overall product was T-cloned into Takara pMD-19 T-vector (produced by Takara BioTechnology (DALIAN)CO.,LTD.) and sequenced to confirm the sequence. The L73W and A164V mutant BL21 (DE3) dnaQ was named after mutD.

Maltose hydrolase gene malQ was cloned from E.coli JW3995.
In parallel, we also constructed tryptophan sensor circuit. According to the report about the translating ribosome by nascent peptide based tryptophan degradation gene cluster regulation mechanism, we previously synthesized the corresponding tnaC coupling Rho sequence. This gene cluster was assembled with lacZ gene by overlap PCR and the gel-purified fragment was cloned between NcoI and HindIII sites of pTrc99A vector by restriction enzyme digest and T4 ligase induced ligation. All the information about primers was shown in “primer information”. This plasmid was named after pTrc99A_trp sensor_lacZ.

In this week, we tried to clone mutD and sfGFP cluster downstream of araBAD promoter (pBAD). We amplified pSC101-Cm-pBAD and sfGFP fragment from plasmid AraC_pBAD_CI_OR222-sfGFP, which was kindly provided by Professor Ouyang Qi in Peking University. mutD was introduced by three different ribozyme binding site (RBS) sequence upstream and also"

Unfortunately, well 3  does not show any bands. Well 2 has a plasmid band that is pretty close to the expect size of the plasmid construct.
Because the constructs on this plate don't seem to work, I religated pcat with YFPc and transformed it on a new plate. As these reactions were taking place, I also attempted to induce the pbad again. This time various concentrations of arabinose were used on the cell culture of the pbad_YFPc construct, pbad_RFPc construct, and the pbad_GFPc construct. Concentrations of 5 uM, 10 uM, and 50uM. This was for liquid culture in LB and PBS to prevent auto fluorescence from the LB. In theory, it should be easier to see the fluorescence if any in the PBS liquid.
Once there were colonies on the plates for the new pcat_YFPc, plasmid preps were made as well as another restriction digest reaction on them. During restriction digest, I used plasmids from the new plate and old plate. This time a new buffer was also used on the double digestion, Buffer 3 when cutting at X and P sites. Only double cuts were made on these sample with either EcoRI and SpeI sites or XbaI and PstI sites. All these reactions were run on a gel.

We did two colony PCR to check the samples, but we got negative results from the colony PCR. Even so, we still continued to miniprep those colonoes which were used for colony PCR and checked them with normal PCR later, this time we saw expected bands for all 4 samples, which should be around 600bp for 1(TuYV coat protein) and 1H(TuYV coat protein with his-tag) and 800bp for 4(TuYV coat protein with partial readthrough) and 4H (TuYV coat protein with partial readthrough with his-tag).

From the results, the majority (30%) of the participants said they think charging stations in public places would be a successful, with 13% suggesting other including medical related applications.
The second question looked more specifically on using portable chargers powered by bacteria, with 83% of the participants saying they would be comfortable with using one.
Energy
There are five energy related questions that also focus on renewable energy. It was important to gauge people’s reaction towards renewable energy sources, as our conductive nanowires will provide an alternative source of energy. 81% of the participants said they were for renewable energy, with 78% saying it has a positive impact on the climate.
We also wanted to know which energy sources the participants deemed to be the worst and the best in terms of being environmentally friendly. The most popular energy source with 47% was solar energy for being the most environmentally friendly. The worst source of energy on the environment with 68% is fossil energy.
The last question looked into the production of energy. We asked the participants whether it was something they found themselves concerned with. 85% of the response was yes.
Economical Value
We asked only one question concerning the economical value for our product in comparison to other energy resources. This question is important in terms of allowing us to see where we place in the market. The majority vote of 27% said that our product should be cheaper on the basis of being a renewable energy source.
Environment
The final two questions were based on the idea of scaling up our project. We asked the participants if they think our bacteria could be grown in a bioreactor to provide households with electricity, of which 78% said yes. 66% of the participants also believe building a bioreactor could have a positive impact on the town if it was placed in a non-populated area.
What we achieved
The survey helped us evaluate many different aspects of the project. Based on the answers we received, we learnt that people would be in favour of using bacteria in products and believe if we were to scale up our technology it would provide a positive impact on the town. Moreover, when we handed out the surveys we received many remarks about the risks the participants associated with our project, of which included containment. Using this feedback, we were able to further research the use of a kill switch for the bacteria within our project.
Social Media
To engage the public and discover other iGEM teams to collaborate with, we created different accounts on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter"

CPU_CHINA,2017,Team:CPU CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,", many patients fail to receive a proper treatment in RA’s preliminary stage which not only afflicts the patients, but also brings a heavy financial burden to their families.
In China, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is 0.2% -0.4%, so with a population of 1.3 billion, China's rheumatoid arthritis patients are expected to be around 5 million. If they cannot be given effective treatment, their mobility will be limited due to joint pain, and will eventually lead to disability. Statistically, disability rate in patients with two years of rheumatoid arthritis is up to 50% while those with three years can be 70%.
Field Studies
To further understand a patient's conditions and the clinical status of treatment, we decided to go to Nanjing Gulou Hospital and Nanjing First Hospital to perform a questionnaire survey in the department of rheumatology immunology after beforehand investigation and contact. First is our preparation:
Respondents: patients with rheumatoid arthritis at inpatient and outpatient in rheumatology department
Sample Size: 80 people
Procedure:
1. The production of questionnaire (Avoid sensitive issues and patients’ personal information, and respect patients for their personal privacy).
2. Assign teammates with different tasks.
3. Determine the procedure and the time.
With our planned scheduled, we went to the hospital for a two-day survey (Figure 1). We ensured the authenticity of the answers to our questionnaires. For patients with reduced mobility, our members completed the questionnaire according to their oral narration (Figure 2). We tried to gain more insights in the treatment they expected to receive, as well as the treatment they received in real life, which enabled us to feel more about the pain and suffering this disease could bring.
Figure 1. Conducting a questionnaire in the Nanjing First Hospital
Figure 2. Our teamer was talking with the patient carefully
Questionnaire analysis
The following conclusions can be drawn by analyzing the data collected from the questionnaire statistically (Figure 3-5 are part of the questionnaire data) together with some supporting materials:
Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease most commonly seen in women aged 40-60 years old, so it is a typical middle-aged and old-aged disease, which seriously affects patients' life quality. Most patients choose drug treatments to alleviate the pain, but in actual clinical practice all currently available drugs fail to show any very significant therapeutic effect, which is why patients crave for new treatment methods. They also hope that the new method can have less side effects and lower recurrence rate, thereby reducing their pain."

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Tatyana about our new contraceptive, she told us she had believed condoms were the only type of birth control. Tatyana isn’t a fan of condoms anymore, as she experienced a condom that broke and resulted in an unexpected pregnancy. She relayed that she didn't believe condoms are reliable. Luckily, she was financially stable enough to care for the child, which is an issue many mothers in Trinidad and Tobago face. Condoms are commonly found in local pharmacies, but information about how to use them is severely lacking. Tatyana explained that women in the area need and want to know more about birth control. Our team hopes that our brochure will inform women of available alternatives to condoms and how to use them safely.
Uganda
Basaliza Women Development Association (BAWODA)
BAWODA is group of women leaders spread all throughout Uganda. Our outreach team spoke with Joy Muhindo, the chairperson of BAWODA. She informed us that the stigma on birth control in Uganda arose because women began trying unsanctioned birth control methods with dangerous side effects. Many women heard of these side effects and assumed that all birth control methods had these potential dangerous side effects. Their group encourages condom use if women cannot access safer birth control methods. While the BAWODA women are willing to try our new method, they hope that we also encourage condom use on top of our contraception because of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in their area. We hadn’t considered that condom use is still necessary on top of our birth control since ours cannot protect against AIDS, so this was an important reminder for us.
Buhanga Thuligahuma Women's Group
❮ ❯
Through the recommendation of Hank Pellissier of the Brighter Brains Institute, our team contacted a Buhangan villager named Masereka Sebastian. Buhanga is a rural village of 2,000 people, and all are members of the BaKonzo tribe. According to Masereka Sebastian, ""you can't drive a car there - you have to walk 3 kilometers or take a dirt bike [to their village]"". Since Masereka Sebastian owns a dirt bike and can access printing shops outside of the village, our iGEM team contacted him to print our questionnaires for distribution to the local Buhanga Women. Women later mailed us their responses.

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"atic activity within the organism. However, for the purposes of looking at the PHA biosynthetic pathway, we will be looking predominantly at the biochemical reactions from an enzyme kinetics perspective. The two main ways to represent reactions and their rates are mass-action and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The latter is the most common way to represent the enzyme kinetics of a biochemical pathway; thus, for our purposes we will use it as the main paradigm for further derivation.
Because the PHA biosynthetic pathway utilizes acetyl-CoA - a crucial component in core metabolism of the organism - as an initial substrate, we must ensure that the model also contextualizes PHA production in the scope of other relevant pathways: the two main ones are glycolysis and the TCA cycle. If we plan to consider the use of alternative feedstock with high quantities of short-chain fatty acids (acetate and propionate), it would be ideal to also provide information regarding the assimilatory pathway for these substrates. Having the most comprehensive dynamic model allows understanding of the control structure of the system (Moreno-Sánchez et al., 2008) as well as identifying bottlenecks arising from elements such as energy and reducing power (NADPH/NADH) for anabolic and catabolic reactions. However, building a dynamic model requires a wealth of information, which most of time is unavailable and requires extrapolation and inference.
To make predictions regarding the metabolic capacity of engineered strains of E. coli, for instance, the strain wherein the Sleeping beauty mutase operon is activated, allowing for in vivo biosynthesis of propionate (Srirangan et al., 2016; Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2017) that may be used for producing the PHBV co-polymer. Understanding how a combination of feedstock such as sugars and fatty acids can influence the overall yield and composition of our PHBV end product can be an enabling tool; however, to achieve this goal is very labor- and resource-intensive. For this purpose, it was deemed more appropriate to use a constraint-based modeling approach (see below).
Understanding the relevant pathways for PHA biosynthesis
Aims 
Using the dynamic model, we can investigate problems related to the behavior of the system and the consequences in production. The questions that we seek to investigate using this model are related most closely to the amount of feedstock (e.g. acetate and propionate) and their relative proportions that would achieve a desired end composition of PHBV co-polymer (Horng et al., 2013). In addition, we also used the model to"

As for the reporter genes, the model is  complicated by the binding of signalling molecules, Which is contrast to the  constitutively expressed genes, we model this rate using Hill equation[3].
 The equation's terms are defined as follows:
-       Fraction of the receptor protein concentration that is bound to ligand.
[L]- Free (unbound) ligand concentration
-       Apparent dissociation constant derived from the law of mass action (the       equilibrium constant for dissociation), which is equal to the ratio of the       dissociation rate of the ligand-receptor complex to its association rate ().[4]
-       The ligand concentration producing half occupation (ligand concentration       occupying half of the binding sites). Because is       defined so that ,       this is also known as the microscopic dissociation constant. In recent       literature, this constant is sometimes referred to as  .
n>1, Positively cooperative binding: Once one ligand molecule is       bound to the enzyme, its affinity for other ligand molecules increases.
n<1, Negatively cooperative       binding: Once one ligand molecule is bound to the enzyme, its affinity       for other ligand molecules decreases.
n=1, Noncooperative (completely       independent) binding: The affinity of the enzyme for a ligand molecule       is not dependent on whether or not other ligand molecules are already bound.

Translation
After transcription,  it must be translated into a functional chromo protein. Translation involves 3  main stages: initiation, elongation of the polypeptide, and termination. The  key molecular machinery driving this process are ribosomes[5], who's binding  and movements determine the overall rate of transcription.
Translation rate can be affected by 3 major processes:
a) the binding of the ribosome to the RBS,
b) formation of initiation complexes,
c) speed of the  ribosome across the mRNA transcript.
we will assume that the movement of the  ribosome (in amino acids formed per second) is the rate determining step in the  translation of the proteins, and the average  translation rate of 17.1 amino acids/sec.[6]

IISc Bangalore
The team from IISc Bangalore intended to make software for easy counting of cells from Haemocytometer, to remove the errors caused by human counting. To test its efficacy in various environments, they collaborated with different teams to test their software. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the species and followed the protocol provided by IISc Bangalore to grow and measure the number of cells in a haemocytometer. We took the images at 10X and 20X as they required the usage of an air objective. We counted 720 plates and the results are as follows:

Results:_Expected length at 1920 BP did not show. In fact no bands showed, except somethin like a primer smear around 100bp.
Analysis: Anealing temperature might have been set to high, as the primers were constructed to aneal at 55°. another run will be done on miniprepped plasmids, with a different program.
Restriction digest on miniprepped pOT2 plasmids with ninaB insert using EcoRI
Date: 27/7
Done by: Christian
Methods: Restriction digest
protocos: RD1.1
A restriction digest was carried out to determine the length of the pOT2 plasmid and insert. protocol was followed to point, using miniprep as template dna.
Results: strange things going on at different lengths, and nothing matches the expected length of about 3800BP.
Analysis: Another digest is needed to show that plasmid length is wrong, as it seems unlikely with comercial plasmids.
Restriction digest on miniprepped pOT2 plasmids with ninaB insert using EcoRI and XhoI
Date: 28/7
Done by: Christian
Methods: Restriction digest
protocos: RD1.1
A restriction digest was carried out to determine the length of the pOT2 plasmid and insert. protocol was followed to point, using miniprep as template dna. Both XhoI and EcoRI were used, as these were the enyzmes originally used to create insert and cut plasmid for ligation according to fruitfly under the GH section, which our pOT2 plasmids falls under. protocol was followed to point, except for the digest running for 2 hours.
results: Digest showed a band close to the 3.8kb marker expected for the full length plasmid, concurrent with only one digest working. (although an earlier digest with EcoRI alone showed a different band.) Miniprepped plasmid had also ""moved up"" the ladder
analysis: Something fishy is up with this plasmid, and the digest. one more will be run only using XhoI.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#prueba_-_-_TEXT.html," they even lent us suits and veils  to  interact  directly  with  the  bees!  Previously  
we had consulted a protocol that showed us all the details about the in vitro breeding of bees and by observing the techniques used by Ponce de León for the transference, we were able to validate and somehow, to begin with, the practice of this activity.
Interacting with the bees and being able to observe the composition of the bee boxes, the way in which the different foods were applied and the way in which beekeepers approached the bees were all key elements that allowed us to define the optimum application method of our product and helped us ensure its appropriate integration regarding each characteristic of the hive organization and the work done by beekeepers.
When returning to the CIAD facilities we had the opportunity to discuss the use of bees in the laboratory, how many bees were used? What   was   this   number   based   on?  Were the   three   R’s
considered? The reality is that in Mexico there does not exist such regulations and the bioethical part of working with bees in the laboratory is quite unattended. We found this situation somewhat unsettling and it led us to perform a more extensive analysis of this topic. (consult the bioethical essay in)
M.S. Romo and M.S. Ponce de León could broaden their panorama on the research that is currently being done with bees and their diseases thanks to the sharing we made with them of our project and the allusion that synthetic biology is its fundamental part.
Thanks to this visit we were able to have our first real approach with bees, we knew the reality of working with them and working with the two strains according to a specialized laboratory that has already experienced the proper biosafety considerations. This visit gave us different data that is very useful for the whole experimental plan of our project, and besides that, we lived a little of what beekeepers live every day, like traveling inside the truck with many bees that stayed inside from the field and even experiencing some bee-stings. We were also able to capture amazing photos of the hives!

Demonstration of emulsifying effect of fermentation broth
We used diesel to verify the emulsifying effect of FIL-07 ABCRI. We added fermentation broth of FY-07 and FY-07 ABC to the diesel in the two tubes respectively. Shook the test tube, and then stood for six hours. After that, we can clearly observe that the diesel fuel in the test tube, which added fermentation broth FY-07 ABC, was emulsified. Experimental results show that the FY-07 ABC, which produce rhamnolipid, can be a good emulsion of oil.
Demonstration of emulsifying effect of fermentation broth
In the experimental results already in our laboratory, it has been shown that the cellulose produced by Enterobacter sp. FY-07 has a clogging effect on soil channels.
Discussion and future plans
In this summer, we have proven that every part of our project design is available. We can believe that the engineered Enterobacter sp. FY-07 can block the channels in the soil and emulsify the oil. Just because some of the difficulties can be solved, our construction of the bacteria have not yet been completed. In the next days, we will complete the construction of the bacteria and further verify its function.
