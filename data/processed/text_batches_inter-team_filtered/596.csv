BNU-CHINA,2015,Team:BNU-CHINA#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," Gene circuits of light regulation system
The overlap extension PCR (OE PCR) was used to finish their gene circuits. However, there are secondary structure in this part. So we could not get the part at first. Then we changed DNA polymerase Pfu to PrimerSTAR, another kind of DNA polymerase which performs better than Pfu. Finally the construction of light regulation system is successful.

In this period, we also had some discussions about experiments and modeling face to face. Through these discussions, we learnt more about each other and made progress together.

Collaborate with ZJU-China
Last year, team ZJU-China constructed a kind of reverse promoter which we hoped to add to our biobricks this year. So they generously provided us with these biobricks. We appreciate ZJU-China very much and we are looking forward to further cooperation in the future.
They constructed two main circuits, first one expresses a serine integrase. This intergrase can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP, the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome. This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to attL and attR at the meantime. This inversion can be reversible by appropriately controlling the conditional expression of integrase and an excisionase in Bxb1 named gp47 at certain ratio. They change start codon ATG to GTG for a appropriate expression quantity.
The second one contains a switch, two reporters, two RBS and terminators. At first, the plasmid expresses GFP, when gp35 is expressed, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.
Map of those two circuits are shown below.
And figures below show us circuit 1 and 2 using Agarose Gel Electroporesis.
They performed experiment to see whether their circuits work. From the figure above, they found out that when only circuit 2 is transformed (A), GFP is expressed, when both of the two circuits are transformed, the switch turns and RFP is expressed.
Map of those two circuits are shown above.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," replica plating may provide sufficient levels of certainty.
Our several lab groups worked tirelessly to make more media, to check for deletions in plasmids, and to design primers that actually work.
Now that we have lox-URA3-lox, linearized pUC19, and amplified homologous arms, we are able to begin Gibson Assembly. We did two gibsons this week. The first Gibson includes the parts mentioned above and the second is our linearized pXRL2 along with several gene fragments: ADR, FDX, Delta7H, p450SCC, and 3BH. After combining the neccessary components with the Gibson Master Mix, we put it in the PCR machine for an hour and then stored it on ice. The following day we inoculated the gibson products on high copy LB-AMP plates. The pUC19 plate grew normally but the pXRL2 plate lawned.
We then picked colonies from the pUC19 plate and transformed it in liquid cultures. We then performed colony PCR to check if our Gibson assembly was successful. It likely did not work. The gel showed very bright bands in the wrong areas but a faint band where our desired product would be. With this information, we made streak plates of the potential successful colonies in hopes to isolate what we believe to be our desired gibson product and threw the rest of the cultures out.
Once we created a gel with clear, distinct bands for DNA extraction, we tried using the Bioline Isolate II PCR and Gel kit to retrieve the DNA from our agarose gel. At first we used a different binding buffer than the one provided in the kit, but the final extraction had a high salt concentration that made the DNA unusable as a PCR template. We tried using the Zymogen clean and concentrator kit to further purify the DNA, but there wasn’t enough DNA to use for PCR reactions after the clean-up. We performed two more gel extractions using the reagents from the kit but still didn’t get clean enough DNA for further PCR amplification. We finally decided to order the full genes and use the primers from the OE PCRs to amplify the full length genes.
After the Gibson team removed one loxP from pXLR2, we used the KLD enzyme mix from a site-directed mutagenesis kit to recircularize the plasmid. We plated the transformants, and then made liquid cultures from colonies two days later. We designed and ordered primers for colony PCR to check that loxP was properly removed. We prepared for yeast mediated cloning by preparing "

Bisphenol A degradation
In 2005, Sasaki et al. isolated a soil bacterium from the Sphingomonas genus which is able to degrade the environmental toxin bisphenol A (BPA) with a unique rate and efficiency compared to other BPA degrading organisms. This strain was called Sphingomonas bisphenolicum AO1 and is able to completely decompose 120 mg BPA L-1 in about 6 hours. Three genes which are responsible for the first step of this effective BPA degradation by S. bisphenolicum AO1 were identified: a cytochrome P450 (bisdB), a ferredoxin (bisdA) and a ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (FNR) ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ). The bisdAB genes from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were isolated, transformed into and expressed in E. coli and enabled this bacterium to degrade BPA, too ( Sasaki et al., 2008 ). In addition, the BisdAB proteins from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were able to degrade BPA in a cell free system in which spinach reductase was added ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ). So we assume that the BisdAB proteins also work in a cell free system together with the ferredoxin-NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase from E. coli. The suggested reaction mechanism of the first BPA degradation step is shown in the project overview image above or in the animated .gif in figure 1:
File:Bielefeld-Germany2011-BPAdegrad2.gif
Figure 1: Suggested reaction mechanism of bisphenol A degradation and BioBricks needed for this reaction in vitro.
In 2008, the iGEM team from the University of Alberta submitted the codon usage optimized bisdAB genes from S. bisphenolicum AO1 to the registry of standard biological parts in the so called Freiburg BioBrick assembly standard (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>). Via this assembly standard it is very easy to build fusion proteins. We were able to fuse these already existing protein domains together with the NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase gene from E. coli to the fusion protein FNR:Fdbisd:P450bisd which subsequently was fused to an S-layer gene. Moreover we could show that the constructed fusion protein FNR:Fdbisd"

SYSU-Software,2015,Team:SYSU-Software#Vailidation_-_-_TEXT.html,"Q & A (in Co-development) can have different topics for users to discuss. Anyway, it’s good to provide a platform for communication in the community.”
Inspirations
For a dry-lab practitioner (a bioinformatician), Ma is more interested in the “Hub”. The idea of adopting the features of “GitHub” and applying them to Synbio is a try. To stand the test of time, the “Hub” should make collaboration and open design a routine to synthetic biologists and iGEMers. Ma is a student in bioinformatics and seldom constructs genetic circuits in vitro (wet-lab practices) or in silico, but CORE can to some extent help him with his research: maybe he could find some research topics in the Co-development that he can use his knowledge of bioinformatics to solve, and a collaboration result!

Some Feedbacks (Translated into English)
“I like the protocol management tool! The plasmid is beautiful! What a surprised that it can directly assist the whole process of the experiment. But some more details: make an alarming sound when the time is up?”
(Interesting, but…)
“Q & A. I know how to use it!”
(But it is not only for Q & A.)
“CORE Bank. I can more easily find a genetic circuit.”
Inspirations
For a wet-lab practitioner, he or she would find CORE Design most useful. CORE Design provide a more powerful protocol management and experiment scheduling functions. In addition, he or she might think that a Q & A platform is helpful when they encounter troubles in the experiment. In general, wet-lab practitioners deal with less complex circuits, and they might prefer to see the Co-development module as a platform for Q & A. Well. It is fine to ask for help in the community via this platform, and get, give and share your answers with anyone else in the community.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html,"rep B had DNA concentration of 1001.2 ng/uL possibly indicating that there may have been a lot of genomic DNA contamination. However miniprep A product was still used as a PCR template for a reaction attempting to isolate CarAc, CarAd, AntA, AntB, and AntC. Special conditions for this PCR included replacing 60 uL of water with 60 uL of betaine heated to 37 degrees Celsius and running a Mg gradient ranging from 0.5 uL - 2.5 uL per tube for each gene. Of these only AntB had bands of the right size in 3 of the lanes (Mg concentrations of 1.5, 2, and 2.5 uL). However, all of the AntB bands (including the negative control) contained a contamination band at around 100 bases, probably due to the formation of primer dimers. This forced us to do a gel extraction rather than a PCR purification. This gel extraction did not work as the nanodrop results indicated high amounts of agarose contamination. Another PCR was performed using the same conditions, but using miniprep B instead as there was no more miniprep A product remaining. Unfortunately there were no bands for AntB, only the 100 basepair contamination bands.
Desulfurisation
PCR was reattempted on Rhodoccocus that was lysed using two different dilutions of the lysate buffer, but the gel verification confirmed the previous failure in using this approach. An alternative that involved preparation of an overnight culture of the Rhodococcus cells followed by a plasmid purification was followed. The plasmid purification eventually yielded plasmid samples with concentrations of 98.6ng/uL to 182.7ng/uL (4 samples obtained overall). Additionally, the catalase biobrick was used to transform some stock competent cells, and samples of some colonies were subsequently PCR'ed. Although, the gel verification showed some potential contamination, and the required banding patterns at around 2200bp was not obtained.

Nutrition
Or, Iron deficiency: An Unmet Global Need
Iron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional deficiency in the world, according to the World Health Organization [1] . Iron deficiency is rampant in developing countries and is especially prevalent among young children and pregnant mothers. Young children are particularly at risk due to the large amount of iron required during periods of rapid growth. Similarly, expectant mothers require heightened levels of iron during pregnancy, and if this demand is not met, the transfer of iron to the developing fetus may be affected. This problem even persists after birth, since if an infant is born with insufficient iron, postnatal acquisition of additional iron is typically insufficient to make up this deficit [2] .
Iron deficiency has remained relatively persistent over time, despite attempted public health interventions, in large part due to challenges in delivering and distributing health care in resource-poor settings. Current prevention and treatment methods require routine provision of supplies of iron supplements or iron-fortified foods, and such items are difficult to aquire or economically prohibitive for populations at greatest risk of iron deficiency [3] . In addition, many of the iron-enriched foods provided by such programs are usually imported from outside sources instead of grown locally. Our aim is to provide developing populations with an economically and logistically superior alternative to distributing iron-rich foods and supplements, which to date have not met this persistent global need.
Phytate
Or, The Iron Lockbox and its Key
Phytate is the salt form of phytic acid, also known as inositol hexakisphosphate or IP6. This molecule chelates and sequesters phosphorous and iron in plant tissues. Only ruminant animals such as cows and sheep produce an enzyme in their rumen that can separate the phosphorous and iron from the phytate. Therefore, humans should limit their intake of phytate as it interferes with the absorption of calcium, iron, and zinc, which can also be chelated by phytate.
Phytases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of phytate, or phytic acid, releasing six phosphate groups from phytate. The dephosphorylation of phyt"

On contrary, negative feedback is always favorable to stability, such as Activation with negative feedback (contains 1 edge as feedback) and Self-inhibition (contains 1 edge as feedback). Interestingly, although Mutual-inhibition contains 2 edges as negative feedback, it may results in strong self-activation and switch between two stable states. In our project, we aimed at all three-node network structures which contain 4 nodes (1 input node, 2 regulatory nodes and 1 output node) and vast possible regulatory edges among them. So we combined these basic modules above to construct networks. Picture: some sketch maps of network structures like bellows:

The ideal network in our project must be sensitive to the input signal and be able to distinguish the low input and high input from each other. So we expected that the target structure should have a low-input-low-output and high-input-high-output character. Besides, it should avoid ambiguous interim region between low input and high input.

1.Biosafety considerations and investigation for our project
Having identified our project, we discussed the biosafety of our project with professor Liang who has worked for years on nucleic acid detection and biosensor. We discussed with professor Liang on the safety and feasibility of our project . For the safety of our project, our experimental strain is E.coli DH5 Alpha, a very common strain in biological experiments. As long as we do experiments according to microbial and molecular experimental operation specification, there will be no safety issues. For the feasibility of our project, designing different structures of hairpin and enzyme to regulate the expression of the gene of interest is very useful for the future work.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," usefulness, there is no documentation that the parts have ever been successfully reused within the iGEM competition. We suggest that this is due to the difficulties in assembling biosensors systems – the screening of a library of sensitivity tuners would require the ability to easily generate multiple sensor circuits. Although only one part would be changing in each circuit variant, current genetic engineering techniques mean that parts are tightly coupled together, preventing the simple swapping of parts. Therefore, we propose a modular, multicellular system for biosensor development, using a cell-to-cell communication system to eradicate the requirement for further genetic engineering of reusable biosensor devices (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Multicellular Sensynova system.
Cell-to-Cell communication
Bacteria have native quorum sensing systems which enable cell-to-cell communication through the production and detection of hormone-like auto-inducers. These molecules allow the synchronisation of behaviour in large populations of bacterial cells (Waters & Bassler, 2005). One such system involves the autoinducer AHL (Acylated Homoserine Lactone). AHLs compose of a lactone ring with an acyl side chain containing between 4 and 18 carbons (Churchill & Chen, 2011). Various AHL synthases exist, which produce AHL with different modifications and side change lengths. AHL receptors are sensitive to AHLs of specific length. For example, it has been found that the Rhl system, producing and detecting AHL of acyl carbon length 4 and the Las system, producing and detecting AHL of acyl carbon length 12, exhibit little crosstalk – the receptor component of the system is sensitive only to carbon chains of the correct length (Brenner et al., 2007). The orthogonal nature of the AHL family of autoinducers has enabled their use in a variety of synthetic systems. They are often used as biological “wires”, linking either inter- or intracellular processes. These “wires” have been previously used in a number of synthetic biology systems, e.g. Gupta et al. (2013) and Tasmir et al. (2011). In this project, it is proposed that modularity, and therefore the ability to use parts “off-the-shelf” without further genetic engineering, could be improved by splitting components of biosensors into different cells which communicate to coordinate responses. The orthogonal quorum sensing systems Rhl and Las will be used as biological “wires”, linking different biosensor components together. This separation of components will enable the decoupling of non-specific components from specific detection systems. Using this approach, production"

We do expect to see some background 3HB from the untreated sample since it was in the shaking incubator at 37°C in the Buffer solution. PHB is a bioplastic and degrades spontaneously as well as enzymatically. However, the spontaneous degradation occurs slowly.
Our chassis can utilise 3HB▼
bdh2 improves growth on 3HB
We have previously observed that MG1655 cells can survive in minimal media that contains 3HB as sole carbon source. This is evidence for that some uptake mechanism and a metabolic pathway is active at a low level in the cells. We hypothesised that the 3HB dehydrogenase could improve growth since it can convert 3HB into acetoacetate, a common metabolite in E.coli.
In order to test this, we run a growth experiment with various 3HB concentrations where the growth of cells containing bdh2 (BBa_K1149050) and Empty vector was recorded on a 96 well plate. We have calculated the growth rates from this data and plot it on the graph below.
3HB sole carbon source growth in minimal media with phaCAB and EV. MG1655 phaCAB were grown in supplemented and minimal M9 media. Relative to the empty vector control, there was no significant difference in growth as t-test gave p = 0.8072 > 0.05. However, an ANOVA of the data gave (F 3,8 = 6.589, p < 0.0149), thus the null hypothesis, there is no difference between M9M and M9S must be rejected. Indeed if we look closer, we see that both M9M EV and M9S EV are significantly different from another (p = 0.045), as are M9M phaCAB and M9S phaCAB (p = 0.0284). Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," We removed inserts from synthesized plasmids and started cloning procedures into pSB1C3.
Drylab
A enlarged fishBIT tag model was 3D printed for display purposes. Sensor design for the app was started. We began looking into various tests that could be done to test the durability of our tag, including but not limited to tensile testing and wind tunnel testing.
Week 13 (August 30 - September 5)
Wetlab
We encountered issues with getting past ligation stage with synthesized plasmid inserts and H backbone.
To confirm EcnB expression, several SDS-PAGEs were done on constructs without stabilizing proteins to use for Western blots (to see their expression) and later ZOI assays.
Drylab
Business plan was reviewed by a professor with expertise in the area. Additional tags were printed, and samples were sent to prospective customers for feedback.
Policy and Practices
We sent our prototype of the fishBit to Rome Fish Hatchery and the Cornell Biological Field Station for feedback. We hope to use any advice and critiques to update our fishBit to fit the industry’s needs in the best way possible.
Week 14 (September 6 - September 12)
Wetlab
A Gibson construct (MJ) was successfully sequenced. Western blots showed possible expression of ZG and ZR, but not ZJ, though we didn’t have a positive control because it did not survive past the lag phase.
Switched focus to getting expression from all biobricked Z constructs and MJ to use in ZOI assays.
A second set of constructs (ZG, MJ, ZQ, ZT) were set up for western blots.
Drylab
Dry lab finalized plans for testing fishBIT. App design and sensor designs continue smoothly.
Policy and Practices
iGem members Grace, Casey, and Rishabh attended the Sciencenter Building with Biology event where they helped enthusiastic science-lovers on a Saturday morning learn how to spread plates, demonstrated the possibilities of 3D printing, and simulated rearranging genes with legos.
Week 15 (September 13 - September 19)
Wetlab
The second set of western blot revealed expression of ZG, MJ, and ZT. ZG was taken to be the positive control based on previous western blot. A series of ZOI disk diffusion assays were set up at the Cornell Vet School to test the efficacy of our BioBrick constructs.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#MaterialMethods_-_-_TEXT.html," the OD600 was measured to gauge the volume for sample-taking ensuring similar cell-concentrations for each measure. Cells are harvested and resuspended in an appropriate amount of Phosphate buffered saline (PBS). It is possible that the cells has to be diluted later because the flow is too high due to high concentration.
Measurements were performed in the BD LSRFortessaTM using following lasers and filters:
SSC and FSC: 488 nm - 488 nm/10 nm
GFP: 488 - 530/30
excitation: 488 nm
emission: 530 ± 15 nm
mRFP and mCherry: 561 - 610/20
YFP: 488 - 542/27
eCFP: 445 - 473/10
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
The HPLC was performed with a ... column.  Sample preparation: Cells were lysed in acteonitril incubated for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at top speed.  The supernatant was applied onto the column.
HPLC Method:
Column (preheated up to 40 °C) was equilibrated with 92% A and 8% B
50 µl per sample were applied to the column
The proportion B was increased linearly to 50% in 7 min. The last 3 min it is increased to 100%.
Buffers:
A: Water , 0.1% formic acid
B: Methanol, 0.1% formic acid

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#LabNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Isiah did a gel extraction as well as ran a gel of Divya's PCRed wtPUF. The PCR was successful as the bands were around 1.6 kb, close to 1.7 kb.
-Received the split-GFP sequences used by Mrs. Valencia-Burton in her paper for characterizing an RNA scaffold! The final PUF-GFP sequence or synthesis can be subsequently made to have as backup if tethering doesn't work.
-Did PCR cleanup on the three pBAD digests (no gel extraction in order to increase yield). Concentrations were still extremely low. Used pBAD digest with 7/10 and 7/16 PUF digests for two ligation reactions. Also started a digestion of PUF construct PCR and two digestions of pBAD. Increased the DNA mass for the digestions so that concentrations could be high enough after PCR cleanup for different ligation ratios.
7/19/12
-Isiah did a PCR of wtPUF according to a different protocol. He PCRed five samples. Divya ran a gel of those samples in the afternoon; they were unsuccessful. We shall repeat the pcr tomorrow.
-Did PCR of cCFP in order to amplify the band before digestion. PCR proved to work after Bob ran a gel of it. Made a final draft of PUF(WT)-aGFP ready for synthesis in case tethering doesn't work. Made two inoculations of K157006 in preparation for tethering and cloning tomorrow.
-Angela miniprepped three plasmids: pBAD30, P. protet. E, and the plasmid encoding venus. A glycerol stock of pBAD30 was made. Ligation of several testing constructs (6 YFP test constructs and 1 PUF binding site and YFP test construct) were completed and sit overnight.
-Transformed and plated the ligation reactions from yesterday. Plated two plates for each ligation reaction (100 ul and 200 ul) for a total of four plates. Also did PCR cleanup for the three digestions from yesterday. Yields were a bit better due to greatly increased DNA mass used, but loss of total DNA mass after cleanup/extraction was still severe. Started two ligations with this set of digestions using a 1:3, 15 ul reaction and a 1:6, 20 ul reaction.

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#iLOVCharacterisation_-_-_TEXT.html," have changed the conformation of the protein. The altered state of the protein may have a higher or lower rate of reemission of the excitation photons.
The striation of the results invalidates them from determining the peak emission and excitation wavelength as it cannot be determined whether it is the rest conformation of iLOV that is being measured.
Figure 3: The florescence response of the protein iLOV to a range of excitation wavelengths. The peak response could not be determined from this measurement due to the photo bleaching of the iLOV (Though it occurred at an excitation wavelength of 444nm and emission measurement of 500nm). Emission measurements are taken at 2nm intervals whilst excitation wavelengths are spaced at 1nm intervals.
Photo-bleaching was observed in the high resolution scan but not in the broad range scan. This may be because during the broad range emission scans the proteins are exposed to exciting photons for 1.8 ms per scan, whilst in the high resolution scan the protein are exposed for 4.5ms per scan. Three scans are taken in quick succession.
To determine whether the effect is indeed artificial, the fluorescence emission at 500nm was plotted across the excitation wavelengths. This can be seen in figure 4. The triplets of successive scans are coloured. Measurements taken from the the broad range scan are plotted for reference.
Fugure 4: The fluorescence emission of the protein iLOV at 500nm for a range of excitation wavelengths. The first measurement of each triplet is always notable higher than the trend.
From figure 4 it can be seen that the first measurement is notably higher than the trend for the next two measurements in each triplet. This would suggest that the protein has been photo-bleached as the emission response decreased after exposure to excitating photons. The difference in fluorescence between the high resolution scan and the broad range scan is greatest at excitation wavelengths of 420nm and 440nm which correspond to measurements taken in the final scan of a triplet. This effect will be explored in more detail in the photobleaching section.
The errors in figure 4 are calculated via equation,
\begin{equation} \delta F = \sqrt{\sum_{i}^{N}\left(\frac{f_i\delta O_i}{O_i^2 N}\right)^2+\sum_{j}^{M}\left(\frac{g_j\delta O_j}{O_j^2 M}\right)^2},     (2) \label{Error} \end{equation}

The cost of a false positive was taken as the cost of a contrast enhanced chest CT scan (£359 [19] ), plus the cost of the test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110) as it would be done for 6 years - as that would be the follow up of a positive result of our test. We assumed that all patients with a false positive would subsequently have their cancer ruled out by a CT. Previous screening trials have showed that other procedures are needed, sometimes bronchoscopy, or a false positive proceeding all the way to surgery and treatment. However, we believe a CT in combination with our test would rule out nearly all false positives (especially if several miRNAs were used in tandem to look at the properties of the ‘tumor’ in a subsequent test) - and the probability of a patient having further measures taken would likely be negligible. There is also no data available to quantify this additional cost.
The cost of treatment in stage 1 is £8000 and in stage 4 is £10,050. [19] We used the cost at stage 4 as the upper bound of the cost for stages 2-4. Similar to before, this is likely to decrease were a large scale screening trial to take place and figures for individual stages used - as cost of treatment in stage 2 is far lower than stage 4. [19] We assumed the cost of unsuccessful treatment in stage 1 was the same as the cost of successful treatment in stage one plus average cost of treatment in the other stages - as if treatment is unsuccessful in stage one, a patient is likely to have their tumor progress to later stages. The cost of treatment in stage 4 is not dependent on success as the treatment is just palliative care.
We ignored the cost of recurrence of a cancer - recurrences in cancer are complex and cannot be easily modelled. Furthermore, the earlier the cancer is detected, the lower the chace of recurrence. This means our sensor that can detect NSCLC at stage 1 would drastically reduce this cost.
As Tammemägi gave the probability of cancer in the next 6 years we calculated the cost effectiveness of screening each year for the next 6 years. Hence the cost of 6 true negatives is the cost of our test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110).

After confirming that our parts success in biofilms expression, we are going to test the effect of binding between CsgA-Histag mutant and inorganic nanoparticles. We apply suspended QDs solution into M63 medium which has cultured biofilm for 72h. After 1h incubation, we used PBS to mildly wash the well, and the result was consistent with our anticipation: On the left, CsgA-Histag mutant were induced and QDs are attached with biofilms, thus show bright fluorescence. Therefore, we ensure the stable coordinate bonds between CsgA-Histag mutant and QDs can manage to prevent QDs from being taken away by liquid flow. The picture was snapped by ChemiDoc MP,BioRad, false colored.

    The intensity of GFP/RFP fluorescence is related to the intensity of the input red/green light(Ig,Ir ) the concentration of the induce substance, which is directly related to the GFP fluorescence.Therefore, we attempt to explore the quantitative relationship between them and simulated relationship between the two inputs and one output of the integrated system.

Inflation
    In our experiment, we have designed and performed the microfluidic devices, where the substrate inside wash the increasing AHL in the chamber room. On the one hand, we controlled the concentration of AHL in the chamber room, on the other hand, the diffusion of AHL realized the united oscillation among each chamber.      Therefore, we constructed a model on the relationship between the flow rate of microfluidic and the concentration of AHL.

Oscillation
    We want to prove that the oscillation system and the light input model can be couplied in theory.Through the preliminary experiment, we can see that the bacteria concentration of fluorescent protein expression of AHL and the strength of bacteria is positively correlated. Therefore, we through modeling of the external AHL concentration, the results can be used to characterize the fluorescence intensity.

By computing with C program, we can observe that after 9s, the corresponding change of concentration of mRNA is less than 0.1%. Comparing with the synthesis time for protein which is more than 3mins, it is less than 10%. So basically, the concentration of mRNA during the phase of synthesis of protein is fixed and it satisfies:
, which is cmr=sT/ln2
2) The influence from the time of synthesis of regulatory factors GFP/LexA
In accordance with the result of search, the half life of GFP/LexA is around one hour, while synthesis takes about 2mins. By using qtiplot, we can see the whole process with C programing. The result shows that, it makes little difference whether considering the reaction process or not.
Hence, basically, the time of synthesis of regulatory factors GFP/LexA can be neglected for related reactions.

1. The realtionship between the dioxin and the GFP concentration is nearly linear, which is perfect for the signal transformation.
2. The quorum sensing speed is quite rapid, which is suitable for the dioxin's enrichment
3. The efficiency of dioxin degrading enzyme does not meet our expectation. But its presence shortens the settling time of the concentration of GFP of sensor to 30000s, which is largely faster than current methods.

Alessandro transformed the Gibson assembly of the previous day and completed the protocol for competent cells.
Nadine set the platereader experiment with the co-transformed cells containing J61002 Ptet-RFP and pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR. She ran a gradient PCR on the lysis cassette (that didn't work yesterday),but again we have a too short product... This assembly needs to be check tomorrow.
Friday, 19 August 2011
The platereader experiment worked well, showing that with enough ATC concentration RFP can be induced even with constitutive expression of TetR. The first graph shows the maximal RFP signal corresponding to each ATC dilution, averaged over the 4 different cell colonies. The second graph shows RFP expression over time for 2 individual wells, either without ATC or with 800 ng/mL. The results confirm that both pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR and J61002 Ptet-RFP plasmids work as expected.
Very high concentrations were tested, because at first we had used false dilutions that had only low impact on RFP induction. There seems to be a saturation above 300 ng/mL, so in the future we don't need to use as much high concentrations of ATC.
About the PCR of the lysis cassette for the new Gibson assembly, Nadine found out that she designed the reverse primer on a terminator (BBa_B0010) that was also present 400bp before, allowing the primer to anneal perfectly after 1400bp instead of 1800bp. This mistake was also present in the primer designed for the 3-part Gibson assembly, but we didn't notice at this time (see 11.07, the lysis plasmid has about"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#Kill Switches_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_K628806 was to be selected for testing.
Part BBa_K628806 comprises a gene encoding an antimicrobial peptide under the control of a pBad arabinose inducible promoter. It was selected from a list of many potential kill switch parts as it had a simple mechanism of activation and results recorded on the parts registry showed successful killing over a time period of a few hours. It was decided that this part could be tested to determine whether this killing function was retained over a longer period of time.
Our Experiments
Overnight growth at different concentrations of arabinose (29/07/14)
6 hour monitored growth (30/07/14)
29/07/14 - Cultures were grown over-night.
30/07/14 - 96 well microplate was set up. Each well held 200µl and contained overnight culture and chloramphenicol and varying volumes of LB media and arabinose stock solution to create different concentrations.
The cells were grown in the microplate for 6 hours and readings of optical density were taken every 30 minutes at five points within the well and an average was recorded.
10 hour monitored growth (31/07/14)
30/07/14 – 3 colonies were picked and grown in a shaking incubator overnight at 37°C in LB media containing Chloramphenicol.
31/07/14 – a 96 well microplate was set up. Each microplate well contained 200µl of liquid. This included 20µl of chloramphenicol and varying amounts of LB and arabinose stock solution to create different concentrations of arabinose.
Plain LB media and Top10 cells growing in LB and 7400µM chloramphenicol were used as controls.
This was grown over a period of 10 hours in a micro plate reader which maintained the temperature at 37°C and shook the plate.
Readings of optical density were taken every 30 minutes at five points in the well and an average of these values was recorded.
Results and Conclusions from Experiments
Figure 1: A graph comparing the growth rates of transformed and untransformed cells in media at a concentration of 7400µM arabinose
The graph above depicts the growth rates of untransformed Top10 cells and culture A, transformed with the kill switch device, BBa_K628806 and allows for comparison. As can be seen, the part does not completely inhibit growth. Even in the presence of arabinose, the molecule which should activate the kill switch, it can be seen that the cells have grown. However"

Quantification of mRNA expression levels by RT-q-PCR
The characterization of our transfected mammalian cells showed that the two receptors containing an avidin variant were expressed and translocated to the outer cell membrane. The biotin-presenting receptor containing the biotin-acceptor peptide, though, showed a very low fluorescence signal. Therefore, the success of the stable integration was tested by PCR of the genomic integration, which lead to the conclusion that the construct was transfected and integrated sucessfully, hinting at a problem downstream of the integration. In order to understand where the source of this problem was, we took a closer look at the expression levels of the different receptors by analyzing mRNA levels in comparison to each other and to the housekeeping gene (HKG) GAPDH.
For a better comparibility, we used the same amount of cells for each receptor and not only reviewed cells with stably integrated but also cells with the episomal stable receptor constucts. After extraction of the total mRNA from the cells the quality and integrity was measured by Bioanalyzer. All samples showed a RNA integrity number (RIN) above 9 which means that the total mRNA is pure and does not have any contamination. During the first step of RT-qPCR the total mRNA in converted to cDNA by a reverse transcriptase, which is then used in the actual quantitative PCR to quantify the amount of a specific mRNA was produced by the cells. For this reason two primer pairs were designed. One of them was designed to bind the exact same region in all of the different receptor mRNAs and amplify the same part of the receptor. Contrary to that the second pair was supposed to bind only in the biotin presenting receptor and amplify a part that is unique to this receptor. By this method we wanted to observe if only one part of the mRNA is unstable or if the general mRNA level of this receptor is decreased.
For the evaluation of the raw data we used the ΔΔCP method [3] in which the crossing points (CP values) of a gene of interest and of a reference gene are compared and normalized with a constantly expressed HKG, to get an idea of the relative amounts of the mRNA of interest.
In the following you can see the results of our experiments. We compared the expression levels of T-REx cells which were transfected with our different receptor constructs and"

Bees: Continued Preparation of Solutions for the Oxalic Acid Gradient Using KMnO4
Objective: Continue preparation of solutions being used for the oxalic acid gradients with KMnO4
Procedure
Solutions of 0.01 M of KMnO4 were prepared from stock. 0.158 g of KMnO4 was dissolved in 100 mL of d2H2O. 0.003 M of KMnO4 was then prepared using the 0.01 M solution.
The oxalic acid gradient was also set up with 10 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes with the following oxalic acid concentrations:0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%.
A 1 mL volume was created for each concentration using 1% oxalic acid and d2H2O
All solutions and the oxalic acid gradient were set aside for tomorrow on the bench.

Biofilms: Results of July 7 Recultured Biofilms, Degradation of July 8 Biofilms and Preparation of New Biofilms for Further Testing
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Tiffany Dang, Dinula De Silva, Ronja Kothe, Jonathan Kwan, Aum Patel, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: Determine if yesterday’s recultured biofilms were successful. In addition continue to degrade biofilms using the household cleaners brought into lab for testing and see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms created yesterday.
Results: Reculturing of the July 7 Biofilms
We were successful in reculturing the biofilms to varying extents based on the overnight cultures of the degraded RFP biofilms. Based on reference of the biofilm that had been cultured before the cleaners were added, the Truly is still the most red in colour. Both Fantastic and Tilex was cloudy with culture but not with the RFP used to originally culture the biofilms.

Assumption
Although Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) is a well characterised enzyme, there is no clear kinetic data for degrading soluble Beta-Amyloids and its fibrils.
There is no kinetic data for MMP-9 degrading soluble Beta-Amyloid, but there is data for degrading vitronectin, in which a composition of Beta-Amyloid [7] Therefore, we assumed that Beta-Amyloid is mainly vitronectin.
We found a type of insulin degradation enzyme which can degrade the Beta-Amyloid fibrils 1-40 and 1-42. We assumed that IDE has the similar kinetic property as MMP-9
The concentration of the enzymes are assumed to be constant in the system, it cannot be degraded.
Results
Figue.1:The figure shows the degradation of soluble Beta-Amyloid, all the soluble Beta-Amyloid will be degraded in 4 days. Therefore, the assay is applicable.
Figue.2 and 3:Both figures shows that Beta-Amyloid can not be degraded efficiently by Insulin degradation enzyme. It's slightly degraded after a month. Although the insulin degradation enzyme may be less efficient than MMP-9 enzyme, such high concentrations of fibrils are not recommended for the assays.

However, we feel that this could still be an incredibly useful system for other teams for both killswitch and non-killswitch-related applications, making it still a valuable contribution to the registry.
Kill Gene Testing
While building our systems with GFP in order to test their control, we also constructed them with our kill genes.  This was delayed substantially however due to problems in their synthesis.  Specifically, the micrococcal nuclease that arrived from IDT had a 1bp point mutation which changed an isoleucine residue into a lysine.  Initially, our systems resulted in no killing of cells. Therefore we had to mutate this residue using site-directed mutagenesis . Once completed, we were able to begin testing. With our GFP data collected, we moved on to characterizing the mgtA control system upstream of our S7 kill gene ( BBa_K902019 ). To test the circuits, we incubated cells expressing our construct with varying concentrations of magnesium.  We then measured both Colony Forming Units (CFU) and OD 600.  For a detailed protocol, see here .
Results
Figure 7: This shows the OD600 values of mgtA circuits with S7 both mutated and unmutated. The negative control consists of mgtAp-mgtArb.
Figure 7 shows that the mgtAp-mgtArb-S7 ( BBa_K902018 ) starts acting approximately 4 hours after induction. However, it also shows that 10mM MgCl2 is not enough salt to inhibit the entire system because there is no difference in OD600 measurement at 4hr time point between 10mM and the 0mM concentrations. This test needs to be repeated with higher concentrations of Mg2+ however this data suggests that the mutagenesis was successful and S7 is active and killing the cells at approximately 4hr which does not necessarily reflect solely upon the activity of S7 but also on the response time of the mgtA system.
An alternative: a glucose repressible system
Based on the problem with the magnesium system in relation to tailings pond conditions, we wanted to find an alternative. We found a promoter that was induced by rhamnose and repressed by glucose.  This seemed to be a very suitable candidate for controlling the kill switch in the bioreactor since the promoter was shown to be tightly repressed by glucose. We could supplement the bioreactor with glucose to inhibit expression of the kill genes in the bioreactor. Escape of bacteria into the tail"

The circuit to receive input signals is composed of AND GATE, plac promoter and light-controlled promoter. After being induced by IPTG, plac promoter activates the expression of T7 RNA polymerase (T7 ptag) which contains two  amber mutations. After being induced by green light, PcpcG2 promoter activates the expression of a special tRNA (supD), which is used to identify amber mutation. In the wild-type E.coli, amber mutation will inhibit the translation of T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, when IPTG and green light exist together, T7 RNA polymerase will be expressed, and then T7 promoter will be activated to express the downstream gene.

Making constructs to express putative acyltransferases in plant chloroplasts
AIM:
The aim of our prebiotic is to produce acylated/butrylated starch in plants. Methods to chemically acylate starch purified from plants already exist, but as they use strong chemicals and require heating they are not environmentally friendly. Using various acyltransferases, we hope to acylate starch in plants. We use a model plant, Nicotinia benthamiana, for initial tests because we can obtain results within a few days. Later on we would aim to make transgenic plants in a species that makes a lot of starch, such as maize (corn), potatoes or wheat.
METHOD:
We used Golden Gate Cloning  and the Plant Standard Syntax 1 to make our constructs. We used 35s promoter from Cauliflower Mosiac Virus ( BBa_K1467101 ), to drive constitutive expression.  We made a chloroplast transit peptide (New part - BBa_K1618028 ) that we then used in an N-terminal translational fusion with the acyl transferases for the protein to reach the chloroplast, where starch is produced.
In order to confirm that the transit peptide was functional we made a second set of constructs that had a fluorescent reporter in a C-terminal translational fusion.
To deliver the constructs to plants we needed to use Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a shuttle chassis. This meant parts needed to be assembled into a binary vector with origins of replication for both E. coli and A. tumefaciens. In order to submit the parts to the registry we also assembled parts into the MoCloFlipper pSB1C3 that accepts Golden Gate Parts into the pSB1C3 backbone.
All cloning was done according to the Golden Gate one-step Digestion-Ligation Protocol provided on our protocols page here .

PPS-Programmed Polyketide Synthesis
The domain in type I polyketide synthase(PKS) can work independently without losing their function[1]. We want to standardize the domain and assemble them in correct order and finally we can rational design and produce new-to-nature polyketide as we want.
1.What kind of polyketide synthase do we choose as our candidate?
Polyketide almost exist in every organisms but many of their synthesis processes are unclear[2]. First thing we did is to search suitable PKS. Erythromycin PKS modular 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase(DEBS) from Saccharopolyspora erythraea is a good candidate[3]. It has served as a module system for researching to engineer PKSs and to explore their structural plasticity and substrate tolerance[4] for long. DEBS, encoded by the gene eryA, are divided into three part including totally six module. DEBS1 which include three module, is the first part of DEBS[5]. (figure.1)
2.How to search the boundary between the domains and linker in a module?
The domains in PKS have independent functions[6]. We tried to separate different domains in the sequence of erythromycin type I polyketide synthase. To make sure that the integrity of domains are unbroken, it’s important that searching for the boundary between domain precisely. We find out the boundary between two domain, each domain are connected by the short adhesion.We search two database ASMPKS (Analysis System for Modular Polyketide Synthases: http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/~hstae/asmpks"

Project Description
Microbial Electrolysis Cells and Geobacter sulfurreducens
Microbial Fuel Cells harness the metabolic energy of bacteria, typically Geobacter sulfurreducens, to produce a voltage difference across a galvanic cell. In Microbial Electrolysis Cells this voltage is supplemented by an outside power source to drive an electrolysis reaction and produce hydrogen gas.
This method of hydrogen production is relatively recent and to date most of the investigations into improving the technique have revolved around the physical design of the chambers. However the technique relies fundamentally on the biology of the microbes used in the reaction, and thus we investigated avenues of improving the biologics of the system using a genetically engineered E. coli partner bacteria. We attempted to characterize two parts, BBa_K773002 and BBa_K2182000.
BBa_K773002 codes for the expression of Proteorhodopsin, a light-activated, membrane-bound proton pump. The export of H+ ions into the microbial electrolysis cell makes the electron exporting action of Geobacter sulfurreducens more efficient, thus theoretically increasing hydrogen yield. Proteorhodopsin requires retinal in order to fold correctly, since retinal is not naturally produced in the strain of E. coli that was used we generated retinal by adding beta-carotene to the culture and using Blh (BBa_K1604021), a beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase expressed upstream of proteorhodopsin. We included the Blh gene but not the full retinal synthesis pathway for initial tests because beta carotene is much easier to acquire than retinal and this design decreases the size and complexity of the plasmid without sacrificing proteorhodopsin function.
BBa_K2182000 is a novel part that we are submitting to the registry. It codes for NADPH Oxidase which catalyzes the formation of water from NADPH and O2. This oxygen scavenging activity improves the activity of the microbial electrolysis cell by preventing oxygen from reaching the cathode to react with hydrogen or from stressing Geobacter, which is an obligate anaerobe.

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," data was presented as the concentration of enzymes that remain free after binding, we needed to modify the Hill equation in order to model the fraction of unbound GzmB. Since bound + unbound = 100%, and the Hill equation models the bound component, it can be said that
, provided that the dataset is properly scaled to a range between 100%-0%.
The FindFit function of Mathematica was used to find the unknown constants Kd and n for the modified Hill equation above. Our model returned a Kd of ≈ 28.130 and n ≈ 1.3540. The final equation is
, where θfree is GzmB activity and [L] stands for concentration of Serpina3n (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Model: Serpina3n Inhibition of GzmB. Using data from the Ang et al. paper, we developed an equation that models relative GzmB Activity as a function of Serpina3n concentration
Human GzmB Inhibitor ACT3m
Given our model of Serpina3n, we also wanted to create a model for the protein used in our device, ACT3m. The dataset obtained from the ACT3m paper (Marcet-Palacios et al., 2014) is the result of a colorimetric assay. Data was presented as absorbance values (A405), which correspond to the concentration of free GzmB, at different inhibitor concentrations. The paper used this to prove that their novel ACT3m inhibitor was the strongest out of their entire pool of possible candidates: treatment with ACT3m resulted in the lowest A405 values, which suggests the strongest inhibition of GzmB.
To model this set of data, similar adjustments had to be made. First, the dataset was scaled so the numbers ranged between 0 and 1 (in this case, increased by a factor of 2). The same modified Hill equation was used from the Serpina3n analysis. Our model returned a Kd of ≈ 13.336 and n ≈ 0.605, so the equation looks like
(Figure 2).

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," a final analysis of the results, discussed about all problems and questions and helped with the preparation of a presentation, they had to hold in front of all instructors and participants.
Team Shuttle Vector> Phusion PCR of the fragment tAOX1 that contains upstream an bidirectional double AarI restriction site was done with the wild type X-33 and GS115 as DNA template. The positive control was as ever positive, but no other amplicons.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
We got new Streptomyces DNA from or supervisor C. Rueckert. He did an alignment with our S. griseus and S. lavendulae sequences against a local database for Streptomyces and identified S. rosechromogenes, S. tuebingen and S.goettingen. Those laccase genes showed simularity to our laccase genes. Since he had isolated chromosomal DNA we were able to work with them. We set the PCR with the three Streptomyces. On this PCR S. tuebingen DNA could be amplified, but it wasn't specific for that what we expected. No products could be amplified on the other two.

used 18E (e. coli promoter from plate 5) instead of pSB1A3, has plasmid BBa_J61002 w/ AmpR
About control experiments:
Uncut vector (BBa_J61002) withOUT ligase: checks for viability of competent cells and antibiotic resistance of the plasmid, as well as transformation procedure itself
expect colonies
since we are using a linearized plasmid, is there another uncut vector we could use that has the same antibiotic resistance so we can check the competency of our cells?
cut vector WITH ligase: shows background due to vector recircularization (and uncut vector)
expect few colonies (few more than without ligase), since only the plasmids which did not get cut during the digest or the plasmids which did get cut but are able to recircularize with the ligase will be transformed
this is the most important control. theoretically, there should be no colonies, but there is always some background, so as long as we have a lot more colonies on the vector with insert (actual ligation reaction) plate, it's okay.
The following controls were not carried out but should be and are useful for future experiments:
cut vector withOUT ligase: shows background due to uncut vector
expect few colonies, since only the plasmids which did not get cut during the digest will be transformed
only do this one if you have extra cut vector, if we don't set it up it's not a big deal, since cut vector with ligase will just show the total background due to uncut vector"

Team:BCCS-Bristol/Wetlab/Part Design/BioBricks/PyeaR+LacZ
The PyeaR promoter was ﬁrst put into the BioBrick standard by the University of Edinburgh’s 2009 iGEM team. We used this promoter and connected it to a GFP BioBrick to create a BioBrick that expresses GFP in response to levels of nitrite. We also connected the promoter to the LacZ gene which codes for β -galactosidase. This was used in a Miller assay, an experiment that is used to characterise a repressors response to inducer.
The constitutive RFP was expressed via an unmodiﬁed BioBrick from the parts registry.

As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthetic biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthetic biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend. However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.

INSA-Lyon,2014,Team:INSA-Lyon#molecular_-_-_TEXT.html," since it has neither the reach nor the rotation freedom of the floating C-terminus tag. It might be interesting for futures teams that would want to maximize the number of tags to add to their CsgA, providing the structure alteration isn't too important, which is an information we didn't have enough time to investigate this year.
NiChelation
After the structural changes brought by the tags we tried to determine the chelating activity of the tagged CsgA. So we simply added nickel ions in the neighborhood of the tags and let the minimisations and dynamics do their magics.
Results
Wildtype CsgA chelates nickel
The very first result we are going to talk about is that even without an His-tag, the wildtype protein is able to chelate nickel. That is something we didn't expect and were surprised to discover. Nickel can ben captured by either a group of ketones that are close to each other, but even more surprising, we observed the couple of histidines already present in wildtype CsgA act like gates, ""grabbing"" the ions with their cycles, and litterally pulling them  between the beta strands into the center of the protein. After witnessing this we ran simulations with wildtype CsgA alone and a lot of nickel ions, and realized that its chelating power was quite high as it could retain a bit more than twenty ions.
Chelation by the His-tags
For the folded conformation the tag, be it His1-tag or His2-tag, cover chelating site of CsgA, but is still able to chelate nickel ions en se repliant d'elle-même ou avec l'aide de groupes sur CsgA?, hence we conclude that such a conformation wouldn't bring much chelating power to the protein. As for the floating conformation however, we managed to verify a property found in the litterature publi modmol, which is that on a poly-Histidine tag, a nickel ion is chelated by the unprotoned nitrogen of the cycle of two histidines that are separated by a third  histidine schéma?. We also observed that through the folding of the tag around nickel ions so that histidines may chelate it, ketons groups were brought together, earning the ability to chelate an ion as well, and that the carboxyl group of its C-end was also able to chelate an ion. All in all, we determined that a floating tag should be able to chelate up to 5? nickel ions"

Figure 2. Final results of the E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 plates after the addition of DNAzyme. No bright fluorescence can be detected throughout the plates. The areas circled in red indicate the location in which the DNAzyme was dispensed on the quadrants containing the growth of E. coli DH5α (left) and B. subtilis WB800 (right).
Conclusion
We did not see the expected results, despite our troubleshooting efforts; therefore, further troubleshooting of this collaboration with iGEM McMasterU is required, as we did not observe the expected result. Fluorescence should only be detected within the quadrant containing E. coli DH5α and not in any of the other sections. As shown in Figure 2, no fluorescence can be seen in any quadrants of the two plates. There is a slight change in agar colour that can be seen in the circled area of the section labelled as B. Sub, for B. subtilis WB800. However, it is unclear whether this change in colour was caused by the DNAzyme or other factors. Due to limited amounts of DNAzyme sent by iGEM McMasterU , we were unable perform this experiment again.
We could look into using a Typhoon Imager, which was the suggested viewing device, in order to better match the McMaster University protocol. Due to the constraint of time, we were unable to find a laboratory that had this equipment available for use by us. By using this technology, we would be able to better troubleshoot this protocol by analyzing results under specific parameters, such as absorbance, that a traditional UV light cannot provide.
Throughout the process of this wet lab collaboration, we were able to test the DNAzyme, named GLOWzyme, synthesized by iGEM McMasterU , and assess the plausibility of incorporating it into our PHB system on Mars. Further testing is required to determine the efficiency of the DNAzyme to detect the presence of E. coli, which will provide insight as to whether we should integrate GLOWzyme into our system or look for other possible detection methods.
In addition, if the GLOWzyme system is to be incorporated into our project, there are two design elements that will need to be addressed. Firstly, the DNAzyme system has to be engineered in a way where little effort from the astronauts is required to maintain its working capacity. Also, a secondary system will be required to be hybridized to the GLOWzyme system such that when an E. coli leak is detected"
Georgia_Tech,2012,Team:Georgia Tech#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," by the lab safety officer in School of Biology, Marc Pline. The GT iGEM team follows all the safety protocols and guidelines as described by the Georgia Tech Environmental Health & Safety here
Also, our project follows the policies and procedures governing the possession and use of Recombinant DNA as stipulated by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Biosafety Committee and as laid out in this document
Safety Issues Concerning the GT iGEM 2012 Project
As with any project involving culturing bacteria, appropriate saftey measure have to be taken with our project. Though none of the bacteria we are working with are human pathogens or environmental liabilities, it is possible that unwanted contaminants could be cultured in large volume unintentionally. Therefore, we treat every culture as if it were dangerous and take important precautions, such as wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), cleaiing up any spills with 10% bleach or 70% ethanol, and autoclaving all culture tubes and plates before disposing of their contents.
Bacterial Strains Used
When working with any GMO, it is imperative to make sure that it remains in the lab and is not spread outside the lab. However, for our project we are not working with any human pathogens, so out project has been classified as Biosafety Level 1.
Agrobacterium tumefaciens
The lab has ordered its DNA to isolate the TraR sequence from it. We also recieved Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the Ti plasmid taken out. A tumefaciens is a plant pathogen, but it's virulence factors are on the Ti plasmid. TraR itself is merely a regulatory factor.
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)
The bacteria we used, BL21(DE3) E. coli, are non-pathogenic and thus not likely to cause any ill effects if released by accident. Transforming with plasmids containing TraR will not confer any benefit to them in any new hosts, save for the antibiotic resistance marker encoded on the plasmids.
Security Risk:
Biobrick Safety Considerations: The proposed biobrick of the Georgia Tech iGEM will consist of the basic parts of DNA of auto-inducer receptor TraR from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and a marker protein such as Green Fluorescent Protein. None of these parts have been documented to raise any safety issues.
Biosafety Regulations at Georgia Institute of Technology

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

The fluorescence was measured with a plate reader:
The fluorescence intensity and protein concentration were measured with the FLUOstar Omega,
which is a multi-mode microplate reader. Samples were pipetted into the microplate and analyzed via the plate reader. In this experiment we focused on the protein concentration and the fluorescence intensity of RFP. We measured the protein concentration with the bradford-assay. This is a method to determine the total protein concentration. To analyze the protein concentration of the samples, Coomassie Brillant Blue was pippeted to each sample. With the binding of the dye to the proteins the color changes from dark red to blue. The more protein in the solution the more Coomassie dye can bind to proteins and the more the color changes into blue. The absorption of bound Coomassie dye is 595nm. The absorbance is proportional with the amount of bound dye. With a series of Bovine"

Modeling Overview
Mathematical modeling plays a central role in Synthetic Biology. One of its major abilities is to predict the behavior of a biological circuit. Therefore, it is an important bridge between the ideas and concepts on the one hand and biological experiments on the other.
The main idea is to interact with the experimental part of the project in two ways. On the one hand to characterize the constructed biobricks, and identify parameters of the models thus allowing a better understanding of the biology behind. On the other hand, to direct the way in which experiments are performed, so as to verify a prediction done from the modeling world.
The first step, with a little knowledge, was to develop a mathematical model based on a system of differential equations. Then, the equations were implemented using a set of reasonable values, taken from the literature,  for the model parameters. This way, we could validate the feasibility of the project. Here, one of the main characters of the play came into the ""cheaters"" . We saw the “cheaters” could appear from an original population of “normal” microorganisms. This lead us to perform several experiments to measure the metabolic burden that arises when cells carrying a synthetic plasmid want to effectively synthesize the desired protein, as compared with cells that are NOT producing the protein. This could lead to increase the fitness of the “cheaters”. Go to the Experimental evolution prediction from the model page to see how did we model the cheaters.
Then we started the characterization of each part created in the lab. Some of the mathematical model parameters were estimated thanks to several experiments we performed within the project (others were derived from literature) and they were used to predict the final behavior of each construction. Go to the Modeling Bacteria page to see the models we did for the glucose-sensitive construction and the thermal shock responsive contruction. Also see Modeling Yeast page for the model of our construction in Yeast.
Experimental procedures for parameter estimation are discussed and"

Summary
Today we ran the PCR products for sac, ara and sspb on a 0.8% gel with wide wells, which we then cut out using the transilluminator.  Goksel also did a ligation of the sspb brick that was purified from the gel using the sigma gel extraction protocol. We ligated the product with the pSB1AT3 plasmid backbone prepared last week. Both the sspb insert and the backbone were cut with EcoRI and SpeI.  Today Arun also ran another PCR including our ara region, it worked well so we believe we can use the resulting PCR product for a digest and a ligation.
sac, araR and sspB PCR products were run on the gel. The order of the weels is: ladder, sac, araR, sspB, ladder.

Promoter Library Sub-Project
Introduction
From the previous lab session the products of the PCR reactions attempting to amplify the sigA promoter library (synthesized sequences of the sigA library containing degeneracies) were run through 1.5% agarose gel in electrophoresis. Analysis of the gel showed that although there were hazy bands forming, these may have not been the result of the PCR products and may have been caused by the primer-dimer complexes formed. The promoter fragments are roughly 100bp however, meaning that there may be little distinction between the promoters and the primer-dimers in 1.5% agarose gel! In light of this experiment, today's task will involve cleaning up the PCR products for another run of DNA gel electrophoresis tomorrow.

E.coli Transformation
Electroporation method was used in order to                             transform a DNA construction. This procedure is                             commonly used for E. coli and Agrobacterium.
The electroporation cuvette was put in ice 10 minutes before inserting the cells.                                     An aliquot of electrocompetent cells are                                     taken out of the -80°C freezer, and they                                     are put immediately into ice.
1-2 ul of the ligation product are                                     taken and added carefully to them.
60 ul of the mix are taken and put into                                     an electroporation cuvette making sure that                                     there are no bubbles.
The cuvette is dried and put in the                                     electroporator, making sure that any spark                                     is done. In that case, the process does not                                     work and must be repeated. This could                                     happen when plasmid and E. coli concentration are not optimal.
The voltage for the electroporator is                                     1500V for E. coli and 1440V for Agrobacterium.
Transformed cells are resuspended in                                     300 μL of LB in the electroporation                                     cuvette. Then, they are taken and put into                                     an Eppendorf letting them grow in the                                     shaker for 2 hours at 37°C.

NTU_SINGAPORE,2017,Team:NTU SINGAPORE#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," CRISPRi.
Not only that: the GFP gene in this case is on a p15A origin plasmid. Literature suggests that there should be 15-20 copies of this plasmid per cell – and hence 15-20 copies of GFP promoters for the dCas9 to bind to and interfere. On the other hand, there is only one genome bound GFP gene in our endogenous reporter E. coli strain for multiple dCas9 to bind to.
Thus, the binding affinity of our truncated dCas9 variants are more strictly interrogated by this plasmid reporter system, especially when dCas9 expression is restricted.
Based on these conclusions, we would expect to observe similar results with endogenous gene CRISPRi if we are to target a less effective site, for example the -35 of the promoter. In addition, we may also replicate the very low dCas9 level expression to achieve strict interrogation in endogenous CRISPRi.
While plasmid reporter used here is an imperfect model of therapeutic CRISPRi, we have shown that it is a better method to interrogate our truncated dCas9 binding affinity – especially with regards to mammalian endogenous gene activation. Such a system may serve as a rapid intermediate to testing any future truncated dCas9, complementing other methods such as our mammalian exogenous gene activation and the EMSA assay established by Macquarie iGEM team.
We would like to thank NUS iGEM team for providing a characterized CRISPRi dual plasmid system. Do check their wiki page also here ."
Kyoto,2014,Team:Kyoto#Project#Magnetosome Formation_-_-_TEXT.html," obtained based on a model that assumes 500 nm magnetosome at maximum size of the vesicles, to avoid over-estimation of the parts efficiency (see Material and Method section for more detail). We next performed more precise estimation. When we assume the vesicle size at 120 nm (magnetosome of magnetotactic bacteria is 35 to 120 nm), the probabilities of the model are 9.9% (pLQ) and 6.0% (pLQB), so the efficiencies are 91.9% and 166.7%, respectively. These results together indicate that the efficiency of vesicle formation by pLQ and pLQB introduction is reasonably high. Most, if not all, of the transformants with these plasmids harbor at least one vesicle per cell.
Fig. 12 Our model of E. coli
We used this model to calculate theoretical VOR (vesicle observation rate).
Fig. 13 Measurements of the height and radius of transformants for the parts efficiency estimation.
We measured sections to make graph 1. and 2. To determine height, we measured their mean and extracted a part of samples which are larger than the average. Then, we took an average of the extracted samples. However, we determined radius from average of data.
E. coli growth is retarded when pLQ or pLQB are introduced
The transformants with pLQ or pLQB frequently show elongated form in TEM images ( Fig. 16 ). We reasoned that this is due to the inefficient cytokinesis of these strains. To address this issue, we investigated the growth curve of these strains ( Fig. 14 ). While the growth rate of pL ( Fig .15 ) transformant was same as the control, that of pLQ and pLQB transformants were much lower than the control strain. These results are in good consistence with the model that pLQ or pLQB expression is partially harmful for the cell division (presumably at the cytokinesis).

The growth rate of pLQ and pLQB transformants were lower than pL transformants and control. Culture at 37 °C in LB medium.

Progress on Carotenoids (Monday)
Today we carried out restriction digest of K118006/CrtB (as recipient plasmid vector) using SpeI and PstI (two cuts both within suffix), and of K118005/CrtI (as gene insert) using XbaI and PstI (one cut within prefix, the other cut within suffix).
Recall that the sizes are: K118006/CrtB: insert: 949bp, backbone: 2079bp, total: 3028bp. K118005/CrtI: insert: 1498bp, backbone: 2079bp, total: 3577bp.
Hence we expect one band of about 3000bp for K118006/CrtB, and two bands of about 1500bp and 2100bp for K118005/CrtI, after restriction digest with their respective enzymes.
The restriction digest products were run on gel, and the results were shown below:
Lane 1: Log-2 DNA ladder (NEB). Lanes 2 and 3: Restriction digest products of K118006/CrtB (less DNA loaded in lane 3). Lane 4: Undigested K118006/CrtB (negative control). Lane 5 empty. Lane 6: Restriction digest products of K118005/CrtI. Lane 7: Undigested K118005/CrtI (negative control).
This indicated that the restriction digest was successful.
We then carried out gel extraction on Lane 2 and Lane 6, ligation with T4 ligase, and electroporation into E. coli Top10 cells. Results of transformation will be ready for inspection tomorrow.

However, TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) had a mutation in the RVD region of the second repeat making it specific for a cytosine instead of a thymine. Because of that, we will have to design new primers to add the new TALE B target sequence to the RPF generator.

Questionnaire
We have designed a questionnaire about the treatment of heavy-metal contaminated sewage both in English and Chinese and distributed it through the Internet. During the past two month, we have collected 498 samples. These samples qualified us to make further analysis about our topic.
1.Respondents
We have a variety of respondents of different ages, different occupations and different knowledge levels. As to the age, respondents of 18-25 years old, such as university students, account for more than one-third of the total. The rest are people at their 41-50 year old, 31-40 year old or 26-30 year old, which account for 55%. Besides, there are few respondents under 18 or over 60. As to the knowledge level, most respondents have received well-round education. That is to say, this survey covers mainly university students and intellectuals who have enough social experiences and are easily influenced by new-born stuffs.
2.The knowledge of sewage treatment
When surveying about public awareness of sewage treatment, most respondents (98%) pay attention to such sort of news in daily life, which illustrates high attention paid to water pollution. However, subjects only have limited knowledge of current conditions and sewage treatment disciplines and it is demanding for us to further promote the propagation of water contamination. As to the opinion on the treatment of industrial polluted water, most respondents are unsatisfied and concerned about it since lots of problems still exist.
3.The knowledge of heavy metal contamination
In this part, we investigated the knowledge of heavy metal contamination and the knowledge of biological approaches dealing with heavy metals. Respondents know that heavy metals mainly come from industries and electronic products, yet hardly know exact harms heavy metals will do to humans. Therefore, we believe more information should be spread widely in this part.
In the meanwhile, most respondents don not know about biological approaches dealing with heavy metals. They believe this kind of methods will have a bright future and hold positive attitude towards it. However, considering one-fourth of respondents are blindly confident about it, it is necessary for us to promote the propagation of bio-technology application.
4.The propagation of pollution
We have also investigated the ways in which public residents get informed of pollution prevention. It shows that there are plentiful of ways but the Internet is the main information resource. Respondents reflect that the information is extremely limited and wish to learn more about heavy metal pollution.
In a word, from the statistics above, both the resource and the number of respondents ensure that our survey is of convincing credit"

In our project, we attempted to use modified yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to mimic type I hypersensitive reaction in vitro. As former mentioned, two groups of cells play major role in allergy: the first group of cells (basophil granulocyte and mast cell) sense the existence of certain allergens, and release mediators; the second group of cells senses the concentration of mediators and carry on downstream physiological function, like endothelia cells of blood vessel. The activation of these two groups of cells could serve as indicators of allergen. For simplicity, we try to engineer yeast cells to emulate the behavior of the second group of cells.
There are two kinds G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway described in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Gpr1 pathway for sensing glucose, and Ste2/Ste3 pathway for sensing pheromone originates from yeast of opposite mating type (a/α). Yeast of α mating type secretes pheromone called α factor, and senses pheromone a factor from yeast of a mating type. Similarly, yeast of mating type a secretes a factor, and senses α factor. The mating pathway can be activated by pheromone from opposite mating type, inducing the transcription of mating related genes like Fus1 and Fig2. The pheromone sensing pathway of a-typed yeast is diagramed in fig 1.
fig 1. Pheromone sensing pathway of a-typed Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Former publications stated that some of human GPCRs can be successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and functional coupled with its endogenous pheromone sensing pathway, activating transcription of genes like Fus1 and Fig2. It has been showed that replacing the five amino acids at C terminal of Gpa1 with the five amino acids at the very C end of the Gα subunit that originally interact with GPCR to be expressed in human body could increase the coupling efficiency.

Results of Sequencing and Colony PCR
PCR showed that rtTA and GFP were both present.
Sequencing showed that GFP was in the backbone, not rtTA
rtTA was probably not in the backbone and was floating near the colonies instead, so when we picked up the colonies for Colony PCR, we also picked up the rtTA with them.
