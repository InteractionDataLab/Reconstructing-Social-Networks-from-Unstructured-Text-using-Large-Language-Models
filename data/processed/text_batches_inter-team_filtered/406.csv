Collaborations
Heidelberg
We are glad to cooperate this year for the second time in succession with the motivated iGEM Team Heidelberg. As some of our team leaders were in the last years’ iGEM-Team, we knew about the spirit of Heidelberg’ teams and were hopeful to have a great collaboration as well as a lot of fun with them.
Fortunately, three members of them decided to meet us spontaneously after a demanding meeting within our team. The evening turned out to become great including stories about iGEM, local gastronomic specialities typical for Freiburg or Heidelberg and much more. The next day, we talked about our projects and possibilities to cooperate. It turned out that both teams use the same light system (LOV) for their experiments, although one – their team – worked with bacteria, the other one – our team – with mammalian cells. We showed them where we are working, how we work and presented our latest experimental results. In addition, we talked about the light boxes wherein we conduct our light experiments and about the appropriate conditions of a light experiment.
After we had explained to them how to handle mammalian cells, we heard some information about their interesting project “iGEM@home” that includes the possibility to share unnecessary resources of the computer to speed up modeling of complex protein structures. In terms of important aspects of their project, we were interested in their weekly published blog. A few weeks later, Team Heidelberg gave us the possibility to write a text for their blog about light induction systems, a central part of their and our project. Their blog is released every Monday. HERE you can read the text that was published on the blog. As a quid pro quo, they helped us by modeling our system: as they had a lot of modeling work in their project, they could give us helpful advices to improve our modeling.
 
 
Aachen
We noticed during the meetup in Munich that we our both teams had a good foundation for a coopartion. We skyped several times discussing our projects and how to exactly work together to bring our both teams forward. We also had the pleasure of meeting Micheal face to face when he spontanously showed up in Freiburg.  In addition, we met again at the Aachen meetup and finalized the collaboration. Team Aachen helped us by providing us with laser-cutted phot"

Modelling
Intro
In an effort to understand our system and understand the dynamics behind our construct and its impact on the bacteria we decided to make a computer simulation. With this simulation we hope to be able to predict the amount of inulin produced by our bacteria and maybe get a measurement of how much sucrose is needed to meet the inulin requirements for health benifits.
Disclaimer
Due to the limited characterization we’ve had with our enzymes it hasn’t been possible to make any exact modelling but we hope to display some of the basic functionality of our bacterial system. With this model we hope to show the dynamics behind the process of inulin metabolization but due to the large number of variables we have had to assume a lot of parameters. For the modelling purpose we’ve used the program Berkeley Madonna which is a simple yet effective program to model biological systems. (http://www.berkeleymadonna.com/)
Theory
SST: is able to cleave and combines a sucrose with a fructose moiety of a cleaved sucrose molecule to make the trisaccharide 1-kestose through a beta2->1 linkage. FFT: uses 1-kestose as a substrate and elongates this by the iterative addition of n amount of fructose moiety again through beta2->1 linkages. This enzyme also has the ability to cleave sucrose into its two constituents.
Figur 1 – In the image we can see the basic structure of inulin, with the bottom part being the first sucrose and the “arm” extending upward from the green fructose are fructose units added by FFT.    (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC196615/)
When making a model it is often helpful to make a simple sketch of your system to visualize it and then figuring out what goes into your system where, and what comes out. It is also essential to find bottlenecks i.e. where there might be delays in the system due to enzyme inefficiencies or transport of precursors across membranes etc. From this sketch we constructed a causality diagram which is shown below.
In this diagram we postulate that SST and FFT work in cooperation, that is,"

Description
Choosing reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem laboratories routinely face. Experimental practices differ immensely across laboratories, and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled members leave the lab. Such fragmentation in protocol methods and their documentation often hampers scientific progress. Indeed, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that measures a protocol’s success. In turn, the lack of commonly accepted protocols and inadequate documentation affects experimental reproducibility through method inconsistencies across laboratories. Review studies even estimate that only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible, and up to 54% of materials/antibodies/organisms are not identifiable for reproducibility studies ( https://peerj.com/articles/148/ ). This is an alarming figure and suggests that many of the results we base continued research and development on are inaccurate or cannot be replicated independently.
To attempt to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowd-sourced ratings and comments system to clearly document, rate, elaborate, review, and organize variants of experimental protocols in order to increase the likelihood of reproducible scientific results. This would streamline some of the confusion associated with finding and replicating protocols by creating a database where investigators can upload protocols, comment on them, and even use a rating system to allow the best protocols to rise to the top.  Before starting, we designed a survey ( which you can check out here ) to poll a range of scientific researchers on their experiences trying new protocols.  We disseminated it across our networks and over social media to judge the interest and usefulness of our project.  For those still interested, the survey will be available here for people to take at least through the end of 2014.  So far, we've found that among a diverse and experienced set of respondents, every single scientist has struggled with replicating protocols from other experimenters, with >50% of respondents having difficulty more than 25% of the time.
Additionally, our survey identified that unclear language and missing steps of protocols as the greatest contributors to the irreproducibility of protocols. Furthermore, 100% of respondents indicated they would use a database like this to browse and download protocols, and"

Safety
Our Workspaces
Wet Lab
We have our own iGEM TU Delft lab in the new Applied Science building on the edge of the TU Delft campus. It is classified as an ML-1 lab, the lowest safety level to work with modified organisms, which is sufficient for our experiments . In this lab we do all the molecular work, such as cloning, PCR and transformations. For characterization work, such as measuring fluorescence or growth curves, as well as growing our cells we can make use of the equipment of the Department of Bionanoscience of the university.
Optical Lab
Since our custom-built setup involves working with lasers, we need to have a specific optical lab for this. For both our safety and the accuracy of experiments, this lab is completely light-isolated, no light can go in or out. This lab is also classified as ML-1, so we can bring our organisms inside. The lab has all the requirements for laser safety, such as a warning sign and an interlock that will"

Super optimized modified yeast – light-emitting cell display
The aim of the project of the iGEM team of Eindhoven University of Technology in 2012 is to design and produce a new multi-colored display in which genetically engineered cells function as pixels, analogous to how a flat panel display works. The challenges are in reaching a high refresh rate of the screen, but also in creating a multi-colored prototype. There are three components to the display: genetically engineered cells that emit fluorescent light in response to an electrical stimulus (the 'pixels'), a device to provide stimuli to each pixel (the 'control grid'), and a computational model that predicts how cells will react to the stimuli from the device. The basic biological parts used in this project are yeast cells, fluorescent calcium sensors and voltage-gated calcium channels. The laboratory work will focus on integrating these parts and establishing the desired reactions to electrical stimuli in order to create the 'pixels' of the display. The project is based on the research of iGEM Valencia 2009 who built a display on a 96-wells plate from yeast cells with Aequorin, but a higher refresh rate and multiple colors are aspired in our project. Computational modeling will provide insight into the electrophysiology of yeast cells, the role of calcium channels and the most sensitive parameters in calcium homeostasis in order to optimize the biological system. We will build an electronic device that is compatible with biological material to provide control over the pixels. The custom build hardware of the device is complemented with software written in LabView to generate images on the screen.

This week, the fabrication group focused on what materials to construct our chamber from.  At first we considered a single wall design, but this was eventually scrapped, as we were unable to find any material that would provide sufficient insulation at a reasonable thickness (and cost).  After putting our heads together, we decided on a double wall with an insulating layer in between them.  Mac began drawing up the chamber in Solidworks.

The peptide aptamer’s specificity could be examined with protein microarray. Many different proteins would be immoblized to the microarry chip, the peptid aptamer taged with flourecent dye though anti-FLAG, would be added. Thus the fewer proteins towards the peptid aptamer can bind, the higher specificity.

The term “living machine“ - a hybrid between machine and living organisms
Machine originates from the Latin term „machina“ and means „tool, artificial equipment“ and is defined as „a piece of equipment with moving parts that is designed to do a particular job.[..]“ (Pons; Oxford dictionary 1884).
It follows that machines are designed for a particular purpose, according to the plans of humans and adopt a predetermined, defined and by itself immutable function. Machines are per definition not in the position to plan and conduct their behavior autonomically. They cannot change actions by themselves and can only operate in a certain way with the environment. Crucial characteristic for a machine is the autonomy but not the material, organic or inorganic (Deplazes 2011).
In contrast to the heteronomous machine stands life itself. The discussion about the concept of life in synthetic biology is a complex and wide-ranging field, where the difficulties of a definition lie just in the diversity of life. It is noteworthy that the researchers themselves are trying to find a suitable explanation, as it is an objective of synthetic biology to create new life (Deplazes / Huppenbauer 2009). Here is a brief description how researchers are trying to define life or alive.
After a minimal definition each organism is alive, which has an independent genome, has a cellular membrane structure and a sustainable and autonomous replication system (Endy 2005; Toepfer 2005).
The autopoiesis theory acts on a philosophical assumption when developing a concept of life. Living organisms differ from non-living organisms by"" [the fact that they are] the product of their organization […]. There is no separation between producer and product. Being and doing [of an] autopoietic unity is inseparable, and this constitutes their specific type of organization ""(Maturana, Varela 1987). Consequently, the products of synthetic biology would not been self-caused, but organized externally by humans. Consequently, following this train of thought, scientists will never succeed in producing an autopoietic system synthetically. The human as manufacturer of the genome states himself as the creator of the organism. The postulated unit of producer and product can never be succeeded. The organism remains heteronomous by the determination of the genome by man.
This logical problem with the autopoiesis-theory in synthetic biology leads to restricted and modified applicability of the theory .
Thus, the following discussion will concentrate on"
Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," blue, in combination with the biocatalyst E. coli is essential for electron transport. In contrast to the voltage values reached with this setup even for low resistances, both E. coli KRX solution without mediator and cell free M9 medium with mediator show much lower values.
Figure 33: Microbial fuel cell results from cultivation of E. coli KRX with and without redox-mediator and a negative control without bacteria. The resistance used was periodically increased from 10 Ω to 10 kΩ.
The polarization curve presented in Figure 34 confirms this fact. Plotting the measured voltage values as a function of the according current shows the characteristic correlation between voltage and current, depending on the used resistance.
Figure 34: Polarization curve, calculated based on the measurement values presented in Figure 33.
By calculating the appropriate electrical power values and plotting them in the form of a power curve as a function of the current (Figure 35), the differences becomes even more visible. While the cultivation of E. coli and the test with only M9 Medium show no significant differences, the cultivation containing 345 µmol L-1 methylene blue achieves a significantly higher wattage, but still does not nearly reach the level of bacteria and mediators in combination. It should also be noted that in comparison to the power-values shown in the following text, the results presented in Figure 33 to 35 are significantly lower, because of a deviant measure arrangement. During this investigation it became apparent that the used A UT 803 multimeter, connected in series for current-measurement, had an internal resistance of about 550 Ω which was not specified in the manual. For that reason, there was a significant voltage drop over the multimeter which distorted all data collected. Based on this fact the measure arrangement was changed to the circuit presented in Figure 3 for all future experiments and the current was calculated using Ohms law.
All in all, the calculation of polarization and power curves by changing the load of the system using different resistors shows the importance of a suitable electron transfer system. A comparison of the different fuel cell generations was not possible, because the experimental setup was optimized over the course of the project.
Figure 35: Power curve, calculated based on the data presented in Figure 33.
Besides the calculation of power curves the temporal process of power output is a very important parameter evaluating the overall performance of a microbial fuel cell, too. Exemplary, Figure 36 illustrates the electrical power as a function of time for the wild type E. coli KRX and a genetically modified strain of E. coli KRX"

The gel looked like this:
Apart from a slight band around pSB1K3 indicating incomplete digestion, the digestion was extremely clean. This protocol was recommended by both the Knight laboratory and NEB, and as such it seems to work well.

∴J04500 appears too long: it should be 220bp.
∴The purification efficiency of the PCR kit is currently unknown when purifying digests, and this must be tested-especially since a J04500, a 220bp segment, is pushing the 200"

Algorithm
The users of our software are all innovative researchers who are interested in utilizing Synthetic Biology to tackle many different real-world problems. The purpose of our system is to recommend the most related genetic parts to the users based on users' research interest detected by our system.
The information we use to make recommendations is based on a database powered by NLP and Random Walk, which contains scores between each keyword and each genetic part. Formally, it is a matrix consisting of the number of keywords and the number of Parts. The element at the row and column is the score between the keyword and genetic Part that can reflect the connection between them. (Higher score suggests stronger connection).
The overall strategy of our system is Collaborative Filtering, i.e. we first search similar keywords in our database of the unknown word offered by users, then recommend genetic parts which are highly related to those keywords that are suggested for users.
How to find the most similar keywords in our dataset of a given unknown word in an accurate and efficient way? Here is our general solution: To quantify the semantic similarities between words accurately, we use techniques in Deep Learning to convert words into numerical vectors and the cosine similarities between each vector can represent the semantic similarities between words. To search the similar keyword efficiently, we use the KD Tree Algorithm, a speedy algorithm based on the binary tree, to implement the K Nearest Neighbors strategy.
Network Analysis
Search analysis
At scientific journals, keywords are often required for publishing articles. Keywords can be used for indexing or searching, and offer a faster way for readers to browse the content of a project and find their interests.
In fact, in 2015, iGEM try to collect some keywords by asking teams to submit.
This year, a new data format is created and its keywords enable our network analysis. First, We used Microsoft Text Analytics Service to extract keywords from wiki texts of previous projects. Only the most frequently used keywords will be focused. By using machine learning, those keywords were converted to word vectors base on a semantic database. A network profiling relationship among keywords, projects and parts data is built and stored in the S-Din database. When searching, related information will be provided based on the network analysis, which would spark a brand new idea unexpectedly.
Interaction analysis
When you use interaction analysis for a Part on the design platform, any other parts"

It is thermoplastic which means that it can can be warmed up and reused.
It can form filamentous structure and thereby can be used as a raw material for 3D printing.
P(LA-co-3HB) has similar properties as ABS which is used in making LEGO bricks (Grieser F, 2016)
has shown to have low toxicity to humans
In regards to these properties, the P(LA-co-3HB) production using genetic engineered organisms that are easy to handle mass produce, lightweight and easy to mass produce is suitable for space flights and future martian colonizations. This concept can not only be used on Mars, but also on planet Earth.
The biosynthesis of both pure homopolymer Poly Lactic >cid (PLA) and heteropolymer P(LA-co-3HB) in Escherichia coli has previously been researched and optimized by Yamada et. al. (2010) and a similar work is demonstrated by iGEM team, Yale iGEM 2013 , who were inspired by the work done by Jung and coworkers (2009).
In Jung et. al. (2009), they use a synthetic two-step bioproduction of PLA and P(LA-co-3HB). In their first step, they introduce a synthetic pathway by incorporating four genes to synthesize P(LA-co-3HB). In the next step, they manage to synthesize pure PLA along with P(LA-co-3HB) with high fraction of lactic acid by enhancing production of lactic acid. The production of P(LA-co-3HB) is not been demonstrated before in B. subtilis and that is why our first goal is to make it synthesize P(LA-co-3HB) and thereby optimize it to produce pure PLA in the future, as it is done by the iGEM team from Evry 2016 .
The biochemical properties and one-step biosynthesis of P(LA-co-3HB)
P(LA-co-3HB) is an organic compound that is produced by hetero polymerization of lactyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl in bacterial cells. The fraction of lactic acid and 3-hydroxybutyryl identified in P(LA-co-3HB) varies and has shown to be dependent on amount of lactate and acetyl-CoA in the cell. The fraction of lactic acid in P(LA-co-3HB) influences the melting temperature of P(LA"

Even Fluid Dispension-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf
Integrated conversion of a set volume to dispense over time for dispensers in Neptune’s microfluidic devices are integrated into Neptune’s Software. A table of PWM and uL values at even intervals of fluid dispensing are generated and stored for each servo-syringe combination within Neptune to be used by the front end of the system to send dispense commands to the arduino. This can be done by the user through the Control page in an intuitive, pictorial way.
Neptune Packaging | Priya Kapadia
After creating Neptune as a web-application, the hardware team thought of packaging the entire application into a desktop application that the biologist could download onto his local computer. This would enable the user to use Neptune offline, making it more convenient. To do so, a packaging tool called Electron was introduced to host Neptune. This is under development, and moving forward, Neptune may become a desktop application that biologists can use anywhere and anytime.
Microfluidic Chip Prototyping | Shane McCormack
In order to ensure our design, build, and control workflow was functioning properly, we took designs through the Neptune workflow and tested them with mock experiments using colored water, or by collaborating with other iGEM teams to test biology inside our accessible microfluidic platform (checkout our collaborations page for more details on biology inside our systems!)
We stand on the shoulders of giants.
Our work would not have been possible without the foundations laid by our mentors. Neptune’s microfluidic design and fabrication tool leverages projects such as Fluigi Place and Route, Mint description language, MakerFluidics, and 3DuF in order to provide the most intuitive and cohesive experience for users. These projects have been built and expanded on by our graduate student mentors. We would like to thank our mentors for all of the work they have done to allow us to bring Neptune to life.

Fluigi outputs the design in a series of visual formats: SVG files (which can be used to mill out the different layers of the microfluidic chip using a CNC mill), a JSON file (which can be used to visualize the microfluidic design with 3DuF),"

We introduced our project to the researchers in the laboratory, who gave us a high evaluation of the project and affirmed our idea of applying the system to the regulation of anabolic circuits in order to integrate with the real industries better.
Since engaging in the beauty industry, they suggested that we can not only use our system to produce the enzymes that are needed to process raw material, but also directly produce some ingredients, which can be added to skin care products. And our polycistron system can even attempt to mix two materials proportionally in production. In addition to using E·coli as our engineering cells, we may also be able to apply the system to other chassis, such as yeast, to explore the most convenient way on factory production. We will also keep in touch with Youdu for a long term and hope that our system can really achieve industrial integration.
Fig.18 Qingdao Youdu Biotechnology Co.LTD applauded our polycistron system.
In the process of interaction with biotech companies, we gained a lot and integrated it with our project. We organized our biotech companies research reports into documents and shared our experience with other iGEM teams. Known that our project is about basic research, Tianjin University contacted us and we set up a fundamental research results transformation team together with several Chinese iGEM teams, Tianjin, ZJU, NUDT. We were glad to share our experience with them.  Finally, we have finished a report on the transformation of basic research results, hoping future iGEM teams can learn something from it.
3. INTEGRATING PROJECT WITH A GAME——< Csy4 GO!>
""The principles of all fundamental scientific research are obscure for amateurish people.""
""The form of the game < Csy4 GO!> is interesting!""
In the process of human practice, we tried to explain our projects to more people. But we found that they felt it difficult to understand, especially some amateurish people. In order to let more people understand the principles of biology in an interesting and effective way, we spent lots of time designing a game - < Csy4 GO!>, which is a good combination with our project.

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#biosynthesis#carotenoids_-_-_TEXT.html," Registry of parts by teams from previous years. This extends the verified carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in E.coli available in the Registry for an additional step.
Figure 4: HPLC analysis of extracts from bacteria comprising the zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathway (R0011 crtEBIYZ) confirms production of zeaxanthin.
Figure 5: Cell pellets of bacterial culture producing zeaxanthin (R0011 crtEBIYZ)
Biosynthesis of canthaxanthin
We added a synthetic gene for the carotenoid biosynthetic enzyme (crtO) to the Registry. The enzyme crtO can introduce keto group to beta-carotene ring and could lead to formation of echinenone (one keto group) or canthaxanthine (two keto groups). We were not able to obtain standard for echinenone, but we conclude that it was probably present in the cell extract, as there was neither canthaxanthin or beta carotene in the sample (the latter is not present on the HPLC chromatogram, as it does not elute with the method used). There was, however, a coloured substance in the sample, with the absorbance spectrum characteristic for carotenoids, but with a slightly different absorbance maximum than beta carotene.
Figure 6: HPLC analysis of sample, extracted from cells containing R0011 crtEBIYO construct. Analysis shows the presence of a compound, which is less polar than zeaxanthin or canthaxanthin.
Figure 7: Absorbance spectra of the sample, extracted from cells containing R0011 crtEBIYO construct. The absorbance peak of the sample is slightly shifted to longer wavelenght in comparison to beta-carotene standard.
Figure 8 Biosynthesis of canthaxanthin from beta carotene. This is a two step reaction, the intermediate is an assymetric carotenoid called echinenone.
DNA-guided assembly of carotenoid biosynthetic pathway
We constructed 6 genes coding for zinc finger - carotenoid biosynthesis enzyme fusion proteins (Jazz::crtE, Blues::crtB, Zif268::crtI, PBSII::crtY, ZnF_HivC::crtO and Gli1::crtZ). Bacterial cells were transformed with three plasmids (two with each containing three enzymes and the third plasmid with DNA program). Therefore bacteria required three selection markers, which almost stopped their growth. Decreasing the amount"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"a dried with the latter CAHS showed RNase activity even in the absence of the target RNA. This was corroborated by iGEM Munich 2017 , when the same trend was observed under similar experimental conditions with a Cas13a protein originating from a different strain. Nonetheless, the results were positive for the tardigrade-specific protein SAHS 33020, as both the activity and specificity of Cas13a could be considerably preserved after drying and rehydrating. We therefore believe that the SAHS proteins hold great potential in simplifying the storage, usage and shipment of the many fragile chemicals and biological materials.
Vesicles - Exploring the cell's potential as a (future) factory
As indicated on the design page , we wanted to let our bacteria produce all our necessary proteins at once and package them in Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs). For this purpose, we tried to establish and characterize hypervesiculation in a strain with a knock-out of an important membrane envelope protein, TolA. Furthermore, we conducted experiments in which another membrane protein, TolR, was overexpressed. It had been suggested that this would further enhance vesiculation.
Achievements
Confirming the hypervesiculation plasmid
We received the plasmid with the mutation in the TolR gene from UNSW Australia 2016 . In order to confirm the sequence, we transformed the plasmid into a TOP10 strain. Some colonies were picked and screened with colony PCR (with primers IG0028 and IG0027 ). Simultaneously these colonies were grown and miniprepped , prior to performing a digestion with NdeI and SphI. Colonies 3.1 and 3.2 were picked for sequencing (with primer IG0028 ), where the sequence of both plasmids was further confirmed.
Figure 33: Gel electrophoresis of the colony PCR products and restriction assay. (A) The colony PCR products from different transformations. (B) The restriction assay, including non-digested samples as control.
Establishing and characterizing hypervesiculation
We performed a series of tests to determine if we successfully induced hypervesiculation by the deletion of TolA in the E.coli BW25133 strain from the Keio collection (KEIO) and the overexpression of TolR ( Baba et al. 2006 ). The following combinations of plasmid and cells were used (Figure 34): pET-Duet with and without the insert of TolR, both in the E. coli BW25133 strain with (KEIO) and"

The results for the sequencing of LacI-pSB1C3 were checked: For both colonies 47 and 51 there was a 124 bp long exact same insert in the middle of the LacI-gene. In colony 54, there were two point mutations. The first one at location 2215, changing an Arg into Leu; the second mutation was on location 2625 changing a Glu into a stopcodon.
These two point mutations need to be fixed. Since normal mutation fixing by PCR only handles one mutation at a time, a new strategy was thought of: Two different linear fragments should be made, both fixing one mutation and able to join together with the other part via Gibson Assembly. The primers were designed and ordered.
The Phusion-PCR products of the different promoters that were obtained were transformed into TOP10 cells. For this, 2µl DNA was used per transformation, RFP-pSB1C3 as a positive control and MilliQ as a negative control. All transformations were plated onto LB-Cm plates and stored at 37ºC.

A colony PCR was performed for the transformations of the different promoters attached to phaP-pSB1C3. The expected amplification length is approximately 1kb. Four colonies per plate were analyzed in the colony PCR.
This gel showed that only colony 35 (lane 15) did not contain the right PCR-product. The other colonies were transferred to liquid LB-Cm and cultivated overnight at 37ºC.

The positive control from yesterday, with dilutions, still failed. Trying the positive control Gibson Assembly again today. Doing 3uL of positive control, 3uL of Gibson Mixture, and putting the PCR tube containing the mixture into a centrifuge tube, full of water, which has been pre-heated on a 50 degree hot plate. Bascially: a mini-water bath. Water bath is to ensure even heating on all sides of the PCR tube. Going to transform with 1:1 and 1:4 dilutions of the mixture post-Gibson, 2uL total volume of mixture. Going to heat shock with the same protocol that we've been trying so far. 42 degrees for 55 seconds (55 because it's a dry plate and it may not be heating fast enough), 950 uL of SOC, 1 hr incubator at high-speed, 100uL onto selection plate with glass beads
Subcultured each of the Interlab strains into 7mL of liquid LB with chloramphenicol. Put in incubator

Design an absorb system
Although we invested a lot of thought into the detection system, and enhanced the efficiency of detection, it was only half of the solution. To substantially reduce nickel ion contamination, we must design a system that can be used to absorb nickel ions. See more
Design A Device
We will do this for our design products. We put the engineered bacteria containing the genetic line into the injection tray of the machine with tin foil paper. The injection tank has a thermostat device, which can ensure the temperature of the bacteria is not fluctuate in real time. Through chip processing, photoelectric conversion module and wireless module, it converts bioluminescence into digital signals and transmits them to our mobile phones for real-time monitoring.

Design an absorb system
After reviewing the previous works and related contents of the literature, we have identified the biological chassis of this system as S. Cerevisiae. Yeast has a vacuole that is not found in E. coli, and the vacuole is an organelle that is isolated from the intracellular environment. Nickel ions are toxic to cells; however, if we store the ions in their vacuoles instead of their cell environment, we would greatly increase its resistance to nickel ions. This would make it a good candidate to achieve our purpose of capturing large amounts of nickel ions. We found a nickel ion transporter, TgMTP1t2, in a cell of a plant called Thlaspi goesingense hyperaccumulator, which is expressed in the vacuoles of these cells, which we subsequently successfully expressed on our S. cerevisiae cells. However, we thought that the capture of nickel ions by the yeast should be a gradual process, that is, first from the outside to the inside of the cell, and then from the cell environment into the vacuole. So we hope to find a gene that can transport nickel ions from outside the cell into the cell. We found a nickel-ion transporter called TjZNT1 on the ultra-nickel-resistant plant called Thlaspi japonicum, which is a ZIP family located on the cell membrane. According to the literature, this protein has been successfully expressed on S. cerevisiae cells and can achieve the purpose of transporting nickel ions. So, as of now, we have found two nickel ion transporters and want to express them in S. cerevisiae for nickel ion capture purposes. Due to limited time, we have not built the relevant mechanism, but hopefully next year we can build this system.

Living organisms built instructions in DNA and molecular machines to control its environment and keep the essentials processes working. Multicellular system can sometimes seem almost mind boggling.  Understanding how fundamental chemistry interacts with the madness of life is what drives his personal fascination with science.He got involved with iGEM through Kyle, one of the other advisers. “Kyle and I both play in the university brass band,” he says, “We were both in the pub after a concert when he ambushed me, the idea of looking at an interdisciplinary project seemed fascinating, I could hardly say no!”

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eucaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html," during hypoxia (low oxygen level). HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of a α- and a β-subunit. During normal oxygen conditions the α-subunit is hydroxylated by the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase. The hydroxylated α-subunit is a target for an ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitylation of the α-subunit leads to its degradation by the proteasome. During hypoxia the degradation of the α-subunit does not occur, since the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase uses oxygen as a cosubstrate. The active TF enhances expression of different genes as for instance genes associated with blood vessel formation.
pPARγ
pPARγ activation. During fatty diet, fatty acids are converted to prostaglandins by oxygenases, which activate pPARγ. Image published under GNU Free documentation license.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR γ) is a transcription factor belonging to the family of nuclear receptors. PPAR γ plays an important role in glucose metabolism and fatty acid storage. PPAR γ is basically activated by ligands like the prostaglandin PGJ2 and through dimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR) [14] . The activated heterodimer binds to the DNA consensus sequence AGGTCANAGGTCA resulting in an increased or decreased transcription of the appropriate gene. The genes activated by PPAR γ initiate the uptake of fatty acids and differentiation of cells to adipocytes. Besides its function in metabolism, PPAR γ was also shown to be correlated with several diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Activation of PPAR γ by synthetic PPAR γ ligands result in an increased glucose uptake. These syntethtic ligands are therefore promising agents in diabetes II treatment [15] .  Another synthetic ligand of PPAR γ is able to inhibit the proliferation of different cancer types [16] .

Interview Outreach
When scientific findings aim to be introduced into a real-world system they require the input and integration of thoughts from potential users. This fact led the Macquarie_Australia iGEM team to strive to gain the perspectives of rural Australian farmers, the primary target consumers of the hydrogen producing synthetic organism.
Students from the Macquarie iGEM team travelled to the Clyde River Region, 5 hours south of Sydney, NSW. The team visited remote regions along unmaintained dirt roads to discuss their research with independent rural farmers that work in a range of business environments, from berry and rooster farming, to environmentally sustainable eco-lodgings.
They had organised to discuss an array of topics surrounding synthetic biology, wanting to learn about:
The farmer’s knowledge of the field of synthetic biology.
Their feelings and opinions on such research and technology.
Whether they would be interested in implementing such a system.
The team moved away from the confines of the lab to better understand what our target audience knew about synthetic biology and to better understand out project from a community based perspective. The interviews with the farmers were recorded so that their questions and concerns relating to synthetic biology and the teams design concept could be addressed in a documentary style video. Overall the team wanted to gain ideas on the designed system and synthetic biology as a whole. This experience left the team with personal connections and innovative ideas that could never be developed in a lab alone.
Rural Screening
Representatives from team Macquarie returned to the Clyde River to host a rural, outdoor screening of our finalised outreach documentary. Our goal was to ensure that all of concerns and questions raised by the farmers were addressed in either the documentary or in the accompanying, detailed explanation of our final design concept of [The Living Battery]
The active engagement with the farmers and their resulting positive responses regarding synthetic biology was something that truly motivated Team Macquarie and taught us the real importance of science communication."

Introduction
The EnzChek® fluorescence-based cellulase substrate  was developed for simple and rapid quantitation of cellulase  (EC 3.2.1.4). The assay can be completed in 30 minutes or less—  simply mix the enzyme with the EnzChek® cellulase substrate  working solution, incubate, and read the results. In contrast to  other more complex, multistep assays, the EnzChek® cellulase  substrate is perfect for use in a high-throughput environment.  This fluorescence substrate is highly sensitive, with a detection  limit as low as 40 µU/mL cellulase. It is also possible to use this  substrate in a colorimetric assay, albeit with reduced sensitivity.
Materials
The EnzChek cellulase substrate is provided in a unit size  of 1 mg. A suitable stock concentration for this substrate is  1 mM. This can be prepared by adding 1.86 mL of 50% DMSO  directly to the vial of substrate. Sufficient material is supplied  for ~186 assays, based on a 100 µL assay volume in a 96-well  microplate format. The EnzChek® cellulase substrate can be  adapted for use in cuvettes or 384-well microplates.
Storage
Upon receipt, store the substrate at ≤–20ºC, desiccated, and  protected from light. Under these conditions the material should  be stable for at least 2 years. Substrate solution may be kept at  ≤–20ºC, however fluorescence background signal may increase  over time.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Assembly_-_-_TEXT.html," a hotspot region would appear higher than that of the main part of the mutated region.
To solve this problem we choose to create two different reporters, where the positions of the stop codons are separated at least 120 bp from each other.
The next concern was that there are positions inside proteins where the amino acids is remarkable important for the proteins function (e.g. amino acids     inside the catalytic center) or folding. We wanted to avoid these important positions, because at these positions only reversions back to the original amino     acid would reconstitute the protein. The catalytic center for both of our reporter proteins are known (Figure 7) and can be avoided. To avoid positions     responsible for folding of the proteins the impact of point mutation on the folding was modelled using FoldX . Each amino acid was in silico mutated to each other amino acid and the protein stability was calculated. The complete results for the positions 100 to 109 are depicted in Figure 6a, the impact of alanine replacement on every position was mapped on the    GFP crystal structure as an overview (Figure 6b). Striking is the importance of Gly104, where every change in amino acid greatly destabilizes the protein. Based on these modelling results (complete scan like Figure 6a) two positions for introduction of a stop codon were determined (Figure 7).    In addition, a stop position inside gfp already used in reversion experiments were used as well. (Wang et al. 2004)
Figure 6: Extensive in silico stability scan for GFP (A) and mapping of the stability changes for a complete in silico alanine scan (B). The stability changes for mutating each position inside GFP were calculated usign FoldX. The stability changes are calculated in ΔΔG (difference of mutant folding energy to wild type folding energy, low means more stable).      As overview the complete values for mutating to alanine were mapped on the GFP structure. (PDB: 2WUR)

Hobbies: read books, papers, write about general things that happened in life and that pass through my mind, play guitar, sing, play tennis, spend time with my family and messing around with friends and finally,  one of the most important things for me, be absorbed in my own thoughts.
iGEM expectations: This is a great step for doing something for the humanity. The entire world could change for good thanks to the synthetic biology. The power is in our hands, let`s do better things for the future.
Research interests: I am extremely interested in conducting research in order to contribute to the knowledge and development of humanity in the scientific field. Since I was a child, my passion has been to study animal behavior.  However, since I joined to study biology, the ecology and the environmental biology has been very important to me primarily because we are living a crucial moment for the world as global warming. Now I see more clearly that the synthetic biology is a good new increasing field to combat this and one good example is what we are doing in our proyect of rhamnolipids. I have many questions, there are now many aspects of biology that I like to investigate. I am looking for many answers. To go deeper and deeper into the wonderful world of the study of life, I reaffirm the maxim of Socrates, ""I only know that I know nothing"", and that gives me more thirsty of wanting to know.

Synthetic biology has come a long way already and the following step into the complex system engineering will be a big one. Yet, the next generation biosystems are still locked away by our insufficient knowledge regarding biological parts. First of all, the immense amount of parts we currently have are poorly characterized, especially the interactions between them. Moreover, artificial intelligence aided development of synthetic parts with novel functions is hindered by the lack of sequence to function relationship data.
By all means - characterization is not an easy task, as even a small protein has more possible sequence variants than there are atoms in the known universe. For this reason, the characterization speed is as important as measurement precision. The current state of the art characterization techniques - mainly based on microplates and microfluidics - do not have capabilities to effectively assess the sequence and activity relationships for a large number of biomolecules. And that is understandable, as those systems were built for direct evolution, providing a way to assess the activity and sequence of a few best variants.
Therefore, we believe there is a strong need for a step in a different direction - an approach that would enable the ultra-high throughput sequence and activity space exploration.
What is CAT-Seq?
CAT-Seq stands for Catalytic Activity Sequencing - a system designed and built for high-speed, simultaneous characterization of Catalytic and Regulatory biological parts. The best way to explain what CAT-Seq can do, is to show how it works.
A library of uncharacterized catalytic biomolecules is swiftly encapsulated into small water droplets together with Recording Module .
Inside of the droplet, the biomolecules are produced. Each droplet contains a unique biomolecule library member. Then, the Recording Module assesses the biomolecule’s catalytic activity and records that information into the DNA molecule which encoded that specific biomolecule.
The activity information recorded in each unique DNA molecule, together with its sequence, can be read using Nanopore Sequencing.
In this way"

3. Polymer production/binding
Bacteria has been widely used for the production of biomaterials to generate sustainable and eco friendly bricks, bioplastic products, items of clothing as well as “living materials” by incorporating nanoparticles into biofilms. With Barchitecture we can light-induce cellular 3D structural arrangements while producing, binding or degrading biomaterials such as PHA or silicates.
As shown in figure 8, PHA granules are produced through the expression of phaC1, phaA and phaB1 genes (BBa_K934001) .
The cells are also expressing a fusion protein of phasin (phaP1), a PHA binding protein, fused to HlyA C termini that will target the PHA granule for Type I secretion (encoded by HlyB and D) [2]. This results in PHA production, PHA binding by PhaP1-HlyA and its secretion outside the cell without lysing the cell. Therefore this results in constant PHA production and secretion in one step, which is more efficient and cost-effective than current microbial PHA production and extraction approaches.
Additionally, our Barchitecture cells present phaP1 on their surface, by fusing it to outer membrane proteins (Ice nucleation protein) in order to bind the PHA secreted by the PHA producing/secreting cells.
Figure 8. Proposed design for the production, secretion and binding of PHA granules. Cells express phaC1, phaA and phaB1 (BBa_K934001) for PHA granule production, PhaP1-HlyA, HlyB, HlyD for PHA granule binding and extracellular secretion, and INP-PhaP1 for granule binding on the cell surface.
Through a similar mechanism, bacteria, could be light-guided to form precise and intricate structures that can then simultaneously produce and bind biosilica. This approach will enable “growing” electronics just with the guidance of a particular wavelength of light. Our engineered cells would form the desired 3D structure using blue light. These cells would also express photocaged (inactive) recombinant silicate"

dcas9 - sgRNA Model
Figure 1: Schematic representation of the system
After the study of TALE system we moved on to the study of the model, which                     uses as repressor the complex dcas9-sgRNA, whose schematic representation                     is shown in Figure 1.
This system, consists of three subsystems.The main subsystem, is the one                     that replaces the system of TALE and has the same functionality. The only                     difference is that now the repressor consists of the complex dcas9-sgRNA                     and for that reason, instead of the transcription and translation of the                     repressor, we just have a binding of the two molecules. The other two                     subsystems which were studied are about the creation of those two                     molecules. The dcas subsystem works with extra repression for its                     production, which is controlled via Doxycycline.In contrast, the sgRNA                     subsystem operates by activation through Rhamnose-RhaS complex which is                     also adjustable.
For each one of those subsystems, we have studied separately their                     characteristics and the parameters which affects more the output of every                     subsystem. In order to achieve that, we used the knowledge that we gained                     from studying the TALE system. Along the way, we realized possible problems                     and gave solutions to them, which we then shared with Wet lab, so as to                     integrate them in system design.
dcas9 subsystem
We started by studying the dcas subsystem. The dcas is repressed by the                     tetR, because in large quantities can be toxic for the cell. Also, by                     adding doses of Doxycycline, which in turn creates complex with tetR, we                     managed to decrease the repression that happens in dcas to the desired                     level.
As shown in Figure 1, the dcas9 and the tetR are on a different plasmid                     than the rest of the system. This means, that the change in copy number                     that we examine does not affect the plasmids which are responsible for the                     production of the dcas9 and the tetR. After the completion of the modeling                     process, an analysis was held to consider other options that Wet lab                     proposed, regarding the different expression sites of dcas.
For the mathematical representation of the system, we took into                     consideration the following assumptions:
Inducer dynamic Doxycycline: We assume that as soon as                             Doxycycline                             is injected into the solution, is stabilised in a steady state"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," that we should model our MDA reaction first in order to know what length distribution of product we should expect and what effect the substrate nucleotide might have on DNA amplification.That was an important aspect to consider, because while exploring the literature we have found that even though phi29 does not incorporate many modified nucleotides, when it tries to do that it is inhibited and falls of. That might result in large number of short fragments, which is not ideal when using Nanopore Sequencing. Therefore, we have written a mathematical description of Phi29 DNA amplification which takes into account Phi29 inhibition by substrate nucleotide, in order to find maximum amount of Substrate Nucleotides we can use without worrying about short sequencing reads. To see the model, please click here .

Week 33
We have redesigned our prototype by adding the MDA reaction. The negative aspect of turning to MDA was the usage of dsDNA as a template, as we did not know whether the Rolling Circle Transcription (RCT)  would work, because all of the literature describes RCT only using circular ssDNA template. Gladly, we have later demonstrated that RCT works well with double stranded circular DNA molecules.
Week 34
Another issue we had with our first Prototype was the inefficiency of droplet merging. It is very important to merge all of the droplets containing the Product Nucleotides, as each droplet that is not merged is lost information about a specific mutant. At that time, our efficiency was lower then 1 merged droplet for every 20 to 30.
Week 35
To solve this huge issue we have met with Physicist and Microfluidic Technology expert Valdemaras Milkus from the Institute of biotechnology.
More
We have hoped to receive insight about how could we effectively solve that problem. Valdemaras has told us about how he approached similar problems. In his case it was precise-size droplet generation. He solved this problem by modelling and suggested for us to do the same. According to Valdemaras - even though the microfluidic models are extremely difficult to write, it is a lot harder to experimentally find the right parameters when there are multiple unknown variables. It might be like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Week 37
Following Valdemaras advice we have derived a full mathematical description of the active fusion of droplets inside of a microfluidic chip. Using this model we have solved multiple parameters which we then tested experimentally. The predicted parameters have successfully provided perfect droplet merging conditions which we have then continued using in the"

Results indicate no significant difference in growth between different cultures. Slightly lower curve for the nTra10-expressing clone, which is somewhat interesting, since a similar progress was seen in the canceled experiment from 14/10. At least one more experiment will be run next week, using new BL21 clones; this will show whether this is just a coincidence or not.

USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s participants were life sciences undergraduate students from 18 to 24 years old. We only did the survey with N = 9 for both groups, the limiting factor was Group 1. With the support of Psychology Prof. Marcelo, from University of São Paulo, who advised us to do a survey with open-ended questions to measure the ""word strength"" looking for the words incidence, we did a survey in which the participants had to read a phrase or a topic (question) and answer in 15 seconds the first words that came in mind. We got interesting data:
Analysis and results
In the analysis of the data obtained, the ""word strength"" was measured by the incidence  of word/term given as answer. Answer with a single occurrence in our data were disregarded, to avoid pollution of responses and to better provide the visualization and interpretation of generated graphs.
Insect-borne Disease
Comparison of word/term incidence in BioMech and Not BioMech players for the question: ""Insect-borne Disease""
It is possible to see the contrast between the two groups. Looking at the words/terms that are shared between both groups, Group 1 in most cases has higher incidents of those. In addition, Group 1 shows up a higher number of terms that are given as sharing answers among the participants of the group itself than Group 2. This last one is a phenomenon also present in all next questions.
Prevention and control of insect-borne disease
Comparison of word/term incidence in BioMech and Not BioMech players for the question: ""Prevention and control of insect-borne disease""
Here there are a balance between groups in relation to the incidence of those term that are shared between them (phenomenon present as well in the next question) and something interesting happened: Group 1 gave ""Paratransgenisis"" as an answer, which is the approach used on BioTROJAN to combat vector-borne diseases, that's an evidence showing that Group 1 was influenced in its answers.
Microorganisms and Bacteria
Comparison of word/term incidence in BioMech and Not BioMech players for the question: "" Microorganisms and Bacteria""
Transgenics: benefits and dangers
Comparison of word/term incidence in BioMech and Not BioMech players for the question: ""Transgenics: benefits and dangers""
In these two last questions there are two phenomenon already observed in previous questions: shared terms are balanced between groups and Group 1 presents more numbers of terms that are given as sharing answers among the participants of the group itself than Group 2.

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.
It’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d"

Took 266 out of incubator after 18 hours.  Made two glycerol stocks of 266 and miniprepped.  Eluted in 70 uL EB.
Concentration:
Discovered contamination in some bottles of media that we had, including one bottle of YPD that was used to make the yeast cultures from last night.  Indeed, the negative control (plain YPD with no innoculated cells) demonstrated growth.  As such, we were forced to throw away our overnight cultures and postpone doing the transformations we had planned.  Will try to do the transformations tomorrow.  We also found contamination in the double drop out media used to grow activator + reporter parts, which has dropouts for Met, Leu, and Ura. There was also a need to make plates for use to grow the successfully transformed yeast.  In particular, we need about 12 trp-, ura- plates and 12 leu-, ura- plates.
We began with 1L, to which we added 27.2614 g SD dropout mix, 2.0006 g histidine, and 2.0028 g methionine.  At this point we then realized that we had been following an incorrect recipe for adding amino acids; we were adding far too much.  For example, instead of 2 g histidine per liter, we only need 20 mg per liter.  We thus decided to finish up the mixture for plates by putting in the correct amount of amino acids from stock solutions (leucine for the trp-, ura- plates and tryptophan for the leu-, ura- plates).
We also decided to make 250 mL of leu-, ura- dropout mix with the correct amount of amino acids.  We ended up leaving methionine out of this mixture as well.
For future reference, we have the following stock solutions:
Leucine: 20 mg/mL, add 5 mL per liter

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#shadow#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," bind to the operator without the need to form a complex with CRP, hence transcription takes place even in the presence of glucose.
Recently, CCR has been shown to be released by performing two substitution mutations in the xylose operon regulatory protein (XylR) gene in E. coli, which creates a strain that is able to co-utilize xylose and glucose efficiently. This mutant, XylR*, has a higher affinity to its DNA binding site, and thus activates its promoter independently of the co-activator, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) (Figure 2c). As a result, expression of xylose metabolic and transport genes occurs even                   in the presence of glucose [5]!
Figure 3. The xylose-utilizing module.
This construct consists of the coding sequence of the mutant XylR* placed under the control of the lactose-inducible PT5 promoter. Hence, IPTG induction stimulates expression of XylR*.
This had huge implications for our project as converting waste into dyes is now viable. We thus constructed a plasmid which allows overexpression of XylR* upon induction by IPTG (Figure 3), and demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing xylose utilization in E. coli BL21* by conducting growth experiments.
We deviated from our initial plan of engineering a xylose-utilizing strain like what was accomplished in the study, it would be easier to transform this construct into our dye-producing bacteria, allowing xylose to serve as the feedstock. This also enables potential optimization of the expression levels of XylR* and balancing of metabolic flux, which may vary depending on the biosynthetic pathway or fermentation conditions.

Figure 4. The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.
The various subgroups of flavonoids such as flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins, catechins, etc. can all be synthesized from naringenin, the intermediate platform compound.
Along the targeted pathway, we took special interest in a key intermediate compound, naringenin. Naringenin, a flavanone, is extremely valuable due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anti-tumour properties [6]. More intriguingly, naringenin is also the intermediate platform compound for the biosynthesis of other flavonoids, many of which are potential candidates for textile dyes (Figure 4).
While commercial naringenin can be added as the substrate during the biomanufacturing process, we find it desirable to achieve de"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Localization_-_-_TEXT.html," one can quantifiy the amount of luminescence - and thus, proportionally, the amount of secreted luciferase - by measuring the conversion of luciferin into visible light and integrating it over a timespan of 5 s. Therefore, medium samples were taken every 12 h after transfection of cells and measured via the Promega NanoGlo® luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Figure 3: A) Schematic depiction of the genetic constructs used for signal peptide testing via a secretion luciferase assay. B) Results of the luciferase assay, showing luminescence in relative luminescence units (RLU) as a function of time for the previously described three different signal peptide constructs as well as a control construct containing no signal peptide. C) Detection of secreted luciferases in the medium via a Western Blot, using an anti-Strep-tag II antibody as well as an alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody for detection.
Discussion: The choice of signal peptide was nailed down
As would be expected, the EGFR signal peptide construct showed the lowest level of secretion. Although one might think this could also be attributed to a lower functionality of the signal peptide sequence itself after being translated, the lower secretion level is more likely to stem from lower translation initiation levels. Almost completely missing a 5’ UTR as well as a Kozak sequence, slower translation initiation (being a rate-limiting step) is likely to have lowered the level of translated protein in total. The constructs containing the Igκ and the BM40 signal peptide, on the other hand, contain a longer 5’ UTR as well as the Kozak consensus sequence, and thus result in higher secretion levels. Since the BM40 signal peptide hereby showed the highest secretion levels, it was thus incorporated into the receptor constructs.
Other receptor elements: stability and detection
Apart from the functional parts that mediate the (strept)avidin-biotin interaction, other elements in the receptor were designed to make sure it is optimally translocated to the membrane, as stable as possible, and easily detectable.
EGFR transmembrane domain
For anchoring in the membrane, we decided to use a type-I membrane protein, which has a single membrane span with defined localization of N- and C-terminus out- and inside of the cell, respectively. As the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has already been successfully used in the iGEM project of Freiburg 2008, we decided to base our project on the same"

OVERVIEW
The hardware components of this multidisciplinary project were designed and implemented using many engineering principles. After consulting various hydroponic farmers, researchers, and distributors, we were able to tailor our product to meet their specific needs (see Practices ). By using an iterative prototyping process, we modeled and tested our designs repeatedly and improved each time based our results. All the while, we aimed to develop an integrated system that can be easily utilized by our entire customer base.
Cornell iGEM’s OxyPonics system combines our biological components with a hardware implementation that ensures we use the full potential of our bacteria. Our system is composed of three major parts. The first part is our bacteria, which provides optical outputs based on the redox environment and produces antioxidants in response to light signaling. Next, our sensor, which reads those outputs and decides how to signal the bacteria to produce the right amount of antioxidants. Finally, we have created an online dashboard, giving users real time access and control over their farm’s oxidative stress environment. To see our final product, go to our Applied Design page.
DESIGN
The Product Development team utilized the IDEO design thinking process developed by the Stanford Design School. The process follows five steps: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test [1]. At the beginning of the design process, we first discussed the various options to consider such as what materials to use, how the bacteria would be incorporated into the hardware, and how this product can impact the world.  We participated in a hardware accelerator program at Rev: Ithaca Startup Works and ultimately built our project in three phases: feasibility, proof-of-concept, and prototyping.  After months of brainstorming, we decided to make a compact sensor unit utilizing our Wetlab’s engineered redox sensitive proteins to detect the amount of oxidative stress in the environment.  Studies show that providing the right"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Selection#BindingControl_-_-_TEXT.html," leads to an expression of the normally weakly expressed RFP gene.   If the cI protein would bind at the binding site between the GFP gene and the optimized lacZ promoter ( BBa_K2082210 ), it is possible that the polymerase has to stop the expression due to steric inhibition. Therefore, the relation of RFP to GFP expression could give a clue if cI is binding in vivo.   To analyze this hypothesis the GFP and RFP expression are measured from a liquid culture of two E. coli cultures carrying different plasmids. The first culture was transformed with the GFP coupled part BBa_K2082211 and the second with the GFP coupled part BBa_K2082231 .    The main difference of these two parts is the ability of BBa_K2082231 of producing the SH2-cI fusion protein.
A first measurement was performed in the Infinite M200 plate reader ( Tecan ). The culture without producing the cI protein shows a bit higher RFP intensity (figure 3). Integrating the error bars in the analysis, it is not possible to say if their is a real difference between the two constructs designed for this experiment.
Figure 3: Tecan results. In the Tecan plate reader the RFP intensity was measured. The E. coli cultures with (red) and without (black) producing the cI repressor were analyzed. Error bars are implemented.
Therefore, a second measurement was conducted in the FACS (fluorescence-activated cell scanning) for direct measurement of single cell events and verification of the results given by the TECAN. At first, the GFP expression of the two designed constructs was compared with the native reporter BBa_K2082211 .   In total, 50,000 cells were measured in the FACS system, which revealed a much higher GFP intensity produced by the GFP gene carrying cells (figure 4A). This supports the supposition, that GFP was correctly cloned upstream of the reporter sequences. A comparison of the RFP intensity of the reporter without the GFP gene with the modified version exhibits an about 85% stronger RFP production in the cells with the GFP gene   and the reporter (figure 4B). The RFP expression increases with the read over of the RNA polymerase, after docking at the constitutive Anderson promoter region upstream of the GFP gene.
A comparison of the cI-SH2 and GFP producing cells with the cells only producing GFP also demonstrated differences in the RFP intensity (fugure 4C). The cells with cI-SH2 proteins had an about 35% lower"

SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour34_-_-_TEXT.html," a wearable facial screen are provided in the room. Also, it is emphasized not to leave the UV board on longer than necessary.
According to Simon Rose, the lab safety committee representative, there should be no significant risk to the researchers when good laboratory practice and the lab’s safety protocol was followed. All organisms we worked with are non-pathogenic, which further added to the safety of the researchers.
Public safety and the environment
With regards to public and environmental safety, our project is only for “contained use”. We are planning on containing our modified bacteria in a closed environment in order to harvest the produced rubber, and all waste from the lab is either autoclaved or inactivated with iodoform. Therefore any public and environmental safety issues would arise from accidents, where the bacteria are released in nature. Good laboratory conduct ought to minimize this risk. However, should our bacteria be released into nature by the incautious or unscrupulous the implications must be considered.
A small, but potential danger to the public from our project is the possible outlet of antibiotics which could result in some pathogenic bacteria becoming resistant. We have minimized the range of antibiotics used in our project to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and ampicillin. Combined with the fact that the strains of E. coli we used carry no other antibiotics resistance, the risk of them surviving in nature and passing on the plasmid is increasingly small. If the bacteria would survive in nature, the most likely case is that the plasmid containing dxs will be lost, since these genes slow down growth and become redundant in a chloramphenicol free environment. Similarly, in a kanamycin free environment, the plasmid containing the prenyltransferase would likely be lost. Otherwise bacteria will conceivably die from poisoning by rubber before sharing any DNA, as we assume that the produced rubber in the bacterial cytoplasm will interrupt it’s natural functions. If the bacteria were to survive in nature containing the plasmid, it would most likely be outcompeted by the naturally occurring and better adapted E. coli strains.
Should a large amount of bacteria be released, the odds of the above mentioned scenarios happening obviously increases, but only fractionally. Another concern with a large-scale release is the possible amount of rubber waste. When a rubber tree dies and the rubber leaks out, plants can still occupy the area; it is possible that this is by plants specialized to live in areas with regular rubber leaks. We cannot know if plants in others area can survive when rubber particles are present, and hence whether this could damage a local environment.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," human OATP transporter out of all yeast transporters. Transporters from all other common S. cerevisiae strains differ significantly from these.
It has been confirmed that the QDR2 transporter from VL3 can import microcystin (Valério et al., 2014). We reasoned that by replacing the original QDR2 transporter of a S. cerevisiae lab strain (W303a/SS238) with the VL3 variant of the QDR2 transporter we could enable toxin import in a new strain. The reason for not wanting to work with VL3 was that it’s used and optimized for wine production, not for extensive gene engineering. Another reason for not choosing to engineer VL3 was that we would have had to do auxotrophic mutations for it first as such kind of this strain was not available. However, we planned to use VL3 as a positive control in our experiments to compare how changing the transporter of a lab strain effects observed toxicity effects. This way, we hope to see whether toxicity behaviour corresponding to VL3 can be observed.
Final Product
For the final product, we will need to have both the VL3 transporter and the stress promoter in yeast cells.  The colour of two lake water samples, one supplemented with a defined quantity of engineered S. cerevisiae cells and one with unmodified yeast, can then be compared, and the toxin concentration can be calculated easily from a standard curve utilizing known toxin concentrations.
In the final product, we would have a test device containing the measurement and control yeasts. The user could add a small amount of sample water to be measured and analyse it with a mobile app that tells about the toxicity based on the colour difference between the sample and the control. The idea is explained shortly in figure 4.
Figure 4. Simplified detection principle.
Design
Promoters
We chose three whose transcription is regulated greatly by oxidative stress or which promoters are well characterized. These genes were TSA1 (Saccharomyces genome database ID: S000004490), CTT1 (SGD ID: S000003320) and CCP1 (SGD ID: S000001774). We decided to incorporate the promoters of these genes directly into our stress promoter constructs. Binding sites for transcription factors of our interest are identified the region of 1-300 bp before the start codon, but the length of the whole promoter area has not been defined. As promoter areas can be up to 1000 bp long, we decided to use upstream sequences longer than 300 bp. For TSA1 we decided take promoter region of 260 base pairs,"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,", the printer is able to communicate with our syringe pump by making minor changes to the firmware , which can be downloaded and easily installed. This is explained in the software tab . This way, you can use Cura, which is a software to convert 3D models into the printer's language (the so called G-code), to tell the printer to print any geometry made of bioink directly into an ibidi slide. This dish is held in place by a retainer that replaces the glass on the Ultimaker's build plate.
A graphic of what an assembled bioprinter looks like.
Component description
In the following paragraphs the basic function and interaction of the single components will be explained.
Syringe pump
The syringe pump is the main part of our printer extension. Its purpose is to deliver a precise and constant volume flow of liquid according to the printer's information.
Exploded view of our syringe pump.
baseplate: The Baseplate is the main part of the syringe pump. This 3D printed part is designed to retain all the other components and withstand the mechanical loads. The syringe is to be mounted with the help of a bayonet system that lets you lock it with a simple 35° turn.
stepper motor: The stepper motor supplies the torque needed to move the syringe. The difference to the DC motor, which is the best known kind of electrical motor, is that the configuration of the coils inside divides the motor's rotation into steps. Most motor controllers are capable of microstepping, i.e. the motor only moves a fraction of a step at a time. Commonly used is one sixtienth of a step. Since our stepper motor is divided into 200 steps, and we use one sixtienth microstepping, it allows us to move the motor as precisely as 0.1125° while providing a smooth running behavior, which is crucial for our print result.
connector: The connector's job is the force transmission from the motor to the spindle. It is 3D printed.
trapezoidal threaded spindle: With the help of the spindle, the rotation of the motor is converted to a translational movement. The standardized designation 'TR8x1.5' contains the diameter of the spindle (8mm) and its lead (1.5mm). A lead of 1.5 mm means that the spindle converts a rotation of 360° to 1.5 mm of translation. We used the smallest lead we could find, for it determines the accuracy of the pump even further. With the current setup,"

The result shows that the colour has changed besides plasmid with lipase (Figure 11), showing that LipB2 gene is correctly expressed in BL21 E. coli.
         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))

Introduction
       Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide, with an estimated global incidence of 470,000 new cases and approximately 233,000 deaths per year. Then, we try to make an idea to build a new prototype for early detection to cervical cancer, especially caused by HPV 18 and HPV 16. From the previous results of the two teams, Calgary Team 2013 and Freiburg Team 2012, we build a new prototype with some combination from those teams. We learn about the prototype sensor from Calgary Team 2012 that consist of detector, linker, and reporter that combined into one small test pack. Then, to make the detector, we learn from Freiburg Team 2012 to constructing a new specific TALEs that can bind to our target sequences and we called it TALE 1 and TALE 2.

Background
TALEs or Transcription Activator-Like Effectors comes from natural bacterial effector proteins used by Xanthomonas sp. to modulate gene transcription in host plants to facilitate bacterial colonization (Boch J and Bogdanove, 2010).The central region of the protein contains tandem repeats of 34 amino acids sequences (termed monomers) that are required for DNA recognition and binding (Kay, 2009).                      Here is the natural structure of TALE from Xanthomonas sp. :

WHAT DID WE DO?
As explained before in the Background, we try to make a prototype based on the concept of Calgary Team 2013 . So we construct a new TALEs that can bind with our target sequences, especially in HPV 18 and HPV 16. For building the detector, we received help from Freiburg Team 2012 to construct two new TALEs. First, we search the target sequences with the alignment of whole genome of HPV 18 and HPV 16 via NCBI and MEGA5. We search two target sequences in left side and right side. Here are some works that we’ve done:
