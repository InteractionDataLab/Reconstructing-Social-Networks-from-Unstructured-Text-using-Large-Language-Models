Currently, the scientific community manages synthetic biology, but some applications, provided to generate significant revenues, might be developed despite the nuisance they cause. Therefore, as stated by Lluis Mir, ""it remains the vision of science and society, and not markets."" It is also important that involved researchers retain their critical thinking and continue to communicate the progress of their knowledge even if they work in an industrial or commercial context.

Intellectual properties
Thinking about the intellectual property of our project. We wanted that our treatment could be available at the lowest price. In this context, we asked about the open source development or patenting at least a part? The first option would allow any company to develop and improve it, but a private company could then patent a more rounded version of it, and impose prices that benefit the most. Furthermore, Willy Rozenbaum confirmed us that the clinical development would be very difficult to finance, ""if you can convince a manufacturer to begin the preclinical tests, you will already have protected your model because otherwise you will not find manufacturers to develop it. "" This last point would be less problematic with the second option as the funds generated by a patent would help persuading manufacturers, but access to data would be much more limited.

Bioterrorists drifts
The loss of control of living systems syntheticaly created could be intentional. The synthetic biology and the diffusion of knowledge that it puts at disposal of a large public of genomes, notably pathogenes can be modified at low cost. In the case of our DVS project,some changes could transform our vector in biologic weapon like mentionned François le Fèvre: « we can imagine that instead of target a cancer, we target neurons to send drogues that permit to weaken someone ». From 2003, a CIA report mentionned risks linked to live science development and the difficulty to limit the bioterrorism developement. It is necessary to limit access to data at the risk of slowing down progress of the knowledge in synthetic biology.

Problematics related to the DVS project
One of the objective of this meeting was to discuss some issues related to our project DVS. The general points have been mentioned above, since these point apply to the whole synthetic biology. Specifically, we examined relative risks underlying the introduction of potentially pathogenic agents in the organism.
Let’s begin with the importance of this risk. Mycobacterium avium is sometimes responsible for serious infections in humans. But, as noted by Willy Rozenbaum, ""it is a bacterium that"

Summer event:
As the host, we sucessfully held the iGEM 2010 China Meetup . Please refer to that page for details.
Collaboration with team ECUST-Shanghai :
On May 19, four of our team members set out to have a collaboration event with the freshman team ECUST-Shanghai. We exchanged ideas and plans, and had a good time making friends with each other.
In July, ECUST team have met problems with their experiments. We helped them debugging their design, and eventually found the problem lying in the quorum sensing system. The QS signal sending and receiving parts they used were of poor quality, including LuxR, LuxI, CinR, CinI, rhlI, rhlR, and several reporters. We again helped them by offering them our own LuxR and LuxI parts. This solved a big problem for ECUST-Shanghai , although they may probably not come to the Jamboree. (what a pity!)

Human Practice
Introduction
Back to top ↑
As our project this year aims to develop a new therapy, we think public recognition and acceptance is an important part. So we designed a questionnaire and conducted a survey to get an overview of opinions on our new OA therapy. Here are some photos we took during one session of our whole survey.
Note:
The survey was carried out in undergraduate students in biology-related majors, as we thought understanding the whole project may require some background knowledge. We could have conducted similar surveys among common people (regardless of age, education, profession, etc.) if only we had more time.
The original survey was conducted in Chinese for participants’ convenience and accuracy of results. The questionnaire is translated into English and you can download it here .

Saturday
Better results than usual! Apparently we had a colony on mMutY. We still need to get it sequenced, but maybe this one could work? Keeping our fingers crossed. We also miniprepped a bunch of mMutY samples.
Week 12 9/1 - 9/5
Monday--Labor Day
Rikki was the only one who came in on a Federal Holiday. She ran colony PCR on Promoter+TyrR construct (but expected it not to work since for some reason it never amplifies the promoter well--she was right, you couldn’t see a band). She also made overnight cultures of the promoter+TyrR but only made two because she could not find more culture tubes.
Tueday
Miniprepped the two overnight cultures of Promoter+TyrR. We ran out of Promega buffers so we tried invitrogen, but the yields were too poor on one so only one sample was submitted. Guess this was a good thing because--spoiler--the results were negative. We also tried ethanol precipitation for miniprep yields which were too low to submit for sequencing and discovered experimentally that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. In addition to submitting Promoter+TyrR for sequencing, we also submitted mutagenized MutY and DnaE. DinB, MutD, MutL, UmuC, and IPTG+GFP were digested and the mutators were ligated to IPTG+GFP, this time as an overnight ligation at 4C (Promaga t4 DNA ligase calls for overnights to be done at 4C rather than 16C). We tried site-directed mutagenisis on ParC, MutS, MutY, and DnaE using turbo. Overnight cultures were made of the melanin plasmid, as well as IGDM and IGER (for rif assay).
Wednesday
Transformed ligation products of IPTG+GFP+ DinB, MutD, MutL, UmuC. Assuming failure for Quickchange, trying again but using Turbo, Turbo hot start, Phusion hot start, Q5, and Q5 hot start polymerases side-by-side. Hopefully one will work this time :/ Promoter+TyrR sequencing came back negative today, so 12 overnight cultures were made (since colony PCR"

Sanger sequencing results from these plaques showed a high number of different mutations in the 16 picked plaques. Thereby, the number of mutations resulting as a consequence of MP4 usage was slightly higher than the number of mutations in phages cultivated with the MP1 strain. In total, the mutations were widely spread over the N-terminal domain of the RNAP. Certainly, one mutation was recurrent, even the fact that there were no selection pressure. Overall, 15 of 22 mutations acquired during this three day PACE run entailed an amino acid exchange in the domain, while one mutation which occured in four clones resulted in no amino acid exchange.
Figue 13: Random mutations in N-terminal domain of T7 RNAP
The figure is presenting the nucleotide sequence of the N-terminal domain of the T7 RNAP in light grey, a linker sequence in black and the leucine zipper in dark grey

. At the top of the figure a consensus like sequence is shown, summarizing all mutations of the sequenced plaques, which are displayed as single bars under the summary. All mutations annotated are color coded. Recurrent mutations are divided into mutations leading to an amino acid exchange (red) and the mutations which do not have an amino acid exchange as a consequence (orange). In addition, mutations with amino acid exchanges, which are not recurrent are displayed in yellow, while the mutations without amino acid exchange are shown in blue. In total, only plaques showing mutations are shown. Sequences which did not contain mutations were omitted due to clarity reasons. Overall, sequencing was performed on 24 plaques.
By this, we demonstrated that the we can induce the mutagenesis plasmids successfully and sufficient manner. The evaluated conditions, hypothesized by our modeling, confirmed by our sequencing results from the real experiment should finally describe conditions in which a good induction of the MPs should be ensured.
PI-PACE
Coming to our final experiment we finally had the knowledge which is required to perform our own PACE run. This PACE run is just like Dickinson´s PACE approach based on protein-interaction of a split T7 RNAP. In contrast to the run before, both split sites are located on the selection phage. In principle, the split T7 RNAP is evolved on a better and faster reassembly of both fragments, yielding in a higher transcription of geneIII which is encoded under control of a T7 promotor. For further information on the principle of protein-interaction PACE, please visit our special site (h"

Interview with Dr Andrew Griffiths - Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity lead for Biosciences at the University of Exeter:
On 24/08/16 we met with Dr Andrew Griffiths to talk about his role as the current Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity lead for Biosciences at the University and what he thinks could be done to improve these areas within the department. By talking to the point of contact to staff about these issues, we can understand what sort of recurring issues are brought up, and what the university is doing to address these issues.
What I am really passionate about is trying to make sure there is greater equality in terms of diversity across the board, in terms of race and sexuality and making sure the working practices are as flexible as possible.
We asked Dr Griffiths what we could do to encourage greater diversity in science and he responded by saying that it’s less about encouraging a greater recruitment drive for people in terms of sexuality or religion, but more about ensuring there is flexibility and understanding of the pressures and unique difficulties associated. To encourage more people to be openly expressive about their identity we need to make sure “all the people in the workplace feel respected”.
Because of this, we realised that we can’t approach the apparent lack of diversity in STEM in the same way as we might with gender inequality in science. Whilst there are specific problems with encouraging more females to take physics at A level and take physics degrees, the issue of diversity is more complex.
We have a high proportion of women in the undergraduate biology programmes to men, the critical point is after the undergraduate degree, after the post doctorate training.
This statement is concurrent with the observations made by the students in the video highlighting initial observations of sexism in science. Dr Griffiths went on to infer that a leading factor for this might be related to women wanting to have a family at this stage.
From our own personal experience, in Britain it is almost always encouraged for women to take maternity leave and seen as strange for the male parent to take equivalent time. According to Gov.uk,
employees can choose to take either 1 week or 2 consecutive weeks’ paternity leave
however the statutory maternity leave is
52 weeks
- just by observation, this is clearly unequal. Comparing this to Sweden, parents are given 480 days paternity leave, where parents are encouraged to share this between them. Recent legislation has changed this so that shared parental leave is an option, according to Gov.uk parents can
take the rest of the 52 weeks of maternity"

Figure 13. Rapid Sequencing from ONT: molecular principle of library preparation (gDNA refers to genomic DNA) (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 2018).
Our approach uses the same fragmentation principle, but instead of a random transposition, we target this event to specific DNA sequences by our fusion protein. We designed adapters to be compatible with ONT fragmentation procedure figure 13, with the addition of the specific Mosaic End (ME) sequence that Tn5 needs to load and later integrate. The sequences of these adapters are depicted in figure 14.
Figure 14. Adapter DNA used for the integration by Tn5 for targeted sequencing with ONT Rapid sequencing.
The 3’ end of the forward strand has an adenine overhang that will anneal to the second sequencing adapters that carry motor protein. We ordered two types of adapters, with the difference of a phosphate group on the 5’ end of the reverse strand.     The two specified adapters were ordered as forward and reverse primers and tested for integration to intronless EPO cDNA, directed by sgRNA 001 .
4.2 sgRNA Array Determination for Gene Doping Sequences
Aim: Generate a computational model that will output sgRNA sequences required by dxCas9 to target gene doping sequences.
Approach: The design of sgRNAs for the detection of gene doping will guide the integration of adapter sequences to only possible gene doping sequences. The sgRNAs are designed to target sequences near the junctions between exons (not present in natural genes). For this, we developed a model that screens through an entire genetic coding sequence (potential gene used for enhancement) and identifies all possible sgRNA molecules at specific exon-exon junctions.
The possibility of modifying the DNA sequence used for gene doping with synonymous mutations is an immediate threat to our detection method. For this reason, this model screens through all the possible synonymous modifications identified close to PAM sequences near exon-exon junctions, and will only generate sgRNAs for the smallest variation site, thus covering all possibilities with the least number of sgRNAs.
The detailed information about this module can be found on our modeling page .
4.3 Barcode DNA for Nanopore Sequencing
Aim: Develop a system to generate DNA barcodes within sequencing adapters for the identification of sample’s subject.
Approach: Minimizing sequencing time and costs is accomplished by implementing our targeted sequencing approach. During our interaction with stakeholders, Prof. Hagan Bayley from Oxford University (one of the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies"

Introduction
To make the analysis of experimental result is convincible, we also made the simulation using the Finite Element Method(FEM) to define that the field in microfluidic channel confirmed to our expectation.
FEM is a method for modeling and simulating physics-based problems. It divides a large problem into smaller elements, these smaller elements will be solved separately and then be assembled backed to the original model. A collection of smaller elements is called a “mesh”, the “mesh” is constructed by numerous elements, the smaller the size of the element is, the finer the “mesh” is, and the more accurate will the result be.
We made the simulation with the following procedures, and the result of maximum velocity and shear force applied on the bottom wall match with the mathematics perfectly.
Procedure
a. Geometry
First we imported the designed CAD pattern file.
Then we draw two circles which have the diameter equal to the inner diameter of the fluid pipes that we used (0.65mm). The circles were placed around the center of the two circles we reserved for the fluid pipes. Since we used our bear hands to control the position of the holes for the fluid pipes in chip fabrication, the circles were just placed around the center parts like real cases.
Then we extruded the pattern to 90μm, and deleted the undesired parts. The final geometry was shown below.

b.Parameters
All geometry domains were applied with the build-in material ""water"" to represent the petro medium that we used in our experiment.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the shady forest underbrush, on top of a wax-covered leaf there is a minuscule water droplet. Measuring no more that 0.1 nL in size, it has carried with it a few nutrients and a few bacterial cells happen to grow inside it, let’s say 10. Even though the bacterial density is not very high, the limited space could “fill up” with the AHL produced by only a handful of bacteria. In that case, the Lux operon wouldn’t be triggered by the bacterial density per se, but by the restrictive diffusive environment -- thus giving merit to such a term as “Diffusive sensing” [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. These alternate hypotheses provide extra reasons to explore the system through simulation. Our modelling starts with a closer look on previous work. We reimplement the deterministic model described in [ 1 ] and play with different parameters and with adding extensions such as diffusive losses and growth models [ 2 ] to get a better grasp of the phenomenon. This model describes continuous liquid cultures, where the bacteria are kept in a constant exponential growth phase by continuous dilution of the culture medium. Arguably these conditions, amenable though they may be to experimental validation, do not reflect the natural conditions in the colon nor the conditions our experiment entails. The most significant deviations arise from two facts of the natural environment we want to simulate: the microbial community originates from a small initial population colonizing a new environment (thus requiring a custom growth model) and instead of developing in the full volume of a liquid medium, it colonizes the solid, permeable surface of the colon epithelium (thus requiring the simulation of diffusion). This model therefore comprises 3 parts:
1. A​ ​network​ ​of​ ​chemical​ ​reactions​ ​in​ ​fixed-volume​,​​ ​well-stirred​ ​conditions​ ​that​ ​model​ ​the​ ​production​ ​and​ ​consumption​ ​of​ ​AHL​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​the​ ​systems regulatory​ ​elements.
2. A​ ​custom​ ​growth​ ​model​ ​that​ ​evolves​ ​an​ ​initial​ ​inoculation​ ​to​ ​the​ ​environment's​ ​assumed​ ​carrying​ ​capacity.
3. A​ ​diffusive​ ​model​ ​for​ ​the​ ​evolution​ ​of​ ​AHL​ ​spatial​ ​distribution.

For more detail, you can check other parts of our wiki). To normalize the efficiency of all the elements in our system, we utilize relative expression units (REUs)【1】, and the activities are normalized by the intensity of a GFP whose expression is controlled by a constitutive promoter. In detail, for different promoters, direct comparison is enough. For ribozymes and siRNAs which execute the cleavage of mRNA, we just need to do some simple calculation to get the efficiency. For the recombinant enzyme Cre, although it’s function is more complicated than the other functional elements, few steps of calculation and analysis are sufficient. For the efficiency of induction, we can introduce a concentration gradient in the cell culture to find the best condition.

Safety
This year, we Fudan iGEM team worked on a project strongly associated with regenerative medicine and cell therapy.
As is known to all, not before long when people get physiological damage, the only way to cure the damage and save the life is to expect a healthy organ donated by people who would like to offer it. However, studies shows that human body generate immunological rejection when exotic tissue or organ is transplanted. In addition, it is unpractical to cure neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson disease by cerebral transplantation. Developments in Regenerative Medicine are expected.
Each and every one of live plant cells is of totipotency, while most mammalian cells are even of no self-renewing ability. However, a kind of cell named ”stem cell” is of differentiation and division ability, which exists in mammalian organism almost everywhere. Stem cells not only help the organism get new fresh blood, but also save the tissue or organ when they are broken. What’s more, every organism comes from one stem cell—the most totipotent stem cell named oosperm. Stem cells are so important for they all have so much potential to both protect and develop the organism, as a result of which makes stem cells themselves be considered as a kind of therapy for regenerative medicine. 
Before 2006, scientists can only get mammalian cells of totipotency by obtaining the stem cells in the embryonic period during which stem cells"

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-esp_-_-_TEXT.html,"In this test, we encountered a well-known issue with the negative control - even the cell lysates of untransformed cells (or the lysis buffer itself) seem to be disrupting the biofilm to a certain degree, an effect that correlated strongly with the volume of lysate added. The reduction in absorbance after adding EB cell lysates corresponds to the reduction observed by adding the lysates of untransformed cells, indicating little contribution by EB. For P. aeruginosa, however, the biofilm dispersal seemed to occur even for smaller volumes of EB, hinting that EB might be more effective on Pseudomonas rather than Staphylococci. This conclusion, however, can of course not be drawn after a single experiment.
Figure 17. Absorbance at 595 nm after incubation of established S. aureus biofilm with cell lysates.
Figure 18. Absorbance at 595 nm after incubation of established P. aeruginosa biofilm with cell lysates.
When repeating the experiment, we were aiming to introduce the same changes mentioned in the “Biofilm Inhibition” section; avoid using the outer wells which tend to try out, test whole cell lysates instead of soluble and insoluble fractions and also reduce the incubation time.
Biofilm Dispersal, Second Attempt [✔️]
After adapting our protocol to reflect the changes mentioned above, we were able to gather clearer data for the dispersal of both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms. Both experiments showed very similar results with a clear decrease in absorbance after treatment with the EB samples, correlating well with the volume of sample added. Additionally, the differences were highly significant for both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa when 50 μl of sample were added.
Figure 19. Absorbance at 595 nm after incubation of established S. aureus biofilm with cell lysates. A significant difference could be observed between the 50 μl EB samples and the 50μl negative control with a p-value of 5.37225E-08, indicated by the asterisks.

In order to achieve different goals, we design different Donor Plasmids, different Donor Plasmids contain different number of Insertion Fragments, which belong to different groups.
PLEASE refer to ‘DP construction’ to learn about the details of Donor Plasmid and Insertion Fragments and the strategies employed in our design.
As we all know, antibody diversity mainly lean on the number of the fragments used for recombination. Therefore, in order to mimic the antibody generation process, we need to construct Donor Plasmid which contains large sum of Insertion Fragments. Theoretically, we can construct Donor Plasmid of this kind. However, due to the time limit of the competition, we didn’t try to construct DP containing many Insertion Fragments.
In spite of this, in order to meet the needs, we designed two methods to construct plasmids on a large scale and attempted the usage in parts of our Donor Plasmids.
PLEASE refer to 'DP construction and Strategies' for the methods of rapid plasmid construction.
Besides, we have applied for two BBFRFC, which are BBFRFC61 and BBF RFC 62 respectively.
Then, after transformation of the prepared ‘recepient strain’ with Donor Plasmid and the induction of corresponding agents, I-scel enzyme cuts out DNA fragments from DP and LP, generating numerous Insertion Fragments. Besides, antibiotic resistance gene integrated into E coli genome is also cut out, providing recombination sites for Insertion Fragments.
Provided with Insertion Fragments mentioned above and Lamda-Red expressed by Donor Plasmid, Insertion Fragments recombine with the corresponding landing pad sequence in the genome and thus get inserted into the correct site of the genome. Based on our design of Landing pad, we can ensure that only one Insertion Fragment from one group is randomly inserted into the genome, therefore mimicking the VDJ recombination process.
PLEASE refer to ‘DP Insertion and Recombination Induction’ to learn more about this part.
Engineered E coli cells which have undergone successful recombination can be selected out of the pool through specific screening methods. After tests on different strains, our project achieve a recombination rate above 50% based on our current techniques.
PLEASE refer to ‘Result’ to learn more about the identification of recombination rate.
Module 2
The goal of the second module in our project is aimed at selection of specific antibodies. Due to the maturity of existing antibody screening technique, our work mainly focuses on imitation"

The dynamics model constructed for 'Population Control System'
Motivation
   Our team constructed a genetic circuit with population control functions (Fig. 1).  When these Mosquito Intelligent Terminator (MIT or Terminator) are released into the environment, the Terminator population is self-maintained, thus a surplus will never exist. To quantify the population control system, a dynamic model was used to simulate the bacterial population and the protein concentration changes that would occur once these Terminators are released into the environment.  This simulation enables us to analyze system behavior and ultimately determine which experimental parameters should be adjusted to optimize system performance.
Top
Modeling and simulations
  Population control system consists of three genes: LacI, LuxR, and ccdB. The initial population size of Terminator is the input to the system. The concentrations of LacI, LuxR, and ccdB proteins and bacterial population are the outputs.
This system can be modeled by differential equations as follows.
Alpha-C, D and bac are production rates of the corresponding targets, which are assumed to be given constants. Gamma-LuxR, gamma-ccdB, gamma-AHL and gamma-bac are decay rates of the corresponding targets. For an activator AHL/LuxR complex, Hill function is an S-shaped curve which can be described in the form x^n / (K +x^n). K is the activation coefficient and n determines the steepness of the input function (Alon, 2007). The k2 is the production rate of AHL that synthesized by the LuxI protein."
Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Calculation_-_-_TEXT.html,"ematical background on principal component analysis
The mathematical technique used in PCA is called eigen analysis: we solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square symmetric matrix with sums of squares and cross products. The eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue has the same direction as the first principal component. The eigenvector associated with the second largest eigenvalue determines the direction of the second principal component. The sum of the eigenvalues equals the trace of the square matrix and the maximum number of eigenvectors equals the number of rows (or columns) of this matrix.
Algorithms
If our starting point happens to be a symmetric matrix like the covariance matrix, we solve for the eigenvalue and eigenvectors by first performing a Householder reduction to tridiagonal form, followed by the QL algorithm with implicit shifts.
If, conversely, our starting point is the data matrix A, we do not have to form explicitly the matrix with sums of squares and cross products, A′A. Instead, we proceed by a numerically more stable method, and form the singular value decomposition of A, U Σ V′. The matrix V then contains the eigenvectors, and the squared diagonal elements of Σ contain the eigenvalues.

12-mer Expression, cont.
The two start up cultures are taken from the shaking incubator and the OD checks are 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. The start-up culture with the higher OD is poured into a L of LB with 1mL of Chloramphenicol. The contents are put into a shaking incubator at 37 degrees Celsius and left to incubate for 3hours. A 1mL sample is taken from the flask, and IPTG is added to a final concentration of 0.5mM. After IPTG addition, a 1mL sample of culture is taken every hour after IPTG addition for 4 hours total. The samples will be used in an SDS PAGE to check for verification of over expression of the 12-mer proteins. The contents are then left to incubate overnight for approximately 17 hours.
Observations
Before IPTG addition, a 1mL sample of culture is extracted form the flask and pipetted into a 1.5mL micro centrifuge tube.  The contents are spun with a balance at 3000 rpm for a minute. However, no visible cell pellet appeared at the bottom of the tube. Only LB supernatant was observed. This happened again when a 1mL sample of culture was taken 1 hour after IPTG addition. 2 hours after IPTG addition, a 1mL sample was spun down and a small pellet appeared at the bottom. Two cell pellets were successfully recovered 3 and 4 hours after IPTG addition. When taking the OD after IPTG had been induced into the cells for 4 hours, the OD value was 0.2, significantly lower than expected when compared to previous 9-mer expression. This might have been because IPTG was added 3 hours after initial incubation whereas IPTG was added "

      The results show that the density of blue color is associated with the concentration of the arsenic solution.
3. Experimental Design: Specificity of LacZ α biosensor
     This experiment was to test whether LacZ α biosensor was sensitive to copper and lead ions. We compare the blue color in three types of 10 ppm solution. Table 9 shows the experimental design for detecting arsenic ion and                         the result shows in Figure 14.
Table 9: The experimental design for detecting arsenic ion.
Figure 14: The pictures show LacZ α biosensor is not responsive to copper ions and lead ions.
      The results of our experiment show that the LacZ α biosensor can grow normally in the arsenic solution of different concentration. This LacZ α biosensor detects arsenic ion in arsenic solution and with good quality of specificity.                         In a word, this LacZ α biosensor can be an effective fast screening instrument for detecting the arsenic pollution.

4. Products were removed from the thermocycler and stored at -20C until they were needed.
Gel Electrophoresis
Purpose: Gel Electrophoresis is a laboratory technique that can be used to separate DNA fragments of different lengths. This is done by applying an electric field to DNA fragments. Since DNA is negatively charged, all of the DNA will flow toward the positive end of the electric field; the gel allows smaller strands of DNA to move faster than larger strands, so that is how the separation occurs. After a gel has run for 1-1.5 hours, there should be a visual difference between different strands of DNA present in the sample. In our lab, it is most commonly used to separate PCR products, but this has also been used as a technique to sequence and compare different types of DNA in forensics.
Procedure:
1.  An appropriate sized well and comb for the amount of samples was chosen. Typically, a smaller well is chosen with a comb that either has 6 or 10 slots.
2.  The comb and well was rinsed to make sure that any of the residue from the last gel that was run was washed away.
3. 50µL of a 0.8% agarose solution was mixed with 0.5µL GelStar solution from New England BioLabs Inc.
4. The gel was allowed to sit until it solidified and then the comb was removed.
5. The well was filled with 1X TAE until it covered the gel.
6. An appropriate kilobase pair ladder was chosen based on the prediction of the desired results of the separation.
7. 20 µL of the ladder was added to the first well.
8. 10µL of loading dye was added to each sample being run and then mixed thoroughly, without creating bubbles.
9. The entire contents of the PCR tube was added to the designated well for that sample, being careful to gently load the sample so that the DNA does not spread out of the well.
Note: Each sample was documented as to which well it was placed in"

3. HPLC: As the HPLC test with a mixture of caffeine and theophylline (1:1) worked but the pure solutions of theophylline and caffeine did not show any peaks, the experiment was repeated several times. We assumed that operating mistakes or wrong settings are the reason for the negative test results.
But as the experiments have been run under the same conditions this week again, there is probably another source of mistakes. Only in a few cases peaks could be detected, but then distinct peaks were detected.
Outlook: probably an assay to meassure CYP1A2 activity.
Modeling
A simple model for calculating the glucose concentration in a turbidostat from the glucose concentration in the medium and vice versa was made. A tool with a short summary of the math behind it was uploaded to the tools page of the wiki.
The same model was adapted for a flask instead of a turbidostat, changing it from a steady state model to one that integrates over time. Bugfixes remain to be done.
Optogenetics
AP Opto
As the S1030 cells, containing AP_light, were contaminated or mixed-up with AP_dark a new AP_light strain
had to be prepared. The purifications of AP_light and AP_dark, which were already checked
by sequencing, were used to transform new S1030 cells by electroporation and plated on Amp/Tet plates. On the next day a
colony was picked and grown in 4 ml 2xYT + carbenicillin overnight. A glycerol stock was prepared, and the remaining culture was used to isolate and purify the plasmid.
The plasmid purifications were sent to GATC for sequencing. The sequencing results proved that the cells carry the right promoter in front of gIII.
AP Testing
To test if the SP_Opto phage can propagate in S1030 containing AP_light and AP_dark,
cultures with the respective cells were grown in 20 ml 2xYT + carbenicillin to an OD600 of 0.6 and infected with either SP_Opto of the Dickinson phage target_133
and grown in the dark and under blue light After three and six hours samples were taken. A plaque assay"
Kent,2014,Team:Kent#publicperception_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology is, with 83.1% of respondents answering YES to the question 'Do you know what GMO's are?', compared to 52.7% answering YES to the question 'Do you know what synthetic biology is?'. One possible reason for this difference in knowledge could be due to the higher media attention that GMO's receive compared to synthetic biology, which brings GMO's to the attention of large numbers of people who may otherwise not pay attention to or research a scientific technology. An interesting point was raised with the responses to the questions 'Do you think synthetic biology can be useful to society?', and 'Do you think GMO's can be useful to society?'.  A greater number of the respondents thought synthetic biology could be useful to society, 58.1%, than the 52.7% who knew what synthetic biology is. The opposite was true for GMO's, with only 74.3% of respondents believing they can be useful to society, compared to 83.1% who know what they are.
When asked where they had gained the information from which they formed their opinion of synthetic biology and GMO's, 58.8% of respondents said school, and 56.1% said media. With over half of the respondents saying they had gained at least some of their knowledge from the media, this shows that many people's opinions may be formed from possibly unreliable or inaccurate scientific information, which is often heavily biased.  A much smaller number of respondents, 23.6%, reported that they had gained their information from scientific journals, which is perhaps the most unbiased source of accurate scientific information. This shows that many peoples opinion of synthetic biology and GMO's may be based upon biased and inaccurate scientific information.
Another interesting result of the survey is that while 90.3% of respondents answered YES to the question 'Would you buy products created using synthetic biology?', only 76.4% of respondents answered YES to 'Are you in favour of the production of fragrant compounds produced rom bacteria occurring in the UK?'. This shows a difference in the number of people who would be happy to buy synthetic biology products, compared to people who would be happy for synthetic biology products to be created in the UK. One reason could be a lack of understanding that the second question relates to synthetic biology. Another reason could be that while people are happy for something to take place, they are not comfortable with it happening close to home.
It was interesting to look at the results of the survey, and this highlighted to us how important it is that the public are well informed about scientific issues.

We also included a negative, non-fluorescent control where we grew cultures of TOP10 cells that were only transduced with Cas9 . We previously observed severe inhibition of culture growth with the co-transformed cells, probably from the stress of two plasmids. Therefore, we grew up cultures for this test without antibiotic using careful sterile technique to a standard optical density of 0.5 absorbance units. We included six biological replicates for each guide RNA condition, three biological replicates of Cas9-only, and three technical replicates for all of the above. Our Cas9 positive control gRNA cells yielded a high fluorescence and our negative control cells without a gRNA showed almost no fluorescence. Importantly, our experimental condition, Cas9 and the mRFP gRNA showed a very low fluorescence, almost as low as the negative (Cas9-only) control, indicating that our saCas9 is active and able to knock down mRFP expression. This was true across all of our biological replicates. Figure 7 shows that gRNA with mRFP-targeting guide did not fluoresce, as we expected.
Going forward for this experiment, we would need to sequence the mRFP insert from the cells affected by Cas9 to confirm that Cas9 did in fact edit mRFP. This can be done by sequencing PCR fragments from colony PCR or by deep sequencing.

Project Concept
As previously stated, the main goal of our project is to design a bistable switch. We want to enable bacteria to transition between two stable states. In our system, switching between states will be induced by two different inputs and each of the states will have a specific output associated with it.
Our original project concept evolved around building a switch that we could turn on and off continuously. Not only did we want the switch to be able to switch states, but we also wanted it to be able to stay in a certain state without having to induce it constantly. Several designs were discussed, for example using light at different wavelengths to induce the system.
During the last couple of years several attempts have been made to construct bistable switches. One switch design is a one input, two outputs stable switch. It has a stable output but it looses the switching ability and 90% of the individuals in the population are killed when the switch is induced by UV-light (Lou, C. et al.,2010). Another mechanism tested has been a flipases system where the DNA is inverted by specific recognition sites. The system was found to function but was limited by the robustness of the flipase systems and knowledge about their function (Ham, T.S. et al.,2008). Another general problem with the construction of synthetic switches is the loss of function over time (Canton, B. et al.,2008). The limited function and stability of existing switches also limit the application to short time spans. Based on these problems we saw the untapped potential in designing a novel biological switch.
Our switch design is a complex regulatory system, which is induced with the help of input plasmids carrying inducible promoters.  However due to the complexity of the design of the bistable switch it was out of the scope of this project to construct the entire switch. Therefore focus was put on characterizing the key regulatory subparts"

Inspired by artists from Art and Science Research Center, we pioneered to use story as the carrier of our art-and-science work and capture the emotional sympathy of the public.
On September 4th, we were invited to visit Art and Science Research Center. Deep contact with the environment they stay in and the work they have done, the most impressive part for us was the principle they hold, which is keeping the influence and creating all the time. What would our work be after we finish this year’s project? The idea of blending art and science should never be a transient thing, rather, it should become a tendency of the whole society.

Safety
safety concerns
As a software team, our team does not produce any typical biological safety or ethnic issues. However, we still take safety into account from as many aspects as possible:
1. Safety for programmers
Most of our work is mainly done in front of computers, which is not ergonomically to programmers as working in such environment may cause much exhaust and stress. Therefore, we made a series of regulations to guarantee they are not exposed to computers constantly for too long time and recreational area is within 10 meters. What is more, every time our programmers go to web labs, we make sure that there would be safety equipment as well as accompanies for them.
2. Safety for public
We are aware what our software will bring to teenagers or youngsters, and our software is ensured that no violent or sexual scene or content is included. We also did a lot of work to estimate and reduce the possible errors or faults users may encounter in the future.
3.Safety for software
To better protect our intellectual property rights, we have consulted IPRs centre of USTC in case of future problem. We will restrict the use of our software and we will apply for a patent later.
4.Safety for campus
We are quite aware when we perform our work or lecture in campus, and no disorder or turbulence has shown during in the above activity.
5.Other safety concerns
(i) Our team made no new BioBrick parts (or devices), and no safety issues happened from this. (ii)No biosafety group or committee protested our project.
Suggestions for future development of safety in dry lab.
Although a lot of work is done to ensure the safety of programmers in dry lab, a lot of work still remains to be done. And here we present some brief ideas on how we can develop the safety for programmers.
1. In many conditions, programmers in a dry lab have to share places with experiment operators due to limited space, which may lead to underlying health problems. Therefore, we suggest that strict rules should be made to provide independent space for programmers.
2. We take it for granted that not only safety for programmers, but the safety for intellectual property should be taken into consideration. Thus we suggest that all codes and other achievement should be granted with copyrights before sharing.

They made a worldwide study about the situation regarding transgenics, including various topics like the legislation of transgenic consumption in different countries. Each participating team wrote an essay explaining various aspects of this topic. Different questions were posed such as the social perception of transgenic consumption as well as the viability of growing transgenic plants at home or public spaces. We were glad to participate in this Human Practice collaboration because we think that this is a great way of joining forces to tackle problems like the oftentimes negative social perception of transgenic organisms.
Translation collaboration of Team Franconia
Many teams met at the Germany iGEM meet-up in Dresden. For this meet up iGEM team Dresden organized a Collaboration speeddating. This gave us the opportunity to get in touch with iGEM team Franconia , who were developing a card game. To extend the range of this game, the game was supposed to be translated into many different languages. Our team gladly took part in the effort and translated the  game and its instructions to 5 languages: hindu, greek, french, german and portuguese."

For me the initial draw of being involved with iGEM was the opportunity to consider and work towards solving real world problems through the innovation of synthetic biology. I have been mostly involved with the research elements of the project as well as organising media and events to promote our project and cause. The opportunity to problem solve and take a multidisciplinary approach to project has furthered my desire to pursue a medical career with a research intercalation at university to further develop a passion for research sparked by iGEM.

Gaining understanding into the applications of synthetic biology, as well as the ability to make our own contribution to this expanding field has been an amazing opportunity. When I first learned about iGEM, I was most excited by the chance to combine biology and art within the creative freedom and scientific challenge lent by the competition. Art and science being two subjects I am passionate about, I have attempted logo designs and lab work, posters and project research, and hope to use the skills picked up from the many experiences in between to blend the two together in future study.

Wang Yong
Wang Yong is a professor of Institute of Plant Physiology & Ecology, Shanghai Institute of Biology Science. Dr. Wang obtained his Ph.D. degree in MIT in 2006, so he has witnessed the exciting bloom of synthetic biology and iGEM during 2003-2006. In our conversation, we discussed several topics, including the history and future of synthetic biology and iGEM as well as our proposed automatic platform.
Could you tell us your experience as a witness of the development of iGEM? How do you think about iGEM?
“After obtaining a master degree in Biomedical Engineering in 1999, I found a job in industry. In 2002, I was so impressed by the fast development of genetic engineering and felt a new era of biology is coming, though the word of “synthetic biology” wasn’t invented yet at that time. Without hesitation, I applied for and enrolled in a Ph.D. program in biology at MIT. The iGEM means a lot to me since it reminds me of my Ph.D. training and I appreciate its aim and philosophy. Before iGEM was initiated, few people could imagine that undergraduate students can form a team and finish a research project. Yet some undergrads can join a lab where graduate students and postdocs dominant, it’s challenging to run a lab with undergraduates only. There were not many people believe that college freshmen and sophomores could discuss and frame a research project, and finally work it out. With the success of iGEM competition for so many years, people no longer doubt the creativity and execution ability of undergrads.” 
What’s your view on educating synthetic biology to the public?
“Science is not for the scientists only. It should be recognized by the public and should be extended for more education purpose.. Synthetic biology makes sense to biologists. However, the public may have a different impression of these two words. I don"

SDSZ-China,2017,Team:SDSZ-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"A: I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh, I don’t want to cause that much pain to the poor bears. They say                         no trading, no killing right? So that’s not really an option for me.
Q: Yeah. It is indeed very brutal. Well, thanks for your time Mrs. Zhou. We really appreciate                         your help.
A: No problem! Have a good day.
Q: You too.
Contact with Chengdu Bear Rescue Centre
To find out more about the bear bile industry and the protective measures against illegal                         hunting, our team, SDSZ-China, went all the way down south to Sichuan province, where the                         biggest Asiatic Black Bear rescue centre is located. There, after exchanging conversations with                         the staff, we found out that Asiatic Black Bear is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list,                         and the most efficient way to rescue bears now is buying bile bears from bear farms. (Since bear                         farming is a legal activity in China, there’s no way to officially put a halt on this). After                         this trip, we went a bit west and visited a real bear farm where bile is siphoned. There, we                         learned the heartbreaking fact that people harvest bear bile only to make traditional Chinese                         medicine. Yet as most of the modern world would possibly agree, traditional Chinese medicine                         hasn’t prove to have a distinct efficacy in treating diseases, rather it serves as a method to                         nourish and build up people’s health conditions. Because of the all the above, the need for an                         alternative way to produce UDCA struck us as extremely urgent.

Safety Considerations of Our Biobrick parts and Our Project
In this section, we are going to answer safety question 2 in detail, taking the potential risk in the future into concern.
The main safety challenge we must face is that as a practical bacteria therapy our direction is, we shall demonstrate that the “E. coslim” will not harm its host when it is developed completely. As few experiments we can do in such limited time, we have done a series of theoretical work to solve problems in this field.               Intestine-colonized pathogenic E. coli may cause immune responses, following by diarrhea, inflammation and fever (although the strain we use is considered non-pathogen). Thus we plan to transplant the whole synthetic system to another organism (for example, Bacillus subtilis, has proved safe in human intestine). We know that it is hard as the two organisms are very different on transcriptional mechanisms, but we believe the work of establishing model system (that is what we are doing) in E. coli will make it easier. Also, as the rapid development of synthetic biology and gut microbiology, we hope in the near future, we can modify the genome of E. coli to change it a safe intestine microbe.
Another risk is that when the engineered bacteria get higher efficiency on energy production, they could proliferate out of control. To forestall this situation, we design a “death” device (for more information, click on Death ) using D-xylose as inducer. It means if you want to stop weight losing, what you have to do is to eat some D-xylose, and the “E. coslim” will die, shed from the intestinal wall and be poured out. What is more, designed as a two-plasmid system, it prevents all possible horizontal gene transfers.
Further safety issues will be raised and discussed in future experiments, including those operates in intestinal model and animals (For more information, click on Future Perspectives).
Safety Management and Practice
Our project has past a review of an expert committee, of which members are professors or associate professors of microbiology, genetics and bioengineering. Safety issues are considered seriously before they approved our design.                We have consulted a few experts for safety questions about both artificial intestinal bacteria and experiments. Their"
TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#HP#Optimize_-_-_TEXT.html," got numerous feedbacks from others, including suggestions on the of experiments, heated discussions on circuit design, and reflections on safety and application. TUST performed well during the presentation and poster section and provided many useful suggestions for other iGEM teams during communication.It’s worth mentioning that we won the award of the best poster.
BC factory visit
As we near the end of the project, we would like to know the BC factory's view of our work and the production of some BC products. So we visited Shandong Nameide Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Their product is named Nanuomei - a bacterial cellulite wound dressing.
The company's R & D manager received us and took us to visit the production workshop. She introduced us their mode of producing, which is quit different from the mode of producing BC in our laboratory. For example, in the lab we used the conical flask to produce BC. however, BC was produced in a huge metal tray in the factory.
Besides, We introduced our iGEM project to her and asked her what she thought about it. She thought our work was very meaningful and has been achieved increasing BC production, but she had doubts about whether it is suitable for the factory because the production methods and the production environment is totally different.
We plan to test the results of our iGEM project in the factory in the future. And we hope that our project can increase the production of BC not only in the lab but also in the factory.                             This trip we have gained a lot and we are more confident that our project is useful and meaningful.

iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
Our major question is to help students understand synthetic biology in an easier way. To approach this, we have made a questionnaire, an innovation teaching tool, made a wide outreach including online and offline, and even a business model . For more details, visit our section; Practices and Policy.
Gold
Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
We successfully raised public attention to synthetic biology by our software tools and offline events. We held several educational activities ( offline meetings, tutorials and TEDx lectures) by now. Our promotional activity was quite successful and we attracted many students and teachers to know more about synthetic biology. Also all of our activities can be launched in most of the high schools, colleges and educational organizations. So both our Synsketch tools and Synsketch education system are reusable by other teams, educators and engagers.
Help an iGEM team from another school or institution to meet a specific experimental or modeling goal by, for example, characterizing their part, debugging their construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Our project Synsketch has helped SYSU-China, TJU and SCUT-China with designing their genetic circuits
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)

Procedure:
CaCl2 competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells were put out from the stock in -80 °C freezer and were gently thawed on ice.
10 µl of ligation product (P265B) was added to 100 µl of competent cells and gently mixed.
30 min incubation on ice
5 min. heat shock at 37°C
Adding of 1ml LB-medium to each tube.
Incubation for 45min at 37°C in the 180rpm cell-culture shaker.
100µl of those cell suspension were plated on chloramphenicole plates.
The rest were centrifuged for 1min at 13000rpm and the supernatant was dicarded.
The pellet was resuspended in 100µl of LB-medium and this concentrated cell suspension was plated again on new CAM plates.

Hence, we get the fringe number.
Fringe Spacing
Store the fringes as undirected graph: By travelling all elements in the matrix, we add a edge in the graph for all fringe (represented as 0)
For example, a matrix like this:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
We can obtain the table of edges:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
((4,0),(4,1)) \\
((2,1),(3,1)) \\
((3,1),(4,1)) \\
((0,2),(0,3)) \\
((0,3),(0,4)) \\
((0,4),(1,4)) \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Do the depth-first-search for the users’ input ending pixel: We obtain the DFS spanning tree, which records the fringe the ending pixel is in.
Calculate the distance of consecutive pixels in the fringe that users choose by the starting and ending pixels to obtain the fringe order: Users choose a pixel, and we find the corresponding fringe, then calculate the distance of these pixels. We set the minimum distance as the fringe spacing.
Fringe Order
We suppose the fringes are concentric circles by the theory in optics(Team USTC used Michelson Interferometer in the SPRING hardware).Meanwhile, the relationship of fringe order and fringe radius is as follows:
$$r=\alpha\sqrt{n}$$
$r$ is the fringe radius, $n$ is the fringe order, and $\alpha$ is a constant set by users.By this equation, we can get the fringe order from the fringe radius.In the experiment of Team USTC, the relationship is $\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda r^2}{2h}}$,where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of laser, $r$ is half the thickness of thin-film, and $h$ is the distance from film moved by bacterium to the film’s original place.
Now, we derive uncertainty formula: supposed that the first point's fringe series which users select is $n$, the fringe radius is $r_n$, the second point's"

The transformation used E.coli DH5α competent cells was bought from Tsingke Biological Technology company, and we followed the steps in http://parts.igem.org/Help:2017_DNA_Distribution to use the DNA in the Distribution Kit.
Measurement
For this part of inter lab study, we followed the following protocols:
1.Grown 8 devices in incubator for 12 hrs at 37 ℃
2.Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and inocubate them on 10mL LB medium with Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells for 16-20hrs at 37°C and 180rpm.
3.Measure OD600nm of the overnight cultures and record the data, then dilute to target ODnm = 0.02 in the falcon tubes.
4.Measure the OD600nm and Fl under the same condition as standard curve measurement and use the same 96 wells plates.

CFU Protocol
For this part of inter lab study, we followed the following protocol:
1.Pick two colonies from positive control device and negative control device, incubate overnight.
2.Prepare Starting Samples: Dilute the overnight cultures 1:8, measurement then dilute further to OD600nm = 0.1
Calculation:
Use (C1)(V1) = (C2)(V2) to calculate your dilutions           C1 is your starting OD600 C2 is your target OD600 of 0.1
V1 is the unknown volume in μL V2 is the final volume of 1000 μL
3.Check and make sure OD600 = 0.1
4.Dilute
5.Incubate samples at 37 degree Celsius overnight for 18-20 hrs. Then count colony numbers.
Disscussion & Feedback
After the lab work, we had a discussion about the interlab study we did this year and now we have some feedbacks.

After Missions within safety zones around contaminated areas, of course materials and persons have to be decontaminated. Impressively the forces demonstrated this multi-step process. At this the whole procedure from sample taking by the tank Fuchs to decontamination of the rubber boots of the ABC-protection suits with decontaminating agents were shown. Finally persons enter the decontamination tent, which works therefore as a lock-like passage between the safety area and surroundings. There potentially contaminated persons have to wash themselves according to orders and put on new clothes. Efforts and throughput were remarkable and, of course, of an other dimension as our hand disinfection in the laboratory. Further materials for detoxification and decontamination were available on trucks after detection.
The scope of duties of the ABC-defense regiment proved to be more diverse than expected. Even  water conditioning, hygiene measures, weather observations or actions to rescue or fire fighting belong to range of tasks.
Not only military conflicts belong to the operational area of the ABC-defense regiment, but also humanitarian emergencies, support at huge events (e.g. G8 conference or the football world championship in Germany) or containment of pathogens (for example the Influenza A/H5N1 pandemia in Germany 2006).
Beside all kinds of other exciting experiences, as an dark obstacle course which had to be passed with a nightscope, we were able to talk to several people about biosafety and synthetic biology. Unfortunately, we cannot present an official statement here, but recommend the books “Biologische Gefahren I” and “Biologische Gefahren II” of the Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe together with the Robert-Koch-Institut referring to biological threats.
The day at the barracks has been a very exciting change and attracted many visitors of the non-military population. The German military forces presented themselves as a team of specialists endeavored to avert damage  at the hazard of their lives. Wannabe lone fighters couldn't be found.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," We had previously inserted 2 cutsites on our plasmids, Bsa1 (for insertion of finger 1) and Xba1. The lab already has Xba1, and we ordered Bsa1. Xba1 can be affected by methylation if it is preceded by 'GA' or followed by 'TC' [19] ; we checked and our sequences should not be affected.
We also re-plated 78, 79, and 82 today, one set of plates with 1 ul of culture, and the other set with 10 ul.

SNOWMAN!
EcNR2 lambda red (Noah's prep):
Noah remade the kan-ZFB-wp-hisura insert for us with the kan cassette in the opposite orientation from the his3 and ura3 genes. (The kan cassette is under a strong promoter and does not have a transcriptional terminator, so it's possible that RNA polymerase might keep transcribing through the end of kan and into his3.)  He also used it for lambda red in EcNR2, and a couple of plates look like they may have a couple colonies.
picked 4 colonies, diluted in 20µL H20 and used 1µL as template for 1529620 locus PCR. The rest was grown in LB+kan.
Lambda red with Noah's kanZFBhisura:
We recently discovered that the kan plates we had been using were very old, and that might be why we got that weird crystalline lawn of colony-like things.  We will retry lambda red in the ∆hisB∆pyrF∆rpoZ +pKD46 strain and see if this solves the problem
1.5mL cells divided in two: half for kan-his-ura (300ng) and half as a negative control (water)
Thio insert:
In case lambda red also does not work, we will try to add phosphothioate bases to the insert, but only to the lagging strand 5' end (so only the Ura3 side). Since our primers will have very different melting temps, we will try 2 different reactions:
Touchdown PCR:
template: Noah's kan-ZFB-hisura (163ng/µL) diluted to ~10ng per reaction (4 reactions)
primers: kan_f+homology, Ura3 R phosphothioate
2 cycles at each annealing temperature (67, 66...57) for 11 cycles followed by 15"
UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", differential model is widely employed on the chemical modeling. However, constructing a precise model for any speciﬁc reaction is always complex because dozens of material and formulae has to be considered.
But now, a novel technique has been developed to help you ﬁgure out this problem. Inspired by the primary idea of synthetic biology, the AutoModel separates existed simple device as individual parts and integrates them into the device ﬁle which is a
plug-in
for main program. There are hundreds of mathematical expressions in the device ﬁle that represents those relationship between input(reactant) and output(resultant). Customers could add, adapt or ampu- tate any functions, parameters and terms to optimally ﬁtting their experimental data and theoretical model. Besides, preseted device functions could be called for predict your experimental result.
How to use it?
There are 3 kinds of documents included in the program package.
3.1 Device
All of differential equations are stored in the ’DEVICE.py’ ﬁle which is a list of import subfunction of python. Those subfunction are deﬁned in the same format that allowing user to recall them by the same method. The format is
def device’s name (od , input_1, input_2, output, dt = 0.1) :
     parameters
     input1 = input_1 + (differential equation of input_1)* od* d t
     input2 = input_2 + (differential equation of input_2)* od* d t
     output1 = output + (differential equation of output)* od* d t
     return (input1 , input2, output)
where od is optical density and dt is integral time step.
3.2 Network Document
The ’network.txt’ is the file of network which describes the connection among simulated model. This text file is a table. The first column is device’s name which corresponds to the name in ’DEVICE.py’. The next 2 columns are input_1 and its initial value. It could be either inducer’s name or device’s name from first column. The 4th and 5th represent input_2. Last 2 columns are output’s name and its value. If the word in any row is output, it means that the program will return the output value of this device.
3.3 Main Program
The main code for simulation is written in ’demo python.py’ which contains calculating function for growing curve, integrating function for ODE and a plotting part. Here"

Online platform
Wiki building is an essential and tedious step in the iGEM competition. Programmers have to deal with numerous codes if they still follow conventional procedures.
This year, we have created an amazing online platform, Flight iGEM, which will make significant changes to the workflow of wiki building. 
With the Flight iGEM, each member ot a team will be able to participate in their wiki creation.
No matter where you are, you will be able to update the contents of your wiki online. 
Your files can be uploaded to the official server of the iGEM directly through Flight iGEM.
With the contents for wiki and a template you have designed in advance, Flight iGEM can generate a wiki for you automatically.
With the help of Flight iGEM, we hope that all the iGEM teams can say goodbye to the “code soup”. For more details, please visit our page for Flight iGEM .

Also the increase in caloric availability could also apply to carbohydrate food sources thus allowing for an increased self sufficiency and, hopefully, the formation of a surplus that could enter into the world market.  It is this entry into the world market that could facilitate a upward movement of under developed countries.   • Industrial application o The use of the cellulolytic E coli nissle 1917 would increase the availability of glucose for industrial application by opening a new avenue for using the renewable and abundant environmental cellulose.  This could lead to an increased industrial self sufficiency by decreasing dependence on non renewable resources (i.e fossil fuels) or repurposed resources (i.e. corn and rice).  In the case of fossil fuel, the world market depends on it due to its high demand but with the increased amount of bioavailable glucose there would be an increased availability of ethanol for use as a renewable fuel source. In addition with an increase in bioavailable glucose the world will be able to move away from high fructose corn syrup, which has been linked to an increased obesity rate in America, and towards high glucose syrup.  This would mean a decreased reliance on corn allowing its use in other industrial or economic applications.  All in all the use of a cellulolytic bacteria in industry would allow for a repurposing of what was once considered “trash” and instead turn it into a potential “treasure” using it as a resource, recycling what was once useless into something that can now be considered a reliable and renewable resource.   • Humanitarian efforts o Through the use of a known probiotic strain E. Coli Nissile 1917 the cellulolytic genes studied will be able to be used safely and effectively in human subjects.  The effect of the cellulolytic probiotic strain would be to increase the caloric intake in the individuals who live as sustenance farmers, refugees, and in areas that do not provide enough agricultural means so as to provide sufficient calories for the population housed in the area.  This increase in caloric intake would mean an increase in self sufficiency in third world countries and a decrease in economic strain for the supporting nations.    The increase in self sufficiency would mean an increase in economic surplus within the country in question, eventually leading to an increase in the rate of development in these countries.

General mass balance equations for the unbound VLPs
Besides needing an equation to describe the change in concentration of all the VLPs, we also need an equation to describe the change in concentration of the unbound VLPs for each organ. The mass balances for the different organs consists out of multiple parts. The mass balances are similar to the mass balance for all the VLPs, with a slight difference, it has a rate of VLP attachment. This rate describes the attachment of the VLPs onto the surface of the cells.

Purpose
In order to gain the trust of the public, we believe the technology should belong to everyone. In a manner similar to the open-source software industry, people should be able to improve our project or create their own versions of it. This idea of openness is very common among the community of synthetic biologists, but a lot of pitfalls have to be overcome to make it a sustainable reality.
A parallel could be drawn with electronics in the 1960's, when computer programming was extremely low-level and belonged to the realm of academia. Since then, it has reached a far wider population thanks to the creation of frameworks allowing for abstraction of the most technical parts. How could the same principles be applied to synthetic biology, in the context of metabolic engineering and vitamins production?
Even though a lot of lab strains designed for easier modification have been designed in the past, they usually have a very general purpose and biotechnology remains a matter of specialists where every modification has to be made from scratch. We imagined a repurposed organism made especially for the quick construction of these self-replicative tiny factories, that could be easily used by startups, community labs or just by enthusiasts. In the following section we discuss the constraints associated with it, and what such an organism could look like.
For the product to be usable, several specifications have to be taken into account:
It must be easily extendable:
Our micro-organism should be a chassis allowing for quick addition of standard cassettes
It must be modular:
The different metabolic pathways should be independant so they can be put together without going through tedious troubleshooting,
It must survive in the real world:
To make our micro-organism more resistant to contamination, we need to design it so our modifications come with a minimal fitness cost.
It must be all-in-one:
For people with limited equipment, having only one strain that does everything is a huge advantage, because only one bioreactor and one production line is needed. This makes it accessible"

In this model, Caulobacter A will contain chalcopyrite-binding peptides bound to chalcopyrite elusively while holding a K-coil interaction peptide. By addition of Caulobacter B which holds the E-coil interaction peptide, Caulobacter A will coalesce with Caulobacter B by E-coil and K-coil interactions, forming a greater mass that will selectively sink in a froth floation solution. Alternatively, we have considered floating bound chalcopyrite using gas vesicle proteins ( BBa_I750016 ) developed by iGEM Groningen 2009.

Addition of Caulobacter B which holds the E-coil interaction peptide will create an interacting link with Caulobacter A, forming a mass that will fall out of solution
Binding Assay
To observe whether our peptides are capable of binding to chalcopyrite, we incubated 40 μm and 100 μm size chalcopyrite with our peptide expressing Caulobacter crescentus which were then passed through a 40 μm size cell strainer and subsequently washed with buffer and eluted with elution solutions. The elutions were then plated on YPD plate.  Colonies grown on YPD plate suggest that the Caulobacter crescentus were bound to the chalcopyrite as they were present after the wash and elution steps.

Results
Biomining precipitation assays
Before attempting to demonstrate binding with peptide inserted into the S-Layer, we tested binding with WT cells. After having observed binding, we then hypothesized that the fucose layer in Caulobacter was potentially involved in binding. Since there was a fucos knockout was available, we ere able to confirm fucos binding. Moreover, this observation demonstrated that a precipitation assay was feasible when mixing cells with Chalcopyrite.

– tRNA synthetase specific for DMNB-serine and UAG codon in E. coli → version 1 to 10 All of these parts are variants of a DMNBS-synthetase to be used as an orthogonal synthetase in E. coli. Each of them can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA BBa_K2020042 to incorporate DMNBS in response to an amber stop codon.
Incorporation of ncAA: Photo-cleavable non-canonical amino acids offer the opportunity to control protein function on a non-invasive basis. Working with non-canonical amino acids requires an additional, orthogonal pair of a tRNA and a cognate synthetase i.e. which does not crossreact with the endogenous tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA's anticodon is mutated to an amber stop anticodon. Hence, it is possible to incorporate an amino acid at a chosen position in a protein via amber codon suppression. A previously reported tRNA/synthetase pair for O-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl)-L-serine (DMNBS), which derived from Escherichia coli and was used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to the lack of a possibility to work with non-canonical amino acids replacing serine in E. coli by using a 21st amino acid. Based on computational modeling a tRNA synthetase for DMNBS in E. coli was designed by creating a semi rational mutation library. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of ncAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid, each one with its own promoter and only one terminator. Host organism: This reporter plasmid and the measurement of its corresponding proteins expressed are previously used both in an amberless E. coli strain and BL21 DE3 gold. The latter results in competition of the suppressor tRNA with RF1 at the amber stop codon. Screening Results:

Fighting the Hidden Resistance
The nematode parasites Cyathostominae, also known as small strongyles, cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. The economic burden of these parasites is forecasted to increase, since these worms are rapidly gaining resistance to most drugs used to combat them. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these small strongyles. Our vision has been to apply synthetic biology to the untouched field of veterinary diagnostics by developing a better tool for detection, thus decreasing the growth of resistance among small strongyles. While working toward the goal of creating a reprogrammed smart bacteria (nicknamed the Worm Buster) to detect and report the presence of small strongyles, we discovered new useful applications of existing techniques along the way. This has brought our vision about the Worm Buster closer to being achievable, which in the future will provide the tools necessary to help farmers make a decision whether to treat their animals or not.
Our work has laid the foundation for our idea to someday potentially come to fruition. Our novel applications of cutting edge techniques such as phage display and transcriptomics using Oxford Nanopore MinION third generation sequencing provide groundwork for further expansions in the field of veterinary diagnostics.
The Targets
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [1]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [2]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [2, 8].

Goal #1 - Produce stain-fighting enzymes in E. coli
To produce stain-fighting enzymes in E. coli, we need to genetically engineer our bacteria using genes that code for the synthesis of our three enzymes: cellulase, amylase, and chlorophyllase. Each construct should include a histidine tag for protein purification. After enzymes are purified, assays with each enzyme’s substrate should be conducted in order to determine if the enzyme is active or not.
Goal #2 - Demonstrate that enzymes can help remove stains
In order to show that enzymes can remove stains, multiple assays will be conducted to demonstrate each enzyme’s ability to degrade its specific substrate (i.e. cellulase degrading cellulose in CMC agar plates, amylase degrading starch in starch agar plates, and chlorophyllase cleaving the phytol tail of chlorophyll to make it water soluble. These assays will provide a proof of concept; pairing this proof of concept with background literature reviews will help demonstrate that enzymes can in fact remove stains.
Goal #3 - Immobilize enzymes to bioplastic
To immobilize enzymes to bioplastic, we can build upon previous iGEM team's work regarding the production of bioplastic in E. coli. After using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter to illustrate attachment to the bioplastic granules inside the cell, we can go forward with the same strategy for each of our enzymes. To further solidify our end goal, we can chemically immobilize our BioBrick-produced enzymes to PVC plastic and show that the enzymes retained their efficacy after attachment (chemical immobilization would result in a covalent bond between enzyme and activated PVC plastic, the same type of bond that would occur in our biological immobilization strategy).
Goal #4 - Manufacture a reusable bioplastic laundry treatment
The objective of creating a reusable bioplastic laundry treatment is to reduce the quantity of harsh detergents, minimize wastes of non-reusable ""free"" enzymes, and improve upon the removal of tough clothing stains. To create this treatment, we first must prove that we can immobilize our stain-fighting enzymes to bioplastic while maintaining their efficacy. Second, we must be able to produce a sufficient amount of enzyme-immbolized bioplastic to allow for rigorous testing. We can then take this enzyme-immobilized bioplastic and construct an additive device to traditional laundry cycles that can be reused in multiple washes. Furthermore, we can use the stain-fighting bioplastic to surface coat scrubbing brushes and buckets for use in under"

Friday August 11th
My JBEI oligo coverage project and current process : . Getting data - statistics from trace file: raw data, but not quality value. We may use Phred software to output quality value files and then read those files
. From statistics, choose the parameters of oligo effectiveness length and non-effective length: not yet
. Make multiple oligos that cover the whole sequence: coded the functions, not test yet.
. Output the oligos
. Analysis of the result, checking mismatch
Fall Semester
Wednesday September 9th
9/9/09! School started, so I haven't make much process. I finished debugging my primer designer, input a long sequence and it will output the list of oligos that covered the whole sequence. My tool has effective length and ""non effective"" length of an oligos as input arguments, so the next step is to make a Kepler workflow/Clotho tool that calculate and save the statistics of past trace files.
Today we have our first meeting in Fall after Doug returning from vacation. It's great to see everyone doing well, and ready for intensive Fall work.

    Thirdly, we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire summer vacation in the lab for their project and force their ways out towards light and truth together. A day usually started with two teams’ early morning greetings at the building hall and ended up with “good bye” in the evening. The way back to dorm listened the bitter and sweet they shared with each other. What a great scene we created. What a goal we have been always chasing after.

    In Nanjing, we shared our project ideas with several teams coming from different parts of China at the BUDS conference and got some really awesome feedback, and each of the attendees is highly experienced at and dedicated to iGEM. In addition to us, the representatives from the iGEM teams of SJTU, NJU, SYSU and TJU etc. attended this meeting.
Fig.3 The students present at the meeting having a lively discussion
    During the two-day-long discussion, we thoroughly exchanged our perspectives on almost every aspects on preparation for iGEM. We shared the ideas of our projects this year first. We then had a share in the experience of team construction, project design, human practice, cultivating new teammates and source obtainment. We gained a lot of practical advice on overcoming the difficulties of these terms, which we had met and we would meet. Team Fudan provided us with literature concerning cell sensing and response behavior they came across before, which they thought might help us. Also, we were inspired to visit a video game company, for example, to ask the professional for advice, which did motivate us to adjust our game to be more fascinating.

MITOMI
MITOMI stays for ""mechanicaly induced trapping of molecular interactions"", it is a high troughput method using microfluidic technology designed to mesure low affinity molecular interactions.
Purpose: We used MITOMI technique during our project to characterize transcription factor binding energy landscapes in absolute terms by determining dissociation constants (Kd) for a comprehensive set of target DNA sequences.
Schematic of the MITOMI platform:
The control inputs control the valves that close the units or separate the chamber from the mixing space.  Detailed view of the chambers and of the movable membrane used for mechanical trapping, referred to as the 'Button' .
Advantages: The movable membrane shown in the scheme below enables measurements of transient interactions, exhibiting sub micromolar affinities which are generally problematic to observe.

MITOMI scans explanation
We've been using arrayWoRx scanner to acquire the images.
Two scans of the chip are necessary for the analysis of the molecular interactions.
First scan is taken after 30-60 minutes of incubation, when the protein-DNA interactions reach thermodynamic stability. At this point the chamber containing DNA is open to allow diffusion and the valves separating each of the 756 units are closed, which prevents contamination.
Green fluorescence comes from the GFP-tag fused to the protein or from the incorporated Green Lysine.  Red fluorescence is due to"
