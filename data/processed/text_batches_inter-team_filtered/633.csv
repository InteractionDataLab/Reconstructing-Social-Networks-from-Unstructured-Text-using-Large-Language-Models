In these mini-competitions the students were invited to a science fair where we presented posters of previous iGEM projects. They were then divided up into teams with the aim of devising and presenting their own iGEM project, an iGEMmer from the current team guided their mindmapping. Advisors acted as judges and awarded prizes to the most original or innovative ideas.
1. Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
For our Human Practices the team approached several people to obtain feedback on our project to help guide the improvement of the device. Dr Simon Rushton, a politics lecturer, helped us identify potential stakeholders. Dave Ogelsby is a member of the UK government Rapid Diagnostics Steering Committee that surveys implementation of the antimicrobial resistance five-year strategy plan; he pointed out that our device would help prevent doctors prescribing antibiotics to viral infections. In order to understand the doctor and hospital end users, we talked to Mrs Thompson. From these interactions, we assessed that our test needed to be shorter than 2 hours, and our device needed to operate with small volumes of blood. This is because blood tests are only allowed in lab hospitals. For the full story of our Practice, and how they have influenced the design of our project, please visit:

2. Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
Sheffield 2016 has improved the function of the
BBa_J23100
part, by adding an RBS site downstream of the promoter (
BBa_K2016005
). BBa_J23100 was originally submitted to the Registry by Berkeley 2006. Our team has also improved the characterisation of both
BBa_J23100
and
BBa_J23106
. These parts are a strong and medium promoter respectively, that we have used to design our iron detecting device. We have experimentally validated through fluorometry that there is indeed a significant difference between expression levels of GFP coupled to the strong and medium promoters. Comparative analysis of promoter strengths can be directly interpreted from the data we obtained. This data can be found both on the original part experience pages of
BBa_J23100
and

The 3 experiment sets clearly show that the framework is optimised when a higher concentration of cells expressing the reporter device is present (Figures 10, 11, 12, samples labelled 1:1:13). This can be considered as a further validation of our fine-tuning approach using the simbiotics model and the previous plate reader experiments. Although a background signal is visible in the systems expressing the pink ( BBa_K2205018 )and the sfGPF( BBa_K2205015 ) reporters, the blue reporter ( BBa_K2205016 ) due to its lowest background level, constitutes the most suitable reporter module for the Sensynova platform customised as IPTG biosensor. This highlights a crucial advantage of our multicellular, modular framework, which enables each component to be optimised avoiding any extra cloning steps. As each biosensor may be different and require specific designs and optimisation,  easily choosing and changing modules and predicting in silico the bacterial community behavior is essential for the development of new biosensors.
Conclusions and Future Work
In conclusion, through a comprehensive systematic review a design pattern of four components was identified for synthetic biology biosensors. The components are detection and output devices, with optional processing and adaptor units. Based on this design pattern, a multicellular biosensor development platform was designed in which biosensor components were split between cells and linked by intercellular connectors. Modularisation of biosensor components is ensured by the reusability of parts due to these compatible connectors. The production and detection of signalling molecules has been standardised across cells: Detector cells will produce C12 AHL, processing cells will detect C12 AHL and produce C4 AHL, and output cells will detect C4 AHL. Therefore, as long as constructs include the correct connectors, they are compatible will all other devices, without any further engineering of the system. This creates a “plug-and-play” approach to developing biosensors and allows the rapid construction of many biosensor circuit, which can be fine-tuned using only cell-mixing. The splitting of biosensor components between different cells enables the top-down design of biosensing systems. In the top-down approach, systems are designed at a whole system level without consideration of the smaller subsystems required to generate a behaviour, as opposed to a bottom-up approach, where design begins with the smallest parts required to make a system and behaviour is built-up using the knowledge of these smaller parts. Using our platform with sub-systems of a known function already pieced together within cell, it is possible to simply add a cell to generate desired behaviour instead of"

Our iGEM adventure began in March 2017. From this moment until the very end of our iGEM Project, we were guided by our advisors Luc Brunsveld, Tom de Greef, Maarten Merkx and Lenne Lemmens. They helped us with brainstorming, by asking the right questions at the right moment and by advising us on problem solving. We would not have been able to pull this project off without them. Please find below a short profile for each of our advisors.
Prof.dr.ir. L. (Luc) Brunsveld
Prof. dr. ir. Luc Brunsveld is a professor at our university, mainly concerning chemical biology, like Biochemistry or Molecular Cell Biology. Besides lecturing students, he conducts research at our university concerning protein-protein interactions. Now he also advises us during our iGEM project, which we are more than happy with! For a more extensive biography, click on the arrow:
Luc (Lucas) Brunsveld (1975) received his PhD degree in 2001 under supervision of prof. Bert Meijer at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Topic of the thesis was the self-assembly of designed molecules into helical architectures in water. Subsequently, he moved as a Humboldt fellow to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, to work on the protein semi-synthesis and evaluation of lipidated Ras GTPases in the group of prof. Herbert Waldmann. From 2003-2004 he worked as a group leader in the medicinal chemistry department of Organon (now Schering-Plough) in Oss, on nuclear receptor medicinal chemistry.
End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new approaches to modulate biological processes. In 200"

Video call with FAI presidential staff member Lorenzo Della Morte
Looking forward to expanding our international reach, we encountered the possibility to contact the Italian Federation of Beekeepers (FAI). Successfully, after exchanging some emails we were able to schedule a virtual meeting with the FAI presidential staff member Lorenzo Della Morte. We were very excited to have the opportunity to share and also nurture our project with insights, concerns and regulations that came from the city that hosts the headquarters of many important multinational food companies and agencies,
such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and The World Food Programme (WFP). Eight members of the team could attend this important reunion that lasted approximately 40 minutes"

Jeremy Esque
Modelling, LISBP (Toulouse, France)
Given the central role of the Cerberus platform in our project, building of a three-dimensional structural model of this macromolecular ensemble was crucial. Due to the absence of experimental data, the modeling of some parts was challenging. Thus, parameters were built for AzF and 3D structure prediction and conformational sampling  methods were used for the junctions between CBM3a and the other heads (linkers).  It must be noticed that linkers are known in the literature to be highly flexible and disordered, meaning that these regions must be correctly sampled. Because these tasks required specific knowledges, we had the assistance of Jeremy Esque (INRA Research Engineer at the Toulouse LISBP) as a specialist in structural bioinformatics. His skills in protein 3D structure prediction techniques and conformational sampling and exploration methods  have been an invaluable asset to our project.
Juan Cortés
Molecular Robotics, LAAS (Toulouse, France)
Juan Cortés is a researcher at the Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems. His research interests are focused on the development of novel computational methods based on robot motion planning algorithms and mechanisms theory for treating problems in structural biology. Juan’s area expertise in robotics-inspired methods for molecular conformational sampling and exploration has been an undeniable asset to our project. More specifically, he has recently developed innovative robotics-inspired approaches to build atomistic models of disordered regions. In our project, these approaches have been highly useful to carry out a large conformational exploration of linker regions (the junctions between the heads) within our Cerberus molecular platform and generate realistic ensemble 3D models.

Fermentation processes, LISBP (Toulouse, France)
Our first idea was to produce functionalised cellulose in vivo. So we aimed to produce Cerberus and its associated function with the yeast Pichia pastoris in a bioreactor.  We had a long discussion about this with Christine Lafforgue. She is a specialist in fermentation process and her insight was invaluable to our project since it avoided us a lot of difficulties. Indeed, it came out from our discussion that"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Ribosense#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," readings after 790 minutes with E. coli carrying a plasmid containing the fluoride riboswitch
For clarity, and to act as an internal control, the bar chart results are expressed as a percentage change from the same culture, after the same length of time, but with no fluoride added. This assumes that the cultures behaved the same across all fluoride concentrations over the assay, i.e. cell density and productivity were unaffected by the fluoride. This sort of assumption would no longer be needed if a ratiometric system were used, part of our motivation for developing ratiometrica. This data seems to confirm the initial findings, as well as giving greater resolution in the 0μM to 100μM range. The results for higher fluoride concentrations do not seem to quite fit the trend, but as this is consistent across all the cell types it is possible that this was due to errors in making up the solutions, rather than actually being representative of the riboswitch. This data is very encouraging as the WHO safe limit for fluoride is 1.5mg/L (according to Farooqi et al ) which works out at 79μM. This means our riboswitch is at its most accurate around the safe level for humans. For more information on the implications of this, have a look at our human practices page .
It should be noted that we expected a greater difference in sensitivity between the knockout Bacillus strain provided by Yale, the 168 strain we were using, and the E. coli we used. In the original paper there was a significant, nearly 100-fold, difference in sensitivity between the knock and wild type bacillus strains, but our data did not reproduce this. However, we feel it is actually very positive as it means our part is consistent across multiple chasses, and that it has the desired sensitivity to fluoride, without the need for a special mutant to be ordered. This fits with our goal for our kit to be a standard which is widely compatible.
The next step was to place this construct in a ratiometric fluorescent construct, before eventually testing our luciferase construct with it. But, due to delays in developing the ratiometric construct, we only had one attempt at inserting and testing it and it proved unsuccessful. We shall carry on testing it and, whilst we cannot put our results on here due to the wiki freeze, we hope to present them to you at the jamborees.  However, we would like to include here what we plan to do, in order that future teams might benefit. We plan to insert the fluoride riboswitch into the ratiometric"

D. I never give up my spare time to study in lab.
E. Other situation please specify
Q4 Approximately how many hours do you spend in lab on weekdays?
Average=10
Max=15
Through Q3 and Q4, we could see that students tend to spend most of their time in the lab nearly every day. Many of them work more than 8 hours a day and give up their spare time. In fact, most of them told us that they lack exercise. Though they are encouraged to be hard-working, this habit will show negative influence on their health gradually.
Q5. How do you treat organic waste in your lab?
A. We directly pour them into sewer.
B. We collect them in a special waste liquor bucket.
C. We collect them in a special waste liquor bucket for further treatment.
D. Other situation please specify
Most labs do well when they treat the waste liquor. Most labs have special liquor buckets and use them correctly. Some special labs deal with the waste liquor with the help of specialized companies.
Some labs collect waste liquid in a special bucket for further treatment.
Q6. How do you treat contaminated wastes in your lab?
A. We discard them into a special biological waste bag.
B. We directly discard them after sterilization.
C. We collect them for further treatment without sterilization.
D. We collect them for further treatment after sterilization.
E. Other situation
Q7 How do you distinguish experiment waste and household waste?
A. We do not distinguish them.
B. We strictly distinguish them.
C. Other situation
To protect people outside the lab, experiment waste and household waste should be distinguished strictly. About 15% people didn't distinguish them strictly. We also saw that some people throw the experiment wastes in the bucket containing household wastes. We do really well in our own lab and we think it's a good habit. The two kinds of wastes should be separated in the lab and they will be treated differently outside the lab.
Some labs distinguish experiment and household waste while some labs do not.
Q8. How do you store hazardous and poisonous chemicals in lab?
A. We store them in a special cabinet and cannot use them freely.
B. We store them in a special cabinet yet could use them freely.
C. We store them together with other chemicals.
D. Other situation
Most labs manage the poisonous chemicals strictly. Some labs manage all kinds of chemicals together. In fact, some hazardous chemicals need special management.
Some labs implement strict regulation on hazardous chemicals.
Q9. What kind of personal protective equipment do you usually use?

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eukaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html,"HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor-1) is a transcription factor (TF) which is exclusivly active during hypoxia (low oxygen level). HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of a α- and a β-subunit. During normal oxygen conditions the α-subunit is hydroxylated by the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase. The hydroxylated α-subunit is a target for an ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitylation of the α-subunit leads to its degradation by the proteasome. During hypoxia the degradation of the α-subunit does not occur, since the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase uses oxygen as a cosubstrate. The active TF enhances expression of different genes as for instance genes associated with blood vessel formation [67] .

pPARγ
pPARγ activation. During fatty diet, fatty acids are converted to prostaglandins by oxygenases, which activate pPARγ. Image published under GNU Free documentation license.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ) is a transcription factor belonging to the family of nuclear receptors. PPAR γ plays an important role in glucose metabolism and fatty acid storage. PPARγ is basically activated by ligands like the prostaglandin PGJ2 and through dimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR) [14] . The activated heterodimer binds to the DNA consensus sequence AGGTCANAGGTCA resulting in an increased or decreased transcription of the appropriate gene. The genes activated by PPARγ initiate the uptake of fatty acids and differentiation of cells to adipocytes. Besides its function in metabolism, PPARγ was also shown to be correlated with several diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Activation of PPARγ by synthetic PPARγ ligands result in an increased glucose uptake. These syntethtic ligands are therefore promising agents in diabetes II treatment [15] .  Another synthetic ligand of PPARγ is able to inhibit the proliferation of different cancer types [16] .

Among the different courses offered by the school, a micro and nano electronics specialization is possible during the last year of the engineering degree. As the school is also turn towards live sciences, optional modules of this course enables students to see microelectronics applied to  live sciences. One of the optional modules of this course is called “synthetic biology”, and is aimed at making links between the emerging synthetic biology field and microelectronics. In this way, basic biology knowledge is provided to the students, and a project is settled so as to familiarize students with synthetic biology. The last part of this course is dedicated to make a project, and participate to the iGEM competition.
Strasbourg University
European by nature and international by design, the University's strengths and assets stem from its active involvement in virtually every discipline comprising the current body of knowledge. As a young university founded on an age-old tradition, it strives to attain cross-disciplinarily so that this mixing fosters new research opportunities and produces courses that meet society's need. The international dimension is fundamental for the University of Strasbourg and thanks to the worldwide reputation of its research teams, built on excellence and efficiency; it emerges among Europe's foremost research universities. Each of the University's main academic fields of instruction is based upon research sections that are the driving force of the institution, with over 2,600 professors and 2,000 staff. The Technology Transfer Office, one of the very first developed in a French university, strives to promote the work of the researchers and facilitate partnerships with economic and institutional stakeholders. An essential player in the promotion of scientific and technical culture, the University interfaces with its host city, Strasbourg. Solidly anchored in the European Higher Education Area, the University of Strasbourg, a beating heart of the Alsatian metropolis with its 41,000 students, has the potential to face the challenging international competition.

Overview
General
Environmental considerations
The essential part of every iGEM project is its risk management and safety. As a part of the iGEM community, we took these issues seriously into consideration.
General lab safety
We carried out our project at Vilnius University Life Sciences Center laboratory which has a Biosafety Level 1 as we worked with well-characterized E.coli cells which do not cause disease in healthy humans and pose a minimal potential hazard to the environment. However, all the team members have completed general safety training required for such Biosafety level and passed a wet lab test.
All the biological laboratory work carries risks of various levels to the experimenter. To manage those risks we carefully studied and followed all the protocols concerning safety issues, including:
General lab safety: the team was introduced to procedures in case of emergencies, such as evacuation pathways, locations of fire extinguishers, as well as emergency showers and eyewashes.
Personal protection: working in the lab, the team always wore lab coats and gloves to minimize the risk of skin contact with possibly harmful substances; when using UV light (for gel imaging or sterilizing boxes and equipment) team members wore protective glasses.
Decontamination of materials prior to use, as well as waste disposal: the team was instructed with autoclaving procedures and waste disposal procedures according to the compounds used.
Chemical safety: team members carefully studied protocols to handle potentially hazardous chemicals (appropriate storage methods, working in a fume hood, etc.).
Prohibition of eating and drinking in the lab.
To reduce usage of harmful materials, we substituted ethidium bromide for SYBR Gold dye to stain DNA. Ethidium bromide is known as a mutagen which is toxic upon exposure. On the other hand, SYBR Gold seems not only safer but also more sensitive dye. However, because it also binds to nucleic acids, we treated it as a potential mutagen as"

Since starch is insoluble, it does not exert osmotic pressure and should not cause product inhibition, unlike glucose. We therefore hope that it will accumulate to much higher levels than glucose, decreasing downstream processing costs.

ETH_Zurich,2016,Team:ETH Zurich#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," selection system offers a possibility to select for these variants. These systems allow for negative selection (""killing"") of variants that still react to the native HSL (3-oxo-C6-HSL) and positive selection (""survival"") of variants that respond to the new target HSL (3-OH-C6-HSL). We used a fusion protein that is composed of a domain which confers antibiotic resistance and an enzyme that converts a non-toxic compound into a cellular toxin. We tested the combination of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) 17 . While CAT confers resistance for the positive selection step, UPRT is necessary for the negative selection.
UPRT normally converts uracil into uridine monophosphate (dUMP). 5-fluorouracil is metabolised by UPRT to 5-fluoro-dUMP. This irreversibly blocks the thymidylate synthase (thyA), a key enzyme in the production of pyrimidine nucleosides in the cell, which finally leads to cell death 18 .
DUAL SELECTION PROCEDURE
NEGATIVE SELECTION:
In a first step, the created library of variants is grown in the presence of the old inducer 3-oxo-C6-HSL and a toxin precursor.  Variants whose expression is still induced by the old HSL or which have a non-functional repressor (EsaR) express the fusion protein which converts the toxin precursor into a toxin (A), whereas non-responsive repressors remain bound to the DNA and inhibit protein expression (B).
POSITIVE SELECTION:
In a second step, these variants now undergo a round of positive selection to select for variants that are responsive to the new HSL 3-OH-C6-HSL.
The bacteria are cultured in medium containing the new HSL and the antibiotic whose resistance is part of the fusionprotein. Inducible variants express the resistance protein and survive (A). Variants that are non-responsive do not express it and can not grow (B).
Afterwards, the variants can be plated and analyzed or subjected to further rounds of positive / negative selection to enrich for suitable variants.
POTENTIAL DELIVERY METHOD OF REPORTER STRAINS

At the same time model (2) if the enzyme is compared to our slide, the substrate                         is analogous to our addition. The resulting enzymatic reaction rate-substrate concentration and                         gray value-addition concentration have a good fit. So we decided to use this model. And in the                         other literature[1] of the model, the results obtained are also consistent. The gray                         value and                         concentration relationship in this model are shown in Fig. 1(a), This applies to both fixed                         antigens, immobilized antibodies and assays. The different added substances are shown in                         Fig. 2(b).

(c) Fixed antigen grayscale model curve
Fig.1 Gray value and additive concentration relationship
In the step of immobilizing the antigen, we control the amount of antigen added, the fixed time,                         and the brightness and the observation magnification at the time of sampling, and use a large                         amount of experimental data to average and reduce the error. Experimental Results After data                         processing, the Figures 1(c), Equations \(\mathrm{Y_1}\), can be obtained. The resulting image                         was used to                         predict other data and found good agreement. Explain that the gray value-concentration model we                         built is in line with our experiments. Thus, we further established the model on antibody                         immobilization and obtained the results of equations \(\mathrm{Z_1}\). From the model and our                         experimental                         data, it can be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively                         correlated when the concentration is not large. From the model and our experimental data, it can                         be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively correlated when the                         concentration is not very large and more than 0.4 μg/ml.
$$ y = 6.4904 x \quad \mathrm{(Y_1)} $$
$$ y = 9.3506 x \quad \mathrm{(Z_1)} $$
There is a bias when the antigen is not fixed. Therefore, we perform a statistical average of the                         gray values of the unfixed antigen. The \(\mathrm{Y_1}\) equation is the result of correcting                         the zero                         point deviation and the post-processing of the comparison relation \(\mathrm{Ψ_q}\).                         \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) can be obtained                         by treating the modified antibody model in the same manner.

3.4 Equipment Design
3.4.1 Q: Why should we choose LED light sources rather than ordinary light sources?
A: In this program we use LED light sources instead of using optical filters.
Compared to other light sources, the LED light sources are easier to control. By using C4W cube, we can connect more than two different LEDs in one light path. So it means that we can change the light instantaneously without infecting the observation of our worms.
At the same time, compared to the normal light sources, our light sources’ power is larger, which means that we can have a wider field of vision.
LED has another advantage that LED is instant available, which means we needn’t to wait if we turn off it by accident. We can realize the flash mode (modulate pulse) due to this feature.
3.4.2 Q: Why should we refit our LED from 1W to 5W?
A: The LED which we choose originally is 1W, whose power is larger than ordinary light sources. But we choose change our LED from 1W to 5W, which means that when we testing the reaction of our C.elegens, we can have a wider field of vision. So that we can observe it for a long time which benefit to our analyzation later.
After the refit, we find that the heat dispersion is still very well, which means that it won’t affect the time we use of the LED.
3.4.3 Q: Why should we choose DC2100 as our LED driver instead of normal LED driver?
A: The DC2100 is advanced version of LED driver. It has a current-limiting program to avoid the LED from being damaged.
Compared to ordinary LED drivers, the DC2100 can control the current more accurately, which means that we can test the optimum light intensity to active or repress the worms.
By using DC2100, we can modulate pulse which other LED drivers couldn’t realize.

Vanderbilt,2015,Team:Vanderbilt#Project#Sequence_-_-_TEXT.html,"Due predominantly to a low sample size, the reduction found in the RFP with minimized oxidation hotspots was not significant (two-sample t-test: n=4, t*two tailed=4.30, p=0.29). Nevertheless, there is replication of a trend, which could yield more conclusive results with more testing. As the promising results with the UV-optimized sequence demonstrates the principle behind reducing mutation with rational, algorithmic strategies, there is reason to be hopefully the same principles will apply to oxidation hotspots as well, as the previously noted trend suggests.
Given the large decrease in oxidation sites in the optimized RFP, it is still necessary to conclude that the observed improvement in sequence stability with oxidation was lower than seen in the ultraviolet experiments. One probable explanation for this is that different hotspots contribute differently to overall mutagenic potential. For oxidation hotspots, each has a certain elevated probability of undergoing mutation, but those probabilities are likely lower than the corresponding probabilities for UV dimer hotspots. The different technique used also would explain part of the discrepancy.
In total, these experimental results strongly suggest that the optimizations that we make at the sequence level to reduce the number of mutation hotspots do indeed translate to lowered rates of mutation at a biochemical level. Despite the intrinsic variation of these techniques, they were still able to consistently detect  the occurrence of DNA damage, and were at least sensitive enough to produce apparent trends in mutation reduction following optimization. As these protocols were only just developed in their current form by our team, there is undoubtedly opportunities to optimize these protocols further. Given the advantages of these techniques to detect DNA damage, as previously outlined, there is both the means and the incentive to develop them further as research tools for both testing our own hypothesis about various forms of mutation-optimization as well as for other researchers more generally.
Optimized Sequence Expression
Because the current paradigm for optimizing synthetic gene sequences is codon adaptation index (CAI), which is purported to correlate to expression levels, one of our team's main priorities was demonstrating that our novel optimization method based on lowering mutation did not interfere with gene expression. While the initial form of RFP that we generated to have resistance to UV mutation was confirmed to still produce RFP, there was a several-fold decrease in expression levels relative to the CAI-optimized control. This was despite the fact that the sequence was optimized to select the codon with a higher CAI associated with it when neither of two or more codons had fewer hotspots than the other. In response to this setback, we made substantial revisions to the algorithm, this time factoring in """

Referring to transgenic technology, the majority of people have general knowledge of it from traditional media more than daily conversation, who support study in transgene.
Management of drug and label is considered necessary for genetically modified food, because it may contain latent danger without precedents.
Upon genetic therapy, there is a tendency in believing that it will be applied to patience soon, even be able to repair cells, prolong life or accomplish organ transplantation without rejection. However, in consideration of privacy and social ethics, 20 percent of people under investigation are unwilling to possess a “gene ID card” for illness prediction.
Resolutions to present prejudice against transgene： 1. For government，it should strengthen supervision on genetically modified food, which will eliminate public’s worries and detestation on it.   More specifically, first, a series of detailed laws ought to be written for ensure of consumers’ rights.   Then, it had better increase their coverage on the positive influence on genetic technology for social atmosphere. 2. For press media, a positive lead is indispensably to be set, as it plays an important role on influencing mainstream views towards transgene.   Most importantly, any one-sided reportage aiming for catching eyes should be eradicated so as not to deepen misunderstanding. 3. For the medical industry, it is obliged to present an implicit elaboration of genetic therapy to public, rather than different viewpoints from many different so-called experts.   It can make"
Tongji_Shanghai,2016,Team:Tongji Shanghai#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,", we had a visit to NYU-Shanghai. We had a good talk about genetically engineering machine. The old team member, also known as the founder of IGEM in Tongji, shared their project at the year of 2014.
Afterwards, our team introduced the project this year, and have a heated discussion. The third part is NYU-Shanghai introducing their project. We raised important conflict that their work might be repeating one team in 2015, and gave some suggestion for improvements. In the end, we visited the NYU campus in Shanghai, then send farewell to each other. This meeting improves the relation between both teams, and we all gained vital information by collective minds.
Meet-Ups
NCKU Asia Pacific Conference
We took part in the 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 at National Cheng Kung University from 2016/08/08 to 2016/08/14.It’s the first time for Tongji, a young iGEM team to join such an international conference, We get a opportunity to communicate with teams from Asia-pacific region.
We held an impressive presentation and poster exhibition in NCKU with the topic of an optimized targeted breast cancer therapy. Meanwhile, we received plenty of constructive advice from our audience, especially experienced related scholars, which help us to optimize our cancer therapy design.
We truly believed that by this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, we, as well as all the other teams are able to have communications, achieving better results. What’s more, we build a consensus that multidisciplinary cooperation could be better improved by involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competition.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Localization_-_-_TEXT.html,"odies have various areas of application in life science, including protein detection, pulldown experiments and even immunotherapy. Having originally been discovered in 1995 during an in vitro screening for antibodies against cytomegaloviral proteins [6] , the A3C5 antibody is an established molecular tool for specific recognition of proteins. By tagging cell surface proteins with an epitope specifically recognized by A3C5 (being a peptide sequence of 11 amino acids), one is easily able to detect tagged proteins via immunofluorescence microscopy, FACS or one may purify them via pulldown experiments. Through the latter, one may also screen for in vivo interaction partners of the tagged protein.
mRuby 3
Having originally been engineered as a monomeric form of the red fluorescent protein eqFP611, mRuby variants are sine of the brightest red fluorescent proteins available. [7] With an excitation maximum at a wavelength of 558 nm and an emission wavelength maximum of 605 nm, the resulting stokes shift of 57 nm makes mRuby a good choice for fluorescent microscopy imaging and, thus, allows the visualization of the receptor in its cellular environment by being fused to the C-terminus of the transmembrane domain. mRuby is especially powerful for the fusion with receptors - not only due to its small size and high stability, but also due to the fact that, in comparison with eGFP, it appears up to 10 times brighter in membrane enviroments. The mRuby variant used here is mRuby 3, having been engineered for even more improved brightness and photostability. [8]
Strep-tag II
The Strep-tag II is an eight amino acid peptide sequence (WSHPQFEK) that specifically interacts with streptavidin and can thus be used for easy one-step purification of the receptor via biochemical and immunochemical methods. [9]
Nanoluciferase
The concept of bioluminescence has a great meaning for several invertebrate species, allowing communication with other individuals, signaling receptiveness or deterring predators. [10] The most common enzyme responsible for the creation of bioluminescence are the luciferases (from the latin words ’lux’ and ’ferre’, meaning ’light-carrier’).  These enzymes, among others found in fireflies and deep-sea shrimp, commonly consume a substrate called luciferin as well as energy in the form of ATP or reduction equivalents in order to create light-emission through oxidation. The underlying mechanism hereby relies on the creation of an instable, highly excited intermediate under the"

    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate"

P7 GFP, whose in vivo properties are essentially equal to those of mut3 GFP, may be a promising and useful GFP candidate for in vitro experiments, given its properties of very fast in vitro refolding, its high resistance to denaturing and its improved ability to renature .
Both new variants were contributed to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and are as such available for wide use in the synthetic biology community.

PCC 6803 which has a His-tag on the CP47 subunit of the protein, we isolated the Photosystem II. To stabilize the protein during the course of purification, we used n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltoside as the detergent to preserve the structure and activity of the protein.
Photosystem II Purification:
Our team used the protocol developed by Dr. Bricker’s team as inspiration to optimize the protocol to successfully isolate the Photosystem II. Using Dr. Bricker’s team’s protocol, we modified and optimized each step of the protocol through rigorous Oxygen Evolution analysis. Oxygen Evolution tests allow us to quantify the activity of the Photosystem II at each step and during successive purifications we have noticed that our isolated protein efficiency has dramatically increased.
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant, HT-3, was grown in 20L of BG-11 media supplemented with 2mM glucose and 50µM Kanamycin under 50µE m-2s-1 at 30°C with air bubbling for 3 to 4 days. Upon reaching an optical density (OD) of 0.8-1.0 at A730, culture was harvested using a floor-model centrifuge model for 10 minutes at 8,000xg. The cell pellet was washed using Buffer A (50mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 10mM MgCl2, 5mM CaCl2, 25% Glycerol) and combined cells were centrifuged at 12,000xg for 10 minutes. Using Buffer A with inhibitors to avoid proteolytic activity (1.0mM PMSF, 1 mM ε-amino caproic acid) and 50µg/ml DNAase, cells were resuspended and diluted to 1 mg mL-1 of chlorophyll-a (chlA).
The resuspended cells were broken by 2 passes through cell disrupter (Constant Systems, Ltd.) at 35k psi. Ultracentrifugation (175,000rcf for 30 minutes) was used to pellet the thylakoid membranes. The resulting pellet is brought to 1 mg mL-1 chlA. Dodecyl ß-D-maltoside (DDM) was added to 0.8% (w/v) by dropwise addition of 20%(w/v) stock to solubilize the membranes. After"

Application: Tissue Engineering
    Tissue engineering utilizes a combination of cells and appropriate biochemical and physicochemical factors to regenerate or recover biological tissues. The formation, upkeep, and restoration of biological tissues rely on the interaction of cells with other cell types and their extracellular matrix. To successfully develop biological tissue, it is essential that natural conditions of the cellular environment are as accurate as possible; this is where co-cultures play an integral role in application development. In a co-culture, there are two or more cell types that are brought together within the same culture. The communication and interaction between these cell types enable growth and interdependence within the biological tissue. This is vital for medical research and applications in medicine, as accurate interaction and makeup of cells in the tissue is essential for the normal development, homeostasis, and repair reaction of engineered tissue. Tissue engineering applications are used for tissue repair solutions like surgeries, medical devices, and transplants. The opportunity for market growth is increasing as there are increasing cases of chronic diseases, road accidents, and trauma injuries which act as external environmental forces to push growth in market for development of tissue engineering solutions. Furthermore, technological advancement in 3D tissue engineering like 3D bio-printers will drive further research and opportunity.

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," patches after a longer time period of treatment. The complementary short term research is based on repigmenting the affected patches in the similar effect of make-up while the long term treatment is under progress. This will be carried out by bacteria producing melanin on the skin, which will be absorbed and result in colored skin.
Our aim
Our research project uses harmless bacteria that, in fact, are already living in the human body as biological machines. These helpful bacteria are designed in our research project to become cost efficient machines to produce molecules that are deficient in vitiligo skin compared to normal skin. The goal with our project, until November 2010, is to obtain a “proof-of-concept” by having our bacteria produce and secrete molecules that we know, through previous research, are in a deficit in vitiligo skin. The lack of these specific molecules is thought to be involved in the impaired and disappeared pigment cells in vitiligo affected skin areas, leading to white spots.
Currently, there are not any treatments like ours for vitiligo skin. Our idea is to develop a treatment for vitiligo skin, where an ointment with harmless bacteria is to be produced for applying on white patched skin. The bacteria will synthesize and secrete several molecules of interest; these will be carried with a special carrier molecule through the outermost layer of the skin and further down to target specific inner skin cells with the aim of repigmentation.
With our research we aim to in the future develop a treatment that works faster and more efficient in achieving a repigmentation on affected skin areas compared to current medicine.

In our human practice, we want to achieve a complete exploration process. In this process we need to enhance our project and to promote our project to the world. We mainly based on the following principles:
1. Extensive investigation
So as to better achieve the value of the project, we need to listen to more suggestions from the community. As the saying goes: no investigation, no right to speak.
2. Positive exchanges
Not only to show the world our works, but also to have a certain exchange of interaction with the world, we want to get good feedback.
3. Targeting the market demand
iGEM is not only a competition, but also a good project. In order to complete projects successfully we need to understand people's interests, which will help us target the market.
4. Pioneer the future
It’s essential for us to establish a system of Human Practice system, and we can obtain a lot of gains from this system. In addition, the system can be used by other teams in the future.
5. Education
Educate responsible engineers.
Our human practice focuses on the safety, rationality and value of the society. From the beginning, we wanted to find the problem in the daily life. We visited a lot of communities, and interviewed some well-known experts and scholars in the area, and also went to a lot of well-known domestic companies to communicate. We got a lot of good feedback. In the process of human practice constantly on our project has been improved.

INTERVIEW WITH MEMBER OF MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Dr. Wei Yang.
After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind. Generally, most of them have the main shortages of high calories and bad taste even though they might be very sweet. We based the human sweetness receptor on our design and hypothesized to construct the signal conduction pathway in the yeast. And the most important thing is biology safety. In our project, the laboratory strains we used are routine strains,"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM is the ideal platform for this purpose as its community is spread all over the world. That is why we are launching a call for international collaboration for uniform terminology within the framework of the competition!
Where can we tie up? - Previous Engagement at iGEM
iGEM does not only mean designing an entire project from scratch. iGEM teams came up with amazing ideas in previous years and developed astonishing systems making the world a better place. We believe that continuing and refining the best ideas is not only a splendid way of honoring those projects but also a necessity, if we really want to accomplish long-term impact in science.
Previously on iGEM: Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2015
We focused on our outreach on the topics biosecurity, Dual Use, and Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). The team iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2015 laid the foundation for making a true difference in education and enlightenment of those topics within the iGEM community and amongst life science students in general. We want to build on this and further develop and implement their theoretical approaches. The 2015 team examined the current state and effectivity of education on these topics in life sciences and the iGEM community as well as the legal situation in different countries and regions of the world. All their findings were portrayed in a ""Dual Use Report"" . Now we want to convert their theory into practice. Starting at our university, moving on to national and finally international level, we reached out to scientists and experts - promoting education, preventing misuse and misconception.
What has happened since 2015?
At that time, education on DURC did not happen at our university at all. At first sight, this improved as we have a committee at our university which was founded in 2017. However, the mere existence of this committee does not contribute to a better educational situation in respect to DURC yet. Therefore, we now take actions to support the committee and really improve the knowledge and understanding of students about DURC. (Bielefeld University Press, 2017)
Why all this? - Relevance of Dual Use issues in the 21st century
What Dual Use Research of Concern in the wrong hands could do - two case studies
As the previously mentioned definitions are highly theoretical, we want to present some examples which illustrate what research could cause in the wrong hands. We selected these frequently discussed cases to prevent additional panic by not portraying novel alarming scenarios.

Based on that, we have also tried to characterize our system by testing whether or not it is possible to trigger N-mediated antitermination by coupling the N protein to the pBAD promoter.
The 5 test plasmids were transformed into E. coli Xl1-blue, with the SPL in front of the constructs to give a large range of expressions. The first series of test strains are called series A. Isolated colonies from this transformation (series A) were again transformed with the inducible pAT01 plasmid containing pBAD and ARAC promoters upstream of lambda N-gene with its natural RBS to give the test series N. For an overview of the test strains constructed see the table below.

Our main goal was to fight Antibiotic Resistance, but the plasmidic CRISPR-Cas9 system is so efficient that we can imagine to target almost anything!
These are just our words, but our idea convinced many researchers around us and we have established to great agreement for testing our system, namely:
Royal Military Hospital Queen Astrid, Brussels
Our first and most important partnership! We first met them in February when our idea was a phage system as a therapeutic tool. After various brainstormings we decided to keep the Antibiotic Resistance as our main main topic but we switched to a plasmidic vector!
Jean-Paul Pirnay has always been a useful advisor. He’s a leading scientist in Europe for phage therapy and manages the microbiology lab of the military hospital. He took part to various amazing researches, including PhagoBurn.
The military hospital has a wide bacteria collection and our partnership with them will allow us to test our system on their strains, especially V. Cholerae!
We already have achieved our proof of concept!
Our next step: demonstrate the inter-species conjugation!
We are excited to cooperate with the military hospital and their support is a big acknowledgement of our hard work!
CHU Namur Mont-Godinne
This is a university hospital linked to our home university. In September, Pierre Bogaerts, from the microbiology lab, decided to test our system on his bacterial strains! We are very excited for this upcoming experience. The proof of concept was achieved, now it’s time to make it real!
The support of the hospital is very important for us, as the medical application is the ultimate goal of our project!
Last but not least the humanitarian journey in Benin, West Africa made by our colleague Sara, medical student and iGEMer, made us clear how important is to keep working and looking for new solutions! We saw with our eyes what bacterial infection can do when we are not prepared! We want to change it!
All these opportunities were a big plus for our project and they are the confirmation that it will not stop after the Jamboree! Boston will be a starting point for new exciting developments!

Another important variable of the batch model is the time at which the lytic phage is added to the model. Although the variation of this parameter in the continuous model showed no impact on the extinction time, we expected to see the difference in the   batch model. Interestingly, the batch model also showed little variation in the output up if the phage is added at any time up until 9 hours after the start of the simulation (Figure 5). Figure 5D shows that introduction of the phage at 9 hours sharp   results in the lowest extinction time (10 hours). However, from the same plot it is also seen that the population of lysogenic bacteria levels off at the concentration around 10-3 particles/ml, which should not happen due to constant lysis of these   cells. This issue is further investigated in sensitivity analysis.
Figure 5. Simulations of a batch model with different times of addition of lytic phage. (A) P added at t= 0 ( 91b1128 ),    (B) t=5 ( 8fbc2da ), (C) t=7 ( 6376bb5 ),    (D) t=9 ( eaf2859 ), (E) t=11 ( 863e5aa ),    (F) without P ( 1aa3048 ). Red arrow below x-axis shows when P is added to the model, r – ratio    of average concentrations of XI to XS, t – time when XS goes extinct.
Sensitivity analysis
All previous simulations of the continuous and batch models assumed the parameters, such as the burst size, phage absorption rate and time latency, etc. to be the same for both lytic and temperate phage as listed in   Table 1. Similarly, there was no difference in the parameters of all three populations of bacteria: susceptible, lytically infected and lysogenic. Biologically, it is unlikely that all of these parameters will be the same across different populations   and species. Therefore, the initial model of the batch process was extended to take allow variation in all 20 parameters.
We then performed a local sensitivity analysis using the expanded model, each parameter was changed from its nominal value (Table 1) by either subtracting 50% of the nominal value to obtain the minimal value or by adding 50% to obtain the"

He planned to perform experiments on hydrogen produced by algae thus Professor Zou would love to establish cooperation with us. Professor Zou suggests that they can propose new thoughts and ideas about our iGEM project and bio-produced hydrogen from subjects of physics and materials. At last we owe our great thanks to Professor Zou Zhigang, Professor Yao Yingfang and Professor Yu Zhentao for their participation and support.
 
In conclusion, we did learn a lot from the interview. Firstly, we obtained more knowledge about the background of producing hydrogen, and thus, we have a much clearer concept of the current hydrogen-producing situation in China. Secondly, we knew more detailed advantages and disadvantages about hydrogen production catalyzed by nanomaterials. No doubt we received precious encouragements for our project.

Conferences
 
1. CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee)
 
On 2nd-4th September, our team was invited by Sun Yat-sen University to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee). The summit was a rehearsal of the Giant Jamboree in September. All the 26 teams invited to the summit were asked to give presentations about their project. The audience can ask questions about them. Besides, previous captains of Peking-iGEM were also invited to give speeches about the development of synthetic biology in China. We also brought our posters with us and discussed our projects with teams all around China.
 
During CCiC, our posters and presentations were very popular among all of the teams. Some of the iGEM teams that had great interests in our project came up with lots of suggestions and advice, which were of great help to improve our project. We owe great thanks to Mr. Haoqian Zhang, who gave us important suggestions about how to present our project in a logical order. He said that our photosynthetic system could be applied to other model organisms as long as we change the cell surface display protein, which is very inspiring.
 
The precious experience not only enlightened us about the design of our experiment, but also provided us with new ideas about synthetic biology. The presenters in our team also got more familiar with the presentation.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.

We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine.

In order to test the function of the lsr promoter, we transformed the plasmid pTrcHisB containing plsr with GFP gene at its downstream into E. coli MG1655 ΔluxS. We directly add exogenous AI-2 into the culture. The final concentraton of AI-2 is 50μM. Every one hour, optical density was measured and samples were harvested for HPLC analysis. As you can see, after induced by AI-2, the GFP expression is increased compared to control group.
Figure 1.1: GFP expression after promoter lsr is induced by exogenous AI-2
Then we test whether promoter lsr can respond to different AI-2 concentration. We directly add exogenous AI-2 into the culture. The final concentraton of AI-2 is 50μM, 40μM, 30μM, 20μM, 10μM, 0μM. Every one hour, optical density was measured and samples were harvested for HPLC analysis. The result below shows that promoter lsr can respond to different AI-2 concentration resulting in different GFP expression.

Autoinducer-2 Response Device A
This composite part consists of the AI-2 (autoinducer-2) quorum sensor-inducible promoter BBa_K1981101, a GFP coding sequence BBa_E0040, a double terminator BBa_B0015. We firstly isolated promoter lsr from E.coli MG1655. GFP BBa_E0040 and double terminator BBa_B0015 are standard part offered by iGEM. Then we successfully constrcuted plsr+GFP+double terminator using homologous recombination technology.
In AI-2 Response Device A, GFP expression is under the control of promoter, lsr. When phospho-AI-2 binds LsrR, expression of GFP ensues. The expression of GFP can directly respond to the AI-2 level in the environment, which is an alternative way to reflect the AI-2 concentration in the natural or artificial environment.
We fisrtly tested whether AI-2 Response Device A can respond to different AI-2 concentration. We directly added exogenous AI-2 into the culture. The final concentraton of AI-2 is 50μM, "

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," is largely composed of irrationality, then is it really necessary to speak of it as a plague instead of thinking of ways to understand it?
5. How We Incorporated the Above Framework into the Analysis
     We first locate the stage in which our question belongs to. It speaks of the output stage, and is an assessment in nature. So we trace back to possible origins of such assessment in the 3-D model.
     At the surface level, we reduced the problem to be a profit-based question that have two keywords: beneficial and malignant. Then we went down to the judgment level and classified them as good and evil. We don't need to plunge into long philosophical debates about the concept of good and evil, we only need to go one level deeper to find the emotions triggered by these concepts, in this case we only care about evil, because what's good will be good, and don't need exceptional addressing; so the key words in this level are fear and anger. The next step is identifying the origin of such emotion or attitude, and possible explanations are usually found in disciplines that study human irrationalities such as some schools of thought in psychology, literature, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, archeology, mythology, religion, theology, art, etc. [15]
     A framework cannot substitute thinking, it is not universal and certainly it has imperfections. But thinking like this makes thinking a fun thing to do, rather than arduous.
6. Strength and Weaknesses
     First, on the plus side, this model doesn't need math or programming skills to understand; but on the down side, not having mathematical elements to help shape it up, the form is a bit crude. One would argue, for improvement on some exactitude, the axis can be given value to. However, how can ""negativeness"" or ""positiveness"" or ""awareness"" be measured? After thinking over the possibility of an inch-by-inch search to actually give some value to a word, we decided to abandon the deed, because it just seemed to be a subjective process with the facade of objectiveness. Our model could be said to be an experiment done by us to understand irrationality with irrationality, though borrowed some useful form from the world of rationality.
     Second, it's not a software where you can enter your question and it will give you the answer like a program, it just provides a direction for friendly reference if you are finding yourself at a loss. We don't believe any tool can substitute your thinking originality, but still, we wish to make this process a little bit easier, so more"

Although they are new to synthetic             biology, they also have a preliminary understanding of it after our interesting introduction.
To evoke enthusiasm for science in children, we prepared several interesting experiments that were easy to carry out. To our surprise, children were quite into them. We also played games while educated them about knowledge of biology like making the cell model with the eraser, teaching them the structure of the cell, drawing DNA on a blackboard etc. Even though our activities had finished for a long time, people were reluctant to leave.

Gold Human Practice
Overview
As communicators of biology, we believe the ultimate goal of the project is to serve humanity and improve people's living standards. For this reason, we went to the center for disease prevention in Tianjin city to learn about the harm to people caused by the abuse of antibiotics at present, as the beginning of our colorful HP activities. At the same time, in order to further promote the propagation of the synthetic biology knowledge and attract more people's interest in learning biology, UCAS - China and we founded the Beijing - Tianjin alliance and absorbed six universities in the Beijing-Tianjin region became the first formal member. We prepare to apply for Chinese Popular Science Promotion Day by alliance next year. Of course, we hope to inherit and strengthen the             alliance with the promotion of iGEM in China. This year's HP activities of TUST-China do not want to be limited to the dissemination of knowledge, but rather to convey warmth and the humanistic spirit of iGEM. We participated in the college entrance examination volunteer service, providing physical and psychological help to candidates, and welcomed them into the new stage of life as biology seniors. As is well known, interest in biology should be nurtured from a young age, so we went into communities and community welfare homes and entertained children in a biologically specific way, such as showing interesting little experiments. We hope that through our tiny power, we can start to change the world a little bit by changing the people around us.
Spreading Biology
Responsibility comes with the ability. As main iGEM teams in Tianjin, we are entrusted with the duty of spreading our concept and advanced knowledge for education.
We held several meetups with other universities in Tianjin, and discuss the appropriate approach to advocating rational analysis and creative thoughts during the CCiC. Eventually, we took the first step in high schools.
We listened to experts and contacted several high school in Tianjin. Teachers warmly welcome us to do and explain experiments"

Czech_Republic,2015,Team:Czech Republic#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," of a change in species numbers there is if the linked reaction happens. For example consider the following reaction system:
\(\varnothing \Rightarrow k_A \Rightarrow A\)
\(B \Rightarrow d_B \Rightarrow \varnothing\)
\(A + B \Rightarrow k_{AB} \Rightarrow C\)
The underlying stoichiometric matrix is $$\begin{bmatrix}+1 & 0 & 0\\0 & -1 & 0\\ -1 & -1 & +1\end{bmatrix}$$ The number at position i, j says how much of a change in number of j-th species molecules there is when the i-th reaction fires.
Gillespie First reaction method
It can be proved that in a well-mixed solution with the assumption of a thermal equilibrium, the reaction times have an exponential distribution in time. The simplest way to simulate a stochastic system is the Gillespie first reaction method. This method consists of the following steps in each iteration
Compute propensities of all reactions in the system
Generate a uniform random variable (0,1)
Calculate the random time of next reaction from the following formula $$ \tau = -\dfrac{1}{\sum\nolimits Propenisty} log[rand[0,1]]$$
Determine which reaction happened – the index of a reaction is the index of the first entry in the cumulative sum of propensities that is greater than $$rand[0,1] \sum\nolimits Propensity$$
Update the system’s state according to the stoichiometry matrix
Tau-leaping and Dependency graph
Tau-leaping is an enhancement of the Gillespie algorithm, where propensities are updated only once per fixed time step instead of after each reaction. This method makes Gillespie algorithm more efficient in simulating larger systems. On the other hand, this approximation does not fully satisfy the idea of the Gillespie algorithm, because some computations are based on outdated propensities.
To have an efficient simulation together with up-to-date propensities, we decided to include the Dependency graph. This improvement makes recomputation of propensities more effective because propensities are no longer updated all at once, but only those that had changed when a particular reaction occurred. For example, when a reaction with the expression of A has happened, only reactions whose propensity is a function of A are updated. Dependency graph removes the disadvantages of tau-leaping and keeps propensities accurate.

    Both of these two classes of methods have several drawbacks. Skin tests requires well trained medical workers; these tests themselves may result in hypersensitive response, hence are not suited for ones with severe allergy; prick test is painful, some children and their parents are not willing to do such test; also, anti-allergy medicines like antihistamine drug and cortisone, can interfere the test, increasing the possibility of yielding false negative result.
    Serological tests for IgE is more safe and accurate, since it only requires blood sample, and the influences of most anti-allergy drugs on the concentration of serum IgE is negligible. In addition, serum IgE assay can be operated by technicians without systematic medical training. However, serological tests are much more expensive, and requires relatively long time.
    These drawbacks motivate us to develop a novel allergen test method combining the advantages of skin test and serological assay, which we called ATM (allergen test master). ATM is a high cost-effective method based on yeast whole cell biosensor, which can be operated in vitro by people without any medical training, and capable of giving out test results within 24 hours.

Since this is our university's first participation in iGEM, we asked many experienced iGEM teams for advice before we started. We got really helpful replies by the teams Frankfurt, Goettingen and Bielefeld.
Moreover we got visited by some members of the iGEM team TU Darmstadt, which told us about their project and listened to our project ideas, so that we could exchange views on these subjects. They also raised our awareness for a healthy atmosphere in the team, which is why we focused also on team building measures during our project.

The graph seems to suggest that the two subunits of OBP2A may not be interacting in vivo. This can be inferred from the fact that the millers activity of the OBP2A sample lies lower than the negative controls from within the experiment. As a result of this information, one more assay will be prepared in which the two subunits will be switched with regards to the bacterial two hybrid vectors to eliminate any possibility of this being a factor effecting the interaction between the two subunits.

Ethical Outreach
Additionally, we wish to make easy to understand videos explaining exactly what we're doing, and the biological, ethical and safety issues associated with our work, in a form that is both engaging and entertaining for the public. We sent out a survey on what people feel are the ethical issues surrounding our project.
The main ethical issues people have noticed were bioterrorism, accidental release and playing god. we will address these issues in the Safety and Ethics section.
Other Outreach
The Leeds iGEM team have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to talk to sixth-formers attending summer schools and experience days at the University. We are also going to go into local schools and spread the word about Synthetic Biology to students and get them involved.
19th July Outreach Session
On the 19th of July, Paul , Emily and Dan ran a workshop with a group of sixth-form students about Synthetic Biology, our project and the ethical concerns that comes with it.
We started with a short presentation about iGEM, SynBio and our project, MicroBeagle , before getting them into groups and asking them to come up with their own ideas about ethics and what concerns they had when it came to undertaking biological research. Here are some of the main ideas they came up with:
Testing on animals or humans - could be harmful/have side effects/immoral?
Is saving endangered species unnatural?
Do the risks outweigh the losses? Do the risks outweigh the benefits?
Is the thing we're making lethal? Making harmful substances?
Religion ""don't alter what's being created""- playing God, sanctity of life
Getting the consent of the government to do the research
Bioterrorism - risk of the research getting into the wrong hands, weaponizable - mass destruction, chemical weapons, wiping out species
What is the public's opinion on the work being done?
Damaging the ecosystem- escape from the lab could harm natural ecosystems
Effects on the economy - if GM Crops are produced which can destroy industry dependent to the country
Harmful to humans - potentially dangerous eg. GM Crops with unknown side effects
Who controls what has been created? Intellectual Property?
Cloning to make superhumans (maybe a few too many sci-fi movies?)
Science can be swayed by politics
Is it right to spend lots of money on research during a recession?
Genetic modification is unnatural, going against nature, people don't want GM crops
Where does it stop?
After the groups fed back to the front of the theatre, we then wanted to see how many of the students felt these were valid concerns"
Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of the fish tag [2]. Cornell iGEM’s main goal was creating an efficient and localized drug delivery system that, unlike with current antibiotic treatments, does not have significant drug escape into the environment. FDA-approved, biocompatible, and environmentally safe PLGA polymer will used to create the peptide hydrogel [3].
Future Work
FishBIT is a novel solution to drug delivery in fish. While it is a great method of delivering flavocide to sick fish, we at fishPHARM believe in always challenging ourselves to find new and better solutions. While working on a formula and dosing for Flavocide is our number one priority, we will also be exploring new ways of delivering the time-released medication to affected fish. One possible future method of delivering Flavocide would be a pneumatic injection system, which injects individual capsules in fish for rapid and accurate delivery. This system would make treating fish a much less time-consuming process, and would increase the appeal of the fishPHARM BCWD treatment method.

Abstract
    Synthetic genetic oscillators have long been of interest to the scientific community. Our team has constructed a special oscillator gene circuit manipulating two quorum sensing autoinducers to change periodically, and reach their peak value alternately. Inspired by Enigma machine, we intend to use our oscillator circuit to make a biological cipher machine, which is able to encrypt and decipher information consisting of two basic elements. In our design, green and red fluorescence stand for two basic elements of input and output. When one protein reaches its threshold value, a corresponding gene circuit will be triggered, either to retain the original element, or to change it to the other one. Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered. We hope this design can be an innovative attempt to apply synthetic biology to information safety from the aspect of interdiscipline.
The video below intends to introduce our project as the enigma machine.

In this case, the free interaction energy resulted in closer figures, which means that all the showed models must be taken into consideration. From all of this information as well as the obtained interaction structure models, it seems that there is a lower possibility of interaction in the case of TetR protein and the Swi6 chromo shadow domain than in the case of the TetR protein and the BAM Sir3 protein domain. As a consequence, the recombinant protein TetR::Swi6CDS should fold itself in an appropriate way to allow individual domain functionality.

Collaboration with NTU
Since  long ago, We’ve  had close relationship with NTU-Taida  iGEMers. By inviting them for a iGEMers fest, meeting with each other,  technique assistance and having FUN together, we elevate the quality of our  projects. As a result, we, NMYU-Taipei team collaborated with NTU-Taida again!!
In similar, both NMYU-Taipei and NTU-Taida team did bacteria engineering. In our projects, we utilized  cyanobacteria to remove several pollutants inside our environment. Moreover, we  try to achieve Venusian goals. Fortunately, NTU-Taida had a powerful promoter,  a thermosensitive promoter, phs, which is suitable for gene expression on Venus  (high temperature environment). So NTU-Taida help us to create two new plasmid,  phs-CysI and phs-SQR.
 
 
In NTU-Taida’s project, they  want to create a impotent E.coli which help people to lost weight. The gene  express function is quite important in their artificial E.coli. That’s the  reason why we help NTU-Taida to quality control their bacteria. To test the  plasmid removal rate of bacteria the incubated three plasmid transformed  E.coli, IR, tnpR, SmBC and diluted in to 10-7, 10-8, 10-9  three different concentration. Then we incubated E.cloi in LB solid agar  plate and calculated the colonies of each group. We found out that the same  result we got as NTU-Taida did. That is to say, they got a reliable data, also  we successfully quality controlled of their E.coli.
 
The result indicates that tnpR, SmBC transformed  E.coli have much more E.coli colonies, compared to the IR tansformed E.coli. In  other words, IR have higher removal rate that is the same as our expected.

We looked further into the regulations of biotechnology products in Canada and the United and tried to find any piece of legislation that mentioned the regulation of cell-free systems. Within Canada and the United States they do not regulate the methodology of how products are made; they focus on the end product. While we could not find any specific mention of ""cell-free"", Ian was able to clarify within our interview as to why we were unable to find any direct mentions. However, the piece of legislation that we could find that was the most associated with our project is the Assisted Human Reproduction Act in Canada as it prohibits transplanting human-based materials into non-human life forms. From our research, we have been able to determine that cell-free systems are indirectly regulated by existing legislation. Moving forwards with the rapid growth of the biotechnology industry as a whole, it will be pertinent that those involved with the scientific community work with law-makers to develop regulations that are comprehensive enough to capture the growth of the industry to the best of their abilities.

Determination of immobilized β2-MG concentration
1. Standard for immobilized β2-MG concentration
We have known that the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is very sensitive to the                             topographic changes on the substrate surface. When the β2-MG and GA are                             crosslinked and fixed on the substrate surface, the topographic structure of the surface                             will be changed to a certain extent affecting the orientation of the liquid crystal                             molecules. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the concentration of                             immobilized β2-MG on the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell. With the                             decrease of the concentration of immobilized β2-MG, the perturbation to the                             orientation of liquid crystal molecule decreases, and the optical imaging of liquid crystal                             cell gradually darkens. Only a few speckles appear in the optical imaging of liquid crystal                             cell, which tend to be all-black background. The highest immobilized β2-MG                             concentration, which can keep the optical imaging background dark, is fixed on the substrate                             surface when sufficient antigen and antibody reactions are required.
2. Result
Keeping other conditions unchanged,the concerntration of β2-MG is in the range of 250ng/mL to 1000ng/mL,                             and the results are shown in Fig. 4.

From the experimental results, the results show when the concentration of β2-MG                             fixed to the substrate surface is under 500 ng/mL, only a few bright spots appear in the                             optical imaging of the liquid crystal cells gradually darkening, approaching the full black                             background. When the concentration of β2-MG is above 500 ng/mL, the optical                             imaging appears obvious bright spot which is becoming brighter gradually.

Solution
In order to combat excess fluoridation of water in third world countries, we envision solutions that utilize the recently discovered fluoride riboswitch, a structured piece of RNA that kind interact with fluoride and regulate the expression of a downstream gene. We envision technologies utilizing fluoride riboswitches that can be used to sequester, bioremediate, or detect fluoride in water. We think these strategies can be used in cell-free and cell based systems. However, before we can work on developing these technologies we first needed to better characterize the responsiveness of fluoride riboswitches and develop a way to select for riboswitches with a higher responsiveness to fluoride.
Introduction
The Impacts of Excess Fluoride:
Fluoride is present in all bodies of water. Within the oceans, rivers, lakes, and groundwater, the mineral is existent and the extent to which fluoride is present depends on the amount of sediments or volcanic rocks being eroded in the area. It is when fluoride concentrations are at the toxic level when health concerns can arise. The FDA recommends that fluoride concentrations in water do not exceed 0.7mg/mL, while the World Health Organization (WHO) limit is 1.5mg/L, and the Environmental Protection Agency designation for contaminated water is 4 mg/L. Fluoride concentrations at or above 1 mg/kg of body weight are deemed poisonous. Ingesting this amount in one sitting requires immediate medical attention. While constantly being exposed to 10 mg/L to 6 mg of fluoride everyday can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis, in which the teeth and bones decay and deform. More severely, doses above 4.5 mg/kg body weight can cause developmental and reproductive concerns. Therefore fluoride concentrations can affect the growth and the IQ of people. In countries like China, India, and Sri Lanka, water sources are decentralized and residents in some areas experience concentrations of fluoride as high as 30 mg/L (Figure 1).

Human Practices
Overview
 
 
 
As the human practices part of Southampton’s entry to iGEM  2009 we have looked at the issue of science communication. Continuing work done  by team Heidelberg in 2008 we saw that good communication is essential for  people outside of the scientific community to make good decisions.  Sensationalism can do unnecessary permanent damage to perfectly good science.
 
We decided to approach this from 3 angles:
An outreach event will be run for school age children on the  basis that if they are educated from early on they will not get swept up by  media attention. We hope this event will become a mainstay of Southampton  University’s outreach program in the future.
 
A light hearted video detailing our iGEM experience will be  created to encourage people new to the competition and hopefully help them  avoid some of the pitfalls that we found ourselves in.
 
The third angle is to contact local members of parliament  and find out their views and how they represent their constituents on the issue  of synthetic biology.

2. Detection Limit
It is important to know the minimum amount needed to distinguish the fluorescence signal under the blue light box by naked eye, in order to understand at which stage of influenza latency can be viral RNA be detected. We have mixed 2uM aptamer (N2-694 and N9-545 aptamers) with different concentration of its target (i.e.1.5uM, 1uM, 0.5uM, 0.2uM, 0.1uM and 0.05uM) and performed aptamer refolding assay as usual.
3. Ion Dependency
As the test sample will be individuals’ nasal fluid, we wondered if the addition of nasal fluid will influence the RNA aptamer folding, for instance, the ionic composition in nasal fluid.  We have selected sodium ions, potassium ions, calcium ions and magnesium ions in different concentration to test for the fluorescent signals given from our 2 probes (N2-694 and N9-545 aptamers). Ions were added to aptamer folding buffer in form of salt solution. Concentration of different ions in nasal fluid, in aptamer folding buffer are shown below.
The range of concentrations selected for each ions are shown below. Those red number indicate the original amount of ions presented in the aptamer folding buffer.
Optimization of Aptamer Folding Condition
In order to trace the change in fluorescence signal with the time and temperature, BioRad real-time PCR machine was employed for the monitoring fluorescence signal during the aptamer refolding assay using SYBR Green Mode.
E. coli Expression of RNA Aptamer Probes
Although our project aims to produce a probe outside the context of a cell, the screening of probes is cheaper if they can be expressed and tested in E. coli. Moreover, it would allow our future iGEMers to be able to use our probes in their usual contexts, which is in a chassis like E. coli. To test if this is applicable, we co-expressed the probes and targets using the Novagen Duet vector system. While we modified pRSFDuet-1 vector to generate a T7 promoter-based aptamer expression system, we also cloned the target genes into the multiple cloning site of pACYCDuet-1. The resulting constructs are as follows (Fig. Below).
While the RNA aptamer probes are immediately following the T7"

Degredo PETronum!
ABSTRACT
The usage of polyethylene  terephthalate-PET (as like plastic bottles or textiles)  is one of the big problems of our era. Many plastic bottles are not reusable and are not safe for hot liquids or for use in dishwashers or microwaves. Some tougher, reusable plastic bottles may cause cancer. The main disadvantage of plastic bottles is that so many of them end up in landfills instead of being recycled. It takes thousands of years for plastic bottles to biodegrade, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air. We may alter the destiny of plastic in useful way.
Our Abstract in French!
Degrado PETronum La présence de poly-téréphtalate d'éthylène (PET) dans le plastique, comme celui des bouteilles, est l’un des problèmes majeurs de notre époque. La plupart des bouteilles plastiques ne sont pas réutilisables. Et les plus robustes, réutilisables, pourraient être impliquées dans des cancers. Le principal inconvénient des bouteilles en plastique est que nombre d'entre elles finissent dans les décharges au lieu d'être recyclées. Il faut plusieurs centaines d’années pour que ces bouteilles se dégradent,et leur dégradation est à l’origine d’émission de toxine dans l’air. Grâce à ce projet, l’environnement serait débarrassé des PET tout en produisant du pyruvate qu'E.coli serait capable d’utiliser comme source de d’énergie en l’incorporant à son cycle cellulaire. Nous allons dégrader le PET en catéchol. Puis, ce catéchol résultera en pyruvate par le 2-hydroxymuconate.
OUR MISSION
Our project aims to clean enviroment with the degredation of PET to pyruvate by E.coli. With this project,while  the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E.coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new source. We divide"
