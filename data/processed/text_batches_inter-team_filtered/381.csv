Heeyy!! What’s up?? Today we’re going to do plasmid’s DNA extraction from the colonies that amplified the fragments of interest. Either to bioremediation, accumulation or detection.
Electrophoretic profile of the plasmid’s DNA extraction:
1 – 6: pBSK with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation.
7 – 13: pSB1C3 with BB_Essential + E0840.
14 – 20: pSB1C3 with BB_Essential + K346004.
Yaaaay!!! Our extraction worked! To confirm that bio bricks are actually linked, we’re going to digest to release the fragment, by doing it, we can check its size. We selected the following samples:
We used the following system:
The digestion took 1 hour at 37°C.
Electrophoretic profile of enzymatic digestion with EcoRI and PstI:
1: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation not digested;
2 – 4: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation cut with EcoRI e PstI;
5: BB_Essential + E0840 not digested;
6 – 8: BB_Essential + E0840 digested with EcoRI e PstI;
9: BB_Essential + K346004 not digested
10 – 12: BB_Essential + K346004 digested with EcoRI e PstI.
As we can see on the electrophoretic profile, the samples, BB_Essential + K346004 worked, with the PSB1C3 on the top and under it is the biobrick!
However... we have a tricky molecular question! We produced the enzymatic system to release our bio brick, but it didn’t release the BB_Essential + E0840 and BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation (samples 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8)!!! Why"

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended the appropriate safety courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we participated in a general molecular biology workshop to refresh our memory of techniques used in molecular biology.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. This week we also divided up into our respective groups for the project and decided research priorities.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
We examined three problems related to ferritin. Firstly, we investigated protein isolation of ferritin. We are considering the protocols created by Santambrogio et al. (1993), as they have been used by multiple other authors as well. This paper uses precipitation followed by column chromatography, and verification with spectroscopy, PAGE and SDS-PAGE (Levi et al., 1994). Alternatively, we may consider using His-tags for Ni-NTA column purification.
Secondly, we examined the feasibility of using magnetism to manipulate ferritin. Commercial horse spleen ferritin was tested on a magnetic Dynabead rack, and as expected, it did not move, as the core should not be magnetic. We must thus synthesize magnetoferritin wherein the native ferrihydrite core is converted to magnetite--a paramagnetic material which can be attracted to magnetic fields (Jordan et al., 2010 & Wong et al., 1998). We were able to attain"

. I understand that booking a space that can accommodate 3000 individuals is not inexpensive. I also understand that hiring personnel to look after hundreds of judges, thousands of students, and millions in expenses does not come cheap either. But like you yourself have said, without us students, iGEM is a waste of effort. These figures require significant institutional backing and support, and not every institution can defend this expense, let alone afford it as an annual occurrence. It's a shame that there are so many students who cannot afford to participate in this educational experience because of the price tag you've set.
This price is very difficult to justify after looking at audit statements made publicly available on the iGEM website
. From 2011 to 2014, net assets for the iGEM Foundation have nearly doubled ($238,919 in 2011 to $447,045 in 2014), with a significant drop in 2013 (down to $66,550) and rise in 2014 (up to $447,045). Below are a few figures detailing the changes in iGEM's expenses and revenues from 2011.
The above plots were generated from
,
,
, and
. A detailed spreadsheet containing all prices and estimates can be found in
. Note that all 2015 values are estimates based on information from audit statements, and the number of teams participating each year. More detailed information can be found in the spreadsheet.
To highlight the point I'm making, iGEM had a net increase in assets of $380,495 USD in 2014. Bearing in mind that the iGEM Foundation is a non-profit organization, I repeat myself: this is an exorbitant price to pay.
I would like to see over the next couple years a significant effort on iGEM's part to reduce the fees to the competition. Not only for the sake of saving money, but for opening up the competition to less privileged individuals. This year the high school teams will be a part of the Giant Jamboree, and there has been a push in the last few years to integrate high schools into the competition. But if affording over $30,000 USD is difficult for university teams, it is near impossible for many high schools to afford this. Without significantly reducing entry costs, it is of my opinion that the High School Track will not bear fruit worth the investment.
Registration and attendance fees are funds being put forward by university faculties and departments, by organizations and fundraising efforts. Summed over all the teams involved"

NTNU-Trondheim,2013,Team:NTNU-Trondheim#Press#examplePage_-_-_TEXT.html," Vibrio cholerae genomic DNA and made into a basic part. The promoter was then placed upstream of an rbs.sfGFP part using 2AB assembly.
Characterization
By cotransforming this reporter plasmid and the expression plasmid (see above) we were able to measure the strength of ctx promoter (Pctx) induction by ToxR.
Data
See Expression Plasmid Data above.
Function
The human estrogen receptor is known to dimerize around estradiol. By fusing the human estrogen receptor to ToxR, we can create an estradiol biosensor and potentially an estradiol-inducible system in E. coli.
Assembly
The estrogen receptor was refactored to optimally express in E. coli and assembled using designed oligos and PCA (polymerase cycling assembly). The final protein was made into a basic part. Various sub-sections of the estrogen receptor were PCR amplified as basic parts in order to create truncations that might display different responses to estradiol (see figure). The estrogen receptor was fused to ToxR’s C-terminus with Gly-Ser linkers and thus exposed to the periplasm when expressed in the cell.
Characterization
In order to characterize the system, the different truncations of estrogen receptor fused to ToxR were tested with a plate reader. In our control condition, no estrogen was added. For the experimental condition, 1uM of estradiol was added to the solution.
Data
Below are the results of the plate reader data for our control and experimental conditions described above. We find that there is no truncation of estrogen receptor that gives an estradiol-inducible system; however, we are optimistic about trying other truncations and ToxR fusions that might lead us to an estrogen biosensor.

BioBrick Transformation
Last Thursday, the primers VF2 and VR arrived. These primers allow a confirmation of a succesful transformation of most BioBrick parts by means of PCR. The resulting fragment length depends on the specific BioBrick DNA.
Using VF2 and VR, a colony PCR are was conducted with all colonies that were obtained with chemical competent cells so far. Two colonies with the yeast ADH1 promoter (No. 1 and 2, see left photo) and three colonies with a GFP generator (No. 3-5, see left photo) were identified as positive. Thus, all colonies are positive, but the transformation efficiency is too low, since the result was only one or zero colonies per transformation attempt.
Electroporation should give higher efficiencies. An attempt with a new BioBrick ( ADH1 terminator ) resulted in 69 colonies! Ten of them were analysed using PCR. The resulting fragment should have a length of 461 bp, but from the eigth positive colonies fragments between 650-750 bp were obtained (see right photo). This is probably due to a mutation which might result in a different binding location for one of the primers. Another explanation might be that the denoted length is wrong. Since this BioBrick is not important for our project, it will be disregarded.
L= HyperLadder I (BIOLINE)
N= Negative control
Numbers= See text
The transformation efficiency of the electroportation was significant higher than of the chemical competent cells. Therefore, an own stock of electric competent cells was made.
Agar plug assay
TR235 (E. coli with construct to detect adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces) arrived from Princeton (Thomas J. Silhavy). Cells are viable, growth curve done. 11µm PS beads shown to be moved by bacteria (MG1655); we observed ‘jiggling’ of beads when bacteria present (not seen in no-bacteria control). Also, we observed significant movement in different directions (distances of approx 1x to 5x length of the beads by eye) of beads that were close together, suggesting that movement was not due to currents in the medium. We saw no distance covered in almost all the control beads, a few moved small distances, so some currents"

Recently, Mexico has suffered budget cuts in the science development area, actually in 2016, the government subtracted 7 thousand million mexican pesos (which equals 350,000,000 USD) from the funds destined for the National Chamber of Science and Technology. Meaning there are less funds for investigation and technology (Hernández, 2016). The shirts had 3 different phrases and colors and we made our marketing campaign with #IsupportScience.
In order to raise funds for the project and spread the word on science, we developed a campaign in which we sold sports t-shirts with labels promoting science.

Note that the vertical coordinate is logarithmic. We can see that after $k_h = 2$, the strength stabilizes at a very low value, and that the change of strength around $k_h=0$ is very dramatic, reaching up to 3 orders of magnitude. Some microtubule-stabilizing agents mainly take effect by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis. Figure 5 explains how this is possible and indicates that this effect is significant on the yeast surface as well. This result confirms that our plan to use the microtubules displayed on the yeast surface to screen microtubule-stabilizing agents will be very effective.
Comparison between Simulation Results and Experimental Results
Our teammates in wet lab were able to successfully assemble microtubules on the yeast surface and used High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) to obtain images of the microtubules (click here to see the images). Although we did not have time to conduct enough experiments to test all aspects of our model, a simulation under the conditions in this experiment can provide a simple and direct verification of the validity of our model.
According to the conditions in the experiment, we set the initial concentration of tubulin dimers to be $1.0 \ \mu \text{M}$, the volume of the system to be $100 \ \mu \text{L}$, the total number of yeasts to be $6000$, and $k_h = 0$ (since Taxol® is present in a large amount). The simulation gave us an average microtubule length of around $400 \ \text{nm}$ and about $10^3$ microtubules on each yeast. This result is consistent with our observations under HRTEM. We saw that there were a lot of microtubules formed on each yeast. Although we could not count the exact number, one can confidently say that our estimation of around $10^3$ is reasonable. The lengths of the microtubules were mostly within $200$ ~ $400 \ \text{nm}$, which is in accordance with"

Methan<b>E.COLIc</b> : Decreasing the Greenhouse effects and Saving the workers life in one system
MethanE.COLIc : Decreasing the Greenhouse effects and Saving the workers life in one system
Firedamp explosions are frequently seen cases at all mines over the world. In Turkey every year, 50 miners lose their lives because of firedamp explosions. Firedamp is a flammable gas found in coal mines and it mainly contains methane. Beside its explosive property, methane is also the main contributor to global warming. However recent mine mechanisms release obtained methane into air. By offers of Synthetic biology, we aimed to design a device which will work on E.coli that provides solutions for side effects of methane. Device that we are planning to construct involves the genes of bacteria (Methylococcus capsulatus) and insect (Drosophilia melanogaster). Our compact system in E.coli is fabricated as sensation of methane, the conversion of methane to methanol and then entrapment of methanol to handle for biofuel and death of bacteria at 42 C by kill switch mechanism.
When project is analyzed in stepwise, there are successive 4 steps of our modelled system in modified organism. As mentioned in subtitles,  methane is sensed, then converted to methanol and methanol is entrapped and to elute methanol the cells are dead.

Introduction
MethanE.COLIc project is designed to solve one of the problems on worker security in mines of Turkey , by constructing the natural parts of organisms. The main reason for us to choose such a project is that in Turkey- and also in many countries- each year, huge numbers of  workers in mines lost their life due to deficiencies  and conditions in their working areas (mines). The release of Grizu gas leads to subsidence of mines and so death of workers.This project is also designed to solve one of universal problem; global warming. Methane gas is a potential greenhouse gas.This project focuses on sensing the ambient methane gas and converting to one of the bio-fuel sources, methanol. Methanol is entrapped by product of one of the constructs of project, and then cells are dead by kill switch device of project to elute methanol.

Milk Agar Plate Results
The results of our milk agar assay from 7/04/13 of the non-transformed B. subtilis strain WB700:
The zone of clearing around the B. subtilis colonies indicates that our parent strain breaks down milk. Its prominent endogenous protease activity prevents us from using the milk agar assay as a screen for successfully transformed kerA-expressing B. subtilis.
Alternative method to screen for transformed B. subtilis needed:
The feather assay used in Saha and Dhanasekaran’s 2010 paper, “Isolation and Screening of Keratinolytic Actinobacteria form Keratin Waste Dumped Soil in Tiruchirappalli and Nammakkal, Tamil Nadu, India”
Quantitative assay using azokeratin

The above two experiments show that the modified synNotch can be located on the surface of cell membrane normally and release intracellular domain after receiving external signals. The replacement of intracellular domain with TEV has no effect on the function of synNotch.
Eukaryotic verification of TEV activation transcription system based on modified tetR
As mentioned earlier, inducible promoters using transcription activator factors that cannot inhibit transcription often have some leakage due to background expression.
However, our system hopes to realize the absolute function of 0/1 switch, and the background expression is what we do not expect. Therefore, we need to find a transcription activation system with very low background expression.
Coincidentally, the previous team iGEM 2017 Oxford was making a similar attempt. They have designed TEV activation transcription system based on the modified tetR. Although they have not fully proved that the system can work effectively due to time constraints, we believe that their theoretical basis for designing the system is reasonable. Therefore, we attempt to verify their system with eukaryotic cells.

Organism
Most of our work this summer is founded upon the diverse metabolism of the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Throughout the summer, we came to better understand how to work with this organism, and we hope our findings will help establish S. oneidensis as a interesting chasis for synthetic biology.
So, who is this ""Shewie""?
This summer we worked with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a gram-negative facultative anaerobe (Myers and Myers 1997).  Under anaerobic conditions, it reduces a number of electron acceptors such as MN(IV).  This ability can be harnessed by microbial fuel cells (MFC) to produce an electric current (Bretschger et al. 2007).  When the bacteria are grown anaerobically in the anode chamber of an MFC, they release electrons onto the electrode, creating an electrical current.  These diverse respiratory capabilities require a complex electron transport systems, including 39 c-type cytochromes (Heidelberg et al. 2002).  These characteristics of S. oneidensis MR-1 make it an important organism for toxin-reduction based bioremediation and biotechnology applications.
Molecular Biology with Shewanella oneidensis
The Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 genome was sequenced in 2002, greatly increasing its usefulness as a model organism.  It was found that it had a 4,969,803 base pair circular chromosome and a 161,613 base pair plasmid (Heidelberg et al. 2002).  When cloning in S. oneidensis MR-1, it has also been shown that plasmids with p15A origins replicate freely, whereas plasmids with a pMB1 origin of replication do not (Myers and Myers 1997).  We further found that the pSC101* origin from Lutz and Bujard (2007) and the CloDF3 origin on the pCDF-Duet vector from Novagen work in S. oneidensis.  However"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," combination of both the HC and LC together. Luckily, we were able to obtain the wt plasmid from Dr. Binz.
Our professors also contacted the regional council. On DNA level, we cleaved the light chain (LC) from the heavy chain (HC) and our PIs stored the HC like the wild type plasmid. We only had access to the in itself atoxic LC. Throughout our project we always handled LC and HC separately. Furthermore the wt plasmid was stored by our professors. After our cleavage work our PIs transformed the plasmid into E.coli in a S2 laboratory to prepare the sample for sequencing. After it was ensured that the cleavage was successful we were able to go on with the rest of our project.
At this point, we were allowed to work with our botox LC with the admission from our PIs, our university and the regional council which is the governmental authority for safety in universities and research in general.
The iGEM Safety Committee
As it is especially important to iGEM that the projects of their contestants are safe we asked the committee whether we were allowed to continue with our project and gave them all our available information. They agreed that once we were able to prove the successful detoxification we could continue to work on it. The only limitation is that our submitted parts with botox will not be included in next years distribution kit due to possible toxicity. We also had to fulfill the iGEMs safety forms thoroughly.  Additionally we talked to the iGEM safety officer in person at the European Meetup in Munich.  Through this procedure we wanted to completely ensure that we could work with our project safely.
University and Institutes
Our next issue was that we were working in two different labs in two different institutes. We needed a security clearance and talked with Mrs. Dr. Fuss who is responsible for the safety in the cell culture department because our assays needed to be executed with our cell culture and we therefore had to work with botox in the lab. According to her, we were only allowed to work with proteins in her lab but not with DNA. As we ensured the director of the interfaculty institute for biochemistry Prof. Dr. Jansen of the safety of our project an additional concern from another professor came up: we had to be careful of how our project would be represented in the media concerning possible risks.
After assuring our institute director that we thought about all concerned security measures we had to inform him and all other working groups about the major processes of our project including the start of every next step.  Next up was contacting"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Due to the instability of the experimental results we have done before, we need to detect the                             antigen concentration and antibody concentration, and use several extreme antigen                             concentrations                             to determine whether there is a problem with our antigen concentration.

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the exhibition was a series of talks, the Leonardo Art Science Evening Rendezvous (LASER). This talk featured a number of artists who explore the relationship between science and art. Among them was filmmaker Mary Tsang, who recently released DIYSECT, a documentary on DIY Biology and the influence that it had on the scientific and artistic community. In her talk, she mentioned that a number of community Biology laboratories had been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding their responsibility to remain vigilant of the possibility of individuals misusing synthetic biology to cause harm and damage.
This was a stark reminder that while all of us participating in iGEM seek to use synthetic biology to create beneficial technologies, it does have the potential to raise threats and cause serious harm. As a team, we discussed this in depth over the next few weeks and came to an agreement that as synthetic biologists, we do have a responsibility to be aware of what happens in our field. We felt that there is no need to treat our fellow synthetic biologists with suspicion, as the tone of the FBI appeared to recommend. However, we agreed with the fact that we have an obligation to not only conduct our own projects and experiments ethically, but to ensure that others in our field do so as well.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#MBPconstruction_-_-_TEXT.html," and gray bars indicate other α-helices of MerR. The red line indicates the SSG linker, and the blue and green lines indicate the loop after the dimerization loop and the region after the loop, respectively. Orange dots indicate cysteines involved in Hg(II) binding[6]. (C) Predicted structure of resulted metal binding peptide. Mercury ions are indicated as black balls in metal binding pockets.
Earlier work provides us a deeper insight into the metal recognition mechanism of MerR family. Kathryn et al. constructed a hybrid regulatory protein containing the DNA binding domain of MerR and the Metal binding domain of ZntR, which showed an altered specificity to MerR’s promoter but responding to zinc[3], which suggested that the DNA binding domain and metal binding domain of MerR family function modularly to some extent. Since our bioabsorbent needs high metal binding affinity and selectivity, we then took a closer look at the metal binding mechanism and the structure of the C-terminal binding domain.
MerR family TFs share a high similarity at the C-terminal metal binding domain (Fig. 3), which indicates a similar metal recognition mechanism and metal-protein complex structure. The key factor of the remarkable selectivity and sensitivity seems to be the preorganization of geometries suited for specific metal ions through folding of the metal-binding domains in these proteins [7]. To be specific, previous mutagenesis study shows that MerR dimer binds one Hg(II) ion in a bridge fashion between the two monomers[8], and Hg (II) adopts a three-coordinate Hg-(S-Cys)3-binding mode by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy[9], though there is no crystal structure available. As is known, single α-helix has a high tendency to be oligomerized. The outer electron configuration of Hg (II) is 5d106s0, and it tends to form a complex, especially with sulfur. All these evidences above indicate that the C-terminal metal binding domain can act as a mercury accumulator without the help of the N-terminal DNA binding domain. Luckily, Qiandong Zeng et al. constructed an N-terminal deletion mutant (contain only residue 80-120) that can form a stable dimer and retain high affinity for Hg (II) [2]. This work reinforces the idea of tandeming two metal binding domains together to make a high performance and less energy consuming metal binding peptide.

IvyTech_SouthBend_IN,2014,Team:IvyTech SouthBend IN#progress_-_-_TEXT.html," The next day we plated on TET and 2 % X-gal plates. 2% X-gal plates were made by Kevin using the protocol in PT’s lab binder. X-gal plates contain galactopyranoside which detects the activity of converting lactose into glucose and galactase. Betagalactosidase activity is present in our K1477014 due to the indication of a blue color on the IPTG and X-gal plates.
Ten 1.8 mL cryogenic vials with 50/50 of our cells from composite tube #1 and #2 and 40% glycerol were prepared and stored in the -80 freezer as reserve stock.
Performed an upstream and downstream cut of I712074 (T7 promoter), K112806(Endolysin) with pSB1AT3(destination plasmid). Plated and picked colonies waiting to see results. We named the endolysin part as K1477030. Plan for this week is to finish the proposal, finish our Endolysin part and put the alpha generator onto a chloramphenicol plasmid backbone.
Composite part (J23102 and I732020) on X-gal plates and regular ampicillin and tetracycline plates. The plates with no x-gal had white lawn growth with no red present.
Week of 6/22/14 through 6/28/14
Last week our team once again took the time to clean the IGEM box and autoclave everything inside the box including the pipettes. We were able to stop the contamination that seemed to be coming from the B.cereus. We are continuing to do everything in triplicates so our results would show replication and consistency.
Our K1477014 part which was ligated with J23102 (p-con) and I732020 (LacZoperon Mutant) onto a destination plasmid (pSB1AT3) transformants were selected on TET, however when white colonies where picked from the tetracycline plate expanded with the appropriate antibiotic and LB, rolled for an hour, plated and put in incubator overnight, only a red lawn growth would appear every single time and not a single white colony present or visible. Our team came to the conclusion that during the first steps of the ligation process we made an error.
We took all the resuspended tubes of J23102 and I73202 and purified by the miniprep procedure from a cell line derived from the electroporation of Top 10 cells on (05/25"

Sophomore, Major: Chemical Engineering, Favorite Food: Dried seaweed
Hi, I’m Cam, and I’m from the WASP nest of  Fairfield, Connecticut, but I was born in Paget, Bermuda. The Connecticut Skills™ that I bring to the table include: field hockey, rudimentary sailing, country club attire, golf, and tennis.
Outside of my work with iGEM, I’m the Programming Chair of the Engineering Student Council, I give admissions tours for the engineering school, and I lead a small group of freshmen in a Problem Solving Team (PST) for Chemical Engineering.
In my rapidly decreasing free time, I enjoy running, playing League of Legends, not eating actual food, and making terrible puns.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.

To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where Ntr"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," this fusion protein is of smaller size, which allowed us to include longer MD simulations in our tight schedule for simulation on our hardware.
Structural Analysis
In the initial step of the deimmunization workflow, we required a stable protein structure to be able to  evaluate the influence of possible point mutations. For this purpose, we performed two 50 ns MD simulations, the first using the isolated l-fucose Mutarotase (PDB ID: 2WCV) domain and the second the l-fucose isomerase/Ovispirin (PDB ID: 1HU5) fusion protein.  To simulate the proteins of our collaboration partner, we used the MD simulation software GROMACS, as it is a widely used tool with an excellent performance. For the force field we chose AMBER99SB, due to the fact that it is generally applicable and well established.

Figure 4: RMSD plot of the isomerase-domain of the L-fucose mutarotase-ovisprin fusion protein:
The RMSD has been calculated on the coordinates of the backbone atoms of the isomerase domain
The simulation of the FucU isomerase protein for 50 ns without AMP shows a RMSD of about 0.25 nm which indicates some minor conformational changes in the beginning of the simualtion, stabilizing in the last 20 ns of the simulation (Figure 2.1/2.2).
The simulation of the FucU isomerase together with the AMP ovispirin as subunit shows more drastic changes to the tertiary structure of the fusion protein. The RMSD value reaches a value of 0-7-0.8 nm in the time span of 50 ns. This can be explained by the fact, that we manually concatenated the isomerase protein with the crystal structure of the ovispirin protein"

NKU_CHINA,2018,Team:NKU CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," biophysical model which simulates the progress that LacI protein achieves transcriptional regulation by altering the probability of RNA polymerase binding to the PtetA promoter. (b) The distribution of tetA transcriptional level. Bars indicate the number of cells containing different tetA transcriptional levels. The distribution is obtained according to the lacI distribution and the relationship between lacI transcriptional level and glutamate concentration.
It can be seen that in the same community, the mRNA distribution of tetA is significantly different, and the system has high sensitivity, so tetracycline can be used to achieve separation of high-producers and low-producers.
Simulate Production Increase and Predict the Best Initial Condition
When tetracycline is added to the medium, we assume that the bacteria whose tetA mRNA expression is at a certain threshold can survive (that is, the intracellular glutamate concentration is at a certain threshold), and we hope to predict the threshold for maximizing the total production. The specific model is: set this threshold to m, and the bacteria can survive when the intracellular glutamate concentration is greater than m. And since the difference in the expression of glutamate is non-genetic, it can be considered that the glutamate remains normal distribution between 20 mM to 200 mM in the offspring after the bacterial division. Among these bacteria, also whose intracellular glutamate concentration is greater than m that can survive. Define ω as the ratio of the number of bacteria with intracellular glutamate concentration greater than m devide by the total number of bacteria:
(26)
The average glutamate concentration in these strains is:
(27)
Assume that the production of γ-polyglutamic acid is proportional to the intracellular glutamate content, that is:
(28)
Substituting equation (28) into the Logistic formula, and assume that tetracycline only affects the population growth rate and the initial bacterial number without changing the environmental capacity, that is, after adding a certain amount of tetracycline:
(29)
(30)
Simplified:
(31)
The total γ-polyglutamic acid concentration is:
(32)
Polyglutamic acid is a growth-coupled product in B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 [3]. For the growth coupled product, the Luedeking-Pieret formula which describes product synthes kinetics is:
(33)
Since X0 is negligible, Equation (33) has a consistent form with the predicted total γ-polyglutamic acid production Equation (32),  which confirms the correctness of the established model. Here we designed"

CpxA-CpxR is a two-component mechanism that is activated at pH 7.4 and repressed at pH 6.0. CpxA is an intermembrane protein that autophosphorylates at a certain external pH, CpxR (a kinase) then gets phosphorylated by CpxA and acts as a transcription factor. This system originally is a transcription factor for the virF gene, but virF was replaced with a reporter. The original sequence was found in Shigella sonnei, but E. coli has a homolog of these proteins so all that is required on the construct is the appropriate prefix/suffix and CpxR binding site (Nakayama and Watanabe, 1995; Nakayama and Watanabe, 1998).

Figure 3: Normalized fluorescent values from CpxR construct vs control (YGCP). The fluorescence per cell count stayed generally the same throughout the range of pH while the CpxR has a clear increase in fluorescence per cell. Credit: Sofia Chinea
The order from left to right in figure 1 is control pH 6-9 and then Experimental pH 6-9. These are showing the gradient change in expression accordingly with the change of pH due to a pH-dependent promotor compared to consistent expression accordingly with a promoter that is always ""on"". The main point is that the control at pH 6 has more expression of the yellow-green chromoprotein than the Experimental at pH 6. The pH-dependent promoter of the experimental group is down-regulated at pH 6 whereas the control is not. Also, there is an increase in YGCP expression between the experiment pH 7 and pH 8 that is not seen in the control between pH 7 and pH 8. The normalized data in figure 3 shows the relative expression of YGCP. The CpxA-CpxR construct can be found on the iGEM registry as: BBa_K2097000 , while the construct utilized as a control can be found on the iGEM registry as BBa_K2097002 as well as in figure 2.

Apr - May :
Decided to take part in “May Festival”, our university's festival with team UT-Tokyo, we talk about the software exhibited at that time.
Gamification -- turn non-game concepts into game -- is our main theme, because we think it is important to attract people who are not interested in synthetic biology to enjoyable games!
And after discussions, we create the “Memory Game”. This game uses BioBrick-like materials.(-> you can play it here )
This colorful game gathers visitors' attentions.
Jun - Jul :
Talking after talking.
We gather and talk about our projects a lot.
What we should create? What is its feature?
Aug - Sep :
Program the software, receive feedback from other teams as well as members, and improve.
On August 13th, we participate “iGEM JAPAN exchange meet-ups” and make a presentation.
And now, we prepare for the asia Jamboree.

Week2
7.16
    We chose mySQL as our database management system for its search functions. A program which could connect mySQL database and load data as well as using mySQL's search funcions was gotten.  .
7.17
    In the first meeting, our group divided into two parts:UI(part leader: Xiao Tong)& data(part leader:Mubing Zhou). UI members and data members works in pair. All the members made a draft of our project one--Bosearch and looked through partsregistry.org part by part carefully, so that we could choice the functions needed.
7.18
    In this day we determined three parts of our work: categories, search engine, and search result. We also disgusted the search methods. From now, all the members started our group-work with clear aims.
    Search Engine group included two members: Xiao Tong and Mubing Zhou. Their main work was to search keywords (or some other functions) which were input by user in the database and passed the summarized results to them. When user clicked one of the results for more details, the part-name was sent to Search Result group.
    Search Result group included six members: group leader Xin Yang, Deng Pan, Jingyao Guo, Qijia Cheng, Yidan Pan, Yujun Zhao. The main goal of this group was to create an interface to accept the result(part name) of bio-brick searching (which was sent by the SE group),showing the details of this part. In this part, loading database was the most important thing .
    Category group included four members: Chenchen Lv, Junqiu Zhang, Yiqi Jiang and Zili Fan. They would work on building category-formed-interface to show all the data in partsregistry.org, which simplifys the long spreadsheet into keyword-showing tables.

Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit
Note: all centrifugations should be carried out in a table-top microcentrifuge at > 12000 x g/10.000-14.000 rpm
Preparation
Excise gel slice containing the DNA fragment using a clean scalpel or razor blade. Cut as close to the DNA band as possible to minimize the gel volume. Place the gel slice into a pre-weighed 1.5 mL tube. Record the weight of the gel slice. Note: If the purified fragment will be used for cloning reactions, avoid damaging the DNA through UV light exposure. Minimize UV exposure to a few seconds or keep the gel slice on a glass or plastic plate during UV illumination.
Add 1:1 volume of Binding Buffer to the gel slice (volume:weigt)
Incubate the gel mixture at 50-60 °C for 10 min or until the gel slice is completely dissolved. Mix the tube by inversion every few minutes to facilitate the melting process. Ensure that the gel slice is completely dissolved. Vortex the gel buffer mixture briefly before loading on the column.
Check the color of the solution. A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA binding. If the color of the solution is orange or violet, add 10 µL of 3"
British_Columbia,2011,Team:British Columbia#Members_-_-_TEXT.html," fall. After my fantastic experience as a UBC iGEM team member last year, I decided to stay on the team for another great year of learning, research experience, friendship, and memories. This year, I am on the wetlab track once again and am working with the beta-pinene synthase to create a biobrick part and to overexpress it in yeast to characterize it under GPD and GAL promoters, with and without the erg20-2 and IDI1 gene.
Vicki Ma I completed a Bachelor of Science at UBC this year, and will be going to McGill in the fall to study Occupational Therapy with my fiance (we're recently engaged!) who is beginning his Masters in Medical Physics. This is my second year with UBC iGEM, and I am excited to share my experiences from last year as well as create new memories and stories from this year. My main wetlab role is to obtain limonene synthase from the biobrick registry and overexpress it in yeast for characterization purposes in order to meet the gold medal criteria. I am also assisting the beta-pinene synthase track to yield a variety of yeast plasmids for characterization purposes. At the same time, I am working on formatting and designing our wiki.
Joe Ho I am a 4th year science student at UBC, with the interest of virology and molecular genetics. I'm excited to discover what synthetic biology means to me, to my community, and to the world. For me, science is about making connections and iGEM is a great starting point! With previous lab experience in a medical science lab, iGEM offers another wonderful opportunity for me to explore other fields of science with the hope that one day both of these experiences will connect me to what I want to do in the future. My wetlab role for this project is on the cloning of alpha pinene monoterpene synthase into yeast cells while incorporating other parts to improve productions of monoterpenes. At the same time, I am part of the modelling team, using ArcGIS to simulate the spread of the pine beetle infestation upon introduction of our product.
Samuel Wu I've just finished my third year in engineering physics and joined the team to explore Synthetic Biology, a longtime fascination.  My role with the wet lab is to create a genetic construct for the dual expression of two genes (IDI1, HMG-2) encoding enzymes for the melavonate pathway, which supplies the substrate for the monoterpenes.  This construct will hopefully boost production of terpenes in yeast expressing a"

First we tested if our device allows small molecules like IPTG pass through the membrane (Figure 2). We put E.coli with a IPTG-induced green fluorescence protein inside the device.
Figure 2. We add IPTG to the solution outside the membrane. It promoters the expression of gfp inside the Warship successfully.
We also tested if the bacteria inside the device can get out (Figure 3).
Figure 3. We put microbes with different antibiotic-resistance outside and inside Warship respectively. They cannot pass through the membrane.
This device can ensure that the engineered bacteria will be alive in the intestines and is able to exchange matter with the outside of the device.
Model
This summer, we were trying to tracing abnormally high NO concentration in people's guts.  We want to simulate NO distribution in our bowels through modeling. We turn to the discussion of time-dependent diffusion processes, where we are interested in the spreading and distributing of NO with time.
Diffusion Equation
The equation for the rate of change of the concentration of particles in an inhomogeneous region, diffusion equation, also called 'Fick's second law of diffusion', which in this case relates the rate of change of NO concentration at a point to the spatial variation of the NO concentration at that point:$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial ^{2}c}{\partial x^{2}}$$
Figure 1. The net flux in a region is the difference between the flux entering fromthe region of high concentration (on the left) and the flux leaving to the region of low concentration (on the right). (Reference: P W Atkins. Atkins’ Physical chemistry, 7th Ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, 776)
Justification
Consider a thin slab of cross-sectional area A that extends from x to x+l.
Let the NO concentration at x be c at the time t. The amount (number of moles) of particles that enter the slab in the infinitesimal interval dt is JAdt, so the rate of increase in molar NO concentration inside the slab (which has volume Al) on account of the flux from the left is$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=\frac{JA\mathrm{d}t}{Al\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{J}{l}$$
There is also an outflow through the right-hand window. The flux through that window is J′, and the rate of change of NO concentration that results is$$\frac{\partial c}{\"

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," the RFP reporter, fused to any of the five promoters previously tested in step 3. Using a low-copy plasmid for the expression of reporter and dCas9 was a precautionary measure, as high levels of dCas9 can be toxic to the cells due to unspecific binding to other regions of the genome. Starting the experiments with only one reporter would allow us to easily establish how well each sgRNA represses the complementary promoter. The second plasmid was comprised of the sgRNAs and a high copy origin of replication (ori). Confining the sgRNAs to a separate vector is advantageous in that it can be easily substituted out for another vector, potentially detailing sgRNAs with a differing affinity to the promoter. This interchangeability can facilitate a ‘plug and play’ system to produce a multitude of expression levels with ease.
To select for a dual transformation, each vector backbone requires separate antibiotic resistances. Consequently, the high copy vector (containing sgRNAs) was given an chloramphenicol resistant cassette, the low copy backbone was given a erythromycin resistance cassette.
As a control, a sgRNA 0 was added to the library. The ‘SEED’ region of this sgRNA is not homologous to any of the promoters. This will act as a control, to signify how the expression will differ when inhibition is occurring. It will also serve later to increase the pool of possible expression patterns when we come to the random ligation experiments  . These were cloned using traditional type II restriction cloning with BsaI sites.
To construct the sgRNAs, primer dimers were PCR amplified to generate the initial fragments of the sgRNA, it’s promoter, and terminator; also with their complimentary BsaI sites. After digestion with BsaI, the fragments were linearly ligated to produce promoter-sgRNA-terminator ‘bricks’. These were then amplified using a set of ‘universal’ primers designed to be capable of amplifying all of our ‘bricks’, these primers were complementary to a multiple cloning site(MCS) flanking each brick we produced. These sgRNA bricks were then digested using this MCS and ligated into their associated high copy backbone.
Results
The above graph shows characterization of the sgRNAs. As you can see, gRNA3, 4 and 5 are repressing well. gRNA 1 and 2 have no repression, and PE shows that there is very little expression as a background level."

iGEM European meetup Munich
On Thursday the 19th of July we went with 4 group members to the European iGEM meetup of 2018. This was a three day event starting on Friday. It started with talks about biotechnology and physics behind synthetic biology. Afterwards we had a chance to get into touch with companies like DNA biosolutions and Promega. The conference ended with a poster session in which we had opportunities to present a poster of our project to 32 other teams from all around Europe. Afterwards we continued with a tour and some evening activities to finish it off.
On Saturday there was more talks about relevant topics in synthetic biology. We also had more opportunities to speak about our project and meet more iGEM teams. On top of that we had a workshop session. We had opportunities to do several workshops of which we followed one which was given by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. In the workshop we worked together with people from different teams to focus on the design and safety of a certain project.
On Sunday there was a short session with two more scientific talks and some inspiring words by Randy Rettberg, the President of the iGEM Foundation!. All in all we gave, and received, a  lot of feedback and additional ideas from other teams. We also gained great opportunities for some sweet collaborations with other iGEM teams.

Postcard collaboration
In order to people more aware about synthetic biology we collaborated with iGEM Düsseldorf. We made postcards of our own project to show what synthetic biology is and how this is related to the iGEM competition. A lot of other iGEM teams also designed their own postcards and all contributing teams received their respective post cards. We’ll be able to hand these out to people all over the world to show them how"

After our club members had enough background knowledge, we arranged lab courses in both our high school and Peking University for them to practice basic experiments.
The establishment of the iGEM club enables us to learn about synthetic biology in a constructive and supportive environment. Moreover, we were also impressed by questions asked by our team members, since these questions demonstrate not only understanding, but also application of knowledge. These questions forced us to review the mechanisms of molecular biology in more depth. And when teaching our club members about experimenting, we learned through their mistakes, often points that we forgot to point out, which strengthen our experimentation skills.
Street Science
In order to spread the idea of synthetic biology and genetic engineering, we held a street science exhibition at school during lunchtime on October 19th. We performed the DNA extraction from fruits with two steps: polarizing and extracting. Strawberries, salts, and detergents were prepared for the exhibition as raw materials of the experiment. In the first step, we mixed salts, ground strawberry jam, detergents, and water to differentiate nonpolar substance from cells. We put the mixture in water bath 60° Celsius, for 15 minutes to speed up the reaction. Then we put the final DNA solution into a beaker and poured the same amount of alcohol into the beaker. Feather-like substance sank down to the bottom of the beaker in a process known as ethanol precipitation.

Detailed Protocol
Acoustic Field
Sonic and ultrasonic waves could generate a pressure field to the cells adhering to the bottom of the cell dish. In our study of the sensitivity of mechanosensitive (MS) channel, we really found a most efficient sound frequency using buzzer and 108kHz ultrasonic transducer.
Fig. 10 B
Fig. 10 A
Fig. 10 (A) R-GECO+Piezo1 cell fluorescence intensity increased greatly when stimulated by 15K and 20KHz sound. While no obvious fluorescence intensity changed when GECO cells (without MS channel) were stimulated (B).
However, to quantitively define the relationship of channel opening ( considering the influence of energy or force difference), it was important to know the pressure field distribution on the cell layer under certain conditions. Mathematical analysis and finite element analysis (FEA) were used to define the modeling.
Audible Frequency Result Analysis
To discover the response of MS channels to audible vibration, buzzers, balanced amatures and speakers were tried as sonic stimulators applied to the cells with R-GECO and Piezo1 channel, but only buzzers induced obvious cell response significantly in high frequency conditions (15kHz and 20kHz) when they are attached to the bottom of a cell dish each time.
To explain that, a modal analysis method could be used when a buzzer was attached to the bottom of a cell dish, the shear stress induced by the asynchronism between cell culture medium and cell dish buzzer-forced oscillation is the driving factor of the channel response. It is interesting that the shear force magnitude in this condition is similar to the force magnitude in microfluidics channels.
Fig. 12 Buzzer attached on the bottom of cell dish
Fig. 11 Design pattern of the buzzer
Considering that the cell culture medium is a viscous and incompressible fluid with μ= 0.012dyn·s/cm2(0.0012Pa·s), it can not vibrate uniformly with the buzzer. The shear stress due to the differential distribution of fluidic velocity surrounding cell can apply a strain \gamma

What we could have done better
One thing we learned from this experience is that we should have aimed to contact the MPs early on in the process. We didn’t take into account the time frame that it would take for them to reply to us, and some said they will have a reply for us soon but for us it would have been too late as it is after the deadline. This was the case with Anneliese Dodd, MEP, however, we received her reply on the day of the deadline.  We learnt that when it comes to face-to-face interviews, the MPs are more willing to share information as well as their contacts in order to provide us with more help. We were able to have more of a discussion than an interview and even go out of script and learn more. We were even able to show him around the lab and show him our work. This was exemplified by interview
with Terry Westgate, a local councilor of Canterbury.
When it comes to a written interview, as in the case for the Italian Senator, he was able to provide us with detailed answers. When we contacted him, he was given more time to prepare, as he only needed to answer the questions we sent him. The downside to this method was that we had to keep the number of questions short, as he would have been less willing to help us due to his busy schedule. The same applies for Anneliese Dodd.
Engaging with MPs is not difficult, if you approach it right. The most important lesson we learnt was that we should have contacted them earlier. Our approach was to contact as many MPs from different political parties in order to compare the different opinions we receive. However, those with who have not been involved within science were less persuaded to answer us. But that doesn’t mean that some weren’t willing to try. But overall, the interviews we were able to conduct taught us more about our research and approach, and provided us with enough information to improve upon our work.
Franco Panizza - Italian Senator
Profile
Franco Panizza is an Italian Senator and the leader of the PATT ( Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party). He graduated from the University of Padua with a degree in Forestal Sciences. For many years he was part of the government of the Trentino Province, which is autonomously governed since 1946, being an area of dispute between Italy and Austria before then. Senator Panizza’s values and political activities aim at the development in the Province while maintaing a strong bond to Trentino’s rich historical heritage. While in the Senate, he"
BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," in its circular path of motion, the syringe pump will move different amounts with the same change in theta of the servo arm. This problem was overcome by developing an algorithm to ensure a constant flow rate is always achieved with Neptune given the specific values of the active servo and syringe, involving two lookup tables and linear extrapolation.
Modular Baseboard Implementation | Zach Lasiuk
The challenge of Neptune’s baseboard is to utilize a desktop CNC mill to achieve the functionality of a full machine shop. More specifically, Neptune’s baseboard must retain system expandability to arbitrary dimensions and maintain ease of use by providing places to auto-align components. This is done using an emerging standard in microfluidic hardware, the MEC board, developed by the GroverLab at University of California, Riverside. By creating these modular MEC squares that can be milled out one at a time and connected together. Neptune’s board can use a multitude of materials and even a combination of materials, currently tested with HDPE plastic, ABS plastic, and wood.
Created Parametric 3D Parts | Zach Lasiuk & Priya Kapadia
To ensure Neptune meets the requirements of any microfluidic experiment with different requirements for flow-rate and max volume to be dispensed, Neptune has completely parametric 3D parts. These parts hold and align the servo and syringe combination and enable the fluid motion of both. From 100mL to 10uL, Neptune’s 3D printed hardware will adjust in shape to accommodate different size syringes and servos to meet synthetic biologist’s experimental needs. While Neptune has tested servos and syringes on file to choose from by default, should a biologist need more volume to dispense or more precision in flow-rates they can input their own servo or syringe to obtain the exact response they desire. The final result is completely parametric 3D parts that adapt to a specific servo or syringe’s dimensions, enabling a massive amount of freedom for synthetic biologists in using Neptune.
Developed System Firmware | Zach Lasiuk
Reliability and repeatability of experiments are essential for Neptune to deliver results. The firmware developed for the Arduino Mega ensures these standards are met and maintained. Currently implemented, this firmware has the capability to work with both digital and analog servos, up to 13 servo shields stacked on top of the Arduino Mega (enabling the control of over 200 servos at once), control valves with instant motion, and control dispensers with variable flow-rates. In addition to working seamlessly with Neptune’s control page, there is another option to use"

Panel Discussion
In terms of “human practice” the iGEM Team Göttingen invited to a panel discussion.
On the 12th of June 2013 the historical observatory in Göttingen was the perfect scenery to present our project “The beast and its Achilles heel: A novel target to fight multi-resistant pathogenic bacteria” and of course to discuss urgent topics like the origin, the development and the fight against of multi-resistant bacteria as well as gene technology.
After a brief introduction concerning  the iGEM competition itself and a general description of our project, we reconciled to the actual panel discussion.
Therefore, we were honored to introduce the following guests:
They are (from left to right) Dr. David Wurbs from our head sponsor, the KWS Saat AG in Einbeck, Dr. Kalinowski, person in charge of the iGEM Team Bielefeld, Prof. Dr. Uwe Groß from the department of clinical microbiology of the university hospital in Göttingen, Mr. Prunzel-Ulrich, organic farmer from Landolfshausen, Mr. Hirschfeld, conventional farmer from Seesen.
The panel discussed the origin of multi-resistant bacteria in respect to human medicine on the one hand and agriculture on the other hand. In both cases, an incorrect prescription of antibiotics for humans and animals were quote to be main reasons for the development of multi-resistant bacteria. High dosages and the ingestion of excessive strong antibiotics especially in hospitals as well as the multiple antibiotic usages due to mass animal husbandry were mentioned as potential causes. Furthermore the cultivation of positive resistant plants against herbicides was named"
ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," these since the beginning of our project. In China, people are familiar with the heated debate between the media people and the biologists about transgene. We wonder if synthetic biology will become the next topic? We consider the correct knowledge is the first thing that the public should have, for misunderstanding may lead to fear and rejection. And then they could engage in the process by giving suggestions from their aspect.
 
    So we attended STEM festival in Suzhou. STEM is a concept of education that advocates students learning like scientists and engineers, which fits well with the aspects of synthetic biology in a way.
 
 
    We set up a showcase in the exhibition hall with XJTLU. We have a poster to introduce the idea of synthetic biology and our team. What attracted people most was the room escape computer game. It made up a story in our lab, in which you have to find all the clues to decode the cipher in order to escape the room, and the key is the principle of our biological cipher machine. Since room escape is a popular game in China, we think fusing it with some basic knowledge in synthetic biology will make it easier to be taken. And it is welcomed!
    Those who came to the festival were mostly general public who were interested in science. We met a teacher who are fascinated by our idea and synthetic biology, and asked us to talk to his students about these. There were young people attracted by our computer game. However, they were baffled by the new idea it conveyed and eager to learn more about the knowledge behind it. Once curiosity was stimulated, learning efficiency doubles, which fited in exactly with our wishes. We were very pleased to see that we can make a difference.
 
    We also went to the Wuhan science & technology museum. We set up our showcase in the information exhibition hall, which is a hall set up for people to learn more about how information processes. And this is exactly the problem we are dealing with! And our showcase can provide a biological aspect of information processing, which enriched the knowledge of the hall.
 
    Here we played a decryption game with children using candies, which helped them to understand what we have been doing in a funny way. A video which told a story based on synthetic biology was also played beside the game area. Many kids were attracted by it and asked us to explain the details of it.
 
    We find it is a good way to introduce new idea to the public by integrating it with other funny things. It is obvious to see that the computer game and the interesting video conveyed the idea of synthetic biology do work"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#rMFC#GeneticalApproach_-_-_TEXT.html," to bring a periplasmatic cytochrome which is essential for electron uptake in E. coli and use it as an intermediate electron acceptor. Therefore we decided to work with a key-type cytochrome c, called PccH of Geobacter sulfurreducens because it has been shown that biofilms of this organism are capable of accepting electrons from an electrode. Furthermore it has been demonstrated that the mechanism of electron delivery and electron uptake varies in view of involved proteins. In this case transcriptome analysis by microarray revealed that the corresponding gene ( GSU 3274) of PccH  is far more abundant in current-consuming cells using an electrode as electron donor in order to reduce fumarate than the genes known to be essential for electron delivery. Additionally deletion of GSU 3274 inhibits the electron uptake completely and complementation of it afterwards can fully restore electron consumption. Based on this we aim to  express PccH ( BBa_K1465101 ) in E. coli to bring the electrons into the cell by reducing the membrane-bound fumarate reductase.( Strycharz et al., 2011 ; Dantas et al., 2013 )
Figure 5 shows the general principle of the electron flow.
Figure 5: The electron flow mediated by redox active molecules. Therefore the periplasmatic cytochrome leaves the periplasm through the porins OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ) in the outer membrane, gets reduced at the cathode and enters the periplasm again.  There the fumarate reductase which is located in the inner phospholipid membrane oxidized the cytochrome again and is thereby the connective element which transfers the electrons into the cell. These supplied electrons increase the succinate production and together with the succinate dehydrogenase the metabolic activity of the cells should be enhanced.
One of the challenges going along with this approach is the correct localization of the c-type-cytochrome in the periplasm. It is documented that PccH has its own signal peptide for localization and therefore we initially want to use this signal peptide( Dantas et al., 2013 ). Furthermore we  consider to use E. coli specific signal peptides afterwards if necessary.
Another challenge is the correct folding of PccH because there are specific cytochrome c maturation (ccm) genes needed. Those genes also exist in E. coli but are normally just expressed under anaerobic conditions ( Jensen et al., 2010 ). In view of module two and three and of the characterization of P"

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,", mutations and genetic information sharing among bacteria are the main concerns for the patients and the general public. We can see through this fault tree that this scenario is the less likely to happen.
How to improve the safety of our system ?
To minimize the risks for our iron chelating bacteria, it is very clear that the best case scenario is the death of our bacteria.With the help of our fault tree, we decided to use a temporary strategy call ""flush strategy"". However, zero risk does not exist, so we need to give more thought to new ways of improving our system. We propose there some possible improvement for our treatment.
Physical containment
To deliver Iron Coli, we designed a capsule which disolve in the upper intestines. Our bacteria would be trap in the viscous matrice (composed hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) and be evacuated in the bowels. With this physical containment, we limitate the colonization of the upper intestine by Iron Coli and the interaction with other species of the microbiom.
Use of safer chassis
For our experiments, we used common E.coli strain as MG1655, BL21 or TOP10 for pratical reasons. However, for medical implementation, safer strain would be recquired. Here are some chassis, commonly used as probiotic that we could choose:
E.coli Nissle 1917 strain
E.coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a commensal strain used as a probiotic  for treatment of various diseases from diarrhoea to inflammatory bowel diseases
1
. As we worked on E.coli, our system would work without any modification. Nevertheless, even if this strain has no Virulence factor, EcN is also an excellent colonizer of the human gut
2
, which does not match up with our flush strategy (even if we use our physical containment). However, we could use an engineered EcN that could not form bio-film and thus not colonize the intestine.
Lactic acid bacteria
Lactococcus and Lactobacillus are also frequently used as probiotic
3
. Nevertheless, those bacteria are also good colonizer of the human gut. And as we worked with genes of E.coli, our systems are not adapted for them. However, it had also recently be demonstrated that some strain, as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could be used as a DNA delivery factor in mouse ( the mechanism of plasmid transfer from bacteria to eukaryote cell remains unknown)
4
. Thus, we could imagine an alternative strategy for our treatment"
Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," Figure 1, demonstrating the low gene expression level of a LO fusion protein. However, so far we cannot confirm whether LO fusion protein is able to direct AOX or GFP proteins displayed on the cell surface of E. coli. We’re planning to do a subcellular fractionation to separate the outer membrane proteins for analysis in the future.
Figure 2: AOX protein analysis. SDS-PAG and Coomassie Blue staining were used to observe protein expression level. Lane 1: wild-type E. coli as a mock control; Lane 2: LO outer membrane protein [ BBa_K1991007 ] (17 kDa) expression in E. coli; Lane 3: LO-AOX fusion protein [ BBa_K1991009 ] (91 kDa) expression in E. coli.; Lane 4: AOX protein [ BBa_K1991003 ] (79 kDa) expression in E. coli.
After AOX gene expression was confirmed, we want to know its enzyme activity. AOX catalyzes the oxidation of alcohol in the following chemical reaction C2H5OH + O2  CH3CHO + H2O2 and generates hydrogen peroxide. We examined the activity of AOX enzyme by measuring H2O2 production from the oxidation of ethanol. Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit of Sigma-Aldrich was used for the study. In the kit, the red peroxidase substrate is designed to react with hydrogen peroxide to generate red fluorescence signal that can be detected at Ex/Em = 540/590 nm in the microplate reader. We prepared 1ml of overnight cultured E. coli displaying LO-AOX enzyme [ BBa_K1991009 ]. The bacteria were centrifuged and resolved in Assay Buffer provided by the Sigma-Aldrich kit. Then, the resulting lysates were mixed with the increasing concentrations of ethanol from 0%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.10%, 0.15% to 0.2% for 3 minutes at room temperature. The tested alcohol concentrations were at the range from 0.03% (the alcohol law limit for safety driving) to 0.2% (people may lose consciousness at this level). The following procedure was according to the manufacture’s instruction. The data were read out at Ex/Em = 540/590 nm in the microplate reader (BioTek Microplate Spectrophotometer). As Figure 2 showed, the intensities of AOX activity were significantly and linearly"

I am a faculty member in the Systems Biology department at Harvard Medical School and have a joint appointment at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. Our lab develops technology towards the measurement of biological processes in living cells. That includes designing fluorescent proteins and the development of imaging and spectroscopic techniques. Together these permit dynamic quantification of protein localization, protein-protein interactions and protein activity while cells are carrying out a function of interest. For us the interesting processes are: cell division, cell motility and flow sensing. To read more see my research description on the HMS Systems Biology faculty page. I'm very excited to be advising the 2010 Harvard iGEM team.

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," a memory system was to characterise different promoters and check whether they were suitable to be used for expression of our construct.
The iGEM Team Tuebingen 2013 already tried to establish a sensor and we decided to reuse their constructs for our purposes, because all the parts were readily available to us. We used the basic parts for the receptor and promoter (see below)  and rebuilt the construct in yeast using luciferase as a readout.
We also tested several other promoters, to look at alternatives. Suitable promoters should be easily inducible, and also produce reliable results. Also, the sensor should activate the promoter in a straight-forward way while not activating many other pathways to ensure a clear readout.
2013 Sensor
In 2013, we wanted to measure progestin concentrations [Kolodziej et al. 2003] that have an effect on fish/amphibians but usually do not harm humans (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, 1999). We decided to use progesterone membrane receptors (mPR) that mediate nongenomic progesterone responses and belong to the progestin and AdipoQ-Receptor (PAQR) family [Tang et al. 2005] . We used one mPR from teleost fishes (like Danio rerio) and one from Xenopus laevis (clawed frog).
Smith et al. (2008) were able to show that human mPRs can sense progesterone and structurally similar compounds at physiologically relevant concentrations by affecting the FET3 promoter. In their study Liu and Patiño (1993) found such a correlation between structural similarity and binding affinity on female Xenopus laevis. We chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae as chassis for our system due to the fact that yeast possesses endogenous receptors of the PAQR family [Lyons et al. 2004] , S. cerevisiae does not use progesterone in its own metabolism and does not possess any progesterone receptors. Furthermore S. cerevisiae is a well understood eukaryotic organism and offers acceptable reproduction rates.  For this year’s project, we wanted to re-use both mPRs and the pFET3 part.
Promotors
We wanted to use five different promoters for our system, which are all easy to induce. To characterise the promoter activity we will measure  luciferase activity or RFP fluorescence by  expression of the respective protein under each promoter.

Trouble we meet in project
We have finished our experiment and cockroach box design named Green Ground finally.
What we did for project
We wanted to do more about our project, the iGEM, the public as well.
How would the project be
We are now applying for a patent for Green Ground, about to send our product to quality inspection to make in come true. More importantly, we want to use our applet to do more education and public engagement for iGEM and syntenic biology."

Ignorance and misunderstanding are always big dangers to science. The march for science was a world event to show the importance of scientific research in solving current world problems.
KLAS is a great way for us to interact with the society and look at synthetic biology from different perspectives.
KLAS (Knowledge Link through Art and Science) is an interdisciplinary Artist in Residence program focused on creating a connection between synthetic biology and art. It was founded at the Max-Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam-Golm near our campus.
The project aims at informing the public about advancements and ethics questions in synthetic biology whilst combining these topics with arts installations in regular workshops and panels. We got in contact with Dr. Rodrigo Perez-Garcia, member of the organisational team for KLAS and also talked with one of the artists residing at the MPI at that time (he’s from Brazil and plans on storing music via DNA in E.coli!).
There will be a workshop at the 27th and 28th of November, where we will be holding a short talk about our view about synthetic biology and how we experienced working in science for the first time and how that differs from the general public’s view on how science works.

Treponema primitia, a spirochete bacteria.
Treponema primitia, a spirochete, is an ectosymbiont of Trichonympha; “symbiont” because both organisms benefit the other with their mutual existence, in a way that if one of them are missing, the other will die, and “ecto”, because one of them lives in the surface of the other, in this case, the spirochete. This bacteria is in charge of giving the protozoa the characteristic appearance that grants the motility of Trichonympha. Without them, the protozoa loses its shape and cannot survive (5) .
Synthetic Biology: how to get rid of the bacteria
How to kill the bacteria
When the target is defined, the next problem is: how to kill the spirochetes? The idea of phages appears easily. They are great at killing specific bacteria, and with a cocktail of diverse phages they can be very effective fighting against bacteria. The problem that this option has is how the phages would reach the gut of the termite. They would probably need a vector, and this complicates and slows the procedure. Also, phages can be very delicate, the reason why they failed as a medicine when D’Herelle discovered them in the 1900’s and tried to distribute them around the world, so they are not a good option to deal with T. primitia (6) .
Colicins
Partregistry.org offers a solution for this problem:  In 2008, Team Heidelberg (7) created two biobricks related with the production of Colicins. These are toxins produced by Escherichia coli that act against related strains or species.
The biobricks contains: one of the two kinds of toxic colicins, the pore-forming or the nuclease, and two other types needed for the effectiveness of the colicins, the immunity protein, that protects the host from the nuclease effect of the colicins by a protein-protein interaction; and the lysis protein, that lysis the host in order to release the colicins.
In its natural state, the colicins genes are contained inside the plasmids pCOL and controlled by the promoter PSOS that responds to a variety of agents such as UV-light, physical agents and"

We are collaborating with the following iGEM teams (in alphabetical order):
Bielefeld : Bielefeld characterised several laccases to purify municipal and industrial wastewater from synthetic estrogens and other aromatic compounds. After the European Jamboree we realized that our Sporobeads could be a nice platform to immobilize their laccases. The team Bielefeld send us immediately their laccases and set up a quick protocol for us so that we can measure the activity. We probably won't be able to get it done before wiki freeze so you will find all the results in our presentation or after the Jamboree.
Groningen : The team from Groningen also works with B. subtilis. We sent them our new parts that we designed for our BacillusBioBrickBox . Groningen could directly use them for their cloning and we got some useful feedback about our parts. They successfully used our vector pSBBs1C.
TU Munich : We worked closely with the TU-Munich to implement the Munich SynBio Day . Because we are located in the same city, when we heard that the TU lost some important BioBricks from the Spring distribution in September, we gladly provided our aliquots to them, saving their team project time.
UCL : The UCL iGEM team, visited us in Munich during the CAS SynBio Conference . When the conference ended, they stayed one day longer to help us with modeling. This afforded us the opportunity to explain to the modelers from London our project in person so that they could think of potential ways to"

Construction Step 2: Integration of the sgRNA
After digestion of our sgRNA, the ligation was done with the plasmid pK18mob with the CAS9 sequence. The result was transformed in TOP10 strain. We verify the presence of our sgRNA insertion by performing PCR,             and then, after Miniprep, by enzyme digestion for verification.

Step 3: transformation of our plasmid in a conjugative strain
We transformed our final killer plasmid in E. coli S17-1 strain. We used S17 electrocompetent cells.
We have now a conjugative strain (S17-1) carrying a killer plasmid, capable of conjugation and targeting the RFP gene, and a killer plasmid targeting the AmpR gene.
The inserted sequence of the Cas9 and of the sgRNA were sequenced by Macrogen, and are all correct.
To have a better biosafe system, we also have design the same killer plasmid, but in an other conjugative plasmid (pSW23T) which have de R6K Origin of Replication. (See Perspective / Improvement / Biosafety section)
Efficiency of conjugation.
Test #1 conjugation efficiency: transfer of the mobilizable plasmid pK18mob
To verify the efficiency of transfer of the mobilizable plasmid pK18mob, we conjugated the recipient strain DH5ɑ containing the plasmid pSB4A5_J04450 with the donor strain S17-1 containing the plasmid pK18mob (WT). The result of the           conjugation was spread on LB/Xgal/IPTG box without selection pressure. The counting of strains is based on the expressed phenotype. Donors include lactose operon and are blue in appearance, recipient cells that have not conjugated           express RFP. While the transfer of the plasmid pK18mob (WT) restores the lactose operon in DH5ɑ by transferring the intact LacZɑ gene. The simultaneous expression of the lactose operon and the rfp gene produces a purple phenotype with           DH5�"

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," an institution of the     Bavarian Environment Agency, dedicated to bionic, with a visitor centre in the Nuremberg Zoo. They     cooperate with different research groups, that work on movement mechanism borrowed from the animal or     plant kingdom. One of these research groups works on developing bionic Dielectric Elastomer Actuators,     which is why they took notice of us and our work. After exchanging some emails about our project and     their work, our team was invited to visit the Bionicum. On a sunny day in August six of our team members     drove to the Nuremberg Zoo and were warmly welcomed by the employees of the Bionicum. After showing us     around the visitor centre and providing us with very interesting insights into the world of bionic, we     sat down to drink a coffee and talk – all between giraffes and meerkats!
After explaining our project, we learned about their experiences with bionic research and their      public engagement. We received great feedback on how we could use what we already know from nature      in our project. Thereby, we i. A. realised that for our chemical approach to achieve muscle like      movement of the tissue, a molecular machine triggered by a voltage – as it is in all animals –      instead of light would be more effective. We also heard how they teach school classes about bionic      and connect with the public on this topic. After this very productive exchange, we explored the      interactive exhibition in the visitor centre, where we learned a lot about mechanisms in nature that      are used in technology. We realized, that the basic idea of bionic – making technology that      resembles nature – is the exact inverse of the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM – making biology      that resembles technology. This is precisely the reason why the combination of both should lead to a      successful implementation, as it combines what already works in nature with individual adjustments.      Our tour through the visitor centre ended with a very enjoyable performance of Nao, the sweetest      robot we have ever seen. Here, we were told that after 15 minutes of performance he had to be      charged for at least two hours to refill its batteries. Thus, we experienced the drawbacks of      currently used robot drives, having a very high energy consumption, that we prior only knew      theoretically.
To sum up, we had a very interesting and good time at the Bionicum. We learned a whole lot of things,     many of which we could integrate into our project. We can very much recommend visiting the Bionicum in     the Nuremberg Zoo"
