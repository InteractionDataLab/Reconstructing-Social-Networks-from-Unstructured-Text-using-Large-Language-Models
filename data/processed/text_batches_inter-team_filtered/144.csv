Placing the watermark
The initial thought was to insert the watermark into the genome of the bacteria, so as to increase the stability of the watermark in the bacteria. However, as all parts inserted into the bacteria are placed in plasmids, it would make no sense to insert the watermark into the genome. The bacteria could transfer their plasmids to other bacteria, and retain their watermark, and the watermark would have become useless, persisting in bacteria that have no modified material at all.
Also, the thought was to mark the bacteria, and not the parts. Thus we could have a single watermark to cover the entire modified organism. However, this presents us with many of the above problems. Should anyone encounter  a rogue bacteria which has lost some of its plasmids, the watermark would be useless. It would only cover the entire modified system, and should some, or all bacteria have discarded the plasmids, the watermark would be useless. We therefore propose to mark every plasmid, before and after the coding sequence. The watermark will therefore be split into two separate components. The team creates a watermark for every part, and inserts it into the plasmid, before and after the coding sequence.
We chose to divide the code into two separate parts for two reasons. Firstly, being split into two equally long parts at each end of the coding sequence ensures symmetry , which again should help make insertion of a watermark easy, as this will reduce the complexity of the primers we need to design to insert them. Secondly this ensures that identification is done easily, since the combination of nucleotides of the sequence from E to X and from S to P is known. Thus we effectively increase the sequence we search for from 6 to 26 nucleotides. Also this means that the risk of a naturally occurring combination of nucleotides, identical to the synthetically created one decreases.
Alternative placement
We also thought about the possibility of placing the watermark between the cutting sites of E and X, and S and P respectively. Since this area is a spacing area, it might be a good spot to"

We can clearly see that scar has been successfully formed between Pqrr4 and B0034. I now have to wait for the part with GFP+LVA tag to arrive to finish constructing our reporter circuit.
Now that I have verified the presence of Pqrr4, I can now sequence Pqrr4+I13500 (RBS+GFP) in order verify and make those cells competent again so that we can test Emily and Vicky’s mutants.

Ethics Meeting
I do, however, remember the ethics meeting as mentioned above which is quite useful. Among many topics we discussed novel ways to explore human practices in iGEM, and gained potential contacts to interview regarding their views on synthetic biology (for example the issues arising from open source biology).
Getting Advice in Second Life
It works on my laptop again after re-installation, this is an awesome accomplishment. Today, Stefan was able to meet up with Max Chatnoir, the owner of Genome Island, for a couple of questions. We asked her about how she gets underaged students on her island and she said she can only show them demos on the projector, or her almost-18 year old students get accounts on Second Life anyways. We want to find more information about restricting our island as safe and allow teen grid access, which is something we should look into.
Stefan was able to send our wiki and a few pictures to Max over email, and she liked what she saw . She is looking forward to us allowing second life educators to tour our island, which we are tentatively scheduling late August or September. She also mentioned that it would be a good idea for us to relocate our island to SciLands, a cluster of science related islands in Second Life, such that we’d have neighbours with ‘related topics’, allowing for users to reach our island easily from other islands based on their interest in science. This would involve a relocation fee, but it might be a good idea to consider.
I talked with Katie… So basically, lab missions will never encompass what you’d see as an entire lab procedure (using all the equipment), as it would be difficult to focus on specific parts. We have allowed each piece of lab equipment to be used with ‘general’ ingredients, and these can be used in conjunction with other"

Improvement of an Existing Part
K2020026
– leader sequence MFalpha (different version of the biobrick K792002) This part is a different version of the leader sequence MFalpha ( BBa_K792002 ) for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It can be cloned directly in front of the protein, which will be secreted. It will be relocated into the medium and the tag will be cleaved off during this process. This alpha mating factors secretion tag is naturally occurring in the genome of S. cerevisiae. Futhermore, the sequence contained an illegal restriction site, which was corrected via PCR by us. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
Evolution of a New Synthetase
Screening System
K2020040
– screening plasmid for incorporation of non-canonical amino acids → pRXG This part is an improvement of the existing BioBrick K1416004 , called pFRY by the iGEM Team Austin Texas 2014. It is an flourescent reporter for measurement of incorporation of ncAA. pRXG is one part of a two plasmid reporter system for measurement of incorporation of ncAA via amber supression. It consists of two flourescent domains connected through a linker sequence containing and amber stop. When IPTG induced and expressed, the flourescence intensity can be measured. A red flourescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated as response to the amber stop codon, then a green flourescence intensity is measurable. Fidelty and efficiacy of the incorporation can be determined with comparison of flourescent level. This reporter plasmid is one of a two plasmids containing screening system for determining efficiancy and fidelty of non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) incorporation via amber termination supression. One plasmid contains tRNA and corresponding aminoacylation-synthetase. The other one is this plasmid presented herein. It consists of am mRFP1 domain which is connected through a linker sequence containing a recoded amber stop codon with a sfGFP domain. The expression of the plasmid gives either a red fluorescence, or - if the ncAA will be incorporated at the rec"

This signal transfer could also be observed using cells, that can produce AHL and be induced by AHL in order to produce a fluorescent reporter as well as the signal itself again. Placed on a grid in our millifluidic chip , signal propagation from one single induced bead over the whole chip was could be achieved.
Modeling
Integrase theoretical characterization
Based on the data presented in  Bonnet et al.'s publication ""Amplifying genetic logic gates"" [9] , we parameterized a detailed model, resulting in predictions for  a significant number of parameters currently not documented in the literature, such as binding affinity of integrases to their sites on the DNA.
Predicting the whole system's behavior with a comprehensive fully derived model
We have a thorough model for the whole Mosaicoli system based on a detailed study of every module of this system, including quorum sensing, integrases, and diffusion. We derived the formulae from mass action kinetics and state precisely which approximations we do and why we think we are justified to do so. All our steady state simulations and some of our dynamic simulation results fit to experimental data from our own experiments or found in literature.
Human Practice
Detailed investigation on the question of complexity through seven interviews of experts, a survey and our own reflections
We conducted a deep study of complexity, how it emerges, and how we should deal with it. By interviewing experts from different fields and by listening to the public with a survey , we have broaden our views. Our own biological project also raised questions on this subject and we finally integrated everything that we learnt in a reflection of our own .
Bringing synthetic biology to the public
Last but not least, we have been communicating our enthusiasm for the field of synthetic biology during the whole project, through school visits, open house days, science slams, social media... We are commited to make our project, and synthetic biology in general, understandable and interesting for everyone. This is also why we placed some ""simplify"" buttons all over our wiki, each time a scientific text could be hermetic to the public.

It has been shown that the ssrA tag sequence of M. florum (mf-ssrA) is efficiently recognized by the M. florum Lon protease (mf-Lon). Appending this tag to the C terminus of native or denatured proteins resulted in their rapid proteolysis by mf-Lon. Furthermore, mf-Lon did not degrade proteins bearing the E. coli ssrA tag (ec-ssrA), and E. coli Lon (ec-Lon) did not efficiently degrade proteins bearing the mf-ssrA tag. [11]

In blue light system, darkness inhibits expression BFP and DgrA ,DgrB circuit, while blue light stimulates BFP expression and express DgrA and DgrB to let bacteria slow down. Blue light inhibits HfiA expression simultaneously, which leads to biosynthesis of holdfast to make bacteria adhere to surface more quickly.
In red light system, darkness inhibits expression mRFP and DgrA ,DgrB circuit as well, and red light guides BFP expression and produces DgrA and DgrB to cease flagellum rotation. Red light inhibits HfiA expression simultaneously, which leads to biosynthesis of holdfast to make bacteria adhere to surface more quickly.
Conjugation
Due to C. crescentus 's special traits, the achievement in this bacteria would extremely maxmize effectness of photography.
Then how to guide plasmids into C.crescentus from E.coli which is used to amplify vectors? The first method that hits our mind is chemical conversion. But through the literature, the main ways to transfer plasmids into C.crescentus are conjugation, electrotransformation and transduction. We test the first two-methods and only conjugation works at last. Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material (plasmid) between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. Conjugation, regarded as a key bridge bewteen E.coli and C. crescentus, will improve the stability and resolution of pictures.
Protocol of conjugation is the following:
Culture C.crescentus and E. coli S17-1 overnight with the liquid medium.When the OD of C. crescentus reaches 2 and S17-1’s reaches 0.5,we can stop cultivating.
Mix S17-1 and C. crescentus in a volume ratio of 2:1.Centrifuge it with 4000r/min and suspend the thallus again with 200μl LB liquid medium.
Spread out an 0.45μm nitrocellulose filter on the LB solid medium without antibiotics.
Spread the mixed bacteria liquid in step 2 onto the filter and incubate it at 30℃ for 3-7h.
After incubation,elute the thallus from the filter with 200-1000μl LB liquid"

""It`s a real alternative to pertrochemical deodorants. Be independent and safe harmful industrial substances.""
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
The user can breed their own yeast with specific characteristics, thus creating their own specific perfume. The kind of scent that can be produced is unlimited, and can easily be adapted to the consumer's requirements. The charger is used to cultivate the yeast, then to sporulate it and fill it into the deodorant container. By pressing the symmetric buttons on the top of the deodorant's cap, two substrates are brought together in a separate upper chamber. This can sporulates the yeast and applies it to the skin. The growing medium consists of a special sugar, which itself can be produced by the end-user.
Technical Description
We genetically modified normal bakers yeast and integrated a complex set of order- producing and cleansing genes. Thereby we enabled the yeast produce substances for removing bad-smelling skin bacteria and to give yourself the perfect smell!

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," widely available, we decided to visit high schools to start bioethics debates on this topic. Would they want to make use of DIY gene editing techniques? And why should they or should they not? More on the set-up of the debates can be found in the drop down below.
Figure 6. High School students engaging in our bioethics debate on gene doping.
Educational Set-up High School Bioethics Debates
We decided to have one main topic of debate: 'The goal of sports is to get the best out of people. Is science allowed to contribute to this in any way?' After dividing the class over several groups of interest, e.g. the Ministry of Health and Sports, Sport doctors, Athletes and Fans, they could discuss their opinions in the light of their interest group.
Subsequently, they had to come to a united conclusion with the aid of some text fragments selected by us to provide a broader focus. Below in figure 7, the template is displayed that the students used for recording their opinions.
Figure 7. The template on which students could add their arguments pro or con the statement “The goal of sports is to get the best out of people. Is science allowed to contribute to this in any way?”.
In setting up the lessons, we closely collaborated with Hannah Stammes from the education department of Delft University of Technology to have the most effective outcome of the debates. We followed the so-called 5E model. The five E's stand for Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate respectively. In the Engage phase of our visits we anticipated what we were going to do and made connections between the background knowledge of the students and the principles of gene doping and our detection device. Also, we evaluated the sports affinity of the class and made a link to sports events as the Tour de France that was upcoming.
After the Engage phase, the students could explore in their group discussion and source evaluation (Sources used by the students: fragments from “Topsport en gendoping: grenzen aan sport, opsporing en geloofwaardigheid” by Ivo van Hilvoorde and from “How Sports Would Be Better With Doping” from WIRED ). We walked around to train them to explain their arguments.
Subsequently, during the explain phase there would be a discussion between all groups representing the different stakeholders. Often, this plenary debate would be vigorous, with students passionately defending their opinions against their classmates.
Then, we would answer their technical questions and we would evaluate the students knowledge in turn. Interestingly, some students independently"

How our BioBricks work
Figure 1: iGEM Team Bielefeld is developing a biological filter using immobilized laccases, enzymes able to radicalize and break down a broad range of aromatic substances. For the production of laccases from different bacteria, fungi and plants, three expression systems were used: Escherichia coli KRX and Rosetta-Gami 2 and the yeast Pichia pastoris. Immobilization is carried out either by using CPC-silica beads or by fusing the enzymes to cellulose binding domains. The concept could be extended to other toxic pollutants in drinking and wastewater, as well as to industrial applications in paper and textile industries or even for bioremediation of contaminated soil.

MichiganState,2018,Team:MichiganState#HP Expert Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," future. I’ll admit however, that I still know very little about GMOs, and most of my education on them came from classes in graduate school. From what you've told me about your project, I do like what you are doing with your GMOs though.
What specifically do you dislike about GMOs? In other words, what do you see as the downsides of using GMOs?
On my personal farm, I don’t use GMOs because I am certified organic. Many customers rely on me to have non-GMO crops due to health concerns and strong opinions. On my old farm, Groundswell Farm, I didn’t have space for sweet corn and I was surrounded by corn fields. I couldn’t grow corn because my crops would be contaminated by GM corn nearby. Cross pollination scares me. Growing GMOs is also expensive--or at least developing them is expensive. Last I heard, it was something like a million dollars to produce a GMO. I like growing peppers, tomatoes, and lettuce that are not GMOs because GMOs of that produce are not profitable anyways.
How do you feel about GM crops vs crops grown with GM bacteria?
I need to look at more science in order to form an educated opinion. Organic regulations would not allow me to use such a product on my farm. GM inoculants also exist, but I always buy certified organic types for my farm.
Is there anything that we (us and scientists in general) could do that would make you feel more comfortable growing crops with GM bacteria (i.e. more experiments determining the safety of GMOs, applying GM bacteria to crops only in contained areas, etc.)?
I have no opposition to research that is done carefully, and for purposes that help small farmers and sustainable farmers. It’s about contentious landscaping. For example, Vitamin A rice, for good reason, met a lot of opposition. There were cultural barriers to switching to different varieties of rice. There was a lot of uncertainty about what GM rice would involve. I’m not completely sure what scientists could do, and want to look into it more.
What information sources have shaped your opinions on GMOs?
I took a class on GMOs in graduate school. Plus, I’m a farmer and farm worker in a bubble of organic agriculture and vegetable production. I’ve looked at information from the general press and trade literature of organic farming. I’ve met with many interesting and well educated people at farmers markets. I’ve met with individuals from a small local seed company, Ann Arbor Seed Company, who seemed justifiably nervous about GMO due to risks they have to their business model and the vision"

Overview and Introduction
Microfluidics is a scientific field that exists at the intersection of the fields of engineering, physics, chemistry and biotechnology. It deals with the manipulation of microliter volumes of liquids which are processed on devices called microfluidic chips. As a result, microfluidics allows complex protocols and procedures to be performed on chips. There are a variety of different types of microfluidic chips in existence. For example, digital, paper and centrifugal microfluidic chips are all in use today. MARS focuses on continuous flow microfluidics fabricated from polycarbonate and PDMS.
Currently, members of the synthetic biology community are equally, if not more, occupied with running their experiments than thinking about new innovative ideas. The implementation of microfluidics devices are one of the possible solutions to this problem.  The main benefits of using microfluidics are that they are automated and efficient.  Since microfluidics devices operate on such a small scale each experiment can yield high throughput data, all while reducing the cost of expensive reagents.  Addtionally, they are run using programmable hardware, meaning researchers can acquire consistent data each time an experiment is run.  So these points bring about a very important question; Why are microfluidics not being utilized in every synthetic biology experiment?
Problem Statement
If a synthetic biologist would like to use microfluidics in their lab, they would follow the traditional design and manufacture workflow. This consists of three general stages divided into:
Design
Manufacture
Implementation
Designing, manufacturing and using a microfluidic device  requires significant knowledge investment in topics such as the basics of fluid dynamics and specialized software such Adobe Illustrator. If a synthetic biologist does not want to design their own chip, they can search through published literature. However, these devices are often highly specialized and not useful for the average synbio researcher. After either designing their own chip, or selecting a published microfluidic, they would begin the time consuming process of designing and modeling their chip  using Comsol. Once the design is finalized, they can move on to the manufacturing stage of the workflow. Most microfluidic fabrications methods, such as soft lithography, require"

This system would be applied for a new cell division counting method that researchers can guess how many times the cells have divided just by observing the cell color, such as the 1st generation shows red, the 2nd generation shows green and so on. This method could be useful for counting cell divisions in embryonic development research.
Some conditions of Embryonic cleavage in Eukaryote are different from cell division of E. coli. For example, the promoter works in the cleavage is not Pnrd, the promoter we used in our project. However, Eukaryote also has a promoter working only once during a cell cycle. Therefore, we believe that, in Eukaryote, there could be some alternative substances to the substances we use(e.g. RNAi, Transcription Factor), and a similar genetic cycle we designed in E. coli can also work in Eukaryote[4].
Figure. The cell division counter which show us how many times the cell have been divided by expressing different color of fluorescence proteins.
The past project that try to make division counting system by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Gothenburg ) This team intends to create a generation counter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast cell would express fluorescent proteins of different colors according to the number of daughter cells spawn.
In the project of 2014 Gothenburg, the counter stops when cells are divided a certain number of times and, different types of SDS is needed for each generations. In our project, Cycle system is used and it allows counter not to stop counting. Moreover we don’t need different types of factors or promoters for each cell division. Therefore, our system is more useful for cell division counter.
3. Application to the use of microbes in metabolic engineering
Methods that improve the efficiency of industrially beneficial reactions by increasing the productivity of certain enzymes by using microbes are widely researched, developed and practiced. As our designed system enables E. coli itself to change the expression of genes periodically, this system could make such metabolic reactions more effective. Here is one example; In the case of a multi-stage enzyme reaction which involves enzymes cannot work with other enzymes and needs to take a moment during each reactions, our system is useful because one cell produces different enzymes at different reaction stage by using our system and  the multi-stage reactions would proceed.

In this way the teams are able to adjust their presentation based on the critics and feedback from the other iGEM teams. In between the presentations we could enjoy the talks of 2 professors of the KU Leuven (professor Jos Vander Sloten and professor Johan Swinnen). The last one inspired us all with his life story as researcher, this summer he ran 2400 kilometers from Leuven to Santiago de Compostela. All of this as a tribute to cancer patients all over the world. His story inspired the iGEM teams to go further and push through their limits in this project. Afterwards we could enjoy a tasteful dinner which everyone attended, all the team members mixed and sat together. Everyone had a great time and got to know their fellow iGEM students a bit better, we all share a common goal and that made it a little easier to break the ice. After dinner the teams presented their poster, everyone could freely move and ask questions where necessary. In this way they are able to change some of the details so it would be perfect for Boston. We finished with a great group picture and a gift for everyone, our heart shaped stress balls as a memorabilia to our event.

Naturally, we considered Eos an ideal environment to publish something about our iGEM project, given its broad target group.
We started by kindly asking Eos to write an article about us. As we expected, they kindly reclined. However, they surprisingly offered us a writer’s account on their website, and the opportunity to write one or more articles our self. Without hesitation, we accepted this opportunity thankfully, and started writing.

Decoy
The spores containing the DNA sequence that encodes our key will be    sent in a mixture with decoy spores. These strains were constructed    with our BioBricks BBa_K1930002 (key) and BBa_K1930006 (sfGFP) The high    ratio of decoy spores makes it hard for unauthorized parties to    retrieve the correct key if they try to sequence the entire sample by    brute force. In this experiment we tried to determine how fine our    system is in selecting the spores from the decoy once the right    treatment is applied.
We prepared a Bacillus subtilis strain containing a superfolder GFP    and a spectinomycin resistance cassette in the genome. Then we prepared    mixtures of that mutant with wild-type B. subtilis in different ratios.    In this experiment living cells were used instead of spores. After    growing in different conditions, the final mixture of mutant vs    wild-type strains was determined microscopically and in a flow    cytometer.
Due to the high ratio of decoy cells, any non-approved party trying    to sequence the entire sample will not be able to distinguish the    key-sequence from the background noise. In the scientific literature,    using standard sequencing techniques it has been possible to detect one    mutant out of 150 wild-type molecules [1] [2] . However, fine-tuned    technologies, such as Duplex Sequencing, have shown to increase that    number to one mutant in 10,000 wild-type cells. That same technique is theoretically    able to detect one mutant out of 10 million decoys [3] !
Experiment setup
We combined different ratios of sfGFP bacteria and decoy bacteria.    LB medium was inoculated from glycerol stocks of the sfGFP strain and    the wild-type strain which were grown overnight at 37 °C, shaking at 220 rpm    in a 3 ml culture. On the next day the corresponding dilutions were    made and grown again overnight at 37 °C in a shaking liquid 3 ml    culture. The antibiotic was added to both the preculture and the    diluted culture.

The primary reason the Warwick team selected to develop a new detection system was the opportunity to contribute to improving the quality of human life. We fully understand the importance of understanding different perspectives and considering different opinion, hence why we have devoted a large amount of effort to corresponding with members of the public and incorporating feedback.
Nuffield Collaboration
Over the course of the project, we were assisted by Gurpreet, a Nuffield Bursary Student from Whitley Academy in Coventry currently entering her 2nd year of sixth form. Through joining us she hoped to further her knowledge of biology and chemistry enabling her to make a more well-informed decision for University applications. In addition to teaching her practical skills in the lab, we also educated her on synthetic biology topics not covered in her current academic syllabus.
Gurpreet was very helpful in providing an alternative perspective as someone from outside the academic sphere with which to share ideas. By identifying the more complex concepts that were that were most difficult to explain, she helped us prepare for attending public events such as open days. Gurpreet expressed a keen interest in the different methods that could be applied when constructing our sensor in order to make it most suitable for use by a wide demographic. By encouraging us to consider the different environments in which our device could be applied, and further involving herself by researching potential solutions, she influenced the development of the physical composition of our device and method of delivery.
Westminster UK iGEM Meet Up
On Wednesday the 17th of August, Warwick iGEM travelled up to Westminster University to attend a two-day event, along with 16 other teams from around the UK.
After being welcomed to the University of Westminster by Dean Professor Jane Lewis, the event began with a question and answer session with Dr Markiv – a spokesperson for iGEM. She provided ideas that helped develop the ‘Human Practices’ aspect of the Warwick project, as well as troubleshooting the few issues that had become apparent with the Wiki page. After she voiced her concerns, we investigated how we could obtain and incorporate the views of the public and relevant professionals. Following this, we arranged to facilitate discussions with patients, researchers, and students in secondary education.

When choosing 7 zinc fingers out of 13 we wanted to avoid picking a group of zinc finger proteins that bind to similar DNA sequences. Programs that are able to find these similarities already exist, however, they can only compare one zinc finger versus all others individually. To take things a step further, we decided to write a program that will help us find out if any new similarities arise when we combine more zinc fingers with a spacer of 2 base pairs between each pair. The problem of finding the right subgroup turned to be too difficult even for a computer due to the astronomical number of possible combinations.
To make things easier we decided to only test each zinc finger against every other individually, and against all possible pairs with a 2 base pair spacer. That way sufficient information for picking a sub-optimal group of zinc fingers for our needs could be provided. Furthermore, the problem would be simple enough for a computer to solve it in a timely manner.
The program consists of three different tests. First test compares each zinc finger to all others individually, while the second test compares each zinc finger to all possible pairs. The second test consists of two parts - the first part compares the zinc finger to all pairs, catching only same sequences of nucleotides (we set the size of this sequence), while the other part compares all the nucleotides and saves the highest numbers of same nucleotids even if they're not in a sequence. The third test then picks the most suitable sub-group for each zinc finger and calculates its 'score'. The score of the group depends on three parameters the user chooses before starting the program - these three parameters determine the most important test when calculating the score. First parameter increases the value of individual compares to other zinc fingers, the second parameter increases the value of comparing zinc finger to pairs using sequences and the third parameter increases the value of comparing zinc fingers to pairs without sequences.
To follow the BioBrick standard we also made sure that zinc finger or pairs with spacers do not contain any BioBrick restriction sites.
Once these tests are completed, the program takes five groups with the best score, sorts them and prints them. Output print contains the names of the zinc fingers and the best possible 2 base pair spacer for all zinc finger pairs in the group. The following snapshot shows how the output looks like the following figure:
Because this program was initially written to find the best possible sub-group for our project, it is yet possible to test any available zinc finger. In addition, its source code is quite hard to understand and its usage limited to those skilled in using linux shell and java (most of the"

UESTC-China,2017,Team:UESTC-China#test4_-_-_TEXT.html," of beekeepers and BeeT: A juicebox-like product that beekeepers apply to the sugar water just before the start of the winter.
BeeT design and product description by Thieu Custers, Design Academy Eindhoven.
""I am interested in combining disciplines to discuss ideas and come to new solutions. By using science and art together, I aim to tell stories about what could be our future. I want to take existing conflicts or themes and envision what could be their consequences or solutions, to broaden our understanding of the present.
BeeT is an innovative approach to solving a man-made problem. Implementing a genetically engineered bacterium into the agricultural sector is something that should be done carefully. It opens up a dialogue about the use of altered organisms in daily life. Communicating both the risks and the merits of such a precise tool is the most important to me. Genetic engineering is a new technology that is met with a lot of fear, but by completely and openly showing the inner workings, it can be assessed honestly.
With BeeT specifically, the challenge is going to be to gain acceptance in the world of beekeeping. The design of the BeeT container is meant to be clear in use, and will show which hive is currently being treated with the bacteria. The marking label is still connected to the container of the bacteria, ensuring no mix up of labelling.""
BeeT will, via the sugar water, end up in the brood food and be transported to cells where bee larvae grow and where the mites are present. Inside the cell it will ""sense"" and kill the mite, strongly increasing the chances of survival for the colony. Existing technologies use for example thymol, a pure toxin. Thymol is not only toxic to mites, but to bees as well. It has to be applied three times a year and interferes with honey, which can make it taste like mouthwash. The ""do not change the consumer principle"" turned out to be an important input point. Rather than requiring that beekeepers have to change the sugar baskets they use (since some of them are not completely dark), we decided adapt the system in such a way that it will not be killed by the light of the sugar basket. A box-like product is the most ideal form since it can be applied to all sugar-water-basket systems.

We initiated contact with students from the Design Academy Eindhoven to enhance the interdisciplinarity of our project. We met up several times and discussed science, society and where those overlap. Their views on our project and synbio in general helped us"

We ran the DspB PCR product on gel to check for the correct product. Get results from Whitney.
We also ran the digestion enzymes for Savinase.
We set up AmyA for sequencing to check to make sure that the plasmid was taken up correctly. Whitney has the results.
We also ran our 96-plate we prepared on 7/8/13. For the washes, we briefly centrifuged the plate in between the washes to help prevent the removal of the biofilm through the washes. However, our data was still very inconsistent. In some cases we saw a higher biofilm reading in the untreated samples than those treated with urea; this is the exact opposite of the result that we should have seen. In the two Eppendorf samples that we prepared, we saw a significant reduction of biofilm in the treated sample. After discussing our results with Dr. Grose, we decided to use Eppendorfs for the biofilm growth and treatment before transferring to a 96-well plate to take the reading. We will no longer grow the biofilms and treat them in the 96-well plate. This will also allow us to start new growths every day we come into the lab, allowing us to gather data more quickly and consistently.
After further discussion with Dr. Grose, we also decided that our biofilm assay protocol is ready to use. We now need to finish purifying our finished enzyme products to be able to test them. We will now focus on getting our enzymes cloned into E. coli and purified for testing.

UNAM-CU,2015,Team:UNAM-CU#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," have values related to the population average without generating values that would be unrealistic such as negative or extremely high that would surge from other distributions like the normal distribution. These pulses were taken as the following:
We also take into account that there is an amount of time between food eating and sugar level changes associated with them, so we are planning to build a system that uses delay equations to represent this period. Other important instances that could influence the glucose levels are the starving response and the glucose-consuming activity, those factors are dependent on the glucose levels given for a certain time and vary along the day, these equations were developed using a delay equations system, which might be helpful because these changes are not instantaneously taking place after its application.. Activity was thought to a function that causes a reduction on the glucose levels according to a certain person’s physiology. There is a constant consumption of glucose in the body that is not related to sport activity, like the consumption used to sustain the brain and other metabolic pathways [2]. We expected a differential response according to the glucose levels already present, when those levels are low, an
specific person has low energy levels, which could be correlated to a deficit on energy supplies like glucose. On the other hand, when glucose levels are too high, people tend to feel a lethargy sensation, it is commonly known as “el mal del cerdo” (the pig’s disease) in our region. Under that theoretical basis, we assumed that our activity function would have an optimum glucose burn at a medium glucose rate, which might be different inter and intra population because of the metabolic variances that could arise when changing our study subject. The two tails of the function should be asymmetric since both have different origins, considering these circumstances, we assumed that the graphic that represents this behaviour should be like the Figure 3.
The resulting function of the variables obtained by our methodology is shown in this figure, when compared to the experimental values, little difference in the values is seen. By generating the corresponding calculation, it was also possible to obtain the equilibrium values for our system.
The starving function followed a different approach, the response for each glucose level scenario were also analyzed and compiled at a single function with its respective graphic. When a certain person reaches extremely low levels of glucose, the body uses the glucose stocked in the body as a emergency resource, resulting in an increase in blood glucose. This response is dependent in the amount of glucose, which reduces considerably with medium levels of glucose [3]
The conjunction of these factors emulates the influence of lifestyle on glucose dynamics, these must be considered with the dynamics that result from the metabolism, which also involve"

First HackDay and Hackathon
Our team was invited to talk about synthetic biology and its innovative potential at 1st Hackathon organized by Minas Gerais government. At this edition of the international event, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development collaborate intensively on software projects, participants were proposed to figure out and develop interesting and efficient interfaces to make public data available. This event had the participation of MIT Center for Civic Media.

In this context, we could present a comparative overview about how biological information, found at genetic material, may also be manipulated and integrated on different ways in order to create novel and useful combinations. We were also able to talk about iGEM and our participation on it, and, by comparing both competitions, debate how many benefits may arise mainly from people interaction, the development of an altogether, hard, intensive work and collaboration, providing revolutionary products or services to society.
Finally, we debated about ethics regarding science and the use of animal models for research, a recently trending subject in Brazil after invaded a research institute. Then, more than providing some clarification about ethic committees and their requirements, we explained how synthetic biology might be a source of alternative approaches.

This value proposition canvas is a tool to investigate and map the added value of the product you want to sell, to ensure that it is a product that best suits your users needs. It is distributed into the segment Value (left) and Customer (right). For this canvas, we have chosen our main user, the (human) anti-doping agencies, and linked the way the agencies will benefit from our detection method and related services.
Figure 2. Value proposition canvas. This canvas describes how our product ADOPE can be of added value to our customer, the Anti-doping agencies. The left square describes what our products and services are and how they create gain and relieve pain for our user. The circle to the right lists the jobs of our customer, as well as what would benefit the customer (Gains) or what would be undesirable situations (Pains). The circle and square face each other, indicating the many overlapping characteristics between what our user wants and what we offer. More details on each point can be found in the dropdown below.
Value proposition analysis
Customer: Anti-doping agencies
The main customers for our gene doping detection method are anti-doping agencies. The national anti-doping agencies are all given directive by the World anti-doping agency (WADA), leader in stimulating research into anti-doping measures. Their jobs are to protect the spirit of sports, prevent unnatural performance enhancement and protect athletes' health. These three criteria are used to evaluate if a substance will be added to the list of banned substances, after which a detection method will have to be developed to enforce the ban.
Thus, they benefit from an implemented detection method for the substances which are on the list, in this case gene doping. In these tests, they profit from high data processing speed, making the analysis of doping tests faster so they might prevent doping users from starting a race as the results are in before then. In addition, it is advantageous for them to have high-throughput tests, allowing for the testing of many samples at the same time. Athlete privacy is also an important advantage, since this is in compliance with data protection laws. They also benefit from a test that is >accessible to all WADA-accredited laboratories and that fits within the current testing framework. This means that tissue sampling cannot be considered for doping tests ( Haisma and De Hon, 2004 ) and that new doping tests can be implemented within the current testing practices and times. Finally, a method would be easily adaptable to new developments in the doping world, keeping up with the rat race of doping user versus doping detector.
In contrast to these"
Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," homology in all of genome copies has been disrupted, which can only result when the cassette-of-interest is used as the template for HR. Non-homologous end-joining does not occur in chloroplasts, and so would not interfere. By the end of the process, all genome copies would have the cassette-of-interest, i.e. homoplasmy would be achieved.
We are taking safety considerations very seriously. The “driver” cassette would not promote its own propagation, as Cas9 would only cut the genome between homologies 1 and 2. This means that the transformed algae would not pose any danger, even if accidentally released into the environment. Moreover, it may be possible (although further testing is still needing to confirm this) to get rid of the Cas9 gene altogether, by replating the cells onto antibiotic 1 only, once homoplasmy is confirmed. This would remove the selection pressure for the “driver”, which might then be lost.
This design has been the result of discussions with many scientists in the field, safety considerations resulting from our integrated human practices and theoretical work. You are welcome to track the changes in our design in the Notebook section under ""Plasmid design update"" and ""Plasmid design update vol 2"", along with explanations about why changes were made.
A library of chloroplast parts in PhytoBrick standard
We are also developing a library of chloroplast genetic components, compatible with the recently developed and highly modular PhytoBrick standard for the assembly of gene units. We have codon-optimised many of our parts (using the software developed by Saul Purton at UCL), and are checking their functionality. Limited by the 10-week duration of the iGEM project, we are unlikely to complete all the necessary experiments to verify our Cas9 strategy, but the library would also have a standalone value and enable future work in this area.
HARDWARE
We are developing open-source hardware which could come at a fraction of the cost of commercially available equivalents, extensively documenting assembly protocols online to make them accessible to researchers with little or no electronic and mechanical experience. All documentation will include comprehensive part names and wiring diagrams. We are also in the process of uploading video tutorials to Instructables / Youtube
Biolistic Device (“gene gun”)
One of the project aims is to design, build and document a full protocol for a low-cost gene gun. Biolistics is a particle bombardment technique widely used in a range of cell/tissue type transformations, capable of rapid delivery of multiple plasmids for transient or stable expression and without the use"

In order to prevent the aggregation of our fusion proteins after encapsulating their gene-bearing plasmids and purified BamA mRNA into liposomes, we needed to develop a modulatory regulatory tool to lock the translation of our membrane proteins to allow enough time for the encapsulated BamA to fold and insert into the liposome membrane.
Fig. 8 Associational scheme of thermoswitches’ action in the SynDrop system. Not locking the concomitant translation of our target protein and BamA results in target protein aggregation due to insufficient membrane insertion and  assembling potential of BamA.
Fig. 9 Associational scheme of thermoswitches’ action in the SynDrop system. Locking up translation gives time for proper folding and insertion of BamA and prevents undesirable aggregation of target membrane proteins.
Additionally, while creating SynDrop, we have considered various options on how to make our complex cell-free system more user-controllable and predictable. Cell-free systems are becoming an attractive platform for in vitro compartmentalization and protein research, and although usually compositionally sensitive, they also offer a platform for building synthetic genetic regulatory tools or logic gates. Both the need to control the translation time of target genes and desire to provide more modularity for our synthetic system, led us to exploring RNA thermometers as a viable option to perform these tasks. They have minimal molecular burden and are easy to modulate. These properties encouraged us to developed a library of synthetic RNA thermometers suitable to translationally regulate the expression of our fusion constructs in bacteria with a further possibility to transfer them to IVTT systems. All of the RNA thermometers including those we found in literature and our de novo modelled ones were optimized for best performance at 37oC, bearing in mind their future transition to IVTT system, whose optimum performance temperature is also 37oC. Consequently, our experiments showed that our synthetic RNA thermometers, despite their simplistic structures compared to naturally occurring ones, efficiently triggered the expression of target constructs at 37oC, and successfully locked it at lower temperatures having made them an ideal complement to our liposome IVTT system. All of our thermoswitches unlocked the expression to similarly high levels at 37oC, but differed in terms of leakiness and success at inhibiting translation at lower temperatures.
Conclusions
We proved that herein described synthetic RNA thermometers enable high-yield expression of our constructs in an inducible temperature range. What is more important, this spectrum of temperature is compatible with currently used in vitro transcription and translation systems. Synthetic Thermos"

Fig.4  Expression of GFP in different TEV concentration levelswithout using recombinase
(As for each chart in this part, we choose the quantity of GFP as the vertical axis, and 0.01 hour as the unit of the horizontal axis. Different subplots correspond to different levels of intracellular protein concentration). It can be seen that under low signal levels, the effectors have inevitable leakage, which is not allowed by us, so the rec system have tobe used to ensure the rigor of the system.
Recombinases , especially a subset called serine integrases and excisionases[5], are enzymes that can flip specific fragments of DNA. Recombinase can directionally catalyze sensitive DNA exchange reactions between targeted short (30–40 nucleotides) sequence sites that are specific to each recombinase[6]. They have been proved to be able to stably modify DNA sequences, which is the biological basis of our MOSFET construct.
Fig. 5 Large serine integrases reliably and irreversibly flip unique fragments of DNA
DNA cleavage and re-ligation occur at the central crossover region at a pair of recombinase recognition sites (attB and attP), which allows the sequence to be flipped between recognition sites. After recombination, the original attB and attP sequences become reconstructed sequences attL and attR. The resulting attL and attR sequences cannot be recognized and bound by integrases alone, so the state after integration is stable.
Signal output
After mathematic model verification, it was found that the system achieved equal outputs with different thresholds and jump by using different promoters and recombinases. These features mean that it can function as quick-response switches. The Model team fed back to the Wet team, hoping to make more diverse switches by combining different promoters and recombinases.
Fig. 6 We re-selected the tetO-downstream promoters
UbC, EF1α, and miniCMV were selected and matched with different recombinases, including TP901, Bxb1 and PhiC31, by adjusting the parameters of each part and the strength of the promoter. Our whole system has formed nine threshold choices.
Theoretically, by selecting different promoters and recombinases, we can actually control whether the recombinase can successfully complete the reverse of its downstream sequence under a certain antigen concentration. In other words, we can preset the threshold antigen concentration according to our practical applications.
System reset
To realize a resettable and more accurate 0/1 switch, we introduce recombination directionality factor (RDF)"

Another thing to note is that there are two white, hazy continuous bands within the gel; one of them is located at the bottom of the first set of wells and the second band is located at the bottom of the second set of wells. These are thought to be the primer dimer complexes formed by the dNTP's. This means that the dNTPS hadn't been accidently missed out.

In light of the PCR reaction failure the Metal Sensing team will need to carry out the PCR reactions on the transformed B. subtilis genome again. This time though, the genomic DNA will be prepared firstly using on the kits found in the lab. This process extracts the genomic DNA of the Bacillus subtilis cells meaning that nothing can get in the way of the PCR reaction from happening. This theory arises from the fact that B. subtilis is Gram positive; it's cell wall may interfere with the PCR reactions. Additionally, the PCR reactions will work better in pure DNA samples.
That will form tomorrow's task. In the meantime, the metal sensor team prepared the overnight cultures of the wild type Bacillus subtilis cells to be used in the genomic DNA preparations tomorrow. To 2 x test-tubes 1.5ml of LB was added and, under aseptic technique, 2 colonies of wild type B. subtilis was extracted from the plate and added to each of the tubes. These test-tubes were then transferred to the shaking incubator at 37C for an overnight growth.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"21] using the CURL network library and further parsed using the LibXML library. In case of network failure, the NRPSDesigner can fall back to a local copy of the taxonomy database, which can be retrieved from the NCBI FTP server in advance. In order to reduce network traffic and memory consumption when the final graph is built, as little data as possible is loaded in advance. The missing taxonomy information is retrieved lazily in parallel to the shortest path computation and cached afterwards. DNA sequences and metadata not required for the pathway construction are fetched after the pathway has been constructed only for the domains the pathway is comprised of. The final pathway is returned in form of an XML file, built with the LibXML library, containing information on the domains and their origin.
For command-line option parsing, the Boost.program_options library was chosen, as it promotes modularity by allowing every component to specify its own set of options. This enables switching between different database backends or changing the existing one without the rest of the program knowing about it. Although this approach introduces an extra dependency to the NRPSDesigner library itself and not just the executable, Boost.program_options allows querying of options, their associated data type and other metadata. Therefore e.g. a graphical user interface written in C++ could extract this information and dynamically build the required input fields, without knowing anything about the underlying algorithm or backends.
The Web Interface
In order to allow tight integration with the Gibthon software package of iGEM 2010 we chose the Django framework , written in Python, as the back-end of the web interface (see Fig. 5 ). The front-end was implemented using the Bootstrap 2, jQuery and jQueryUI frameworks. The interface allows to select the desired peptide monomers and specify their configuration/modification. Subsequently, a 2D structure preview of the resulting molecule is generated on-the-fly using the OpenBabel library [12] via its Python bindings. The structures of the individual amino acids are captured from the database, performing a SMARTS pattern search for the NH2-CR-COOH group and constructing peptide bonds between consecutive monomers. The resulting peptide structure is projected to 2D coordinates, exported as SVG and then directly sent to the browser. To reduce server load, structures are cached using Django’s view caching functionality.
Heavy computations like pathway construction or domain prediction are performed asynchronously outside of the web server to counter long computation times and request timeouts. The Celery Python package combined with RabbitMQ is used for managing and scheduling the tasks. Additionally log messages are collected and retrieved by the browser via AJAX polling. After the pathway has been constructed"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Second there is no vitamin B12 necessary, the only cofactors which are involved are NADPH and biotin, both of them naturally occurring in the organism.   Third there is theoretically just one further enzyme needed to complete the pathway.   All enzymes necessary for the production of malonyl-CoA are still present in V. natriegens and we just have to integrate the last enzyme, malonyl-CoA reductase.   Nevertheless, overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase increases productivity, so we took both enzymes into consideration. (Kildegaard et al. 2016) proposed, that there are many ways to further optimize the pathway and direct the flow to a high product titer. Hence, implementing many variations of this pathway into V. natriegens and testing them in a fast manner promises a high gain of knowledge about pathway optimization and general principles of metabolic engineering.
Figure 2: Pathway for the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid
The pathway starts with pyruvate as product of glycolysis and other central metabolisms. Pyruvate is dehydrogenated by pyruvate dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA gets carboxylated by
Acc
to form malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is finally reduced to 3-hydroxypropionic acid by Mcr. Acc and
Mcr
are the two enzyme, we planned to express heterologously. Acc = Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, Mcr = Malonyl-CoA reductase
Choice of enzymes
For the core pathway, we need to implement two enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc) and malonyl-CoA reductase (Mcr).  For Acc there are several candidates, which have still been tested for synthetic metabolisms    ( (Kildegaard et al. 2016) ; (Liu et al. 2013) ; (Vidra et al. 2017)) .     Our plan was to first test enzymes from different organisms and then optimize expression profiles.   To benefit from the fast engineering workflow in V. natriegens, we decided to use enzymes from different organisms.   We planned to use the native
Acc
from V. natriegens, because it is still present in the cells and we prevent unnecessary burden by overexpressing a heterologous Acc.   The native Acc consists of four subunits together with an associated biotin ligase"

Kill Switch
In the applications of synthetic biology, people always question about the safety of genetic engineered organism. There is a potential risk of horizontal gene transfer to other non-lab strains, posting a threat to the natural ecosystem. Therefore, we need to take some measures to guarantee the safety of our bacterial materials. Moreover, for potential medical use of engineered organism, we have to take extra step to ensure the biosafety.
In our project, we designed bacteria to treat gut inflammation. It is critical to control the fate of genetically modified bacteria when needed. We did so by engineering a kill switch in bacteria. The kill switch should allow us to terminate bacteria after therapy, so as to avoid interrupting the normal gut ecosystem and the risk of horizontal gene transfer. We decided to use two type of killer genes, killer red and phi 174 gene E, as the kill switches.

Nanjing_China_Bio,2012,Team:Nanjing China Bio#projects_-_-_TEXT.html," a long time ago (over 150 years).  However, due to uncontrollable toxic effects to normal tissues, this method has been disregarded for decades.
Thanks to the development of molecular biology technologies, we can modify bacteria as we wish, thus tumor therapy undergoes a spectacular renaissance.  In order to eliminate the toxic effects of bacteria upon normal tissues, we need to screen some promoters that express specifically only in tumor areas.  As stated above, the central parts of tumor are highly hypoxic areas.  Therefore if we screen out the anaerobic promoters that only function under hypoxic circumstances, we could make the genes for cytotoxic drugs specifically express in tumor tissues to decrease the damage on normal tissues.  Through consulting on predecessors' work, we searched out several anaerobic promoters, ligating each of them to plasmid vectors with reporter using molecular techniques.  Promoters highly expressed in hypoxic circumstances could be screened after transferring Salmonella Typhimurium with modified combined plasmids.
In addition, the Salmonella Typhimurium we used are VNP20009 from the lab of Professor Zichun Hua, a bacteria knocked out of chromogenes purI and msbB.  The bacteria are also removed of antibiotic-resistance markers, becoming stable antibiotic sensitive strains.[6]

Results from this reaction are about the same as in previous PCR reactions.  mZifA and mGliA are definitely present, being 318 bp and 422 bp in length, respectively.  mLexA may be present, though while it should be only 244 bp in length, the band for this PCR reaction was longer than 422 bp.  pCYC might also be present.  This is corroborated by the fact that there is a strong band between 200 and 300 bp, which corresponds nicely to the length of pCYC (288 bp).  However, it is important to note that there was also a small band around 700-800 bp as well.
Innoculated cultures of W3031a in YPAD for transformations tomorrow.  Placed into incubator at 5:17 pm.  Have Ricahrd's permission to use his shaking incubator tomorrow should we need it.
Innoculated two cultures of HB101 in LB in preparation for making competent cells tomorrow.  Also restreaked another plate of HB101 for use should we fail tomorrow.  Both the cultures and the plate went into the incubator at 8:42 pm.
Ligations will occur today instead.

Interview with National Council Mr. Markus Ritter
Mr. Markus Ritter
This is a translation from the german original audio file. Questions and answers ( see below , for the original audio file contact the team) done by a student. We try to translate as accurately as possible, but we are no ribosomes. No mistake that arises through translation mistakes is intended.
Question: Is the continuation of the Moratorium on GMP a sign for the smaller acceptance in politics and society or the fear of the research in the field of GMOs here in Switzerland?
Answer: I think so. There is a fundamental reservation in Switzerland and generally in Europe in terms of genetically modified plants. This is certainly caused also because of food scandals, for example EHEC and BSE. The consumers are generally more sensible about food.
For genetic engineering we are still waiting for three main things:
You need to show that genetically engineered plants will have more advantages than usual production methods,
the coexistence between ordinary agriculture and genetic modified plants needs to be shown,
and we still need to show that there will be no consequences with this technology.
The eyes are now on you and the research to proof these points. I would never intend to stop research.
Q: These examples of EHEC and BSE are no examples for genetic engineering. Do you think the fear of the people comes from not being well informed?
A: The more we are proceeding into the direction of globalisation and a highly technological world, the more people want untouched nature, culture and values, and they try to at least protect their food as an untouched refugium. They say: “No! Everything, but not our food!”
Q: But if we now consider that we can show drastic advantages and we can dis"

Collaboration with SIAT-SCIE
In collaboration with SIAT-SCIE, we held a workshop to communicate about our projects. We also help them with molecular cloning biology.
After several online contacts, we invited SIAT-SCIE to our lab and held the first workshop in SUSTech. The first part of the workshop was introduction of our ideas and methods, and we prepared a brief speech on background knowledge about microinjection and microfluidics which we used in our design. After our presentation, SIAT-SCIE also proposed their idea about the project and possible related research literatures.
What’s more, we also deeply exchanged our ideas about managing a project. And we reached an agreement that working in smaller groups and having group meeting is a good way to coordinate working progress and form a good working pattern.
SIAT-SCIE project introduction
Workshop with SIAT-SCIE
We also participated in South China iGEMer Meeting up held by SIAT-SCIE and Shenzhen_SFLS. The aim of this meeting was facilitate communication between college teams and high school teams. We also shared our ideas with other teams in the meeting.
South China iGEMer Meeting up
Besides exchanging ideas, collaboration was also meaningful by giving help to other iGEM teams which experienced technical difficulties. For example, we taught them how to construct plasmid and we helped SIAT-SCIE construct their core plasmid in their project.

Safety
   The strains of E. coli that we have generated in the course of this project are not likely to cause disease or other bio-safety problems under standard laboratory conditions. None of the parts that we have generated in our project have a high inherent bio-safety risk, though it is conceivable that these parts could be used to along proteins that themselves have bio-safety issues. Therefore we stress that users of this technology verify that human risks from expressed proteins are minimal.
   We refered https://2010.igem.org/Team:Washington/Safety for this statement.
Secretion System
   Our work on Type 3 Secretion System was done without involving live Salmonella bacteria. We used 2 BAC library fragments from Salmonella's DNA which was obtained from Salmonella Genetic Stock Centre (SGSC) following required procedures. These 2 fragments of salmonella genome is inserted in BAC Vector which is contained in E.Coli strain MG1655. Our instructor obtained appropriate permit from our universities safety officer of genetic recombinantion.  These E.Coli were acknowledged as non-pathogenic and permitted to be used under P1 safety level. However due to material transfer agreement between our laboratory and SGSC we can’t submit  Type 3 Secretion Apparatus (Syringe part of Type 3 Secretion System) to BioBrick Registry.

Integrated Practices
This year our project is going to strengthen the bio-pattern formation in augmented reality which means we are trying to make control of the bio-pattern by computer paths and systems.  That could be applying to the printing of biology materials, the controlling of embryonic development and the regenerating of tissue and organ,however, we are seeking for chances to collaborate with related enterprises,such as Baofeng company which was a video player technology company in China to provide us the equipment we need. For during the research and observation process of our program, we are planning to bring in the monitoring function of computer in order to get a real time monitoring and adjustment of the bio-pattern which means connect the virtual world with the real cultivate, that's the AR part of our program.
We also interested in how our project will affect the society so we took part in some activities in China including a few meet-up conference and questionnaire surveys. For example:
2016 HUST China cheering up
Our team take part in 2016 iGEM HUST China cheering up in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan this summer.   We shared our idea and experience of experiments and mathematical modeling with other iGEMers. There were so many enthusiastic students from the university all over the country. We talked about projects, some difficulties we ever faced during the conference.
2016 STSU CCiC
We are invited to participate in the third CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer's Committee) hosted by SUN YAT-SEN University on September ,2016. In the presentation time, many teams show their project and ideas . In tea break time, we communicated actively with other teams about our project, and received many good advice and suggestions.
By the way, the CCiC means ""Central China iGEMers Consortium"". It’s origin from the 1st Central China iGEMers' meet up hosted by our team in 2014.

Guiding HS students towards future participation
After our lectures, we decided to guide students from The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University to participate in the coming iGEM HS in 2013. On August 28th, our several team members once again went to The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University and had a talk with Ms Shen Jinghong, the Associate Principal of the school, and two other teachers who are interested in iGEM. We also took lots of photos recording the scene of discussion.
Figure 21. On August 28th, our several team members once again went to The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University and had a talk with Ms Shen Jinghong, the Associate Principal of the school. (She is on the left)
According to our great job in propagating the concept of iGEM HS division one and a half month before, their students are motivated to take part in the iGEM competition, fulfilling their utmost potential. We discussed in details about the total number of students participated, the schedule, and what we are able to do in supporting them. They were thankful for our efforts and began to consider subsequent issues.

In September, we invited some of the students, YAN Wumo, GE Qiuchen, and HAN Yutong, in The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University (SHSBNU), who are willing to participate in the iGEM contest, to join our group discussion and study basic molecular experiments techniques, such as plasmid extraction and gel electrophoresis. In the process, they have made a great progress in learning primary knowledge and frontiers of Synthetic Biology, as well as in the elementary experiment manipulation. We have also taken lots of photos recording their study process.

Cloning Strategy
We assembled the different indC variants on a chloramphenicol resistance backbone (pSB1C3) with an IPTG-inducable lac-promoter, the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 and the coding sequence of the respective indC variant. The indC plasmids should be co-transformed with a PPTase construct to get a significant and fast indigoidine production. Therefore, we used a second plasmid backbone carrying a kanamycin resistance (pSB3K3). We assembled five pSB3K3 derived plasmids, each carrying an expression cassette with an IPTG induceable lac-promotor, the BBa_B0029 ribosome binding site and the coding sequence of the respective PPTase (sfp, svp, entD, delC and ngrA; see Table 1). We used E. coli TOP10 for co-transformations of the possible combination of the indC variants (2) and all PPTase plasmids (5).
Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning
Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) is a sequence-independent cloning method based on homologous recombination of double-strand DNA overlaps of vector and insert(s) (
). It is suitable for the generation of combinatorial, synthetic construct libraries as it allows for multi-fragment assembly in an accurate, efficient and economical manner.   CPEC relies on a simple polymerase extension of the DNA fragments to be assembled. Crucial to this concept is the design of vector and insert fragments which MUST share overlapping regions at the ends ( Figure 1.1 ). In a single reaction set-up, insert DNA fragments and linear vector are heat denaturized and allowed to anneal at elevated temperature, resulting in specific hybridized insert-vector constructs ( Figure 1.2 ). Subsequently, the single-strand hybrid constructs are extended under PCR-elongation conditions (72 °C for 20 s/kbp of longest fragment) which yield completely assembled, double-stranded circular constructs ( Figure 1.3 ) ready for transformation into competent cells. The single strands nicks introduced on each strand due to the unidirectional nature of the polymerase chain reaction will be removed by endogenous ligases upon transformation into Escherichia coli.

Conclusions Color
After a great summer of hard work, we've learned quite a few things. The most important about the color pathway are listed below.
Color Pathway - Wetlab
It proved to be too much work to PCR 8 genes out of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in addition to making the temperature sensitive input system work (with only 2 wetlab guys). It was a good choice to split the project into two paths, as advised at the teachers workshop in Paris, as this allowed us to choose for the most promising path, should one of them not work out as expected. When it became obvious the actual color producing genes we aimed to get from the registry were of low quality (bad sequencing or did not grow at all) we gave priority to the temperature sensitive input system. In the end we did make some progress towards constructing our envisioned color pathway by PCR-ing three of the genes out of E. coli, which have been sent to the registry and to a sequencing company.

British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," more well-rounded scientist and researcher. My goal is to become more knowledgeable in the field of synthetic biology, whether that is through reading background content or applying lab techniques. That way, I can contribute more to the team in the future as well as apply what I have learned to other similar experiences down the road.
What inspires you:
What has really driven me throughout my life has been the dynamic between the natural curiosity humans have towards the unknown and the ability to share the discoveries stemmed from that interest to society. It is fascinating to see how driven humanity can be to venture into the unknown, risking everything for the sake of obtaining knowledge. What fascinates me further is how captivated these scientists are in explaining these findings to everyone else so that all can benefit from the newfound information. This process is one that I believe makes humanity very special and gifted and one that drives me to do my part to help.
Desired Impact on the World:
Humanitarian aid has always been a passion of mine, especially with it came to investigating the various public health concerns around the world. I would love to be an integral part of research pivotal in improving the health of communities currently lacking in accessible healthcare. Whether this is through drug discovery or disease control, it would be fantastic to contribute to work that leads to aiding others.
Hobbies:
When I am not working on iGEM, I am often outside playing sports or supporting my favorite sport teams. In particular, I am an avid soccer fan, passionately supporting the clubs Tottenham Hotspurs and San Jose Earthquakes. In exploration of my more artistic side, I frequently spend my time painting and learning new languages.

Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM because of a Terry Talk by a past iGEM member, who described the elegance of synthetic biology and the need to create standardized parts. That moment on, I was hooked into iGEM and its limitless potential.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I have been with iGEM for several years now and every year I love being able to take a concept and try to turn it into something tangible, useful, and meaningful; it truly is a unique undergraduate experience. The jamboree is one of my favourite parts of iGEM, its inspiring to see all the different projects and hear what inspired other teams.
What inspires you:
Nature, its incredible complexity juxtaposed with its elegant simplicity is just mind blowing. I see nature and its application as being as limitless as the imagination itself.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," list of publications on our wiki. The following text is meant to give a first impression about what is known and what has been done so far regarding V. natriegens.
Introduction
First isolated from salt marsh mud on Sapelo island off the coast of Georgia in 1958 (Payne et al. 1958), the gram-negative bacterium was first named Pseudomonas natriegens (Payne et al. 1960). These early studies also revealed a broad range of tolerated pH conditions with an optimum at a pH of 7.5 (Payne et al. 1960). One feature of this newly discovered organism became immediately apparent: The incredible doubling rate, first determined to be around 9.8 minutes (Eagon 1962). We found that doubling rates of around 7 minutes were possible (own Data).
Only much later, studies found several possible reasons for this. Firstly, as most Vibrio species, V. natriegens genome is split and distributed on two chromosomes. This means that replication can start at two origins of replication (Ori), resulting in more in parallel replication.
Figure 1: EM photograph of V. natriegens (Austin et al. 1978).
Additionally, it was shown that the gamma-proteobacterium has an increased
rRNA
activity. This is because of a greater number of
rRNA
operons which are additionally controlled by stronger promoters (Aiyar et al. 2002) when compared to E. coli . More
rRNA
means more ribosomes since
rRNA
synthesis has been shown to be the rate-limiting step in their assembly (Miura et al. 1981). Estimates for the number of ribosomes in V. natriegens in the exponential phase suggest around 115,000 per cell, while E. coli is estimated to have between 70,000 and 90,000 (Failmezger et al. 2018).
This gives V. natriegens higher protein expression and lets it create biomass more quickly. Could this also be exploited for the production of high-value proteins? Most likely.
It was soon discovered that V. natriegens would make a perfect example by which to effectively and harmlessly demonstrate the basic techniques of microbiology to students, taking full advantage of the immense doubling rate (Mullenger 1973; Delpech 2001). Experiments regarding population structure, UV stress, and simply bare growth can be observed in a much shorter time frame.

      Small Protein-Mediated Quorum Sensing in a Gram- Negative Bacterium (PMID : 22174954) To elucidate this function, we previously isolated and characterized eight genes required for Ax21 activity (rax genes). raxA, raxB and raxC encode components of a predicted type I secretion system (TOSS). Ax21requires this RaxABC TOSS for activity and secretion [3,4]. The RaxB protein carries two highly conserved N terminal proteolytic subdomains characteristic of transporters in Gram-positive bacteria that cleave N-terminal peptides prior to substrate secretion [4]. These data, together with the presence of a predicted N-terminal signal sequence in Ax21, suggest that Ax21 is cleaved by the RaxB transporter prior to secretion. raxST, raxP and raxQ encode enzymes involved in sulfation
      This indicates AX21 is synthesized without a plant
