Hey, I'm Vic, an undergraduate senior student majoring in mathematical statistics. Yet my research field is biology statistics, and that is why I'm here.
For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"The sequencing of the J04500 + Beta-lactamase with a His-tag construction from last week revealed that we had successfully completed this part.Mutagenesis primers were designed for this gene as a BsaI cut site is present in the sequence which could interfere with any Golden Gate assembly attempted with this part. Successful mutation of this part was completed and confirmed via gel electrophoresis and sequencing. A preliminary test was also attempted with this part in order to see if the leaky properties of the LacI (BBa_J04500) promoter could successfully produce beta-lactamase at levels large enough to allow the transformed cells to survive on plates containing ampicillin even though this part exists in a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid (pSB1C3). This test successfully displayed that active beta-lactamase was being produced by our cells. Also produced this week was the plasmid switch of the beta-lactamase gene with a His-tag at the C-terminus, the beta-lactamase gene with a glycine linker at the N-terminus.
Week 14: July 29 - August 2
Realizing the time constraints we have for the submission of our parts, we reviewed our Golden Gate assembly experiment to ensure we can submit the parts to the registry. In case this method fails, we also began development of Gibson assembly primers to see if this assembly assembly method cooperates with us.
We began characterization of prussian blue ferritin through kinetics experiments. Our first goal was the construction Michaelis-Menten plot to determine the activity of our peroxidase-like catalyst with the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) substrate which ended up looking like this: INSRERT GAPHHHH These experiments then continued on to optimization experiments wherein we determined the optimal pH, temperature, and concentrations of ABTS and H2O2. We intend to repeat these experiments 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine so that we could compare the two substrates and determine the most viable one for our final system.
Week 15: August 5 - August 9
Prepared the basic reagents for magnetoferritin synthesis, we attempted to create apoferritin this week.

Over Sugarfilm and More
Taking most of the advantages of biofilm as a reactor, Sugarfilm makes phase-related synthesizing procedure (in this case, 3 phases in total) more suitable in biological ways:
(1)Each cell only carries out one reaction step in the system, which greatly relieves stress to the cell when compared with cells carrying the whole process;
(2)The efficiency would not be weakened due to the separation of each step, since the formation of biofilm links all the cells together to get the work done in a nice flow.
What Sugarfilm illustrates here is more than just a simple application. It's a symbol of infinite possibilities coming with our stratified expression biofilm system (Rainbofilm). For similar synthesizing pathways involving a lot of extracellular reaction and intermediate product flow, and relatively clear phase division in the pathway, Sugarfilm would be an ideal model. Only by substituting the corresponding coding sequence parts in the device with the desired coding sequences (enzymes or regulating molecules, etc.) would the system get off to a quick and neat reaction state.
In future development, Sugarfilm should aim to further improve the versatility of the system. First, the targeted substrate of the reactor system should not be limited to saccharide. In fact, Sugarfilm system has the potential to apply to any phase-related synthes"

This year Team Minnesota has been very active in collaborating with different iGEM teams. We contributed to Team Eindhoven's cloning guide by providing information on yeast recombinational cloning. This way future iGEM teams have a manual explaining how different cloning methods work so they can explore which technique is best for their project. We also helped Team Aachen, Michigan Software, Paris-Saclay, and Santa Clara by providing data and filling out their respective survey. Lastly, we helped Team Egypt by mentoring their new team.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion .
In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.

Abstracts or summary of different teams’ projects that worked with riboregulators
The usage of the riboregulator system can be versatile; Different teams utilized the system in different ways. In general, introducing the riboregulator system to a certain circuit allows another level regulation. The new level of regulation then can give possible outcomes such as: specific interaction/communication (UC Berkeley 2006/ Caltech 2007); minimization of leakage by introducing post-transcriptional repression (Calgary 2007); and modulation of different concentrations of desired outcome (K.U. Leuven 2009).
One drawback of riboregulator system in the context of iGEM is that teams that originally have riboregulator incorporated in their systems drop the use of riboregulator of because of time restraint (Calgary 2007). This is because when riboregulators are used to introduce another level of regulation, it becomes a supplementary part of the project; Usually, even without the extra level of regulation, the teams can prove the functionality of their systems. Therefore when the time is limited, and when the teams prioritize the things they need to do, they end up dropping the riboregulator system.

Abstract: “Networks of interacting cells provide the basis for neural learning. We have developed the process of addressable conjugation for communication within a network of E. coli bacteria. Here, bacteria send messages to one another via conjugation of plasmid DNAs, but the message is only meaningful to cells with a matching address sequence. In this way, the Watson Crick base-pairing of addressing sequences replaces the spatial connectivity present in neural systems. To construct this system, we have adapted natural conjugation systems as the communication device. Information contained in the transferred plasmids is only accessible by ""unlocking"" the message using RNA based 'keys'. The resulting addressable conjugation process is being adapted to construct a network of NAND logic gates in bacterial cultures. Ultimately, this will allow us"

Introduction
The majority of the previous iGEM projects focused on expressing certain genes to achieve a specific task such as sensing a certain phenomenon. This year, we took a step forward in exploring the potential of Escherichia coli, thus building a system that is capable of regulating multiple genes. The system, so-called E.colightuner, is built by three regulated-systems including light regulated-system, temperature regulated-system, and sRNA regulated-system. We used noninvasive factors such as red light and temperature to create different conditions under which E. coli can express different genes. We also introduced a new sRNA regulated-system that hasn't been widely applied in iGEM before.
E.col"
ColumbiaU_NYC,2016,Team:ColumbiaU NYC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," there was a high      degree of bacterial growth on the plates, which was not      expected. Perhaps, the gentamicin did not kill the      bacteria on the cells either because the concentration was      too low or the the incubation time period was not long      enough.
Another experiment was conducted to determine the IC50 of      rhamnolipid by treating the keratinocytes with different      concentrations of rhamnolipids for 24 hours. The      concentrations selected were based upon the results of      several research papers that utilized rhamnolipids with      different cell lines. Graphpad software was utilized to      model the the data and it was determined that the IC50 is      between 40 and 60 ug/ml.

Molecular Cloning
Tired of waiting for the xylose inducible promoter      backbone plasmid, we decided to utilize what we have      already available in the lab and clone arabinose inducible      promoter into our construct. We designed and ordered the      primers for the new construct with the arabinose promoter.
Rhamnolipid Quantification
This week, we wanted to see if saturating LB with glucose      helps producing rhamnolipids.  We grew mutant putida with      LB + 10g/L of glucose, 30 g/L of glucose, and 50 g/L of      glucose and measured the amount of rhamnolipids at      different time points. After 24 hours of growth, 50 g/L      glucose gave the most amount of rhamnolipids.  After 72      hours of growth, all three growth media gave slightly less      rhamnolipids.  It is possible that bacteria are eating up      rhamnolipids as they run out of carbon sources during the      stationary phase. We also created a more accurate standard      curve using 95% pure mono-rhamnolipids.
Keratinocyte Experiments
Based upon our suspicion that the gentamicin was not      killing the bacteria, we conducted an experiment in which      we manipulated the concentration of gentamicin and the      incubation time points using four different strains of      bacteria (E.coli, W.T. Putida, Aeruginosa, and Mutant      strain). The highest time point and concentration was four      hours at 200 ug/mL yet these conditions were not      successful on all of the strains.
We planned repeat the bacteria MOI experiment with      different, accurately calculated MOIs knowing the new"

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

NTNU_Trondheim,2018,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," laboratory. We have to assess different strains, glucose levels, pH, and medium nutrients when doing biofilm assays, and try to imitate the conditions in nature.
His insight made us decide to do a test on LB and M63B1 medium to discover which glucose and pH values that were optimal for biofilm formation in E. coli Dh5α and TG1 strains.
His advice benefited us a lot by allowing us to produce significant amounts of biofilm and therefore enabling us to see whether CRISPRi had an inhibitory effect or not.
Kåre made us aware of the flaws in our original protocols for biofilm quantification, and consequently we went with the alternative protocol that he had recommended.
Key insight
It is hard to diagnose biofilm. Routine-diagnostics is based on planktonic growth. In biofilm the bacteria multiply slower, there are less metabolic activity, gene expression changes and the bacteria is less sensitive to antibiotics. To diagnose it, they have to try to remove and crush the biofilm matrix, before growing the bacteria.
It is the low-virulent bacteria that causes problems, because there is few symptoms. The consequence is a buildup of bacteria in the biofilm so the implant has to be removed.
Biofilm formation depends heavily on the growth media, especially the glucose levels.
Provided a better protocol on Crystal Violet Assay for biofilm measurements.
Summary of Interview
We interviewed Kåre Bergh, professor at «Institute of Clinical and Molecular Medicine» at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim, Norway. Kåre has previously worked with infections, microbiology and immunology, and currently works with diagnostics. In our interview, Kåre gave us interesting and detailed insights regarding prosthetics operations and the risk of bacterial contamination during the operation. Infections can actually occur years after a prosthetics surgery, and can be discovered due to indications that the prosthetics has detached.This is caused by low-virulent bacteria in biofilm that gives rise to non or modest symptoms of inflammation. This makes it difficult to diagnose and the biofilm would have to be discovered, removed and grown in the lab to be able to identify the bacteria. Only 1-2 % of the patients with hip prostheses is infected with biofilm-producing bacteria, but it is very unfortunate for those who do. After a few years, often between 1-2 years, the prosthetic has accumulated dangerous levels of bacteria in a biofilm matrix.  Consequently, the prosthetic must be removed through another surgery and replaced with a new one. This is very stressful for the patient, as well"

After this step, we cocultured confirmed transformants in a 10mL LB medium and extracted the plasmid with the 〖E.Z.N.A.〗^TM  plasmid mini kit I (produced by Omega Bio-tek). The plasmid was transformed into JW3379 and 48 single clones were picked. JW3379 chemically component cells were prepared by the following protocol. This library was named after sweet pressure part RBS library in this iGEM project.
Figure. 10 mutation rate measurement induced by our engineered mutD mutator
In this week, we also measured the mutation rate increase induced by mutD mutator. The basic protocol was provided as attachment “mutation rate measurement”. To be brief, strains E.coli JM109 carrying vectors pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, pBAD_B0032-mutD-sfGFP and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFP were cultured in LB medium and induced by 1g/L arabinose and the specific fluorescence of sfGFP (excitation 488nm, emission 512nm) (fluorescence to OD600) was measured. Thus, we made sure that pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFP have relatively higher mutD expression. Thus, only the mutation rate of pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFP were measured in the condition of arabinose induction by 1g/L and strains carrying pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP without arabinose induction and wild type JM109 were set as negative control. We followed the protocol provided and found that pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFP could increase the genome mutation rate up to 10 times compared with negative control. The results were shown as the figure below.
Week8（8.14-8.21）
In this week, we tested the performance of our constructed tetA based selection pressure circuit. We were trying very hard to finely tune the culture condition to make our system have desired tryptophan dependent property. However, we only obtained very weak such property. First of all, we cultured E.coli JM109 carrying pTrc99A_trp sensor_RBS_tetA series of plasmid in"
UMaryland,2018,Team:UMaryland#BCmodel_-_-_TEXT.html,"0.01 cm) = 15.87  g cellulose
Using values obtained from the literature about the CipA-CBD [1] where our CBD was acquired from, we determined:
- Maximum binding of CipA-CBD to cellulose = 0.43 µM/g cellulose
- Local concentration of PETase at 50% binding = (0.5)(15.87 g)(0.43 µM/g) = 3.41 µM PETase
Enzyme Kinetics
The degradation of PET follows heterogeneous catalysis, where the reactants and the products [2] are in different phases. This creates difficulty in modeling the rate of degradation but teams such as Tianjin China has used Langmuir's Equation, secretion, and diffusion models to model the process of secretion, diffusion, adsorption, and degradation. However, while their models gave great insight into the mathematical relationships between these variables, it was not possible to obtain practical results as many of the variables used in the equation are not found in the literature and are difficult to obtain experimentally.
We have developed the “working cellulose” model which is more practical in predicting the rate of degradation when PETase with a cellulose binding domain is added to a degradation system. We modeled the rate of degradation of PETase as a zero-order system, where the concentration of the reactant is negligible to the rate of the reaction. This is present in many surface-limited chemical catalysis models, where the catalyst surface is saturated by the reactants, and the rate limiting step can be simplified in the surface area of the catalyst.
However, in our PET degradation model, the reverse holds true, where the concentration of PETase is the rate limiting variable compared to the surface area of the PET film when considering practical examples such as the degradation of a plastic bottle. We determined the following rate equation for the degradation of PET:
In our reduced and simplified zero order enzyme kinetics equation, we only need to know the product, time, and enzyme concentrations to determine the kinetic variable k to predict degradation. Through values obtained through the original PETase discovery paper by Yoshida et al, we were able to calculate the kinetic variable for both low-crystalline and high-crystalline PET.
At 30°C, pH 7.0, [PETase concentration] = 50nM, time = 18 hrs: PETase produced a total of 0.015 mM of product when fed high-crystalline PET and 0.3 mM of product when fed thin-sheet PET.

Outreach
As one of the rather few groups involved in synthetic biology and as the only iGEM team in Finland, we had two major goals in outreach: First, we wanted to increase knowledge of synthetic biology and its possibilities among the general public, students, educators, researchers as well as in industry and business. Second, we aimed to increase awareness of iGEM among students, researchers and educators as potential future iGEM participants, instructors and mentors. Furthermore, we promoted iGEM to industry, business and non-governmental organizations as potential supporters of future iGEM teams.
Events
General public
To promote synthetic biology to the general public, we approached the people behind the science festival Thinkfest , organized by the University of Helsinki in early September. Thankfully, we were given a major role in organizing a Science picnic, an event oriented mainly towards families. We brought with us microscopes to check out gram-stained bacteria with, amazing glow-in-the-dark bacteria and even a gene gun! Children could also colour their own superhero bacterium and tell us its special ability, or play Flappy Coli previously developed by Aalto-Helsinki. We also had the chance to give a talk on synthetic biology, its possibilities, and our project for an audience of general public in the center of Helsinki during the event.

From them, we learned that, as we expected, farmers care a lot about the conditions that their crops are exposed to, and hence might be receptive to new technologies like ours which allow for better environmental control.

Terrapin Farms
Next we spoke to Terrapin Farms, an organic hydroponic farm that uses Nutrient Film Technique systems, where they grow microbes in the plant growth water to improve the flavor of their greens. We wanted to learn about the use of microbes in farming, since ultimately that is what we would like to do. They do not face any additional legal regulation since their bacteria are sourced from the soil and not transgenic. In order to keep their bacteria alive, Terrapin uses molasses instead of traditional nutrient solutions containing salts and citric acid. The molasses not only provides a source of sugar for the bacteria, but also helps control the pH of the solution. We discovered that people do not seem to have a problem with the microbes because soil farming also has bacteria. Like most traditional hydroponic farms, Terrapin has high hopes in hydroponics' role in future food production. They reinforced the idea that hydroponics has the ability to allow farming in areas less amenable to traditional agriculture.

Karma Farms
We sought out small hydroponic farms in order to learn more about their challenges and what was obstructing them from expansion. Nathaniel Shaw is the Hydroponic Production Manager at Karma Farms, which is a small farm that focuses on year-round production of greens to the local community. His farm struggles with low margins and inconsistent crop yields. We discovered that he hopes to improve crop yield with a better lighting system and more automation for measurements such as pH and temperature. He emphasized the need for consistent crop yields to keep the business going.

Bolton Farms
Bolton Farms is a hydroponic greenhouse facility in Hilton, NY.  We hoped to discover the causes for the high operation costs of mid-sized farms. We talked to John Bolton, who revealed that the biggest problems in hydroponics revolve around maintaining a controlled environment. Heating is an important part of control because of the cold winters in upstate NY. He mentioned to us that one of the biggest causes of hydroponics farms failing was labor costs. Expensive labor pushes some farms to move towards automation.

""After my usual diversion of investigating 'a pain an' a flutterin' about         me heart,' and an 'O, I'm kilt intirely,' I visited Mrs. Mackerel, and had         the extreme pleasure of finding her quite composed, and in conversation         with her fashionable friend, Mrs. Tiptape. The latter was the daughter of         a 'retired milliner,' and had formed a desirable union with Tiptape, the         eminent dry goods merchant. Fortunately--for she was a woman of         influence--I passed the critical examination of Mrs. T. unscathed by her         sharp black eyes, and, as the sequel will show, was considered by her         'quite an agreeable person.'
""Poor Mrs. Mackerel, notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it, had         evidently received some cruel and stunning communication from her husband         on the night of my summons; her agitated circulation during the fortnight         of my attendance showed to my conviction some persistent and secret cause         for her nervousness.
""One evening she assured me that she felt she should now rapidly recover,         as Mr. Mackerel had concluded to take her to Saratoga. I, of course,         acquiesced in the decision, though my previous opinion had not been asked.         I took a final leave of the lovely woman, and the poor child soon departed         for Saratoga.
""The ensuing week there was a sheriff's sale at Mackerel's residence. The         day following the Mackerels' departure, Mr. Tiptape did me the honor to         inquire after the health of my family; and a week later, Master Tiptape         having fallen and bumped his dear nose on the floor, I had the felicity of         soothing the anguish of his mamma in her magnificent _boudoir_, and         holding to her lovely nose the smelling salts, and offering such         consolation as her trying position required!""
Thus was commenced the practice of one of the first physicians of New         York. The facts are avouched for. The names, of course, are manufactured,         to cover the occupation of the parties.

Led by limnologist Bill Foster and a host of other environmentally-conscious Ithacans, the Floating Classroom’s Eco-Cruises focus on the lake ecosystem and how it interacts with the greater Cayuga watershed (and beyond!).
We gave a presentation on one of these “eco-cruises”, introducing our project and synthetic biosensing as platforms for preserving the lake’s water quality. By presenting our project in the context of how it could benefit the local environment, we hoped to connect with the local community and get a sense of the potential impacts of a project such as our own. In the process, we met an incredibly active advocate against hydrofracking in New York; this is discussed more in the Human Practices section.
Sciencenter
The Ithaca Sciencenter cultivates a culture of learning and discovery by providing opportunities for children, students, and adults to explore the vast domain of scientific inquiry. They also incorporate presentations about various scientific endeavors in Ithaca by allowing guest presenters to come in each weekend to foster hands-on learning activities.
We arranged a series of three presentations with the Sciencenter, which has progressed from an introduction to genetics to an introduction to synthetic biology, and will culminate in mid-October with a look into the applications of synthetic biology. The Sciencenter has allowed us to rouse enthusiasm for science among our younger audiences, and simultaneously spark discourse about synthetic biology among adults.
Video Collaboration
This year, Cornell iGEM led a collaboration project with AlumniGEM and the iGEM teams from SDU, UNAM Genomics Mexico, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, Northwestern University, and others. We sought to bring to light some of the ethical, social, and environmental implications of large-scale genetic engineering projects in modern society by creating a series of videos accessible to the general public. This video series is not a solely educational enterprise, nor are we trying to persuade our viewers to hold a particular view of genetic engineering. Our hope is to start a conversation between students, teachers, parents, other members of the public with valid concerns about genetic modification, and ourselves, young scientists trying to make a difference using scientific tools.
We aim to continue the dialogue about new technologies and advancements in the field of synthetic biology by expanding collaboration efforts such as our own, to reach broader audiences and further the spirit of transparent discussion of human practices issues. Our videos can be found on our Youtube channel , and please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns.

We had a great time and there were some really interesting and insightful debates and comments - thanks especially to iGEM Cambridge for their passion on this topic!
Another team member stated, 'I don't think our team had really put much thought into the IP ownership of our project - it's definitely something we should consider though, as we would want to be able to stop anyone using our project for potentially harmful research'. 'I always thought IP was kind of a binary question - you either patent something, or you give it away. But there are so many options in between. It's a very nuanced area of law, I think that's the main thing I hadn't really appreciated, there are lots of different ways you can share or protect your ideas'.
View the Oxford iGEM powerpoint presentation used as the basis for our workshop below!
Special thanks for the success of this event are owed to:
Bethan  Wolfenden and Philipp Boeing for organising and iGEM UCL for hosting the YSB event
Andrew Russell, Glen Gowers, and Philipp Lorenz
Dundee, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and all the other teams which attended and had such enthusiasm for the debate!
iGEM policy
Given its ever increasing prominence in the field of synthetic biology and its unavoidable influence on the future of the field, iGEM must cannot remain neutral on the matter of intellectual property. In the words of iGEM start-up Morph Bioinformatics,
“iGEM must position itself and not only define its role in the world of biotech - but also how it sees the role of synbio”.
iGEM’s approach to intellectual property will be intrinsically related to its overall position and self-definition in this exciting emerging field.
“It is time now to rationalize this 'big picture' and find a business model by treating the public, academia, biotech, pharma etc. as different units to optimize and synergize their outputs. And as with all business and communities the major factor of success is to follow one ultimate vision - and that should remain increasing the quality of life”.
iGEM’s approach to intellectual property being critical for the future of the competition, its teams, and even the future of synthetic biology, our report analyses three alternative approaches to iGEM in dealing with this legal issue.
The benefits and disadvantages of each are summarised in the tables below.: maintaining the status quo; complete openness; confidentiality clauses; reach through licence agreements.

Ideally, for each set repressor level, the output will have a non-zero rate of production at different levels of arabinose input. The most useful plot here is rate of output against input concentration, with different set repressor levels as different lines on the same graph. This is equivalent to the competitive inhibtion of enzyme action, a sample plot of such a case is given below (figure 3).
figure 3
The feasibility of such a system investigated, the question is how to implement such a system?
To continue the modelling work; models need to be refined according to data that begins to come from the plate reader. A return to looking at the latch in terms of rates of output production will possibly be useful, although no such clean switching level is expected to be possible. Also, the preliminary plate reader data shows a decrease in rate of GFP production having reached a peak value. A possible explanation is the large requirements the high rates place on transcription and translational machinery of the cell. The overall effect could be considered to be one of negative autoregulation with potential for oscillations about a steady level, damping as the system progresses through time.  Finally, this week we also aim to look at stochastic simulation possibilities using StochSim.

Blog #16 - iGEM team at RWTH Open House
By NBailly 15:22, June 29 2014 (CDT)
Yesterday, RWTH organized an open house for students from ages 14 to 16. Different departments, institutes and student councils presented exhibits, latest research projects, and the many programs they offer. Students could actively try out science and research in prepared experiments at each stand. Various groups of student representatives also offered first hand advice to students with respect to what to study and when and where to collect information. In presentations about the different fields of studies, students gained first insights into the world of academic professions and other career perspectives.
Nina and Florian showed students how they can get involved in research outside of the programs.
Our iGEM team, too, supported the bioscience department with our own stand. We presented a prototype of our measurement device Cellock Holmes that students could use to measure the fluorescence of different riboflavin solutions. Apart from giving general advice as university students to high school students, Nina and Florian explained students how they can get involved in research outside of a specific university program.

We have interviewed*** her and expanded our knowledge about refinement and disinfection of contaminants from wastewater, the problem of antibiotics and superbug formation. After that, we have contacted with ASKİ (Ankara water and sewerage administration)**** to also explain our project to them and ask for permission to officially use their campaigns and surveys in order to support our project. They have also provided us with their refinement facilities in case we need to take samples to test our system. Another interview we had was with İbrahim Gülen who is a veterinarian. Talking to him was really interesting since he is not from synthetic biology, genetics or engineering fields but is constantly working with antibiotics due to his job. He explained his thoughts about antibiotic use for animals, how animals are affected by antibiotic resistance and what can be done as a further research regarding the purification of harmful chemicals from wastewater. Learning his opinions was a great experience for us since it also gave us an enlightment.

iGEM Presentation at VIII.Horizons in Molecular Biology and Genetics: “Horizons in Molecular Biology and Genetics” is a seminar organised by the students members of Bilkent Genetics Society. It takes on task which is being a platform for researchers to update people about what they are working on and how their researches are going. It also aims to build a bridge between audience and researchers directly by giving a opportunity of creating a direct contact. Main purpose of this seminar series is the spreading science and enlarging the science for people. Our team has presented the project at VIII. Horizons in order to both introduce the concept of iGEM and create an awareness about the antibiotics usage and resistance and the consequences of being unaware usage of antibiotics. We have also showed our plan and the resolution which we have considered to be useful to prevent the generation of antibiotic resistances from the contamination of antibiotics in the waste water. We are so dedicated to create an awareness on this topic!

The Tygon tubing was then attached to the Nanoports and two Syringes filled with the fluids; one with the droplet phase and another with the continuous phase. In early testing, these fluids were water and mineral oil. The syringes are then set up onto a syringe pump (Harvard apparatus pump 33). The outlet tubing was connected as well, and drained out into an arbitrary collecting chamber for observation.

Figure 9. DFM connected to syringe pumps for testing
Figure 10. Close up image of DFM channels and reservoir
As of now, we have been able to pump fluid into and out of the DFM at rates up to 1mL/min without observing any leakage. Moving forward we will perform a more rigorous stress test, to observe what pressure can be achieved before fluid leaks out of the reservoirs. After this point, we will characterize what flow ratios between the continuous and droplet phases are needed to create monodisperse droplets.
Droplet Electroporation Module
Bulk electroporation methodology has often been shown to result in poor cell viability. Transgene silencing is also often reported after transfection. Microfluidic electroporation has previously been shown to increase transfection efficiency by multiple orders of magnitude. The advantages of physically scaling down an electroporator stems from the exceptional heat diffusivity of microchannels, and in this case, microdroplets. In bulk systems, internal heating (referenced as Joule heating) is a factor. Scaling down the size also allows the applied electric field to be much smaller, yielding low electrical potentials and better cell viability (Headen, 2018).
We chose to begin the design process on a Droplet Electroporation Module (DEM) due to its’ applicability in regular lab protocols, and the importance of efficient transfection methods in end-to-end production. We had designed a DEM that has 9 electrode pairs for transfection.

We were also interested in determining a simpler way to manufacture electrodes into glass microfluidic devices.

However after consulting with him we had learned that engraving holes through glass would be a very difficult challenge. Assuming that the holes could be made, we"

We then used the online tools of Feng Zhang's Lab at MIT to find our desired gRNA composition. We also did some calculation based on phenomenological energy calculation to estimate the stability and effectiveness of our gRNA sequences (Hsu et al., 2013). The tool shows that almost no off-target binding will occur. BLAST was used to further confirm the results. We also analyzed the structure of the resulted gRNA, which shows an approximate free energy of -1.4kJ (Zuker, 2003). For detailed information, see our gRNA design page.
See how we design our gRNA.
Modeling
Our project is intended to treat retrovirus diseases.So we want to know how effective the CRISPR/Cas9 system is. In our model, we discuss about dynamic changes of different cells in a person’s body using Matlab and we take HIV for exmple. After theoretical analysis, symbol description, formula derivation and Matlab analysis, we can see how the system works and the influence the CRISPR/Cas system produces by the change of virus and cells in this model. It will help us to forecast the future applications of our project.If the environment doesn't change, we can stimulate the situation in Matlab for a short time. The result is that the CRISPR/Cas9 system will take effect.

See how we do the modeling.
Safety
Our system has several built-in design to reduce the potential safety risks of the system utilization.
See how we concerned about the Safety.
Future Perspectives
In vivo establishment and validation of the system
Currently all our experiment design is based on in vitro conditions. However, our ultimate goal is to fight against HIV in vivo. A recent published paper in PNAS, sharing the similar design with our project, presented strong evidence for the effect of this system in other cell lines (Hu et al., 2014). So one of our important further works is to establish an in vivo system to test and improve our design. We plan to transplant the engineered Hela cell to immune deficient mice such as Nude or NOD/SCID mice. We will then optimize the dynamics of inducing of Cas9 of the transplanted cell by feeding the mice with Dox.  The effect can be monitored in live mice in real time is we conjugate a luciferase gene to Cas9 gene and imaging its activate in the live mice. We will then optimize the delivery method and dosage"

French Meet-up 2015
This year, Bordeaux team hosted the French Meet-up with the help of Cap Sciences (Scientific Museum in Bordeaux specialized in scientific popularization) during the last weekend of August (29-30th). We invited all French and francophone teams. Aix-Marseille University iGEM team, Paris_Saclay iGEM team, Pasteur_Paris iGEM team and Toulouse iGEM team came from France, KU_Leuven iGEM team came from Belgium and EPF_Lausanne iGEM team came from Switzerland and all enjoyed the weekend with us.
On Saturday morning, iGEM Bordeaux organized a small orienteering race in the city. The objective was to answer enigmas about synthetic biology and other iGEM projects to find clues for the next location they needed to go to. Divided into three teams, we were able to visit the beautiful city of Bordeaux which ended in a picnic at the Cap Science Museum.
There, teams presented their projects in front of other teams and general public at Cap Sciences and we talked with the audience about the inconvenient and advantages of each project. Each team had to make their presentation understandable for everyone. We also were lucky to have a theatre expert who gave us constructive feedback on the best way to present our projects at Boston and to a non-scientific public.
When every team finished their French presentation, each team made a very quick presentation of their project in English without a PowerPoint, and then again, the public gave some advice for each team.
Look at our first presentation in French with English subtitles down below!
Look at our second presentation in English down below!
After a long day of walk and talk, we went out for dinner in a restaurant and came back to home to have a well-deserved rest to be ready for the Sunday activities.
On Sunday, we all met at the Jardin Public (Bordeaux Park) to do some activities proposed by iGEM Paris_Saclay and iGEM Pasteur_Paris teams. The first one organized a debate about biosafety, and filmed a short video of iGEM team presentation on biosafety for each project. This encouraged all teams to think"
BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," together, suggesting that movement was not due to currents in the medium. We saw no distance covered in almost all the control beads, a few moved small distances, so some currents are present. Bacteria and beads were left together for ~30mins to allow time for adhesion. No movement has yet been seen when the bacteria and beads are not left to adhere. We will look again at this, as we may have not previously looked closely enough (photographing over a time course of a few minutes).
0 mins
1 min
2 mins
Circles represent position at 0 mins, one colour for each bead. For example, the bead that starts in red circle    moves down and right, while that in the yellow circle moves left.
Chemotaxis assay (Yu, H.S. et al. (1997) FEMS Microbiology Letters, 156, 265-269.) has not worked so far. Currents can be seen flowing from the aspartate plug, pushing bacteria away. The focus of this week will be on getting this fixed, with a view to combining chemotaxis and the ability to move beads, allowing us to move beads in a particular direction.
The GRN for switching on the chemotactic response by binding to a bead, and signaling to nearby bacteria that a particle is in the vicinity, is almost finalised.
7th August - 13th August
BioBrick Transformation
The self-made electro competent E. coli DH5α cells were tested twice. The transformation efficiency with pUC19 was 4.45 x 108 cfu/µg and 5.67 x 108 cfu/µg. The first attempt with BioBrick DNA failed, but this might be due to a too low cell amount compared to all the other decanted tubes. In the following transformations, the incubation of the punched paper disc with the DNA was varied in time (3 h and 5.5 h). It seems that a longer incubation increases the transformation efficiency. This has to be confirmed, since the transformations were conducted by different persons. Thereby, next to the yeast ADH1 promoter another BioBrick ( enhanced version of EYFP, yeast-optimized YFP ) was tested because the VF2-VR value of yeast ADH1 promoter we got didn't coincide with the value given on the iGEM page.
Agar Plug Assay
Evaporation and currents that were occurring in previous attempts at the agarose-in-plug assay were eliminated by ensuring water potentials of plug and chemotaxis buffer were as similar as possible"
HSiTAIWAN,2016,Team:HSiTAIWAN#HumanPractice#SocialStudy_-_-_TEXT.html," for the Taiwanese to report visit Chinese medicine outpatient care in the last month in 2009(OR=1.11) and 2013(OR=1.20).  Male and the elderly were less likely to use Chinese medicine than the reference groups.  The likelihood of using Chinese medicine significantly increases with the educational level.  Taiwanese people with education degree of senior high school are more like to buy Chinese medicine without physician’s prescriptions (OR=2.49).
The results of logistic regression on knowledge are shown in Table 4 .   Knowledge regarding GMP on Chinese medicine is significantly associated with higher educational level.  Similarly, knowing the requirement of doctor’s prescription for Chinese medicine purchase is significantly associated with higher education level.
6.Conclusion:
Taiwanese used Chinese medicine as one of medical measures to cope with illness.  Most of them did not know regulation and policies related to Chinese medicine, particularly less-educated group.  Due to inadequate knowledge , they were under potential health risk of misusing Chinese medicine.
Media Analysis of Gene Technology/Synthetic Biology
(This media analysis was done in collaboration with NYUM-Taipei, so all information are shared by both teams.)
1.Motivation
Learning from the article “The role of social scientists in synthetic biology”  written by Jane Calvert and Paul Martin, we understood that although there is no consensus on the definition of synthetic biology, there is a widespread conviction that it has important ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI), and that these should be explicitly addressed.
Whether gene technology/synthetic biology can be accepted and become prevalent and profound in a society depends on education.  We believe the impact of education can’t be significant through sporadical, independent efforts by individuals.  We know that media plays the most important role in influencing the knowledge, attitude and behavior of the people.  Thus, we believe only through right and efficient media can GTSB be taken into consideration and become helpful technology adapted widely.
iGEM has been the most influential worldwide contest on synthetic biology.  In the competition, students from every countries learn the greatest science part of this  discipline.  Furthermore, they learn more than gene engineering because they were exposed to different issues and problems in our society.  We believe the fruitful iGEM wiki could be influential not only to the participants but also for the rest of world.
We were wondering what context of GTSB in media Taiwan people are exposed to.   How well they can apprehend the content? What content is covered in the front wiki page of each iGEM team? Whether the content can be apprehended"

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html,"37°C and 220 rpm.
Preparation of the microscope sample [ 1 ]
Clean two microscope glass slides with 70 % ethanol and water.
Take a gene frame and carefully remove one of the plastic foils from the gene frame without causing disassembly of the plastic cover on the other side of the gene frame.
Attach the gene frame in the middle of one of the glass slides by first facilitating contact on just one side, followed by guided attachment of the remaining gene frame with a fingernail. Prevent air bubbles while attaching the gene frame to the glass slide.
Transfer 500 μl of the warm agarose-LB or agarose-TBE in the middle of the gene frame. Make sure the whole area including (the borders) is fully covered.
The following steps have to be carried out quickly to prevent excessive drying of the agarose-LB or agarose-TBE.
Place the second glass slide on the agarose-LB or agarose-TBE filled gene frame. Try to avoid air bubbles. Place the sandwiched slides in a horizontal position for 45 min at 4°C in the refrigerator to allow the agarose-LB or agarose-TBE to solidify sufficiently.
Carefully slide off the upper glass slide. Use a razor blade to cut out agar strips of ~5 mm width within the gene frame, on which the cells will be grown.
Carefully remove the second and final plastic cover from the gene frame to expose the sticky side of the gene frame.
Load single cells on the solid medium without touching it with the pipet tip. Use 2.5 μl for a whole strip, or 1 μl for a small square. Always start on top of the agarose pad and allow the liquid to disperse equally on its assigned growth area by turning the slide up and down. The slide is ready, as soon as the edges of the liquid become corrugated and movement of the liquid is no longer visible when turning the slide.
Place a clean microscope slide cover slip on the gene frame from one side to the other (avoid air bubbles). Assure complete attachment by applying pressure on the cover slip along the gene frame with your fingernail. If the cover slip is placed on the cells without allowing them to dry long enough, cells tend to grow on top of each other during the experiment. Also be careful not to wait too long before applying the cover slip, since the agarose will then be too dry.

ITCCC
In July 13th, we got an invitation to introduce iGEM to preparatory members of high                                 school team                                 in ITCCC (INTERNATIONAL TEENAGER COMPETITION AND COMMUNICATION CENTER). Our team leader gave a                                 speech about iGEM and some of team members answered the questions. After the speech, the high                                 school students had a further understanding and got more interests about iGEM. In which, we                                 brought our years of experiences on iGEM to them.
BCU
Between July 17th and 21st, our team and team BCU conducted an                                 communication of iGEM, mainly                                 about the InterLab experiments. BCU is a young iGEM team. So, as an experienced team, we                                 BIT-China helped them. We provided them with some conveniences on instruments and reagents. In                                 five days, we completed the InterLab experiments, analyzing and discussing them based on the                                 experimental data obtained. This exchange established the foundation for the communication of                                 the two teams in future projects, and we all benefited from this exchange.
Education to younger generation
Back in high school, if someone would show us the beauty of biology, we think there would be                                 more students choose to study biology in college. Therefore, to expand the influence of                                 synthetic biology, we delivered a lecture to high school students of Capital Normal University                                 High School in Beijing, during which we introduced iGEM giant jamboree and our project, WHO CAN                                 GET AN A to them. Through the lecture, not only did high school students gained a better                                 insight into such a meaningful competition, but also we knew more about our own project and                                 started to think a new way to let public understand our project.

Collaborations
Collaborations play a very important role in terms of project development. Collaborations with other teams help us to learn about better ways to handle a problem, to learn new ways of working, to perceive different ideologies and to develop the project in general. It provides us a better chance to get to know other teams and to learn to cooperate. In scientific fields, cooperation and collaborations play a major role for growth and discovery. We are highly encouraged to work with other teams since it increases our horizon of knowledge and we are happy that iGEM promotes the idea of sharing knowledge and scientific materials. The following are the teams whom we can proudly call our collaborators this year.
iGEM TU Delft
Their iGEM project is called CASE13A. Both our projects are similar in terms of the use of Cas13a and paper microfluidics. Our collaboration started with our meeting in Delft. We were excited to see that TU Delft were also working with Cas13a as their major protein. We both are trying to work on different ways of tackling the problem of the antibiotic resistance using Cas13a. Therefore we decided to collaborate since it gave us the opportunity to discuss the challenges and also to try out different approaches together. We started a collaboration for our software since we both were working on optimizing the crRNA for our targets. In our team, we designed a software that could give us the best design and structure of the crRNA for different targets. For this reason, we created a database of different possible sequences using NUPACK and other platforms. Team TU Delft has a similar project where they predict the part of the target that can best serve as a crRNA. We provided them with a list of possible targets and best crRNAs structures for their software.

Moreover, team TU Delft sent us the Tardigrade intrinsically Disordered Proteins(TDPs) to test them with our purified Cas13a, to check its activity and stability when used together with"
Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#how much can we degrade_-_-_TEXT.html,"ompertz Functions
We used a variation of a sigmoid function called a Gompertz function to model the theoretical growth of our bead-encapsulated bacteria. These functions are well-established[1] as a method of predicting population growth in a confined space, which will be the case if we encapsulate them in agarose beads. Growth rates follow a sigmoidal curve, where they first increase and then slow because of limited resources and population density. We assumed that the population of bacteria over time will follow one of these functions (when scaled correctly).
Gompertz functions are of the form:
y(t)  = population size as a function of time
A = maximum sustainable population
B = shift on time axis
C = growth rate
Using this theoretical form, we could then calibrate the values of our variables through comparison with actual growth curve data from wet lab experiments. This was an important step because it then allowed us to calculate the total theoretical degradation rate of DCM that our kit can support.
Varying each of the three constants allows us to fit our Gompertz function to the actual growth data. The effect of varying each constant is shown below:
Reference:
Zwietering, M. H.; Jongenburger, I.; Rombout, F. M.; van 't Riet, K. (1990), ""Modeling of the Bacterial Growth Curve"", Applied and Environmental Microbiology 56 (6): 1875–1881
How can we reduce the drop in pH?
How can we reduce the drop in pH?
Using buffers to reduce the pH change of our system
We have investigated the effect of using buffers in the aqueous part of our system.
As a first approximation, we model our system of bacteria turning over DCM, producing HCl, as a chemical system in which HCl immediately enters the 'bulk' (extracellular) solution; in this system we have a single buffer (HEPES) to reduce the drop in pH, maximising the amount of DCM the entire system can degrade before the pH drops below a toxic level.
Derivation of the Van Slyke equation:
To simplify calculations, assumptions that HCl completely dissociates, and that the system volume = 1L (allowing concentration and number of moles to be treated interchangeably) are made.

A total of 8 petri dishes (labeled 1 to 8) each containing 4 pieces of copper and 1 petri dish (labeled 9) containing 3 scratched copper were utilized. Calculations were done to see how to dilute OD 31 bacteria to OD 1. After calculations, 100 uL of OD 1 bacteria were placed into four petri dishes and spread around using beads. 20 uL of OD 1 bacteria were placed onto each scratched copper in petri dish 9. Dishes 2,5,7, and 8 have bacteria added. Whereas dishes 1,3,4, and 6 do not have bacteria. All the petri dishes were placed in an incubator at 29 degrees C and a beaker of water is in there to make sure they don’t dry out. On the first day, all the flasks and the petri dishes contained clear media with copper samples in them.
July 7
After removing the flasks containing AFM from the shaker, we noticed a rather obvious layer of whitish-yellow precipitate sitting at the bottom of the flasks. The flasks without AFM—the controls with the distilled water and sulfuric acid—did not contain this white precipitate. The source of the precipitation is unknown.
Measuring the Masses of the Samples in Liquid Media:
The copper pieces were fished out of the solutions with tongs sterilized by heat. They were then rinsed off with water first then 70% ethanol solution. After drying the pieces with a kimwipe, we tried to smooth out the corners and flatten the piece out in order for its dimensions to be measured accurately. The copper pieces were then massed, and the results recorded. Once we found the masses, the copper pieces were placed back into their respective flasks.
Taking Optical Density:
1 mL of basal AFM low pH solution was pipetted into a cuvette to serve as a blank. The cuvette was then placed in the spectrophotometer, which recorded the OD. The blank was used as a reference. 1 mL of the solution in the flask containing only AFM and copper was pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then capped and placed into a centrifuge for 2 minutes at 12,000g. The supernatant solution was pipetted out of the tube and disposed, leaving behind a white pellet of cells.

Human Practice
Synthetic biology is a controversial topic especially in Germany. Therefore, public outreach efforts are necessary to enhance the general understanding of synthetic biology and to facilitate acceptance. In return, the scientific community can profit from the bidirectional dialogue. During the summer we had several opportunities to engage in such dialogues.
To raise awareness of the benefits of such exchange for scientists one of our team members gave a lecture to students of biology. It covered ethics in the context of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Lecture about iGEM and Ethics in Synthetic Biology
Lecture about iGEM and ethics in Synthetic Biology in the course 'theory of science and ethics'.
The lecture was held for undergrad students of biology in the course 'theory of science and ethics'.
First, projects of successful iGEM teams were presented to give an overview about the importance and variety of synthetic biology. In this context ethical implications of genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas9 were discussed. This raised essential questions of principles like 'What is life?' and their ontological circumlocution as well as the ethical justification for the actions of a bioengineer.
The discourse evaluated common philosophical positions and compared their arguments. For example conservative and liberal anthropocentrism, as well as teleological and deontological approaches to justification of synthetic biology. Additionally, the possible interpretations of synthetic biology from the perspective of monotheistic religions were  discussed.
In order to engage with the local community we participated in the science fair Freiburg. Local institutes and companies presented their research to an interested audience from young to old and offered the chance to do easy experiments especially for children. Our project received a lot of interest and people recognized the importance and potential of synthetic biology in health care. However, they expressed many concerns regarding genetic modification as well as immunobiology and specifically vaccination.

Flow cytometry is a method of measuring the size, density, fluorescence type, and fluorescence intensity of a event (single bacteria). We performed the same flow cytometry experiments on the same samples as Figure.5. The results are demonstrated below (Fig. 6, 7).
We observed a very interesting phenomenon from the data of the flow cytometry: Comparing to Fig. 6, it can be seen that the expression of GFP in the “promoter-antimicro-RBS” was consistent with that in the “normal expression” between 2 and 5 hours, and the results of the flow cytometry showed good single peak results (Fig. 7).After 6 hours, the GFP expression of the “promoter-antimicro-RBS” in the microplate reader was gradually higher than that in the “Normal expression”. At first, we think that the different growth conditions of bacteria may lead to this difference, but the data of flow cytometry bring different interpretations: First, from the comparison of the total profiles, we can see that the two devices have no significant difference in growth rate ( this can also be demonstrated by the number of particles per volume of flow cytometer, this data is not given), but for the distribution of fluorescence intensity, “promoter-antimicro-RBS” changed significantly after 7 hours. The bacterial population differentiate, and concentrate in two regions. The single peak pattern in the data gradually become double peaks (Fig. 7). We do not know why the bacterial population spontaneously generates and differentiation, and we hope that some team could give this issue a reasonable explanation in the futrue.
future design
About future:
In our exception, our device, with further development and verification, could finally achieve commercialization and become a portable, popular medical detect device. We hope that our device could become one of the standard configurations in community medical services just as same as current HBV Qualitative test paper.
Still, there are many problems need to be solved to fulfill such a goal, including problems like how to decrease the cost, how to make the system become portable and how to write appropriate instructions for common users. Among these problems, we will provide following illustration to answer one of the most important questions above all, how to remove the ‘windows period’ of our device.
Analysis and experiment demonstrated that our device has its own ""window period"" (specific time period for observing, if missed, there is no more chance for users to observe the real-positive result.). Current effort could make the outcome of RNA-interaction become visible, yet how"

Scientific Collaborations
Team Tübingen
At the European Meetup this year in Delft we met the Team from Tübingen. We talked about our projects and learned, that their project for this year’s competition involves the synthesis of a novel antibiotic to be used in humans. As we exchanged ideas we came up with a way to collaborate. Since it is interesting to examine against which bacteria a novel antibiotic has an effect, we planned to test the antibiotic, made in Tübingen, in another bacteria, in Erlangen. Thereto the Team from Tübingen sent us Clorobiocin, a molecule similar to their novel antibiotic, a protocol for an agar diffusion test as well as the needed material. As test bacteria, the corynebacteria C. glutamicum has been chosen and we finally studied the influence of Clorobiocin on the C. glutamicum strain 13032 with the PEKEX2 plasmid for selection. We performed the test with different concentrations of the antibiotic and – for control – with ampicillin, water and MeOH, resulting in the pictures presented below.
Hence, the tested antibiotic works just as well as ampicillin against C. glutamicum.    We really enjoyed this collaboration, as we think the project from Tübingen is very interesting and the work on novel antibiotics is very important – especially in the fight against bacteria that are resistant against traditional antibiotics. So, thank you very much Tübingen!

Modeling ::Dimensionless Model
preparation | parameters | results
In order to make a further analysis on stability of the system, sensitivity of parameters, feedback factors-we manipulate all the arguments and parameters to make them dimensionless. Analysis of this part is crucial since parameters in vivo experiment may be different and even at odds with modeling ones but a proper dimensionless can reveal the mathematical essence of our model.

Today Phil and I tried dynamic light scattering (DLS) with our version of Yeates' original cage and Mutant #10. Phil's older samples (purified 4 days prior and thawed twice) were very aggregated and the initial attempt to pipette a sample clogged the tip. My M10 sample (purified 1 day prior and thawed once) were somewhat aggregated, albeit not as extensively.
We pooled all three elutions of the original cage and filtered it and elution 2 of M10 with a .1 micron filter using a centrifuge. M10 elution 3 was kept unfiltered since it was the least aggregated sample.
DLS was performed with the filtered original, filtered M10, and unfiltered M10. Results below:

Munich,2017,Team:Munich#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," workshops annually. IKOM Life Sciences is one of such event organized by IKOM where other students can meet different biotechnology and other related companies. It is highly recommended for all life science students and it is visited by students from all the universities in Munich.
This year's IKOM was really interesting with a high participation from different biotechnology, pharmaceutical and consulting companies. We met many companies from different parts of Munich and we also had the chance to talk to them personally. Some of those companies were interested in our work. Also, we had the chance to see what different companies can offer which helped us later to decide which sources to use in future.
KLJB youth meetup (3rd  June 2017)
KLJB organized the 3-days camping program with different workshops, presentations and activities for young students from schools and universities around Munich. The event was organized by a local group of youths which were involved in this organization. This is also a yearly event where the students camp there and are allowed to participate in all the events whenever they want as a part of this interaction. We were happy to give them some insights into our Project and give them an idea about synthetic biology and iGEM. Many were school students and had no idea about this field.
The German Wide Meetup (30th June to 2nd July 2017)
Meetups are a big part of the iGEM journey. They offer teams the opportunity to exchange ideas, start collaborations and get inspired from people with similar interests, but first of all to have fun. This year’s German Meetup took place in Dresden , where 10 iGEM teams from Germany gathered to get to know each other, as well as each other’s projects. During this three-day event, each team presented their project along with updates on their progress and participated in two workshops: “iGEM goes green” and “Collaboration”. Also Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher and Marcel Thiel from Promega gave talks and Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun presented BIOMOD (Biomolecular Design Competition). This event would not have been complete without doing a sightseeing tour around Dresden, party and a bunch of different games to get to know each other. We left Dresden with new collaboration partners, inspiration and great memories.
European Meetup (7th to 8th July 2017)

Thankful for absolutely everything
General Support
Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski provided us with our own laboratory and the resources of his work group. Thus, he gave us the opportunity to participate in iGEM. Also he was always there to help us with questions and occurring problems. Thanks for believing in your iGEM teams year after year!
As our secondary PI Prof. Dr. Kristian M. Müller supported us with materials and equipment and participated in our weekly team meetings to give us scientific guidance.
Julian Droste, Boas Pucker: Thank you for always taking time when we needed a good advice. We hope that we were not too annoying, even if our questions were usually simple. Without you we would still searching for our laboratory stuff.
Nils-Christian Lübke, Manuel Wittchen, Timo Wolf, Matthias Ruwe, Uyen Linh Ho and Janina Lüders helped us with their knowledge about iGEM. As former iGEM members they gladly supported us. Thank you guys!
Modeling Support

Expression of the microcompartment in E.coli
Out of the seven subunits, 4 of them (B, U, N and K) are his-tagged, which allowed us to detect expression of these subunits, as shown in the western blot image below:
The Western Blot clearly demonstrates successful expression of subunits B, U, N and K in E.coli, but not in Pseudomonas putida. The negative control was a Pseudomonas putida cell lysate without previous transformation. We used the standard western blot protocol described in the downloadable pdf-document at the top of this page.

Demonstration
      During the communication                                 with team “Purdue”, we knew that they prepare to do an in vitro colonization assay to                                 see if their genetically modified E. coli could survive in the target place. Inspired by                                 their thought, we also designed a series of in vitro experiments in order to investigate                                 if our constructed bacteria could survive in gastrointestinal tract.
01  Materials
      Two parts of experiments were                                 designed. One of them is to                                 investigate if our genetically modified E. coli could adapt the physical environment of                                 gastrointestinal tract. We cultured the bacteria in artificial gastral juice and                                 intestinal juice, plotted the growth curve and compared with strains cultured in LB.                                 Another part is to test if our bacteria had the ability to compete with the native                                 microbiota in gastrointestinal tract. Based on such an idea, we obtain the feces of mice                                 from College of Pharmacy in our university and coculture them under different                                 conditions. Competent cells of MC4100 were made based on TSS method and transformed by                                 KCM transformation method (see notebook in detail).
      Main materials used in these experiments are shown                                 in Table 1. Related equipment is                                 similar to InterLab study and is not shown here, with acidimeter (LEICI PHSJ-3F) and                                 balance being the additional ones.

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," level by the Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs. In New Zealand the Animal Health Board (the body responsible for the mass progress in bTB eradication) had a heavy farming representation and testing was not carried out by vets. Farmers have a clear motive to be bTB free. Giving them the tools to manage the disease on their farm is one of Michael's primary aims, and our Ribonostics test could have an application for this.
Social Justice
Bovine TB is the UK's largest animal health problem and a truly challenging disease to try and combat. However the UK also manages the situation of Bovine TB in a way that is currently not working. When looked at simply, the main strategy the UK has to deal with Bovine TB is the use of the Tuberculin Skin Test to identify and immediately remove TB infected cattle. This test has an estimated sensitivity of around 80%. This means out of 10 infected animals 2 will not be detected and will therefore remain within the population, able to spread the disease. Dick made it clear that his practice has larger herds in high risk areas that are chronically infected with bTB because the current test is simply not sensitive enough to identify infected but not yet infectious animals. As vaccinating cattle with the BCG vaccine is banned under EU law, dealing with the disease in cattle is highly difficult. Identifying and removing infected animals is a strategy that deals with the symptoms of the disease as opposed to the root cause. This is where Michael Ross and his company Saved & Safe aim to make a change to the UK strategy to deal with bTB. Michael made it clear how our test could fit into his company's current strategy and helps allow development of a strategy that begins to deal with the infection (the root cause).
The Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has the development of a DIVA (Differentiation of Infected and Vaccinated Animals) test as a main priority for the strategy to eradicate bTB by 2038. A successful DIVA test would allow the use of the BCG vaccine and take steps forward towards establishing a bTB free UK. Our meeting with George Eustice helped us to understand how our RNA based diagnostic tool meets the criterion for a DEFRA DIVA test. DEFRA is responsible for all bTB testing across the UK meaning they are able to assess and implement the approach they see best. Developing a test that offers a new and unique approach to bTB testing was important for us but it was also important that our test could fit into the Strategy for Bovine TB Eradication"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," displays the predicted amount of doping DNA fragments in the blood over time as a result of intramuscular (IM) injection every 20 days. Based on this model , we predicted that there will be 40,000 to 50,000 fragments of DNA per mL blood. We based the sensitivity requirement of DNA extraction on this value.
Figure 2. Concentration of EPO gene doping DNA in the blood during intramuscular microdosing with an initial dose of 96 billion vectors followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days.
1.2 cfDNA Extraction
Design: We extracted cfDNA from bovine serum and confirmed successful extraction with Qubit dsDNA HS assay and nested PCR.
Results and interpretation: We performed cfDNA isolation from the serum using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. To verify extraction, we quantified cfDNA on the serum using Qubit. We obtained 0.394+/- 0.0149 ng/uL of cfDNA after extraction. To verify the extraction further, we performed nested PCR on albumin gene. Albumin gene is often used for verification of the presence of genomic mammalian DNA and was recommended by Sanquin. The nested albumin PCR consists of a first round of PCR using primers 091 and 092 , amplifying an internal fragment of the bovine albumin gene of 229 bp. We deliberately chose to amplify a short fragment since cfDNA in blood is fragmented. The product of the first round of PCR was used as the template for the second round. We used internal primers 066 and 067 to amplify a 150 bp internal fragment of the first PCR product.The product of the first and second round of PCR are shown on figure 3. The bands on figure 3 lane 2-7 confirmed the success of the extraction.

BioMech - Download
In an effort to make BioMech accessible to everyone, we have allowed the game to be open source and therefore it can be downloaded for free. Below you will find instructions    that will aid you in downloading and constructing your own version of the game. The materials required are as follows:
A4 Printer and paper (A3 recommended)
Guillotine or scissors
Glue such as pritt stick
Tape
A die
Pen and paper for score keeping
Software that allows printing (We will use Google Chrome)
Game Board
BioMech has its own game board allowing players to place their BioBricks    in to a plasmid.
Open the board game PDF files. If you have access to an A3 printer      click here , otherwise       for an A4 printers click here .      Both links open in a new tab.
If printing an A4 version of the game it is reccommended that you tape the two sheets      together. For a better experience the board can then be attatched to a cardboard box      to maintain its shape.
BioBrick Cards
In a complete deck there are 100 double sided BioBrick cards,    split in to four groups: Promoters, Ribosome binding sites,    Protein coding regions, and Terminators. The cards can be printed back to back,    on single sheets and stuck together, or single sided in order to save ink. It should    be noted that despite our best efforts the double sided printing option    may not always be correctly aligned.
Open the correct BioBrick PDF file. If you have access to a double sided printer      click here , and       for single sided printers click here .      Both links open in a new tab.
Press ""print"" and locate the printing properties for your browser and ensure      portrait printing is selected. For single sided      prints, do not change any options. For double sided prints select ""flip on short side"".      If you wish to save paper and ink here by printing only the fonts of the cards      only print odd pages (1,3,5...19), this is only recommended for single side printing.
If printing double sided use scissors or a guillotine to separate the cards.      If printing printing single sided stick pairs of pages back to"

AGENDA FOR JESSIKA:
1. Finish yesterday's purification and save the fractions in 4 degrees.  If possible, repeat the purification using another sample of raw cell ly sate.  Don't forget to use the elution in column steps, and recharge and re-equilibrate the buffer before finishing!
2. Create a 1L culture of the 9-mer from one of the starter cultures.  MAke sure you OD the starter culture and record the OD in a notebook! You can prepare the LB in a 2L flask from the side of the sink and autoclave it in the same flask.  Once cool, add the chloramphenical (1mL) and then one of the starter cultures..  Make you add the IPTG after 3-4 of inoculation (check the OD for 0.6-0.6, and let it run over night).
3.  On saturday, spin down the cell pellets from the overnighted culture.
OD Checks
After 17 hour start-up culture inoculation: 0.376
4 hr incubation, before IPTG added: 0.055
NOTE: Only around 4.2mL of IPTG stock solution left, so added 0.8mL less than originally planned.
1st hour after IPTG addition: 0.065
2nd hour after IPTG addition: 0.082
3rd hour after IPTG addition: 0.110
4th hour after IPTG addition: 0.360
5th hour after IPTG addition: 0.650
Weight of bacterial cell pellet after 12 hours of post-IPTG inoculation - 7 grams of cell pellet."

IIT_Madras,2013,Team:IIT Madras#old_-_-_TEXT.html," potent biofilm inhibitor. We plan to express the compound by engineering the I3A-producing genes into our host system (E.coli).  For the second part, we have identified a nine amino-acid peptide (Gb3 mimic) which has anti-Shiga toxin activity. To ensure the effective translocation of the peptide outside the cell, we plan to clone the Gb3 mimic downstream of an outer membrane signal peptide (ompF). The production of the Gb3 mimic will be confirmed by gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry or reverse HPLC.

4 Background
Motivation
The rational, forward engineering of genetically-encoded biological systems relies partly on 1) the generation of a multitude of genetic parts and 2) the sufficient characterization of these parts.  This project aims to contribute to the advancement of synthetic biology by 1) generating and sharing a library of transcriptional enhancers called UP-elements (a new class of BioBrick parts), 2) characterizing strength of transcription initiation by measuring both mRNA and protein levels (by RT-PCR and flow cytometry, respectively) and 3) elucidating UP-element design principles.  We propose our characterization methodology as a minimal measurement standard and hope that the results of this project will be useful to the community.
Project Overview
We designed a variety of UP-element BioBrick parts to serve as transcriptional enhancers and characterized them with our proposed minimal measurement standard .
Figure 1: UP-element in context
Figure 2: UP-element as an enhancer for transcription initiation
In addition to designing and characterizing UP elements, we were also able to further characterize existing constitutive promoters in the registry.
Safety
The nature of this project does not raise any unusual safety concerns.
The local biosafety committee is the VCU School of Engineering Safety Committee.
One of our advisors, Cindy Lovelace, serves on the committee and makes sure that our team followed all safety guidelines.
Our new BioBrick parts should not raise any unusual safety concerns.

The samples showed growth of both encapsulated and unencapsulated “E. coli” and “Pseudomonas” carrying “pBBRBB::mer” after 36 hours, and complete demethylation of the 1mg MeHg in both the encapsulated and unencapsulated samples. No cell growth was observed in strains containing the “pBBRBB::gfp”negative control, LB (abiotic) or LB (abiotic) containing 0.5g empty encapsulation beads, and methylmercury levels remained relatively unchanged. This preliminary run showed that methylmercury levels could drop to undetectable levels in the presence of our bacteria (both E.coli and Pseudomonas) but not in their absence.
Methylmercury Results (II)
2nd MeHg-  - It was expected that the rate of demethylation would increase exponentially, and thus we took samples at time points that would reflect that rate (Fig __).  Within 24 hours, methylmercury levels dropped slightly  in the abiotic LB sample, most likely only due to photolysis in the presence of light            - “E.coli” cells with the GFP control plasmid absorbed (number - abiotic)  mg into the cells before their eventual cell death.             - abiotic encapsulation beads absorbed as much methylmercury from the surroundings as the E.coli cells with the GFP control plasmid.             - E.coli cells with the mer operon remediated all of the methylmercury (1 mg in 1L) in the samples within approximately 5 hours.             ""Pseudomonas” could not survive or decrease methylmercury levels in the samples after 24 hours. We suspect that the “Pseudomonas” require a longer time for the construct to be activated, since they were able to grow and decrease methyl mercury to below detectable levels twithin 36 hours.   The ""E.coli"" cells containing the mer operon were tested in both 1mg/L and 4mg/L of methylmercury chloride. (48 samples)  MeHg was only demethylated by 1 mg before reaching a stationary level.

Description
Oil pollution is one of the environmental issues that attract more and more attention. It not only harms creatures immediately, but cause continuous damage to polluted area, which will cause severe harm to environment. Besides, oil polluted area is hard to recovered as well. So, solving the problem of oil pollution has been a dream of people for a long time. So, recovering areas from oil contamination has been a dream of people for a long time.
This year, we opened our mind. We didn’t limit our mind in recovery, but focused on the prevention. There is a saying goes that a small leak will sink a great ship. On analogy of this, many of oil pollutions are caused by oil spill and some little leak will cause oil spill. If these kinds of leak be found in the beginning, some accident won’t occur any more. Therefore, with using those creature degrading oil, such as bacteria, we are willing to sense oil and find a way expressing this signal to detect leak in a early time. By this way, we want to prevent oil spill and make the world better. This is our Alkane biosensor.
Background
Oil pollution is a problem ailed people for a very long time. People have tried a lot of method to deal with this problem, such as, oil boom method, mechanical method, adsorption method, chemical treatment, and biological method. However, these methods cannot meet the requirement of environment recovery. For example, oil boom can only treat a small scale of oil spill; chemical reagent used in chemical method can be more poisonous than oil; biodegradation doesn’t have ideal degradation value.
Design
We got inspiration from 2016 Sydney Australia. They used regulating circuit in ethylene degradation bacteria as sensor gene and used chromoprotein gene as reporter gene to develop an ethylene detection bacteria. They applied this to evaluating fruit ripeness. We are inspired from this method. Based on our lab′s researching, we hope we can utilize the circuit regulating alkane degradation in P.a to construct an alkane detection bacteria.
