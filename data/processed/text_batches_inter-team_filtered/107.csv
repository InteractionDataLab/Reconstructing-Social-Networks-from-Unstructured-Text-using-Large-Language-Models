UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"
Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.
Eliminate Chinese’s prejudice about biotechnology
After hearing the community's concern about biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 200 booklets to expand publicity.
Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.
Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline in a booklet and handed out the booklets to more high school students. Two students e-mailed us to express their interest in synthetic biology and consulted to us about how to be admitted by Tsinghua University.
COLLABORATION
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM.
Communication & Collabroation
With University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB)
We cooperated with the iGEM team from University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB) and we both learned a lot of thing from each other.
We often had friendly conversions through WeChat and told each other what our projects is about and how our projects is going. They told us that they had some trouble in assembling a plasmid they needed. They tried a lot of ways to assemble the plasmid but failed and they asked us for help. They sent us the photo of their unsuccessful plasmid and after some analyses we suggested them using a method called Gibson Assembly. They adopted our opinions and did some try again. Later, they told us that they had made it successfully and we were all glad to hear that.
We also invited them"
Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html,". However, when the system is exposed to green light, CcaR is phosphorylated and CcaR-P is generated, allowing the synthesis of the magenta pigment to be up regulated instead of prevented. To make an overall green colour, we only want the yellow and cyan pigments to be transcribed, so production of the magenta pigment is problematic.
To overcome this issue, we will introduce an inverter system. CcaR-P will be produced when the bacteria are exposed to green light, but instead of binding to a promoter placed before the gene coding for magenta pigment, it will bind to a cI repressor system.  The subsequent transcription of the cI repressor protein will prevent the synthesis of the magenta pigment, as it will bind to a cI promoter. Binding of cI to this promoter ceases transcription of any following genes, therefore magenta will not be produced.
Several academic papers were referred to in characterising our green light module.
Blue light pathway
The YtvA/FixL blue light sensor phosphorylates FixJ to FixJ-p in the absence of blue light. FixJ-p then binds to the promoter for the yellow pigment gene and stop codon.  In the absence of blue light the Yellow pigment is produced.
The blue light module works in much the same way as the red light module; absence of blue light allows the phosphorylation of an intermediate protein (FixJ) by the blue light sensor (YF1). FixJ can then bind to its specialised promoter which controls the transcription of the yellow pigment (amilGFP). Exposure to blue light leads to the suppression in production of the yellow pigment.
The remaining pigments, magenta and cyan, will combine to form a blue colour.
There are a variety of papers featuring the proteins in our Blue Light Module.
Our constructs
As we have the three different light modules to work with, we can experiment with different techniques and companies when it comes to our assembly techniques and synthesis.
The Red Light Module is the ""easiest"" to work with. This is because we only need to be working with the red light sensor and cyan pigment (the intermediate protein, OmpR, is already present in the genome of E. coli, so we don't need to include the genes which code for it). We will try and assemble this module ourselves in the lab, using a variety of assembly techniques. The pink arrows indicate the direction of transcription. ompC is the specific promoter which is bound by phosphorylated OmpR, the intermediate protein. The black brackets indicate the separate BioBricks (eg. BB"

Strong (similar to PAOX1)
The three best choices (see table above) were PAOX1, PFLD1 and PDAS. Since we did not find much information on PDAS, while PAOX1 and PFLD1 are well characterized, both of them having commercial plasmids for genomic integration [13][14], we chose the latter two as our molecular detectors. That, in a simple genetic construction, could work as a proof of concept. A priori, our output system would be the monomeric RFP (Red florescent protein) ( BBa_E1010 ). The RFP will be use for fluorescence tests and for efficiently characterizing the relative promoter strength. We also expect to be able to see the production of RFP with the naked eye, once in E.coli it is shown to be possible.

Our team chose to focus on the detection system via methanol-responsive promoters, and to characterize them well as BioBricks.
PAOX1
PAOX1 is a strong promoter which can be controlled by simple changes in its carbon source [16], and it is the most common choice for expression of heterologous proteins in P. pastoris, having a naturally elevated expression rate, of around 5% of the RNA and 30% of total protein production [12] [15].
The challenge in using PAOX1 is its regulation. This promoter is prone to a strong catabolic repression by hexoses and ethanol [17] — the main component of alcoholic beverages. Fortunately, ethanol is also involved in the degradation of peroxisomes, cellular compartments where P. pastoris realizes the metabolism of methanol; this aspect is  interesting for our application, since it means methanol will not be degraded as fast as it would in the absence of ethanol. Therefore, the degradation of peroxisomes would enhance the activation of PAOX1, by allowing methanol to stay for longer in the cell.
In order to develop this biosensor, it is necessary to evaluate the rates at which the promoter PAOX1 is activated via methanol or inhibited via ethanol. In addition, we decided to study a modification on Pichia pastoris Mxr1 transcription factor [18] that should alter its"

After the hard part our advisor had planned some games for us with the main focus on communication. The first was called “Gordian Knot” where we all stood in a circle and had to grab two random hands. The challenge was to unknot everyone without letting go of the hands in order to return to the circle.
After somehow managing to master this nearly impossible task, the next game was even more challenging. We were divided into four groups and decided on a leader in each group. Each member of each group got different cards from a stripped deck and had to sort them in a specific way. During the game we were not allowed to speak and only the leader knew the exact way we had to sort the cards. We were only allowed to communicate with little notes, which was not easy for us. The team who used the fewest notes and finished first won the game.
In the evening, hunger overcame us and led us to an Italian restaurant overlooking the half-frozen river “Rur“. Our last evening in Monschau was completed with a cozy get-together with card games.
The next day, after breakfast, we set out traveling home after a successful, wonderful weekend in the Eifel.

iLOV and GFP in the Gel DocTM
Sensor cells producing iLOV (K1319042, A) and GFP (B) 1.5 h after induction.
Equipment and medium selection
Our first approach (before developing our own device) was to use the Molecular Imager® Gel Doc™ XR+ from BIO-RAD in our lab to detect fluorescence. This device uses UV and white light illuminators. However, only two different filters were available for the excitation light wavelength, which resulted in very limited possibilities for the excitation of fluorescent molecules. For example, it was possible to detect the expression of iLOV (K1319042) in our sensor chips, but not the expression of GFP. Hence, the Gel Doc™ was not suitable for our project.
Differend medium in the Gel Doc™
complex media exhibited high background fluorescence while less back- ground fluorescence was observed with the minimal media (HM, M9, NA).
Testing our chips' shelf-life
Chips of K131026 in NEB were stored five days at 4°C. The right chip was induced with 0.2 µL of 500 µg/mL HSL and an image was taken after 1.5 h.
We tested different media (LB, TB, M9, NA and HM) for the preparation of our sensor chips. The medium compositions can be found in the Protocols section. We screened for an optimized medium composition to minimize background fluorescence and to enhance cell growth. The results of the analysis are presented in the table below. Due to the low background fluorescence in WatsOn and the excellent cell growth, we chose LB medium over the other tested media for sensor chip manufacturing.

Another set of experiments were conducted to test the long-time storage of the sensor chips. We varied the glycerol content of the chips as well as the storage temperature. Storage at -20°C resulted in the loss of our sensor cells. Adding 5-10% (v/v) glycerol ensured survival of the sensor cells, but resulted in the loss of fluorescence ability. Hence, we concluded that long-time storage of the sensor chips at -20°C is not possible under the tested conditions. However"

SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html,", which is part of the surfactin biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus subtilis, can effectively modify ACPs from all PKS subclasses as well as related peptidyl carrier protein and aryl carrier protein domains from nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Only with the function of Sfp can propionyl-CoA be linked to ACPs, which is the basement of the reactions.
In the preparatory phase, we transformed pKD46 into BL21, as preparation for gene knock-out. pKD46 contains Red system which is composed from three genes (gam, bet, exo ). The Gam protein prevents an E. coli nuclease of RecBCD from degrading linear DNA fragments, thus allowing preservation of transformed linear DNA in vivo. The bet gene product, Beta, is an ssDNA-binding protein that promotes annealing of two complementary DNA molecules, and the exo gene product, Exo, has a 5´ to 3´ dsDNA exonuclease activity.
After the preparation, we achieved the target gene as above by fusion PCR, which was then transformed into BL21(DE3), yielding E. coli BAP1. Using prpE and the fragment of prpR as homologous arm, we can ensure the gene replacement happens in targeted location. And Sh Ble gene product is zeocin-resistant, helping us to screen E.coli.
Results
After gene knock-out, we achieved BAP1 as the preparation for those following experiments. According to PCR results, prpRBCD gene had been knocked out while sfp gene and prpE gene is still kept on. Obviously, the gene had been transformed into the targeted location.
Conclusion
Although frameshift mutation has taken place in sfp gene, we transformed plasmids with sfp gene into BAP1 to make up for it, which has been proved to work as the following experiments showed. Therefore, by the gene knock-out, we have successfully achieved workable BAP1.

In-lab produced maltodextrin
Maltodextrins are linear polymers of D-glucose linked by α1-4 glycosidic bonds ranging from degree of polymerization (DP) 2 to 20. They are metabolizable by E. coli but can’t diffuse innately through bacterial membranes if their DP is higher than 3. These two properties were of paramount importance in the first step of our selection process. Indeed, maltodextrins, as the sole carbon source in minimal medium, were only accessible by mutants expressing an ˝open˝ porin phenotype. We particularly focused on obtaining maltodextrins of DP 5, ˝maltopentaose˝ because it best combined selectivity and rapid cell growth in comparison to other oligomers (Marciano et al., 1999 ; Spagnuolo et al., 2010).
Figure 1 : Growth differences exhibited by E. coli expressing wt PIV porin and PIVS324G leaky porin, on different maltodextrins after 36h of incubation at 37°C  (Marciano et al. 1999)
Nonetheless, we quickly faced a determining obstacle: industrial maltopentaose is extremely expensive, easily reaching 1500€/g, and large amounts of it were required. It was inconceivable to allow our whole budget to buy a simple substrate, so we looked for a way to produce it by ourselves. We managed to achieve this by precipitating corn syrup (kindly given by our sponsor Cargill) in ethanol. Another scientific paper (Balto et al., 2015) helped us to establish an efficient purification protocol
Corn syrup contains D-glucose and maltodextrins from DP 2 to more than 9. Our objective here was to remove glucose, maltose and triose, which can diffuse through bacterial membranes, and ideally, fractions of DP higher than 6 that are unable to pass through our porin. This way, we could use the corn syrup fraction of DP 4 to 6, which is assumed to be close enough to industrial hexamaltose composition to achieve our selection goal.
In a few words, we proceeded by"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," that the expression of the blue/purple color is very strong. In conclusion the amilCP has been successfully modified by adding a His-tag without compromising the protein.
Figure 16: The picture to the left is of amilCP with His-tag spun down in LB media. The picture to the right is a picture of amilCP with His-tag after the lysis procedure by sonication.
AmilCP with His-tag purification test
To test whether the amilCP with His-tag worked as expected, we purified two solutions of amilCP; one with His-tagged amilCP, and one with just amilCP. Cells producing the His-tagged amilCP were lysed in accordance with the cell lysis protocol before being used in this experiment. The non His-tagged amilCP producing cells were not lysed because they secreted the amilCP out of the cells and into the media.
Both solutions of amilCP were diluted to an equal absorbance before the solutions were loaded onto Ni-NTA columns to be purified. The purification is based on loading the columns, washing away residual proteins, and eluting the target protein.
As shown in table 1 below, the vast majority of amilCP without His-tag seems to run right through the column, as high concentrations can be detected in the flow through after adding the samples to the column. In addition, the absorbance of the eluant is not far from that of the blank, indicating that no amilCP was retained in the column and eluted. It seems like it makes no difference to run the sample through the column multiple times before washing and eluting, which makes sense if the amilCP is not bound to the column.
Table 1: The absorbance of solutions of amilCP without His-tag, isolated from the different steps in the His-tag purification. The absorbance was measured at 588 nm.
Table 2 shows a different pattern for the His-tagged amilCP. For the His-tagged amilCP, the flow-through after sample loading yields concentrations of amilCP that are lower or equal to that of the eluates. The number of times the sample is run through the column seems to make a big difference, especially in the 2nd elution, where it seems there are a linear correlation between the number of times cell lysate were loaded onto the column, and the concentration of eluted amilCP with His-tag.

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Notebook#Funding_-_-_TEXT.html," salary but he has no fundamental obligations. In 1671 van Leeuwenhoek remarried with Cornelia Swalmius, progeny of a pastor family. In 1679 he became an inspector of wine measures, which required a certain amount of mathematical knowledge. In 1694 his wife Cornelia died, whereupon he remained with his daughter Maria – his other children already died.
Van Leeuwenhoek was a rich man. This became obvious from the capital he left for his daughter when he died: ninety thousand guilders. On 26 August 1723 Van Leeuwenhoek died in his hometown Delft, he was almost 91 years old. There are stories which claim that on his death bed he dictated a letter to the Royal Society in London. In this letter he explained the condition of his diaphragm so thoroughly, that this disease is now known as the Van Leeuwenhoek’s disease. Van Leeuwenhoek was buried in the “Oude Kerk” (The Old Church) in Delft.
In his spare time, van Leeuwenhoek became interested in lens making, and had also become familiar with Robert Hooke’s Micrographia (1665) which probably encouraged him to try his lenses on materials other than fabric. In 1673, a friend of van Leeuwenhoek, the famous Dutch physician Reinier de Graaf wrote to Henry Oldenburg. Henry Oldenburg was the secretary of the Royal Society in London at that time. Reinier de Graaf introduced him to the Society as a maker of microscopes better than any other and enclosing the first letter from van Leeuwenhoek to the Society. This was the beginning of a series or around 560 letters that continued throughout van Leeuwenhoek’s life, to the bitter end.  Despite the fact that van Leeuwenhoek – by the use of his handmade microscopes – observed cell structures and later little animals (bacteria, yeast) and thus “inventing” microbiology, he was not a teacher and had no followers in the city. Luckily for history he made a lot of drawings of what he saw and there was the letter correspondence with The Royal Society.
The microscope & The Royal Society
Van Leeuwenhoek’s interest in glass processing and his interest in microscopes has led to one of the most significant and simultaneously well-hidden, technical insight in the history of science. He placed the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, he could pull the hot section apart to create two"

ELECTROPORATION THEORY AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES
In order to demonstrate the versatility of electroporators, the underlying mechanism allowing their functioning must first be described. Cell membranes comprise of a combination of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and other macromolecule-based structures arranged into a bilayer formation providing a selectively permeable barrier to protect the cell and facilitate the transport of molecules into and out of the cell, thereby reducing the potential for molecules to freely diffuse into a cell [1]. This theory of the organization of the cell membrane in the formation of a phospholipid bilayer was characterized by Singer and Nicholson and named the “fluid mosaic model”, and the mosaic properties were further characterized as dominant to the fluidic properties [2]. Electroporation results in a disruption of membrane integrity [3-5], and the subsequent events following electrical discharge allow for membrane permeabilization [5-12]. While the actual molecular occurrences caused by electroporation that allow for DNA uptake are relatively unknown, experimental trials have indicated that interaction between the electrical fields and phospholipids result in the creation of aqueous pores in the membrane [13-15], high-voltage pulses stimulate a reorganization in the ions resulting in a new transmembrane voltage producing a local electrical field. These local electrical fields are theorized to lead to the formation of the aforementioned aqueous pores, allowing for the transport of molecules into a cell [16]. The totality of these sequence of events contribute to the uptake of DNA by cells in the processes of bacterial electrotransformations, but additionally function in cellular uptake for the other outlined applications of electroporation.
The observation of the effects of electrical pulses on living organisms can be traced back to the late 1700s when German physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg described branched structures that form when high-voltage electrical pulses are induced on human skin, which are now referred to as Lichtenberg Figures [17]. Over 200 years later, it was demonstrated that high-voltage pulses greatly increased the number of transfected cells, leading to the coinage of the term “electroporation”, based on the theory that these pulses induced temporary membrane disruptions allowing for DNA uptake [18]. Over the past decade, electroporation has been increasingly characterized in terms of its electrical and biological functionality, with elements such as field strength, voltage output, arc length, transformation efficiency, etc., leading to more advanced technology utilized to carry out the process. Additionally, an increase in the theoretical understanding behind electroporation’s principles has expanded its applications tremendously, including for cancer therapies through electrochemotherapy"

We realized that in order to have a comprehensive point of view over a problem, we also need to cover the perspective from the members of the public. Advices and opinions from the experts should be taken into consideration while doing the project. Thus, the integrated work between the wetlab, drylab, and the policy and practices could be achieved. To share our project and educate the society is also one of the fundamental part of the scientist. Therefore, we aim to have several activities :

Collaboration. Fun Interactions Between iGEM Teams!
Cooperation with the iGEM Team Freiburg
We got to know the Freiburg iGEM team during the Biotechnology 2020+ conference in Berlin, where several teams from Germany presented their projects and were offered the opportunity to gather around, discuss and share experiences in the lab. Since we talked with the Freiburg team about our first experiences in the lab, we noticed that our two projects have something in common: the GibsonAssembly.  That was the start of our cooperation.
The iGEM team Freiburg had already successfully conducted several Gibson Cloning attempts and was able to establish a well working protocol. They offered to realize a little workshop with us so we could improve our knowledge about Gibson Cloning and the practical implementation. On the other hand Freiburg had problems with the CHO cells they were working with for the realization of their project. As the Bioquant is in close connection with the German Cancer Research Center we managed to organise the urgently needed CHO-Pro5 to help Freiburg.
On July 15, 2013 Natalie, Fenja and Michael arrived in Heidelberg and we met in our laboratory in the BioQuant. After a short introduction of our team and the three team-members from Freiburg, we directly started with the Gibson Assembly. Together we worked 3 hours on the theoretical and practical introduction of Gibson Cloning. We managed to successfully assemble and transform their constructs and had positive results on the next day.
Of course the fun was not missed out. During a team-dinner we got to know Natalie, Fenja and Michael better and had good discussions about several similarities in the iGEM-teams like team compositions"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

In essence, the sensitivity of the RCS Phosphorelay system becomes such that the smallest of membrane perturbations becomes sufficient to trigger colanic acid production. Thus, the background noise switches the RCS Phosphorelay system on permanently.
There are a total of 19 genes involved in colonic acid biosynthesis, the best characterised of which are shown below.
Other genes involved in colanic acid biosynthesis are listed below.
wcaF
Putative colanic acid biosynthesis acetyltransferase 2
gmd
Codes for GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase which is a subunit of GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase. This enzyme is involved in colanic acid biosynthesis.
wcaD
Predicted colanic acid polymerase
fcl
Codes for a subunit of GDP-fucose synthase. This enzyme is involved in colanic acid biosynthesis.
General Protective:
The following proteins are thought play a role in membrane fortification to confer protection against the rigours of dessication, acid exposure and osmotic stress.
Other RcsB induced genes coding for protective proteins are listed below.
KatE
Codes for a subunit of heme d synthase / hydroperoxidase. This bacterial catalase protects against osmotic stress.
Host Defence:
Humans synthesise a number of enzymes that are able to burst bacterial cells. These enzymes are called lysosymes. RcsB is able to induce a number of proteins that act as lysosyme inhibitors that will prevent the host-mediated lysis of our chassis.
ivy (Inhibitor of Vertebrate lysozyme)
Discovered in 2001 as the first bacterial lysozyme inhibitor. This Type-C lysozyme inhibitor resides in the periplasm.1
MilC (Membrane-bound lysozyme inhibitor of Type C lysozyme)
This is a lipoprotein that resides in the membrane. 1
Global Regulators:
Repression:
RcsB is also is able to act as a repressor, preventing the expression of both curli and fimbriae. This reduces cell motility and plays a role in biofilm formation.

Alberta,2009,Team:Alberta#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," summer spent at the German Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg, Germany.  I'll be working in both the iGEM lab and a Medical Genetics research lab during summer 2009.  My heritage is a mixture of English, Chinese, and Danish.  iGEM helps move biology to a streamlined, standardized, abstracted process that opens the door to interdisciplinary collaborations and new applications.  I'm excited about the many applications of Synthetic Biology and am enjoying the student-directed and team-oriented nature of iGEM.

I am currently a second year student in Biological Sciences and I am considering transferring into the Immunology and Infection program for my third year. I joined iGEM at the end of my first year and can honestly say that it has been an unbeatable learning experience. It is very exciting to think that the progress we have made can positively impact synthetic biology and society in general. In the future, my career goal is to become a Pediatrician. However, after doing labwork at the iGEM lab this summer, I have begun to consider a career in medical research.

Hon. Biochemistry
I completed my BSc. in Biochemistry this year and have enrolled in the University of Alberta's Chemical Engineering program in hopes of fusing the fundamental science of biological machines with the entrepreneurial world of engineering.  I got involved in iGEM a couple of years ago when I went to a presentation put on by one of the past teams.  I ended up applying in the middle of the night on the last day of registration.  That said, it has been a great experience ever since.  I'm glad that this year I get the opportunity to do some full time work and really get into the project.  Overall, iGEM has a lot to offer anyone who gets involved (including incorrigible advisors: you know who you are!).

hi
HP GOLD INTEGRATED
At the beginning of our project, we visited local and foreign wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and learned that there are currently very few wastewater treatment methods that specifically target nanoparticle (NP) waste. We designed our constructs, prototype and modeling based directly from information given by these treatment plants. Our biofilm parts collection was designed to be able to control biofilm production in sedimentation tanks. Our proteorhodopsin construct is designed to be used in aeration tanks where other microbes are already breaking down organic substances.  We also use the pre-existing biosafety aspect of the wastewater plants. Additionally, we reached out to several NP manufacturers, researchers, disposal services and wastewater experts who provided us with information on the advantages and potential consequences of NP usage, as well as where to target NP waste removal. The feedback we received guided the direction of our project and confirmed the importance of our project to our community.
Bioethics Panel
We hosted a Bioethics Panel, where we invited students and teachers to discuss the moral, social and environmental concerns of our project. To encourage participants to consider the problems from multiple perspectives, we created a role-playing game and assigned different roles to the participants. We then asked for their opinions on NP usage and disposal from the perspective of their assigned role. (Whole team activity)
For instance, one of our questions was:
“Dihua WWTP has no nanoparticle removal plan. Should this be the job of the wastewater plant? Or the nanoparticle manufacturer?”
The following roles were assigned:
Wastewater plant manager
Nanoparticle manufacturer
Citizen
Fisherman
Fish
Most of the wastewater plant managers thought that NP manufacturers should be responsible for removing NP, because they have more information (e.g., solubility, toxicity, etc.) about their own products. However, many other participants were skeptical that manufacturers could be trusted to remove their own contamination and agreed that WWTPs should ultimately be responsible for cleaning water contaminated with NPs.
This activity gave us great insight on how the public perceives NP usage and regulation, and provided us a chance to inform people about both the benefits and the"

Nina: The other antibodies are not in any excess so we do not need to put much research on them, instead learn more about IgG.

ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING CIRCUIT
OVERVIEW
In order to serve as a diagnostics and research tool, our system should not only be able to sense a single molecule alone but should associate an inflammation marker - in our case NO• - with a potential trigger of the inflammation itself. Thus, we implemented an associative learning circuit that allows for the detection of the temporal and spatial presence of two markers. (See Design )
Nitric oxide and 3-OH-C6-HSL are only two possible markers of IBD. There are many more potential biomarkers that are definitively worth investigating. To account for this multitude of possible markers, we devised a modular system that allows for rapid component exchange. Moreover, we extended our single AND-gate by the addition of a memory module: AND-gate activation results in the activation of a unidirectinal switching mechanism, which in turn renders a reporter protein (e.g. GFP) sensitive to a bio-marker previuosly encountered by the AND-gate (e.g. AHL), which causes reporter expression. While the number of distinguistable reporters (e.g. fluorophores) is limited, our system allows for simultaneous observation of a multitude of markers measured in parallel. Our Pavlov's Coli learn the occurence of the presence of two markers and store this information in their DNA until readout.
We designed our system in a way that allows fast and easy demultiplexing of a complex mixture of different reporter strains. If the reporter strains encounter the inflammation-associated marker again, they generate an easily observable output: fluorescence. This was achieved by integrating a second AND-gate that relies on the successful learning process as shown below.
BIOLOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION: RECOMBINASE
SENSOR AND-GATE:
At an inflammation spot, nitric oxide activates NorR and triggers the transcription of the bxb1 integrase gene. Yet, the transcription can proceed only if OH-C6-HSL is also present. HSL makes the repressor EsaR dissociate from the regulatory element (esaBox) on the DNA and thus annihiliates its roadblock activity.
LEARNING:
Once the bxb1 gene is successfully transcribed and translated, Bxb1 binds to the attP and attB recombination sites flanking a constitutive promoter and inverts it. As attP and attB are destroyed through inversion, Bxb1 mediated recombination acts as a one-way switch.
REPORTER AND-GATE:
The constitutive promoter, which"

We are able to do some scientific research for them and use our knowledge about biology to help them evaluate the progress of some biotechnology companies.
On the other hand, we also get some help from GDILSF. They evaluate our project and give us important advice on safety and ethical concerns. They also provided foundation and technical assist to support our experiment. By the end of September we will have the chance to go to the institute and communicate the experience about culture of iPSCs with the researchers from GIBH.
It is our honor that the vice General Secretary Mr. Lin of the GDILSF visited us in our lab and talked about our project with us.He gave us some useful advice. We talked about our cooperation in long term and discussed the possibility of commercializing our iPSCs safe guard.
Campus popularization
At spring of 2013, SYSU-China iGEM team made a campus popularization targeting students from different majors.
In this activity, we presented the iGEM competition from many aspects. Our teammate, Fang Yiming, gave the audience an introduction to iGEM and shared some interesting projects in previous iGEM competitions. Our current team leader, Sun Mengyi, told us the origin, history, development and current situation of synthetic biology, and then discussed the safety and ethical issues about synthetic biology. We also invited the core members of former iGEM teams, Kou Qiang and Ye Chang, who talked about how iGEM team developed in our university and their own story with iGEM.
It was our pleasure that we invited Prof. Lu Yongjun, Prof. He XiongLei and Doctor. Xu Hui to attend this activity. Prof. He XiongLei also gave us a speech that ignited our passion for iGEM.
Thanks to such a cheerful meeting, we met many students who are interested in synthetic biology and iGEM and they are willing to join our team. We established a QQ group subsequently, and had more communication on it. Team members from current and former teams of iGEM-SYSU gathering together, which made it look like the jamboree for iGEM-SYSU. What an amazing evening!

Once in the cytoplasm, the drug released from the bacterium can build up within the cell to result in the destruction of the cell. Combined with RIOT Sensor and RIOT Transponder, the bacterium can potentially target and eliminate cancer cells with minimal side effects.
Initially, small amounts of N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) produced by our engineered bacteria freely diffuse in and out of the cell. In tumor regions with an expected higher cell density, the concentration of AHL also increases. Past a threshold, LuxR binds to AHL and this LuxR-AHL complex will further activate expression of LuxI, producing more AHL. This creates a positive feedback loop that increases both the concentration of LuxI and of our desired proteins, invasin and LLO.

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," our own for when the new chip is assembled and tested.
Version 2
Following the observations made when testing the initial version of this collaboration chip, the overall chip area was significantly reduced while the actual design was made more spaced out. This, combined with a thicker layer of PDMS, lead to the chip seal holding. The chip was capable of creating the proof of concept droplets out of different colors of water, but when the different solutions were introduced, the viscosity of the sodium alginate solution inhibited the formation of droplets. Now that the chip no longer leaks, it was decided that perhaps shortening the length travelled by the segregated solution would reduce the effects the viscous solution.
Version 3
This version of the Harvard Collaboration Chip was not designed by the 2018 BostonU Hardware iGEM team, but by one of our mentors Ali Lashkaripour. It is similar to last version with a few differences. First, the three liquids meet right before the droplet generator. Second, the overall dimensions of the chip are smaller which leads to a better seal. Lastly, the channels have varying widths due to the initial purpose of chip. This last detail is not relevant to the chip’s purpose here. When this chip was tested with the sodium alginate solution, it behaved similarly to to the last version, with the viscous solution creating tailing droplets but no individual encased droplets. After observing
this repeatedly under a variety of different flow rates ratios, it was decided that a new geometry was needed to achieve the collaboration’s desire outcome.                 Using a similar chip with only a single input, we were able to conclude that the while the sodium alginate solution was capable of forming droplets, it did so independently of the chip geometry. After this test and some literature review, a T-junction was decided upon for the new version of this collaboration chip.
Version 4
This latest version of the chip utilizes a T-junction instead of the droplet generators we have been using in the rest of our chips. Similar to the previous chip, all three inputs meet right before the T-junction. Unlike the other chips, a T-junction uses only a single stream of oil instead of pinching the solution with two streams, letting the droplets formed partially independent of geometry. During the first test with parameters similar to those tested in the last design, the problem remained. While there were some droplets being formed independent of chip geometry, there remains no way of making consistent, uniform droplets with the viscous sodium alginate solution. Additionally this chip, like the other
versions, is prone"

Conclusion
If this proposal was successfully implemented Lethbridge would not only look more vibrant, but this proposal would also help a species that humans cannot live without. An increase in pollinators would also be beneficial for the area in general as bees would pollinate all of the vegetation that would need to be pollinated. The cost of the proposal is also relatively inexpensive as only new subdivisions with boulevards would have this seed mix spread along them.
Radio Interview
A local radio station named CJOC interviewed one of our members, Dinula De Silva, about our project after our presentation to City Council. They asked us questions about urban beekeeping in Lethbridge and why it would be beneficial to our community. Also, they asked about urban beekeeping in larger cities such as Calgary and Edmonton, and its success. We also gave them information about what iGEM is and the Jamboree in Boston.

School Presentations
Student asking question during our presentation
We presented to Grade 8. students at G.S. Lakie Middle School and Wilson Middle School in order to expand their interest in synthetic biology and iGEM. We started with a basic introduction to DNA and synthetic biology. This included an engaging experiment in which student volunteers assisted in the extraction of DNA from a banana. We also presented the biofilm and bee issues that we are tackling this year. The students were very interested in the presentations, and asked many questions. Some were even wondering how they could join the iGEM team. Overall, our presentation left a positive mark on the students.

“I found the purpose of the survey very interesting. Science isn't just discovering or creating things. We must notice the relevance of technology transfer. Discovering a drug that cures cancer, a bacterium that cleans CO2 or a tool that improves crops means nothing if it never reaches the market. Hopefully, iGEM will listen and try to make some changes to more directly encourage entrepreneurship during and after their competition.” – iGEM Participant, October 15th 2016
“If IGEM was all year, constantly distributing new source from different labs, constantly sequence verifying, constantly awarding parts that help a wide variety of people, how much more could get done? I think that the answer is a lot more.” – iGEM Participant, October 10th 2016
“There are many projects that could greatly improve society related to medicine, the environment, and do not go further because of the lack of support or assessment.” – iGEM Participant, October 10th 2016
Summary of Open Responses
To summarize, it appears the extra factors listed from the open responses involve the willingness and passion to solve a problem, impact society, gain experience, personal development and potential to earn money. The barriers against founding range from not having enough experience, not having a good enough idea, inability/lack of knowledge about legal issues, regulation barriers and laziness.
The quotes from iGEM participants provide a more human touch for the research objective, showing a passion and drive for progressing iGEM projects through entrepreneurship but also frustration with the barriers that prevent them. In the following section these extra factors will be discussed in parallel to the established qualitative and quantitative data.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#AttributionsII_-_-_TEXT.html," industrial scale gold recycling from electronic waste using delftibactin was mainly performed by Nikolaos Ignatiadis. On his journey through metabolic modeling of delftibactin producing E. coli, bioreactor simulations and cost estimations, he was supported by Johanna Meichsner and Joshua Sachs, who did research on financial data and Florian Schmidt on chemical equations. They received helpful advice by Tim Heinemann.
The modeling of the production kinetics of indigoidine to disentangle the underlying mechanisms of bacterial growth and peptide synthesis was realized by the task force consisting of Konrad Herbst, Ilia Kats, supported by Lorenz Adlung. Konrad was responsible of processing of the time-resolved experimental data, which were generated by him and Ralf Beer. Ilia then generated a model to elucidate the influence of indigoidine production on bacterial growth of bacteria and to provide a more quantitative understanding of the synthesis efficiency of the different T domains and PPTases.
Wiki Design
Our wiki is mainly build on stylesheets from Bootstrap 3.0 and was implemented by Nils Kurzawa. He wrote the main javascripts and css stylesheets used on this wiki. Nils and Tim Heinemann came up with the idea of the main page and subsequently designed the templates for all other pages. Tania Christiansen was responsible several pictures such as the symbols used in the wiki navigation. All team members developed quite some talent when generating graphics and figures in Inkskape (yes Ilia, it is a great piece of software). Thanks also to our creative advisors Fanny Georgi (who should think of an alternative career as photographer) and Katharina Genreit who came up with many ideas. After the basic implementation was finished, Nils received help in the wiki design from Nikolaos Ignatiadis, Ilia Kats, Konrad Herbst and Johanna Meichsner.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Human Practices#all_-_-_TEXT.html," had spread out and reached many people from different fields. Such fields as art or philosophy were of particular interest to us. We were contacted by Kristupas Sabolius, Lithuanian writer and Associate Professor of Philosophy at Vilnius University, who expressed interest in our project and scientific research. Throughout this year we have conducted several meetings with Kristupas and his colleagues and discussed different questions regarding the ethics of genetic engineering, the importance of visualization, imagination and fortuities in science.
Together with Kristupas and two fellow artists Mindaugas Gapševičius (an artist, facilitator, and curator, based in Berlin, Weimar and Vilnius, Lithuania, initiator of several major international cultural/educational projects, including o-o Institutio Media and Migrating Art Academies) and Lina Rukevičiūtė (a video artist, a Saint Martin's School of Art (London) graduate, currently living and working in Vilnius, Lithuania) we decided to organise a discussion on the possible connection between art and science. It was the fourth discussion in our ‘Café Scientifique’ discussion cycle. Read more here
Later, we decided to bring our collaboration with Kristupas and ‘Institutio media’ organisation (which was represented by Lina and Mindaugas) even further and organised a workshop for artists and other enthusiasts. The workshop included bacteria staining and was a part of the exchange laboratory project, developed by ‘Institutio media’. The workshop was organised during ‘The European Researchers’ Night’, which is a Europe-wide public event, dedicated to popular science and informal learning. This is an annual event, which takes place on the last Friday of September. More than 30 countries and over 300 cities are involved in this event. The aim of the event is to show the common public what impact science has on society and how it is engaging and interacting with the common public.
Our workshop was called ‘Adjusting Bacteria’. This workshop started with the discussions on the adaptability of the bacteria to varying environmental conditions and the positive and negative influence of this phenomenon towards adaptability and survival of humans. We briefly introduced participants to the history of the scientific practice of working with bacteria and why such practice is important. We also got the audience acquainted with the bacteria and its structure, the mechanisms of adaptation of bacteria and to microscope usage. To our surprise, a brief 40 minutes of introduction turned into an intensive two-hour discussion. We were thrilled about all the questions and the interest we received. We were happy to answer the questions and broaden participants"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"erase expressed using 4 different ribosome binding sites. Based on the fact that the same enzyme and substrate nucleotide concentration are used, the difference in activity corresponds to difference in synthesised biomolecule concentrations. The expression of an enzyme depends on the particular strength of used ribosome binding sites. Taking this into consideration, the measured relative activity corresponds to strength of ribosome binding sites.
Toehold regulatory sequence library
To explore the capabilities of CAT-Seq workflow as a method for screening novel transcription or translation regulatory sequences a control riboregulator library was constructed based on Green et al., 2014. 9 library members, composed of 3 toehold sequencesand 3 activating RNA sequences, termed Trigger RNA, were designed to test the orthogonality and regulatory characteristics of each part.
Each of the regulatory part, consisting of one toehold sequence upstream of the esterase gene and one trigger sequence were constructed. First of all, the orthogonality of each toehold:activating RNA pair and they regulatory characteristic have been tested in bulk. The constructed library members were synthesized using In vitro transcription and translation kit and their catalytic activity towards N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate (Substrate Nucleotide) were tested. The reaction kinetics were measured using the spectrophotometer as a decrease of absorbance due tue hydrolyzed substrate nucleotide.
Figure 6 displays the relative hydrolysis speed of each regulatory part variant in a form of matrix. The decrease of absorbance shown in Y graph corresponds to the catalytic conversion of substrate nucleotides. As seen from control experiment, in which standard esterase was expressed, the decline of absorbance over time is seen. Taking these results into consideration, the same decrease of absorbance is only seen in the diagonal of the matrix. This means, that active catalytic molecules is expressed only when both regulatory molecules of the same group are present - Toehold 1 with Trigger 1, Toehold 2 with Trigger 2 and Toehold 3 with Trigger 3. None of the regulatory sequences show any cross talk with the other group.
Figure 6. The catalytic activity of each Toehold:Trigger RNA construct matrix. CAT-Seq esterase mutant sequences were placed downstream the riboregulatory sequences with corresponding trigger part and they catalytic activity was measured. The decrease of absorbance corresponds to catalytically active enzyme. The graph shown as a matrix concludes that only Toehold sequences expressed with their corresponding Trigger RNA produce an active enzyme molecule.

BIOSINT_Mexico,2014,Team:BIOSINT Mexico#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," transportation mediated by merE is a one way process.
Since the reaction is mediated by an enzyme, it could be expressed by:
Then, it is possible to model the process just as any other enzyme mediated reaction. For this purpose, we use the Michaelis-Menten equation.
Where v is the reaction rate, Vmax is the maximum rate achieved by the reaction at saturating substrate concentrations, S is the substrate and Km is the Michaelis constant for the reaction, or the substrate concentration when the system achieves half of Vmax. Therefore, adapting this for our process, we have:
Equations for mercury bioremediation
Once in the interior of the cell, under slightly acid conditions, methyl mercury decays on methane and metallic mercury, by the following reaction:
Since the rate of the reaction in normal conditions is very low, we use merB to accelerate this rate. Therefore, the reaction can be described as:
Where methyl mercury is lysed by the merB protein at a rate that goes by the Michaelis-Menten equation:
Where the methyl mercury concentration is the concentration of the molecule inside the cell, described in the last step.
Equations for the repressor system
The active protein complex that is formed by phyb construct and pif6 construct becomes a transcription factor that activates the production of two small interference RNAs. One is specific for the RBS1 sequence and the other for the IRES sequence.
Since the complex has a binding domain that joins to the promoter inducible PCMV, the rate of production of the siRNAs is given by the strength of the promoter and its activity (which is proportional to the activation by CPPA).
Since the activator has to bind to the DNA molecule in the promoter site, we use Hill’s function for macromolecules binding.
From:
Can be deduced for promoters with activators:
To find the complete demonstrations for the Hill’s equation for inducible promoters, you can visit Aberdeen 2009 wiki.
Then, the activity for our promoter can be expressed as:
Where βPCMV is the maximum expression achieved by our promoter. Kd is the constant is the equilibrium constant for the attachement of the inducer and the promoter, and n is the Hill’s coefficient for the cooperative ligation Induce-promoter.
Since the affinity of the tow molecules is high, the Hill’s coefficient is n>1, then, aPCMV, is also greater than one. Thus, the equations that models the expression of siRNAs are:
And given that both sequences are connected to the same promoter, the activity is the same for si"

Freiburg,2012,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractices#Evenings_-_-_TEXT.html," impressive scientific knowledge existed. They constructed impressive machine-like entities, which were capable of moving around and do things, but not to (re)produce, maintain and organise themselves. Using artificial organic materials they also constructed some bacteria-like living entities, which were able to absolve self-production, self-maintenance and self-organisation. This civilisation was destroyed without leaving anything but these two kinds of entities. We now find these entities, without knowledge of the past civilisation, and try to explain them. The explanation of the machine-like entities is ad-hoc not possible at all. One could try to explain them under the terms of their physical structures, but certainly without luck. One would probably make an ‘inference to the best explanation’ and, because these functioning machine-like entities cannot (re)produce, maintain and organise themselves, conclude that they were made by intentional beings. In contrast, no reference to human intentionality is needed by the explanation of the bacteria-like entities. A sufficient explanation of these entities can be given by just referring to the circular causality they own. The ahistorical circular causality makes any external cause unnecessary. These considerations show that in the moment in which we are capable of ascribing biological functions to an entity, all references to an ‘intelligent designer’ to explain this entity in itself is dispensable. Therefore, we conclude that the ascription of technical functions to the products of synthetic biology is only possible regarding a human context, but not if we want to describe what they are in themselves. Thus, it is not warranted to say that the synthetic entities follow a ‘human aim’. Moreover, this analysis allows a clear distinction between machines and living beings, making the expression ‘living machine’ necessary a metaphor.

We redesigned the sequence of BBa_K1960103 with a codon optimization, and synthesized the new gene by IDT. The redesigned version of formaldehyde dismutase is BBa_K2310900 .
After that, we cloned these two genes into plasmid pET-28a with a His-tag, induced with IPTG to test the efficiency of expression with a precise quantification.
Figure 2. SDS-PAGE for BBa_K1960103 and BBa_K2310900
(Both of them with a His-tag is about 50kDa)
The SDS-PAGE shows that our improved version of formaldehyde dismutase, BBa_K2310900 , has a much higher efficiency of expression compared with BBa_K1960103 .
After testing the efficiency of expression, we also tested the catalytic effect of these two enzymes. After a 6 hours inducing with IPTG, we resuspend the bacteria with corresponding plasmid with formaldehyde solution, and incubated at 28℃, assay the content of formaldehyde once an hour.

II. Improvement of the coloration system
To detect formaldehyde in the environment, WHU-China 2014 designed a coloration system. They designed a promoter, BBa_K1334002 , which can be activated by formaldehyde, and then add a fluorescent protein downstream. In this way, people can know whether there is formaldehyde or not from the color change.
Figure 4. The coloration system designed by WHU-China 2014
This system designed by WHU-China 2014 has a shortcoming: the expression of GFP is controlled by the promoter BBa_K1334002, and the strength of this promoter may be very low, so we cannot get enough fluorescence intensity that is easy to be detected. To solve this problem, we redesigned this system with our Bio-amplifier.

We intend to use the lethal system 1 we designed and decided to introduce them into the Nissle E. coli strain, which is shown below.
2
Due to the limitations of the experimental conditions (we lack experimental materials and equipment that can simulate the intestinal environment), we only performed a demonstration of the lethal system.
We also determined the feasibility of inducing a lethal system in vitro. We collaborated with Northeastern University to verify the cold lethal system induced by pCold (using toxic proteins mazF) and the results are shown below.
Boom !
3
Our data indicate that due to the high toxicity of mazF, even low expression of toxic proteins is sufficient for cell death. In contrast, the cold shock expression Lysis showed a better kill switch property. In vivo at 37℃, low expression of lysis is not enough to cause functional probiotics to die, while short-term (4h) cold shock induction in vitro can fully inhibit cell growth. In short, cold shock expression of Lysis as a kill switch is a better choice.
4
However, there are many limitations in inducing lethality in vitro, such as the induction of 16 degrees Celsius and the need to add inducers, so this lethal method is not a perfect method of lethality.
We plan to add our recombinant strains to fermented beverages or to make biobacteria for patients to take. However, due to the influence of time and other factors, the work of this part has not been completed, we plan to follow up on this part of the work."

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#Ethics#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," panel members were: René Custer , regulatory affairs manager at the VIB (Flemish institute for biotechnology). Prof. Johan De Tavernier , a bio-ethicist from the faculty of theology of the KU Leuven. Dr. ir. Anneleen Vandeplas who is an economist working for the European Commission  specializing in agriculture. And lastly dr. ir. Hermes Sanctorum , member of parliament for Groen, which is a Belgian green political party that has sustainable development and ecology as a pillar of its program. The debate was moderated by Ben Vanheukelom, journalist from the VRT radio news (Flemish Radio and Television Broadcasting Organization) and in the auditorium around 200 people with a interest in the topic were present. The aim of the debate was to focus on the ethical issues surrounding synthetic biology in a way which is accessible to students, academics, but also non-scientists. Our iGEM team provided 6 specific  statements that were used as a starting point for the discussion. Below the summary of the discussion per topic is summarized.
E. coligy Opinion
The First question: How do the panel members evaluate our project? It was considered an interesting project that provides an innovative way helping to solve the concern of feeding in a growing world population with a limited amount of space. It is an ecologically responsible way to boost the production of crops per Ha, though Hermes Sanctorum mentioned that the effects on the environment from implementing this genetically engineered machine should be well studied and also the opinion of the society has to be respected.
Regarding the question if this project is strictly speaking an example of synthetic biology, René Custers responded that synthetic biology is a rather undefined term. In this project rather ‘traditional’ genetic engineering is used. The modeling aspect and the use of multiple heterologous genes resulting in a ‘new’ bacteria however make this project a possible application of synthetic biology.
Perspectives Of Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology can be used to design organisms capable of making products in a very efficient way, although at the moment it is hard to foresee all the possible applications. Hermes Sanctorum thinks it is important that we do not create the image that synthetic biology is the solution to all our problems. Rather it is just a next step in solving these problems. If we look at the promises made at the start of genetic engineering we can see that many of those have yet to be achieved, for example providing the solution against food scarcity in the world.
The consumer also has to see the advantage from introducing this technology into the field. This might"

Bactifeed
Chicken Feed Experiments
In order to examine the proof of concept for our project, we designed experiments to examine the longevity of a bacteria coated feed product as well as the killing ability of our Bactifeed.
Before any experimentation could begin the chicken feed obtained from Dodson & Horrel had to be sterilised in order to ensure that the tests we would carry out would be reliable. This was achieved by weighing out 200g of chicken feed and autoclaving this in a 500ml screw top flask. This sterile chicken feed was then stored at room temperature until required.
Inoculation of Chicken feed with bacterial strains
To give us a wide range of data from our testing we decided to use a variety of strains of bacteria to inoculate our feed. We chose pcol Ia-ssp2 to kill the cells, and pcol Ia-MCSand MG1655 E.coli cells as controls. This would allow us to determine that our device was responsible for the killing, if any was observed.
A large overnight culture was grown for each of the previously mentioned constructs / strains and the absorbance was recorded. These values were adjusted to an absorbance of 0.05 through diluting with PBS to result in a 900ml solution. The 200g of chicken feed was emptied into a sterile tray and the inoculated PBS/bacterial solution was poured into the feed. This process was carried out for the MG1655 E.coli as well as the pcol Ia-ssp2. This mixture of feed and bacteria was left to mix on a shaker for 3 hours then left overnight to dry in a sterile fume hood. In an attempt to deduce what inoculation method will produce the best results the same constructs / strains were also used in a 50ml and 100ml agar solution in order to coat while acting as a protective coat.
When the bacterial coatings had fully dried the inoculated feed was transferred back into a sterile 500ml screw top flask. To investigate the longevity of the product"

Controlling Transmission of a DNA Message
In communication systems, messages may need to be sent in response to particular stimuli.  We sought to incorporate this control into DNA messaging at the level of M13 viral particle production.
Setting out to control particle production, we had the option of manipulating any of the 11 genes in the M13 genome (see the M13 Bacteriophage page). In our design, viral particle production is regulated by controlling production of M13 protein VIII, which is the major coat protein [1]. Gene VIII is removed from the helper plasmid and is placed on the messaging phagemid under control of an inducible promoter (Figure 1).

Introduction
Antibiotic resistance is a renowned and pressing global health concern. In more recent times, there has been stagnation in discovering new classes of antibiotics, particularly for gram-negative bacteria. Throughout the mid-1900s, scientists were rapidly discovering the current major classes of antibiotics using the Waksman platform, which entailed systematically screening soil and fungal microbes for growth inhibition. However, the recurring problem of rediscovery and failure of subsequent high-throughput biochemical assays led many pharmaceutical companies to abandon their antibiotic development programs. Current antibiotics are generally broad-spectrum, acting against symbiotic gut flora in addition to pathogenic invaders. Therefore, specificity has recently become a target in modern antibiotic development in order to bypass challenges of both rediscovery and indiscriminate killing.
The core of antibiotic development lies in targeting a molecule or pathway essential for bacterial survival. Bacteria themselves have already developed several mechanisms to both communicate and compete with other bacterial strains occupying similar niches, which can be exploited for the creation of new antibiotic drugs. While some systems rely on secreted signaling molecules, direct cell-to-cell contact is also used to mediate intercellular interactions. Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is one such system that allows CDI+ bacterial strains to outcompete closely related CDI− siblings by synthesizing and translocating a toxin through the membrane of strains expressing the appropriate receptor. The CDI system is common in many strains of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, making it a potentially suitable target for future antibiotics.
This type of growth inhibition was first seen in E. coli strain EC93, in which toxin delivery is mediated by the CdiA/CdiB two-partner secretion system and the outer membrane protein BamA, which is a conserved receptor among all strains of E. coli. EC93 is protected from its own toxin, located at the C-terminal region of CdiA (CdiA-CT), by the expression of a CdiI immunity protein that interacts directly with the toxin to neutralize its pore-forming capabilities. The CdiBAI cluster is common throughout most CDI+ strains, significantly varying only in CdiA-CT"

Summary
Figure 1: The Glasgow 2015 iGEM Azure A staining equipment
Azure A (Dimethylthionine) is a blue dye of the Thiazin family which can be used to visually stain DNA down to quantities of 20ng. Azure A staining requires no expensive equipment or controlled disposal techniques like the common DNA stain Ethidium Bromide. Glasgow’s 2015 iGEM team utilised Azure A staining for the vast majority of the Agarose gel DNA purification/extractions we performed. We aim to promote Azure A staining in order to expand the participation of community and high school labs in iGEM and molecular biology, where they would not be able to meet the expense of equipment or disposal of Ethidium bromide for DNA visualisation.
Background
Azure A is produced when Methylene blue, another Thiazin stain, is oxidised. Methylene blue is less sensitive for staining DNA than its oxidation products, while Azure A demonstrates reduced background gel staining and a reduced required staining time (NCBE, 2003b). The Thiazin family is thought to stain nucleic acids through ionic interactions with the phosphate groups of the sugar-phosphate backbone (NCBE, 2003a); but weak intercalative interactions with DNA have also been described (Paul and Kumar, 2013).
Figure 2: Chemical structures of four of the Thiazin family of dyes, including Azure A and Methylene blue.
Thiazin dyes are combined with Eosin to make Giemsa stain, a ubiquitous diagnostic stain for intracellular protozoan parasites such as Malaria and Trichomonas. Giemsa stain is also utilised to visualise chromosomal configurations by the so-called “G-Banding” of"

Baits created out of microwaved popcorn with 2 marbles in cheesecloth bags wrapped with hemp string. They were left in Lake Alice for 2 days.
September 20, 2017 - 1st Isolation Attempt
Figures 1 & 2. Fungal microbes obtained from Lake Alice
After an incubation period of 15 days, popcorn samples were placed into plastic petri dish to be examined under a dissection microscope. The samples were broken down to smaller pieces to make for easier examination and extraction. The spore with the discharge tubule sporangia and what appears to be zygotes were separated on to CT agar using a 20 microliter pipette. A marked the placement of the zygotes and B designated  the site of the sporangia specimen. Upon further research, it was believed that both microbes from Figure 1 and Figure 2 were of the same species and they were at altering points of the diploid stage in its lifecycle.
