Fudan,2014,Team:Fudan#pro_-_-_TEXT.html," relationship between the two units and -1 shows that the unit in the former layer is a negative regulator of the specific unit in the latter layer. For example, Tamoxifen has no effect on promoters induced by tetracycline, so we set a124, a125, a126 as 0. The ribozyme-a in the hidden layer can lower the expression level of gene-A significantly. Therefore, a211 equals -1. a232 equals 1, because CMV is a constitutive promoter and promotes the expression of gene-B.
We use parameter fijk (both the meanings and the value of i, j, k are the same as those in aijk) to represent the efficiency of the act between the specific pair of units (The efficiency has been normalized by a constitutive promoter. We will show below. ). For instance, we insert ribozyme-a into the 3’UTR of gene-A and the cleavage efficiency of ribozymes is about 70%. We set f211 as 0.7. If there is no relationship between two units set in the contiguous layers respectively, the corresponding fijk can be defined as 0. For the range of all of the parameters being in a small interval, there is no need to introduce a complicated function such as function sigmod which is often used in the field of machine learning to normalize the result and decrease the consumption of calculation to some extent therefore.
We can get the anticipation result of our design by some simple formulations listed below:
For the simplicity and flexibility of our model, everyone can use our model to test their designs or anticipate the results before taking pains to build their logic circuits. Furthermore, people can also use our model to explaining their own logic circuits directly just by training the parameters by their own training sets.
To conclude, we build a special neural network completely simulating and reflecting the true biological process of the logic circuit we establish. This design breaks the common configuration of the neural network and has low calculation consumption. In addition, our model is a good sample for modeling a such logic circuit or even a more complicated one, and we will continue developing this model to make it more accurate and more robust.
Note:
The method to measure the efficiency of all the elements and our system
We measure the efficiency of each of our functional elements by testing the activity of the fluorescent reporter (We first constructed plasmids containing a reporter gene for each functional element to test each one’s efficiency and used different fluorescent reporters to substitute gene-A, gene-B and gene-C to test the efficiency of the all logic circuit.

PARAMETERS - KINETIC CONSTANTS
In order to model each enzyme, at least 2 values must be known: Km and Kcat. These values must be determined when using Michaelis-Menten kinetics to model enzymes.
I found most of my values using the BRENDA database. Not all constants have actually been determined yet for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After all, our project is based on research that was conducted earlier this year.  The values shown in black below were found using the BRENDA database [4]. The values are red had to be inferred. For example, the enzyme HMG2 and K6R-hmg2 were only different in the fact that K6R-hmg2 acted as a stabilizing against protein degration;therefore, the kinetic values for each should be the same [5]. Also, the values were erg20-2 were determined by deciding that the ratio of kcat/km should be 3 times higher that the same ratio for ERG20. This was based on the fact that erg20-2 has been show to produce ""25% FPP and 75% GPP instead of 75% FPP and 25% GPP"" as compared to the wildtype ERG20 gene [9].

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid medium 2_-_-_TEXT.html," only warrior lived in the medium.
4. RFP intensity is used to indicate the amount of LacI, so it can indicate the killing ability of the warrior. This means in our model that the warrior cannot actually kill another warrior, but can activate the RFP expression of another warrior. And more RFP inside cell means the cell is killed more by warrior in other side.
Then we can evaluate killing ability by looking at change of RFP intensity as time inside each warrior. The initial amount of them is same.
III Gene circuit of warrior in the model
Note: Here for simplicity, we hypothesize that this gene circuit is orthometric.
IV ODE, parameters and its resource
V Original Parameter set of the model
Tsinghua-A ODE
VI Results of model
Note: Since we have assumed that the increasing rate and carrying capacity of two warriors are same, so in the model, the amount of two warriors are same at all the time.
1. Results under original parameter sets:
(Fig. 3 RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II)
As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the killing ability of the warrior. From this original parameter set and result, we can see that since the maximal expression rate of RFP of two warriors (Indicating the amount of LacI) have large difference, so the maximal killing abilities are different largely. In the real situation, this means that the warrior I has higher amount of LacI and thus less CmR so it has less resistance to chloramphenicol and slower growth rate.
The first step we can do to regulate maximal killing ability is to increase/decrease the maximal expression rate of warrior I/II. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS after Prhl in warrior. For example, we can increasing the maximal expression level of RFP inside warrior II to increase the killing ability of warrior I.
2.  Increasing the maximal expression rate of RFP inside warrior II
Change beta1AHL1 from 6e3 to 6e4
(Figure 4 RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II beta(1AHL1 )=6e4)
From this, Even the maximal expression intensity of AHL promoter of two warriors are the same, we will think warrior II still have much higher killing ability than that of warrior I. This is because its killing ability is high at the beginning, so warrior I may be killed at a very fast speed at the beginning. And sometimes we may not only want to regulate their maximal killing ability, but also want to regulate their killing"

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#TraciNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," our ligation problems and followed his suggestion of changing our competent cells. He gave us 5 reactions worth of their chemically competent cells to use in transformations to determine if our competent cells were the problem and not our ligations. Kyle transformed three tubes with two ligations and a positive transformation control to test the MIT cells. The two ligations yielded colonies but they were pinpoint colonies and only 1 of 8 plasmid preps grew up. Given the low success rate, it's possible that the backbones need to be dephosphorylated prior to ligation to increase our positive colonies.
While transforming with Jon's competent cells, Kyle observed that their cell density was much higher when the cells were pelleted. To determine if our cells could still be used for ligation transformations if the cells were at a higher density, Kyle, Alberto and I spun down our competent cells to concentrate them. Alberto spun down 800uLs, Kyle 1200uLs, and I spun down 1600uLs and 2000uLs to increase our cell density. We then removed enough liquid to leave 200uLs behind in the tube, resuspended the cells and then followed the transformation protocol as normal. Only one ligation transformation worked out of the various combinations, yielding no consistent result. All four attempts showed excellent results with our transformation positive control, suggesting our cells are good to use for supercoiled DNA transformation but not ligation transformation.
In order to move ahead, I purchased chemically competent cells from Bioline (alpha-select gold efficiency) for ligation transformation. I will also purchase the Zymo competent cell kit that MIT uses and generate new competent cells to try to generate our own high efficiency competent cells for future ligation transformations given the high cost of commercial cells.
WEEK 7: 7/18-7/22/2011
Transformations with ligations using the new chemically competent cells from Bioline worked extremely well. After testing transformations with both 50uL and 25uL of cells, both worked very well with 100+ colonies on the 25uL plate and more than double on the 50uL plate. Since the 25uL plates worked so well, we cut the cell volume from 25uL for the remainder of our reactions in order to make the competent cells last longer and thus cut down on cost.
I ordered 96-well plates for the robot (Eppendorf Twin Tec Full Skirted PCR Plates) and 6 more boxes of chemically competent cells from Bioline in"

Collaborations
To fulfill the silver medal requirement, we collaborated with the Texas Tech and Rice iGEM teams. We reached out to discuss ways in which all parties involved could cooperate and assist each other in order to enhance each team project.
In the spirit of collaboration, the UT Austin team reached out to both Rice and Texas Tech to formally invite both teams to participate in the University of Texas 2017 Fall Research Undergraduate Symposium. Upon this invitation, each team began electronically communicating with one another in order to brainstorm ways in which collaboration could benefit and improve each of the team projects.
On September 23, 2017, iGEM teams from Texas Tech University, Rice University, and the University of Texas met at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in Austin, Texas.  Here, each team formally presented their projects to an audience and panel of judges as part of the program. Andrew Ly, Milki Negeri, and Andrea Martinez presented on behalf of the University of Texas, while Catherine Dunway and Darron Tharp presented for Rice University and Texas Tech University, respectively. After the symposium presentations concluded, all teams met to discuss specific collaboration details and provide feedback to one another. As a relatively new team, Texas Tech received extensive constructive criticism from us because we have more overall experience participating in the iGEM competition and completing the requirements. Texas Tech presented a draft of the initial PowerPoint presentation they were planning to showcase at the iGEM Jamboree. Darron Tharp, newcomer to the Texas Tech team and the iGEM competition, was the main presenter. Tharp showcased the research slides in their entirety, and afterwards, we critiqued each slide to help improve content, formatting, and presentation technique utilized. Texas Tech asked several questions about the jamboree  itself that we clarified to the best of our ability. This series of feedback with the presentation was repeated with team Rice. After we critiqued Rice's and Tech's presentations and vice versa, the joint effort was continued by discussing a more direct means of collaborating.
At the meetup, a GroupMe chat was created with the student leaders from all teams. This was the main source of communication throughout the weeks ahead.  We collaborated with Rice for our modeling. Eve"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Modelling#QuantitativeModelling_-_-_TEXT.html," spaces on the left side of the grid are designated as the DNA loading zone, where the DNA species (red for target DNA, green for non-target DNA) will initially be located. The remaining spaces on the right will be initially allocated for the TALEs, representing the test line on our prototype. DNA then moves from its current square to its neighbouring squares, one square at a time, where the probability of the movement is set in such a way so that moving from left to right is favoured. This was designed to simulate the flow of fluid that will be used in our prototype and is currently used in home pregnancy tests. When DNA enters a square occupied by a TALE, the probability of binding to that TALE is determined by whether the DNA is target or non-target. If binding occurs, the TALE becomes saturated and additional DNA cannot bind, represented visually by the TALE changing from black to blue. After the simulation has run its course, the number of TALEs bound by a positive DNA are tallied against the number of TALEs bound by a negative DNA, from which sensitivity and specificity can be calculated.
Figure 3. Representation of our agent based model, with the simulation before hitting run on the left, and after the simulation on the right. The bound TALES, shown in blue, would be where the blue line on our prototype would appear if this was a test strip.
What did our model show?
We initially tested our model by varying the number of target DNA sequences vs non-target DNA and the number of TALEs bound to our test strip. After performing 3 runs from each of our 25 conditions (5 for both the TALEs and the target DNA levels), for a total processing time of approximately 6 hours, we obtained the number of saturated TALEs in a 50 x 50 grid square representing our prototype for 75 runs. This data would have taken us approximately 4 weeks (based on the construction time of our recent prototypes) to do in the lab. The data from this was analyzed and is represented as a 3D surface below in Figure 4. Based on the graph, it seems that the main determinant in the sensitivity of our system will be the amount of TALEs on the test strip, which makes intuitive sense.

We have deployed our agent based model into an application playable by the Mathematica CDF Player , and it can be found here , along with our enzyme kinetic models. The Mathematica code for our model can also be found at this location.

Overview: The core repressilator
In 2000, Elowitz and Leibler presented the first synthetic oscillatory system in E. coli. Termed the repressilator, this combined three transcriptional repressor systems that were not naturally part of any oscillating system. This system oscillated but was not very precise (it had an oscillation period of 120 +/- 40min, and although mother cells transmitted their state to their daughters when dividing, the bacteria tended to get out of synchrony after time).
Over the next decade, a number of efforts were made to improve the precision of the system. Garcia-Ojalvo et al. (2004) presented a model of an improved repressilator which used quorum sensing to make the bacteria function as a single unit; Figure 1 shows a diagram of this system. Danino et al. (2009) produced an oscillating genetic circuit synchronised by quorum sensing, confirming that this method could be used to improve synthetic biological oscillators.
Figure 1: A quorum sensor synchronised repressilator.
Image: Garcia-Ojalvo et al. (2004)
The repressilator designed by Danino et al. in 2009 was not only advantageous in that it was more stable than the original Elowitz repressilator, but also in that the oscillation period could be controlled. The bacteria were grown in a trapping chamber, and when the flow rate through the main tube was increased or decreased, the quorum"

General Questions Project Specific
Bioethics Panel
We hosted a Bioethics Panel, where we invited students and teachers to discuss the moral, social and environmental concerns of our project. To encourage participants to consider the problems from multiple perspectives, we created a role-playing game and assigned different roles to the participants. We then asked for their opinions on NP usage and disposal from the perspective of their assigned role. (Whole team activity)
For instance, one of our questions was:
“Dihua WWTP has no nanoparticle removal plan. Should this be the job of the wastewater plant? Or the nanoparticle manufacturer?”
The following roles were assigned:
Wastewater plant manager
Nanoparticle manufacturer
Citizen
Fisherman
Fish
Most of the wastewater plant managers thought that NP manufacturers should be responsible for removing NPs, because they have more information (e.g., solubility, toxicity, etc.) about their own products. However, many other participants were skeptical that manufacturers could be trusted to remove their own contamination and agreed that WWTPs should ultimately be responsible for cleaning water contaminated with NPs.
This activity gave us great insight on how the public perceives NP usage and regulation, and provided us a chance to inform people about both the benefits and the dangers of using NPs.
Click here to see the compiled results from all participants
IMPACT
Even though we can’t implement our project in an actual WWTP, we still wanted to make a difference! We decided on two areas where we could make an immediate impact: 1) Creating an policy brief to highlight current obstacles in effective NP regulation and propose new policy solutions, and 2) Fundraising for two organizations that promote environmental protection.
Policy Brief -- Nanoparticle Regulation Issues & Case Studies
Our team has conducted extensive research on existing regulatory laws and policies regarding NPs and nanomaterials. We have investigated chemical regulations, including the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TCSA), the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation, and the Clean Air Act (CAA). There are significant obstacles to successfully regulating NPs, such as conflicting definitions on NPs that lead to an inability to successfully regulate manufacturers. Research has also been conducted on the hazardous effects of NPs on the human body and environment. We decided to compose a policy brief highlighting the existing challenges in NP regulation and the lessons learned from previous failure to regulate new chemical substances. The brief was sent out to regulatory agencies, government agencies, and news outlets to raise awareness about the"

Public Engagement
Our public engagement on UVA grounds, in an elementary school, and within the iGEM community at large paralleled the innovative nature of synthetic biology by focusing on creativity.
Art Competition
Artistic expression is a captivating means for the learning about the field of Synthetic Biology.  In our effort to explore new and exciting ways of conducting public engagement, our team used art as a medium for local fifth and sixth graders to share what they learned about Synthetic Biology from our September workshops.
Wastewater Sticker Project
College is meant to be an environment for learning both a large depth and breadth of information. Thus, we began a sticker campaign around the University of Virginia with the goal of facilitating a larger scale public engagement.  After further consulting with the teams from Aachen and Rice University, we developed a sticker with a QR Code linked to a fun website that would provide the citizens of Charlottesville to learn more.
Mid-Atlantic iGEM Meetup
Do-it-Yourself Biology has recently established itself a fascinating niche in the communities across the country and world to help inform and educate communities.  This year we partnered with Charlottesville's very own OpenBioLabs to foster a brand new relationship between community labs and various iGEM teams in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  In doing so, we facilitated a conversation between two organizations and helped brainstorms for community labs to develop and grow.
Art Competition
By bringing together engineering principles within a biological context, synthetic biology enables creative innovation. In our efforts to teach students about synthetic biology, we wanted to parallel this integrative foundation.
To do so, we partnered with Ms. Pagni, an art teacher for 5th and 6th graders at Walker Upper Elementary School, and created an art competition for her students. The goal was to bring science and art together. We felt that this was the best way to generate excitement about synthetic biology as a science for her students and to stimulate creative thinking. Recent data has illustrated that creativity, from a neurological perspective, is quite similar in highly talented scientists and artists. Instead of arising from “two cultures,” as one might suppose, creative thought in art and in science stimulate similar associated cortices and both shown increased activation of socioaffective processing (Andreasen) .  We were hopeful"

①Weekly Newsletter
In order to know more about iGEM teams all  around the world and enhance the cooperation among us, we have joined the  Weekly Newsletter launched by Xiamen   University and become one  of the first teams to collaborate with them on this activity.
The  newsletter usually has two major parts: project update and team stories. We should  be writing about one of the parts every two weeks. What’s more, we share funny  stories about our experiments and members. Through this activity, all the teams  will be able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from  their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists.
②A Nationwide Questionnaire
In  order to investigate the spread and uptake of synthetic biology and IGEM  competition in universities, we made a survey on the internet, through a  wide-spread and professional platform for online questionnaire survey,  Questionnaire star. We promote our questionnaire within the scope of all  colleges in China  as far as possible. According to the investigation, students coming from  hundreds of schools have participated in the survey, including not only high  school and undergraduate students, but also graduate students. So we can  roughly believe that the results are authentic.
According  to our results, we can see that the great majority of the respondents are  undergraduate students, 1.24% of them are high school students and 0.62% are  graduate students. There are also 1.86% staffs and 3.73% other people. On the  other hand, 52.8% of them are men while 47.2% of them are women.
How  many people know about the concept of synthetic biology? We are very pleased to  find 40.37% respondents answered “yes”. As for the question, “Do you know some  applications of synthetic biology in our contemporary life?” 44.1% people  illustrate that synthetic biology has not yet entered their lives. 52.17% said  they have their own?? comprehension;  synthetic biology has been involved in many"

Connecting with the iGEM community
Despite this importance of competition within iGEM, access to collaborations with competeing teams has nonetheless served to enrich our notions about our project.  We put aside our adversity to allow us to exchange advice, which has been of great mutual benefit to our team. We were able to establish a communication with two teams.
The Bielefeld team plans to recycle metals. This team explained to us how their research was going and how their team was involved in the wet lab. This allowed us to reflect on the organization of our team and the role of everyone in our project.
The Leiden team was working on the stress in bacteria. With them we were able to discuss the human practices part of our project. We told them about the different the events we had particiated in and those that were coming up. We were able to discuss the vision each team had of the importance of human practices and how we wanted to integrate it into our project.
Both these teams, although having different projets and subjects for the exchange, each contributed to advancing our project. The various contacts and exchanges we had with them confirmed the interest of ​​a universal and collective science.  Each team ensures the completion of their project but has different concepts about research and all the teams and help each other, criticize, arguing and improve the result.
We thank them for their advice!!"

spisPink, Pink chromoprotein reporter system (medium Promoter , weak RBS)
878bp
Compared to the common used fluorescence protein such as GFP, RFP, chromoproteins are obviously more useful reporter genes. In our parts, the coding sequences of these pigments are all among 700bp long, and the expression efficiency is high according to our experiment results.
We contributed this series of the chromoprotein plasmid for the reason that they have significant advantages to be used as backbones. The length of 700bp is easy to be distinguished from the original backbone (around 2000bp) by gel electrophoresis when constructing new expression system. Additionally, this kind of backbones are superior because we are able to directly observe the expression results by using naked eyes. It will be much more convenient for the laboratory with limited conditions and also save our time. In the tests, the color of colonies were easy to recognize after 18 hours of incubation.
Our plasmid can also be a substitute for J04450, which kindly recommended to be used in plasmid construction by replacing the RFP gene. For the same reason, we provide these pigment sequence to make the construction process more efficiently.
The expression of 8 plasmids.

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Our liquid stocks we grew from the Gibsoned DNA 2.0 chromoproteins are still on the room temperature shaker. After spinning a couple of them down this morning to see if their color was expressing we did not see any color. We are thinking that the cellulose binding domain may be affecting the color expression of the chromoproteins or they are just taking a long time to express (the iGEM chromoproteins also took a long time to express)

We covered the Gibsoned DNA 2.0 liquid cultures that were shaking at room temperature with aluminum foil. Chromoprotein cells were not growing as well in light last year because the light helped crate reactive oxygens that stunted the growth of the chromoproteins and caused less expression of the chromoproteins.

Proof of concept
Five different plasmids were constructed with the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard in order to verify the systems function in filamentous fungi. To ensure a successful transformation the backbone plasmid pFun has two NotI restriction sites flanking the device to be inserted. Hereby, the device can be cut out of the plasmid and the linearized DNA fragments can be transformed into the fungus. The devices for proof of concept are not designed to be inserted at a specific site in the fungal genome. Therefore, the device can be integrated at any site and with a random number of copies by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This means that the possibility of the disruption of essential genes exists.
The fungal proof of concept plasmids, were constructed with the strong constitutive promoter PgpdA , the TtrpC terminator, and the pyrG marker cassette . Different genes encoding fluorescent proteins were included in the reporter system, where different compartments of fungi could be targeted. The reporter system was designed to target the nucleus, peroxisomes, and the mitochondria. All transformations were performed in the Aspergillus nidulans laboratory strain: argB2, pyrG89, veA1.
We here prove that the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard can easily be applied for the construction fungal plasmids. The constructed plasmids were transformed into A. nidulans and in each case the fluorescent protein was expressed. Only the strain transformed with pJEJAM16 targeting GFP to the mitochondria did not"

Chinese researchers used VP4 phage to study serotype O1 cholera. In India, researchers successfully treated cholera-infected rabbits with a cocktail of 5 phages: ATCC 51352- B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5. Tomorrow I will write an email to send to these professors that Dr. Grose will then forward to them on our behalf. Another approach to obtaining cholera-specific bacteriophage is to search for them in samples of Cholera-sullied water. Clarice researched WHERE Cholera is in the United States, but unsurprisingly no one is keen to publish that their water is infected with cholera. She didn’t find anything helpfully conclusive. Once we have bacteriophages we will coordinate with Michael, Whitney, and Nathan to clone into its genome proteins that (hopefully) will degrade cholera’s biofilm. We are researching candidates proteins. We started growing cholera today and I’ve read several articles that mention assays for growing biofilms. Once we have our engineered phage we will begin testing.
-CH 3/25/13 We again did some planning of what we need to do going forward. Plan of Attack: 1. Study phages 2. Obtain different cholera associated Phages 3. Engineer phage to penetrate biofilm then produce biofilm degrading enzymes upon infection of cholera 4. Testing I think we also need to do more research on V. cholerae in general. What makes up its biofilm etc. Today I set up a sequencing reaction with reverse primer BI227 (1ul undiluted) and pJG78 (2ul undiluted). Sequence obtained. Next time we need to set up a transformation with pJG78 because there is not much of it left.

-CH Set up transformation. 1ul purified plasmid into 50ul E.coli. RESULT: contamination issues either from the LB we were using or the plates being old.
-KK Dr. Grose has distributed the phage requests we sent her to send to professors in China, India, Switzerland, and Harvard. It would be wonderful to obtain CTXtheta phage, which is a cholera-specific phage whose genome has been well studied and inclusively its joint evolution with cholera has been studied. However, we when arrived at class and began discussing, Dr. Grose presented a better idea. We can use a lysogenic phage specific to E.C"

Knowledge Dissemination
Alberta RNA Research and Training Institute Annual General Meeting
Our team participated in the poster session at the Annual General Meeting for the Alberta RNA Research and Training Institute (ARRTI) based at the University of Lethbridge. ARRTI was established in 2011 and is the first RNA research focused center in Alberta, Canada. The institute promotes RNA research, teaching and training in collaboration with government institutes in Lethbridge and beyond. During the poster session, we were able to get initial feedback from members of the science community outside of iGEM including professors, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students. They highlighted areas of our project that might cause potential problems and provided suggestions for improvements. The poster session gave us an opportunity to practice public speaking and present our work.
aGEM Competition
Our team attended the Alberta genetically engineered machine (aGEM) competition hosted by the Alberta Innovates MindFuel and GeekStarter programs. We competed against other iGEM teams from Alberta, including the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary. The competition provided us with feedback about our project from experienced iGEM judges, as well as an opportunity to practice our presentation skills. We were acknowledged for our biosecurity work and awarded Best Stewardship, in addition to receiving a $4000 travel award. The competition allowed us to see the great work done by other teams and provided important feedback about our project before attending the Jamboree.

This year the team had the chance to be a part of the 11th annual Chinook Symposium that is hosted by the University of lethbridge’s Chemistry/Biochemistry Department. We had the chance to present our project during this judging competition and make our Univeristy aware of this years project. Participants of this symposium include research students in undergraduate and graduate levels. We had great responses our fellow students that were observing and participating in the event. As well, we had the chance to discuss our project with faculty members.

About our Open Classes
We have recorded 5 open classes and uploaded to the web aiming at giving people a whole picture of synthetic biology.
Now those open classes are watched by more than 3000 people, and have got more than 50 positive comments.
Lecture 1:  Introduction to synthetic biology. It focuses on the history and applications of this searching area.
Lecture 2:  Interesting stories about synthetic biology. We want to let more people have an interest in scientific research.
Lecture 3: About central dogma. This is the most important and most beautiful theory in synthetic biology. We hope more people can know it.
Lecture 4:  About BioBrick and the basic idea in synthetic biology. Because BioBrick is the essence idea of synthetic biology.
Lecture 5:  About the lab work. Because biology is a kind of science that based on experiment. It will also be much fun for people who don’t have a chance to visit laboratory.

Quantum Prep Plasmid Miniprep Protocol
Minor changes were made to the protocol supplied with the Bio-Rad Quantum Prep Plasmid Miniprep Kit
All centrifugation steps are performed at maximum speed (12,000–14,000 x g) unless otherwise stated.
Transfer an overnight culture (1–2 ml) of plasmid-containing cells to a microcentrifuge tube. Pellet the cells by centrifugation for 15–30 secs. If the overnight culture is larger than 2mL, centrifuge the falcon tubes at 3000g for 10 minutes and proceed. Remove all of the supernatant by pipeting.
Add 200 μl of the cell resuspension solution and vortex until the cell pellet is completely resuspended.
Add 250 μl of the cell lysis solution and mix by gently inverting the capped tube about ten times (do not vortex). The solution should become viscous and slightly clear if cell lysis has occurred.
Add 250 μl of the neutralization solution and mix by gently inverting the capped tube about ten times (do not vortex). A visible precipitate should form.
Pellet the cell debris for 5 mins in a microcentrifuge. (If used falcon tubes centrifuge for the same amount of time.) A compact white debris pellet will form along the side or at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant (cleared lysate) at this step contains the plasmid DNA.
While waiting for the centrifugation step at step 5, insert a spin filter into one of the 2 ml microcentrifuge wash tubes supplied with the kit. Mix the Quantum Prep matrix by vortexing or repeated shaking and inversion of the bottle to insure that it"

I am looking forward to the iGEM project as it gives me the opportunity to develop new skills  in different fields of molecular biology. Especially the idea of working in a team to develop a  project from the beginning on fascinates me. By acquiring sponsors, organizing travel and  explaining scientific results to a broad spectrum of galactic inhabitants I hope to improve my communication skills. New experimental procedures on new planets will for sure  enhance my  qualifications.

For quite some time now, I have been interested in the mechanisms of life and the Living Force. By participating in this project, I hope to acquire some further knowledge of the great many  molecules involved in the aging-process. It is quite fascinating to observe that so many  mechanisms are similar in completely different life-forms, such as the naked mole-rat and the  human-being. Even more so, because we can use knowledge of the molecular-processes of one species  to understand those of another species. Those studying the Force are confident that this  homology is correlated to the fact that the midi-chlorians are found in all living things.

It is my first participation in the INSA-Lyon team. In my previous studies, I worked on two projects about bioremediation and production of vanillin using biotechnology. So being part of the iGEM team is really important to continue learning how to manage bacteria and working in a student team. I am fond of dance, photography and art in general. I live in a town where the international short film festival takes place : Clermont-Ferrand and one of my favorite is “la révolution des crabes”

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Bioremediation_-_-_TEXT.html," The C-terminal region of one monomer, containing two cysteines is close to the redox-active cysteines of the other monomer, and might be important to bind Hg to the active site. Its N-terminal region could be involved in capturing Hg and handing it to the catalytic nucleus, and then reduced by electrons provided by the bound NADPH. MerA is the key for mercury remediation for its characteristic to reduce Hg2+ into H0, making it a prospective protein to use in bioreactors to polluted water treatment stations.
Our construction (How it works?)
To develop a bioremediator, we designed a biobrick device to express MerA protein in mercury’s occurrence. The Mercury ions’ bioremediator device biobrick (BBa_K1355004) is composed by mer bidirectional promoter (BBa_K1355001) attached to the MerA translational unit (BBa_K1355000). It has dual function: A) In reverse: MerR protein regulator transcription; and B) In forward: transcription of MerP - MerT - MerA proteins, as represented below:
In absence of mercury, MerR forms a MerR-promoter-operator complex, preventing RNA polymerase to recognize the promoter, consequently, mRNA for MerPT and MerA will not be transcript. In presence of Hg2+, MerR protein binds to this element and dissociates from the promoter-operator complex, allowing MerPT and MerA expression, as represented below:
Experiments and Results
The experiment for Hg bioremediation was made according to the protocol “Cell growth quantification of mercury resistant Escherichia coli DH5α at differents Hg concentrations by Optical Density”.
DH5-alpha transformed with BBa_K1355004 was inoculated in LM (LB with low concentration of NaCl) liquid medium with 0.05μg/ml of mercury chloride and 34μg/ml of chloramphenicol. The inoculum was incubated in shaker overnight at 37°C. After cell growth, we measured Optical Density (O.D.) of the cell culture in spectrophotometer at 600 nm wavelength. A standard quantity aliquot of bacterial suspension was taken in six falcons (50ml) with 10 ml of LM liquid medium and then added mercury chloride in order to achieve the concentrations: 0μg/ml, 1 μg/ml; 2.5 μg/ml; 5 μg/ml; 10μg/ml; 20 μg/ml. The samples were incubated"
British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaDynamics_-_-_TEXT.html," proper in Japan.
The sequencing results from our amino acid biobricks came back, and it looks like only MetA was successful. It should be noted that the melting temperatures of the Vf2 and the VR primers are 60°, for cPCR validation of biobricks.
Several new combinations of fluorescent genes, antibiotic resistances, and Keio strains were made. We used the wrong ones last weekend, but now, we are going to test TyrA- +GFP, TrpA- +RFP, MetA- +YFP, and also wildtype with the fluorescent genes. Recently, we switched backbones for the 13M RFP to Psb1C3, for we do not know the provenance of our current psb1C3 with rfp (we suspect it might be on the lac operon, as per the registry guidelines), and we also put the GFP on the psb1C3 instead of a kanamycin resistant plasmid, because we were transforming into kanamycin resistant auxotrophs.
Just for qualitative fun, we are trying to grow the ArgC- and the ArgE- together in M9 to see if anything results, with negative controls for both. We also tried growing a wildtype with a TrpB auxotroph with rfp to look for qualitative red fluorescence. The fluorescence calibration experiment must be done before we can do these sorts of things quantitatively.
We miniprepped 4/6 of the biobricks that we ordered from the registry. We intend on sequencing them in the near future. We, lacking LB amp plates at the time, plated one on an M9 plate, but we now think that the strain the registry sent us is auxotrophic for something. We replated on LB amp after making new plates. The last one that we ordered did not arrive.
Joe made M9 plates with and without 1 mM arginine, and it was found that the two arginine auxotrophs grew as expected.
We bought a fridge for our new office, but have yet to fill it. If anyone with extra snacks reads this and wants to help, our fridge is currently underfilled.
Overnight cultures have been set up to make competent cells out of DH5a, K12, and IGTS8.

The ALHS Biotechnology Program is a two year pathway developed by George Cachianes and co-taught by Julie Reis: Lincoln High Biotech Webpage
This year, five members of the UCSF iGEM team were chosen from students who have completed this two-year class. Read more about David, Derrick, Eric, Sherry and Felicity at the team members page !
Peking University and UCSF iGEM Exchange
Through funding from QB3 and the Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, we have established an exchange program with Peking University. For the past few years, we have welcomed an undergraduate student from PKU to join our team and vice versa. This summer, we had a student from the 2011 PKU iGEM team, JI Weiyue, join us for three months to work with as a part of our team. We also had a former UCSF iGEM member, Helena Viets, travel to Peking University and join the PKU iGEM team.
Returning Team Members

Tumor and DVS evolution versus time
First step : Tumor development according to time
We consider the tumor is non metastatic and its growth is exponential.
Let the tumor have a volume V1 in cm3 at an instant t1.
Let the same tumor, at an instant t2, have a volume V2.
The tumor is considered in exponential growth phase and without metastasis therefore its development equation, Tumor Growth Rate (TGR), is equal to :
Thus, the tumor volume according to the time (V(t)) is equal to :
Finally, knowing the Average volume of a cancerous cell (Vcc) (experimental data), if we regard the tumor as fraught (without cavity or blood vessel),  we can determine that the Number of cancerous cells according to time (Nc(t)), without treatment effect, is equal to :
Back to top
Second step : Development of the tissue vector
The tissue vector is injected to the patient at an instant t, near t2. The Number of injected vectors (Nbi) is 1x10^6. The pulmonary tropism of the vector isn’t perfect, only a Percentage (Pp) goes to the lung. The total number of tissue vector in the body increases, because this vector is bacterial and therefore possesses  a Doubling period (DTB).
Thus we can establish that the tissue vector number in the lungs (Nb(t)) is equal to:
The number of Tissue vectors increases until injection of  doxycycline. F rom then, tissue vectors lysis releases the cell vectors in the lung.
This injection time is not insignificant. Indeed, si if we wait long enough, tissue vectors number is sufficient to eliminate the tumor or at least to significantly reduce it. On the other hand, if we wait too long, a higher dose of doxycycline (and so potentially toxic) is necessary for cell vector release.
Thus we can use modelling to determine the optimal injection time of doxycyline (Tdox).
Back to top
Third step : Release of the cell vector
Once the doxycycline injected, the cell vector is released. The cell vectors number is proportional to the tissue vectors number in the lung. And yet, we know the average value of recombinant phage vectors released by M. avium (Npl) is equal to 100.
We can write cell vectors number at the injection instant (Np(Tdox)) is equal to :

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Planning_-_-_TEXT.html," the LMWP-linked proteins successfully penetrated the stratum corneum and accumulated primarily in the epidermis (Figure 2), whereas the control proteins without LMWP linkage remained on the surface of the skin."" - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p.2725
Nina: This experiment is good in the way that it shows that big protein shuch as BSA (66 kDa) and OVA (45 kDa)fused with CPP can pass via skin.
“Since small basic proteins like protamines are precipitated by SDS, as an assay method we used acidic gels in which basic proteins migrate not only according to their size but also according to their charge. Thus, although small basic proteins can be identified in acidic gels, size calibration of these proteins is not accurate. Identification of specific proteins can be made by using deletion or other mutants to eliminate or change the nature of these proteins.” - An E. coli Gene Coding for a Protamine-Like Protein
Nina: I found this article since I wanted to know more about bacteria expressing protamines and their practical studies. So maybe think about using acidic gels when characterizing protamines, such as in our CPP.
“[...] that can code for a small basic protein directs the synthesis of such a protein in vitro. (We now define the P-protein coding region as the tpr locus for “tRNA followed by protamine-like protein.“) Mutants that lack part of the DNA region coding for the protein fail to direct its synthesis” - An E. coli Gene Coding for a Protamine-Like Protein
“In the first protocol, penetratin is synthesized with an additional N-terminalactivated cysteine, protected by a nitropyridinium group to prevent peptide homodimerization. The cargo is probably released freely in the cytoplasm as a result of disulfide bond breakage in the reductive cytoplasmic milieu. In the second method, the cargo and the vector are chemically synthesized in continuity. In this case, no coupling reaction is necessary.” - Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides p 12 Ülo
Nina: This citation and the following three is interesting since they are focused on CPP. We should read the book in order to get a greater understanding about the CPPs.
It is interesting to know that the cargo can be release in a reductive cytoplasmic environment, thus the disulfides bonds will be reduced.

Saturday, June 30
Part of the team volunteered at the high school Jamboree. We saw many amazing teams with remarkable ideas! Congratulations to all the teams for their hard work over the past semester, and good luck as future iGEMers!
Sunday, July 1
We attempted another test transformation , this time using bought Excel 10ß competent cells. We had both a negative and positive control. We also plated different concentrations of the final solution to see if we were over or under plating. We also used agar plates with ampicillin that Tarun made. We used store bought SOC. The part used was BBa_J04450.
Monday, July 2
The tranformations performed yesterday were successful. Both the positive control and the plaes with our part showed growth. The transformation efficiency was extremely high. We got single colonies on the plates with 50µL and overgrowth on the plates that had 150µL. We will only plate at 50µL from now on.
Due to time constraints, we have decided to synthesize both of our constructs. In parallel to characterization of the synthesized constructs, we are going to assemble both constructs using Gibson assembly. The assembles constructs will differ from the synthesized constructs in that the promoter will be a PoPs device and there will be a fluorescent protein on each. In this way, we can find if the addition of these two characterization parts will affect the functionality of our constructs.
The synthesized constructs were ordered from DNA 2.0 . Pictures of the Gene Designer (DNA 2.0 software) renditions of the three constructs are given below.

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Project#Future#AssemblyLine_-_-_TEXT.html,". A substrate could be hypothetically processed by these sequential proteins, resulting in a molecular, in vivo assembly line in E. coli. Such an assembly line could be optimized, as shown by data provided by the RNA scaffold section. .
The following is a technical diagram of the stepwise modifications and production of piceatannol from tyrosine. The Malonyl-CoA must be added to supplement 4CL:STS as it processes p-coumaric acid..
Experimental Approach
To begin the intricate process of testing and building the enzymatic assembly line in vivo, we gathered the different enzymes and necessary reagents from multiple sources, making international connections in the process. We learned from members of the Chul-Ho Yun that group cytochrome P450 BM3 had been mutated at several points to create seventeen mutants of wild type BM3. In the paper “Generation of the Human Metabolite Piceatannol from the Anticancer-Preventive Agent Resveratrol by Bacterial Cytochrome P450 BM3”, they described the activity and longevity of wild type BM3 as well as seventeen mutants of the enzyme examined in in vitro assays.
According to their literature, BM3 mutant #13 created the most piceatannol per minute per nmol of enzyme, and BM3 mutant #10 had high stability during the in vitro testing. Given the reported differences in stability and vigor among the wild type and two mutant forms of the enzyme, we requested the wild type, mutant #10, and mutant #13 enzymes from the group. We planned to investigate the effects of stability and vigor of BM3 in a novel in vivo application; the enzymes had not been previously tested by the Chul-Ho Yun group in this way. We also hoped to investigate any effect the longevity and vigor of BM3 could have on the vitality of the enzymatic assembly line.
After gathering the four enzymes we would use in our assembly line, we began to tackle the simplest steps first. Since we planned to characterize BM3 while integrating it into the assembly line, we chose to begin testing its ability to synthesize piceatannol from resveratrol in vivo. We needed to discern whether piceatannol would be exported from the cell after production, so we devised an assay to differentiate piceatannol from resveratrol and other cellular products in cell growth medium. Using thin-layer liquid chromatography (TLC), we experimented with different procedures for separating control samples of resveratrol and piceatannol.

3.2 Social influence
As the organizer of this life science summer camp, we invite students from Shandong University and Qingdao Agricultural University to join in the preparation of summer camp. Students from different cities took part in our summer camp. Not only have they learnt a lot of knowledge about synthetic biology, but they also could make full advantages of their strengths, found their personal interests and improved their learning methods. Then we put the summary of this activities on our Wechat Subscription. There are some screenshots.

3.3 Feedback
At the end of the activity, the campers expressed their thanks to us. In this activity, they not only learned a lot, but also made good friends. On the one hand, they broadened their horizons and learned theoretical knowledge, on the other hand, they experienced the operation of molecular experiments for the first time. “So cool!” They were surprised when they saw the DNA belt they extracted.
3.4 Future
We hope more universities can join us to make this summer camp more colorful. We also look forward to training campers to think and solve problems independently rather than guided by us at most time. This will be a challenging and meaningful job for us.

Glasgow,2015,Team:Glasgow#AzureA_-_-_TEXT.html," Ethidium bromide (For EtBr staining method see: Protocols)
Conclusions
Azure A is an easy to use, visible light DNA stain which does not require expensive equipment or biohazard disposal techniques. For routine DNA manipulation techniques such as gel extractions from high copy number plasmids like pSB1C3, Azure A staining is an effective alternative to Ethidium bromide without the need for UV light visualisation.
Glasgow 2015 iGEM team hopes to promote the use of Azure A in order to extend the reach of iGEM, synthetic biology, and molecular biology in general, further into settings where the need for Ethidium bromide and the associated costs may prevent participation, such as high schools and community labs.
Safety and considerations of Azure A
Azure A Chloride's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is available from the supplier; it is not deemed to be hazardous. Azure A solution can be disposed of down a conventional sink. Azure A stained Agarose gels can be disposed of in standard laboratory waste. Standard laboratory safety measures for handling a dye; such as gloves, goggles, lab coat, should be followed when using Azure A. Flames should not be used near to preparation of Azure A/Ethanol solution due to flammability. Azure A solutions will stain clothing and surfaces if spilled. Azure A solution can be removed from surfaces (such as a benchtop or staining tray) with 100% Ethanol and paper towel. NCBE. 2003a.

Optimization
The efficiency of cre-loxp system is extremely vital to our design; it may fluctuate a lot in that the DNA are reversible.
The existing period of arabinose and the concentration of arabinose are two main variables, which we can easily control in our wetlab experiments. We find by modeling prediction that the concentration of arabinose doesn't matter much while the time variable is of importance.
Based on our model, we designed some experiments to test the inversion efficiency. This is the result we got with flow cytometor:
In terms of the overall tendency and some critical points, the result is well in accordance with the modeling prediction: the concentration of arabinose doesn't matter while the time variable is important. The result we got by further detailed analysis, to some extent, verify our model. Then to simplify the experiment procedure with a similar effect we add a feed forward control to the design.

Cellulose Processing & CBDs
Testing the feasibility of microbial cellulose-based biosensors
The University of Edinburgh iGEM 2015 team is creating a paper-based biosensor to detect purity of and contaminants in illicit drugs. In an effort to increase the applications of the proof-of-concept biosensor, the team wanted to incorporate microbial cellulose as an alternative to paper. This could decrease the cost of the biosensor as well as making the disposal easier.
For the collaboration, the Edinburg IGEM 2015 used the BBa_K321357, which is an sfGFP fused to the cellulose binding domain CBDcex transcriptionally activated by Lacl. Since the CBDcex is attached to a fluorescence, sfGFP, the strength of the binding affinity is correlated with the absorbance level. The y-axis measures the absorbance in relative fluorescent unit while the x-axis is the time incubation. Although there is large error bar, there is a distinguishable difference between the binding affinity of the CBD onto the cellulose unprocessed and processed sheet. The high absorbance for the processed sheet indicates that the CBD binds more effectively than the unprocessed sheet. This experiment will be repeated in the near future.
By using microbial cellulose that our team provided, the University of Edinburgh team was able to check the binding affinities of a cellulose binding domain (CBD) to the cellulose to see whether microbial cellulose-based biosensors are feasible. Our bioHYDRA project involved testing processed and unprocessed cellulose, and we sent the Edinburgh team a sample of each. This allowed the Edinburgh team to see if there is an advantage to the processing for their applications, and, since our future work includes expressing CBDs on spore coats, the processed sheets will be better for our applications as well. The CBD they tested was BBa_K1321357, which is sfGFP fused to CBDcex and driven by LacI. They chose this BioBrick because it was in the distribution kit and"

PART VALIDATION
 
We validated our parts by showing that they work. We performed an ELISA Assay testing for properly folded insulin, and detected expression of Cytoplasmic Proinsulin, Cytoplasmic Winsulin, Ecotin Proinsulin and YncM Winsulin in the cell fractions we expected them to be.
 
We also performed a glucose uptake assay to identify if the insulin and Winsulin we produced was functional.
 
Multiple insulin-sensitive cell lines were tested for glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation upon treatment with human insulin and with our insulin analogues. It was found that Ecotin-Proinsulin, Cytoplasmic-Proinsulin and YncM-Winsulin all induced an increase in glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation, therefore are stimulating the insulin-receptor and functioned as we expected!
See our Results page for more information
 
COLLABORATION

Controls: For our controls we used uninduced cells.

Experiment name: p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) Assay
What experiment will show: This experiment will show whether our enzyme is catalytically active. p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) is a substrate that contains an ester bond resembling the ester bond broken in PET degradation. PETase, and other PET-degrading enzymes are expected to break the ester bond in pNPB. When the bond is broken, the resulting product emits a wavelength of 405nm that can be detected by a plate reader set to read absorbances at 405nm. If our enzyme is catalytically active, we expect this experiment to show an increase of absorbance at 405nm after adding pNPB substrate.
Reason for doing experiment: To show that our enzyme is catalytically active.
Materials: As adapted from 2012 UC Davis iGEM’s LC Cutinase pNPB assay: pNPB buffer (should be made and used in fumehood due to acetonitriles toxicity)
10mM pNPB in acetonitrile
1:4:95 ratio of acetonitrile pNPB solution, 100% ethanol and 50mM Tris-HCL (pH 8)
Plate reader
24 well plate
Cell lysate
Experiment methods: Set up 24 well plate by adding cell lysate and controls. Add the pNPB buffer immediately before running the plate reader. Run the plate at 37C for 10mins inside the plate reader, taking measurements of 405nm absorbance every 15 seconds. 405nm is the absorbance of pNPB substrate that has been broken by an esterase enzyme, so a significant read at 405nm absorbance indicates enzyme is breaking ester bonds in the substrate.
Controls: For each induced cell lysate sample, we added either lysis buffer (no pNPB substrate) or pNPB buffer. Additionally, we had uninduced controls with pNPB buffer, and a blank well with only pNPB buffer.
Experiment name: pH optimization for PETase E. coli
What experiment will show: How well PETase E. coli grows at different pHs
Reason for doing experiment: PETase is most active at higher pHs, so we want to determine a happy pH medium between E. Coli growth and enzyme activity.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Peru_-_-_TEXT.html," the use of biotechnology goes beyond the cultivation of transgenic crops, but used as tools in modern plant breeding, due to its ability to identify agronomic traits in the gene (PeruBiotec).
There is course of Biotechnology at Universidad Nacional La Molina, it is considered a forefront course relying on national project’s financing, , participation of international universities in addition to working together with research institutes and private companies.
The Peruvian Association for the development of biotechnology in Peru under the name PERUBIOTEC, is a non-governmental, non-profit association that aims to promote and disseminate modern biotechnology and its variants in the fields: scientific, cultural, informational, educational technical research, investment promotion, management of acquisition of patents and licenses or administration that aim to develop technical cooperation actions in the area of conventional biotechnology and modern biotechnology, including the sustainable use of natural resources and biodiversity conservation.
To this purpose, the Association will take scientific positions on behalf of biotechnology; disseminate the principles of modern biotechnology on all applicable fields; will lead programs, consultancy and development projects that include biotechnology, designed to enhance the added value of agriculture, livestock, forestry and aquaculture products on the internal market and make them more competitive in foreign markets. The Association also advise the public institutions and the state in the implementation of development programs involving biotechnology, as well as proposals for the reform of law, that benefit the health, education, industry, mining, to support production chains, agricultural production and forestry, aquaculture and fisheries, among others; conservation of natural resources, improve the environment and ensure sustainable development of each region.
According to the public opinion, a public misinformed, new technology can cause anxiety leading to rejection afterwards. Though, as Biotechnology supposedly, has a potential to save lives, employ citizens, boost the economy ,enlarge the biodiversity, enhance the use of the land and much more, would you reject the pure and simple technology or would try to find as much information as you could to form your final opinion?
Experience gained from many discussions with opponents of biotechnology shows that a significant sector of the opposition believes blindly in the opinion of the leaders of activist groups. If we summarize the problem in a sentence, such as the role of biotechnology in the agricultural field in Peru, it can be said that for many people farming today is the same as that of their grandparents, and that biotechnology came to destroy that alleged natural order (PeruBiotec).

These plasmids were subjected to restriction digestion by EcoR I and Pst I enzymes to look for the correct insert size. Biobrick specific primers (VF and VR primers) were used for PCR amplification of the insert, we borrowed the primer sequences from the iGEM registry. We also sequenced some of the plasmids to make sure that there are no errors in nucleotide sequence and we have the correct promoter. In all, our sequencing results indicated that we had successfully cloned the two tet promoters, so we decided to proceed with promoter activity assays for those two.

We transformed our new plasmids into DH5αPro cells, which constitutively express TetR and LacR (the cell has genome integrated copies of tetR and lacR) and in TOP10 cells (tetR and lacR negative cells). Single colony from each plate was inoculated and culture was allowed to grow overnight in LB medium with chloramphenicol.  Next day, cells were re-inoculated in fresh LB medium having varying inducer (anhydrotetracyline, aTc) concentration. The inducer concentration was 0, 100 and 200 ng/ml aTc.

On our website we have made it clear as to individual attributions of work as well as including the contributions and aid our mentors provided. Please see our attributions here .
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
One of our team goals this year was to expand the library of parts available for use in single-celled eukaryotes, particularly the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Combined with the awesome power of yeast genetics, working with eukaryotes provides additional functionality and complexity not available with many bacterial species. To this end, we have submitted an arsenal of parts to the iGEM headquarters for use in yeast. We have synthesized and delivered a variety of Alpha-responsive promoters and constitutive promoters in the PSB1C3 backbone. Specific part details as well as catalog number can be found on our iGEM parts registry page and on our wiki .
Silver Medal Requirements
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
We verified and classified our parts/devices by means of flow cytometry analysis. We validated the expression strength of our promoters by creating circuits in which GFP was behind our promoters and running the circuits under flow cytometry. By measuring the GFP outputs of each promoter, we can determine the expression strength of each promoter. Results for each individual part can be found on our wiki .

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at"

The major differences between the results and our theoretical values was the later maximum GFP concentration and the difference between the measured maximum and the theoretical maximum for 9×10-9moles/dm-3 of miRNA. In order to delay the peak in GFP concentration the rate of RNA decay had to be decreased. We also introduced a term for GFP degradation, to account for the peak in fluorescence. We then tried to fit the data by changing the parameters with these ideas in mind. The new values for these parameters were:
kdecay ≈ 3×10-4
GFPdecay ≈ 1×10-5

Project Digestion
1. Introduction
Insect bodies are covered with hard integument mainly composed of chitin. To decompose the integument, we used ChiA gene, which encodes secreted chitinase. In order to measure the chitinase activity of the culture supernatant, we evaluated the effects of the medium and cell growth.
ChiA gene we used is derived from Streptomyces avermitilis. S. avermitilis is a kind of prokaryotic bacteria and they produce chitinase.[2][3] We extracted this gene from S. avermitilis and introduced it into Escherichia coli. This gene also encodes a secretion-signal sequence so that the chitinase will be secreted without the cell lysis of the E.coli.
For characterizing the chitinase activity, we used the DNS assay, which is the method to determine the quantity of reducing sugar. In our assay, we determine the quantity of N-acetylglucosamine in a culture supernatant. Since the other materials in the supernatant can react with DNS, it was needed to examine if this assay is available for the quantitative characterization of chitinase activity. We also made a model to assess the enzyme activity in the supernatant from the pre-experiment.
2. Method
Construction
We designed the following construction to enable the secretion of the chitinase, ChiA1. This gene is regulated by a strong lactose promoter, BBa_R0011. We"

Optical Density
Optical Density of a substance is defined as the amount of light which it allows to pass through. The higher the optical density, the lesser the light would pass through or the more the light is absorbed. It also refer to the refraction of substance. It can be measured as a logarithmic ratio of intensity of transmitted light and the intensity of incident light.
Photocaging
Photo-removable or photo-labile protecting groups are molecules that are covalently linked to a target molecule to inhibit its activity. Upon application of light treatment, the target molecule is released from the caged structure, thus activating its function. The process of inhibiting (caging) the function of a molecule through a protection group (which can be removed by light) is called as photocaging.[ 1 ]
Plasmid
A small, circular DNA structure that is separate from the cell's genome and can replicate independently from the host cell. Plasmids are used in the laboratory to deliver specific DNA sequences into a cell.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method to analyze a short sequence of DNA (or RNA). PCR is used to amplify selected sections of DNA or RNA. It requires:
Two ""primers"", short single-stranded DNA sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the DNA stretch to be copied; and also to assign the starting position for the polymerase to bind on.
An enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of DNA, reading its code and assembling a copy.
A pile of DNA building blocks (dNTPs) that the polymerase needs as basic building blocks of the DNA.
Its application includes genotyping, cloning, mutation detection, sequencing, microarrays, forensics, and paternity testing.
Propeptide
Many secretory proteins and peptides are synthesized as inactive precursors that in addition to signal peptide cleavage undergo post-translational processing to become biologically active poly-peptides. Precursors are usually cleaved at sites composed of single or paired basic amino acid residues by members of the subtilisin/kexin-like pro-protein convertase (PC) family. In mammals, seven members have been identified, with furin being the one first discovered and best characterized.[ 2 ]
Proteolytic Activity
The process of hydrolysis of proteins into simpler, soluble substances (polypeptides or amino acids) by the action of enzymes caused by enzymes called proteases.
Recombinant DNA
A vector containing a foreign DNA is called recombinant DNA.

At the Giant Jamboree, we received a gold medal and an Interlab Study Award. We also won the Overgrad Best Parts Collection.
Protocols & Recipes
During our laboratory work several protocols and recipes were applied. To make sure that the work is documented in a systematical and reproducible manner, we have made a list of the procedures and added it to this page.
Protocols
Biolector Measurements
Cultures of 2 ml LB were inoculated and incubated at 37 °C and 350 RPM O/N. The O/N cultures were diluted 15000 folds (first by a 100 dilution in salt water and then by additional 150 folds in LB media). The diluted cultures were distributed in triplicates of 1.5 mL in a BioLector flower plate and were placed in the Biolector. The BioLector was set to incubate at 37 °C and 1000 RPM ensuring optimal mass transfer (oxygen).
The experiment ran for 12.5 hours with measurements of cell density and fluorescence in each well every 5 minutes. The cell density was measured by light scatter at 620 nm and fluorescence was measured at 520 nm with excitation at 488 nm.
DNA Ligation
Each reaction of 20 μL contained:
1 μL T4 ligase*
2 μL T4 ligase buffer*
The cut DNA fragments
Sterile Milli-Q water up to 20 μL
The DNA was mixed in a molar ratio of between 3:1 and 5:1 (insert:vector), and the volume of DNA was dependent on the concentration of the fragments and the number of ligations requiring the same fragments. The reactions were incubated at RT for 2-3 hours. To assess the background vector self-ligation rate, we always included controls with no insert added. Furthermore we included controls with no insert, and no ligase to estimate the amount of uncut vector.  The ligation products were immediately used to transform"
