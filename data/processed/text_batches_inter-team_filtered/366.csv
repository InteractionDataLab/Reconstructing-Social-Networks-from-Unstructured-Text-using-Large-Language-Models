Circuit Abstract
A potentiostat is an instrument capable of maintaining a voltage bias between electrodes. The bias encourages diffusion but more importantly the transfer of electrons which are recorded, and ultimately related to the species present in solution. When faced with the decision to buy or build our potentiostat, we found that the available solutions did not fit our needs. We decided to create our own. We developed an abstract and found a microcontroller with a 16-bit ADC (13 bit ENOB). We then designed, modeled, built and tested our potentiostat under a range of conditions. We went on to create a catalog of prototypes. The final product is the OliView potentiostat: The first arduino-compatible potentiostat to incorporate a 16-bit ADC.
Hardware
The CheapStat is a budget friendly device developed at UC Santa Barbara several years ago. We aspired to build this circuit and modify the software for our purposes, however, the microcontroller on the CheapStat was controlled predominantly in machine level code. The learning curve seemed unreasonable considering our deadline, so we had to find another solution.
We were forced to build our own. With a clean slate, we wanted to create a device that would fulfill our needs, but also be welcomed by the iGEM community. We aimed to match the performance of the CheapStat, but also improve in three ways: increase the effective range of the instrument, decrease the cost of the circuit, and convert to an arduino-friendly microcontroller. In this capacity, we have succeeded.
We modeled our circuit after the CheapStat, eventually including more than 30 components. We went on to create five iterative prototypes. The schematic and board files for the various prototypes are all available here .

Future experiments
For L. rhamnosus
Since our desired host is L. rhamnosus, we have designed some parts to assemble future constructs for this specific host. This is the same “Plan A” for E. coli but adapted to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, since it is a natural probiotic organism. Plan A consists of producing the soluble form gp130 attached to novel signal peptides for secretion to the media. This proteins will form a dimer with sgp80 found in the extracellular media, which will then attach to IL-6 and form a stable trimer capable of blocking interleukin inflammatory signalization.  The construct is codon optimized for L. rhamnosus GG, it has promoters, RBS and terminators that have been used before for L. rhamnosus. It also contains two restriction sites, between the iGEM prefix and suffix, to ligate the Lactobacillus ORI site.
Soluble forms of both receptor IL-6 subunits are present in human blood, in general, soluble receptors for several cytokines have been detected in different body fluids, these are believed to help modulate cytokine response by binding the ligand and thereby reducing its bioavailability. Since the combination of soluble gp130 and sgp80 can act as an antagonist versus the cells with membrane-bound receptor (IL-6R) [1] , the Plan A strategy was developed as a first approach towards developing our psychobiotic.
The system is first regulated by a spaCBA promoter, which allows the expression of the nsrR repressor protein (of PyeaR promoter), and then the cassette regulates the expression of mutated-sgp80 and sgp130 with the PyeaR promoter, after it senses nitrosative stress. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and mCherry will help corroborate expression of both systems. iLOV will be attached to the Pbad-nsrR system and mCherry to the PyeaR-gp80-gp130 system. Both glycoproteins (gp) have a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to themselves for purification.

They must take care of each colony, all while creating smoke to keep the bees passive. At the IV State Beekeeping Forum, emphasis was made on what a laborious activity this job is.
UN risk assessment researcher, Maria Mercedes Roca, Ph.D. , mentioned how economic activities are central to the functioning of our interconnected world. Beekeeping must be propelled to make for economic gains, especially in countries such as Mexico where a large part of its economy is based on the primary sector. Mr. Manuel Ramirez
also referred to this topic; Our country plays a significant role as a honey trader, with most of our exports making their way to the EU. However, there are several obstacles. EU imports can have neither genetically modified content nor most antibiotics. One can’t add anything to a product that would alter its sensorial characteristics without expecting a negative impact. Dr. David de Jong considered we should check what amount of AMPs make their way to honey products, aspect revised in the IV State Beekeeping Forum with Dr. Sóstenes Rafael Rodríguez where we ensured AMP’s are not a problem when it comes to EU honey exportation analysis. Since the national Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) is also strict on contaminants, Guillermo Rodriguéz told us, a natural product against foulbrood is needed both nationally and internationally.
As explained in the chronology of the aforementioned facts, while the project was being developed and basing us on the comments and concerns expressed by professionals, we were able to ensure that our product would not impede exportations and importations of honey. The world honey market reported historical records during 2015, with volumes of operation exceeding 2.3 billion dollars1 and it represents substantial revenues not only for Mexico but countries like China, Argentina, Spain, etc. More than ensuring that highest AMP concentrations in honey would not result in an exportation problem, our project fosters to make exportations go up since there will be no problem with antibiotic residues in honey when beekeepers have to deal with diseases.
The economic part of our project is also made up of the development of the entrepreneurial area where the implications for the sale of the final product are analyzed.
Our project will make sure Foulbrood no longer generates huge economic losses (by killing bees and necessitating antibiotics) but instead become a small nuisance in an otherwise thriving industry.

Secretion
We got our new primer for a signal peptide+mCherry. We performed a PCR reaction and cleaned from gel.
We amplified the signal peptide of aprE gene from the gBlock of our gene with the signal peptide. We cut it with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes, and ligated with the linearized pSB1C3 plasmid from the 2015 DNA Distribution Kit. We performed colony PCR and sent the positive colonies for sequencing.
We transformed the ligation product into TOP10. We performed colony PCR and got 3 positive colonies.
We transformed pDR111+signal peptide+mCherry plasmid into B.subtilis PY79 and performed colony PCR.

Expression
We performed an activity experiment with different lysate concentrations.  We got different slopes and decided to measure the results according to the slopes (the derivative of the graph).
PCR to 3α-HSD from the gBlock with the original sequence (RFC10 compatible), with pSB1C3 prefix and suffix primers.  We concluded that the optimal temperature is 60°C.
Restriction reaction of linearized pSB1C3 and 3α-HSD with the original sequence (RFC10 compatible) with EcoRI and PstI enzymes.
We produced a calibration curve for NADPH using various gains on the fluorescence plate reader in order to find the optimal gain.  We realized that until now we had been using the wrong one.  Based on our results, there is a secondary reaction, so in future activity experiments we will add DHT only after 30 minutes.

Cofactor
We tried to use the Biovision NADP+/NADPH Assay kit to check the levels of NADPH inside our genetically modified cells.  The kit protocol had to be modified since it is geared towards use for tissue cells and other eukaryotic cells.      However, despite our changes, we received no results.  We then tried increasing the time in the extraction buffer, but still received no results.  We sent e-mails to various academics whom had published articles indicating use of the kit, asking which modifications they made to the protocol.

2 Simulation results are shown in two steps:
2.1 No factors added to determine “k”:
This model describes how microfluidics Gaussian distribution plate works when we use this device to test C.elegans’ preference in the plate.
Gaussian distribution is very common in nature and important in statistics. It can reflect the normal state of some phenomena. In this experiment, we use Gaussian distribution plate to see C.elegans’ distributions among channels with the presence of some factors.
Compared with classical Galton board, we use C.elegans as the “ball”. When a worm is choosing a direction at the cross, its previous choice may influence its current choice.
Depend on this, we introduce an important parameter “k” (range[0,1]). The “k” is defined as the absolute value of the differences between probability of two direction choices. It means that the greater the ”k” is, the greater the influence of previous choice on the current one. When “k” is zero, the simulation model is more like Gaussian distribution.
We count the number of choices and calculate the parameter “k” without factors (attractive or repellent factor at one side) at first. Assuming that “k” does not change when we add attractive or repellent factors.Then this model can be used to stimulate C.elegans preference when adding factors with determined “k”. Meanwhile, we can analyze the amount of C.elegans attracted or repelled by the factors via introducing another parameter kxy (range[0,1]).
All parameters set above are depended on the assumption that the influence of parameters are proportional to the probability they affect the C.elegans' choice. For example, we defined “k” as the association between cross choices. If ""k"" equals “0”, meaning that there is no association between cross choices. If “k” equals “1”, the next cross choice is totally determined by previous choice, the result will show poly distribution"

UCC iGEM 2017
Engagement Summary:
The team contacted two groups in our community that would be impacted by our project; local dairy farmers and a micro-distiller. By contacting local dairy farmers we were granted an insight into how our project be applied in their work. A biosensor that can detect antibiotics precisely, quickly and inexpensively would take great pressure off farmers, who would worry that their home tests were inadequate, causing penalties from regulatory authorities. Our goal to create an easily accessible biosensor for antibiotic contamination in food products such a milk would provide a benefit to producers in less developed or regulated countries to test their produce with an ultimate goal to reduce antibiotics in the human food chain. With methanol poisoning still a worldwide cause of death and disability, producing a similarly inexpensive and accessible biosensor for methanol could save lives. Both deemed our projects ethical and of potential benefit regarding regulations and healthcare.
Collaboration
We skyped iGEM teams in Newcastle and Exeter, and exchanged information about cell free systems and our methods with EFPL Switzerland.
3rd year Pharmacy and Biochemistry information session on iGEM
Eoin and Ellen gave a talk to the 3rd year UCC Pharmacy students, and Chloe and Dan talked to the 3rd year UCC Biochemistry students about iGEM. The aim of this information session was to inform the students about UCC iGEM and the possibility to take part next year. We explained our project in great detail, explaining concepts like synthetic biology and biosensors. After the talk we took questions. Overall this experience was very beneficial to us as it gave us experience presenting in front of larger audiences and tested our ability to explain details of our project. On the other hand it was beneficial for the 3rd year students as it informed them about summer science research projects and encouraged them to get involved
Outreach and Community Engagement

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Construction
PCR
We use primer pBad F / pBad R to amplify pBad and standard F / plu1537 R for CDS plu1537.
Seamless assembly
We used seamless assembly as our assembly method so restriction digestion and T4 ligation can be avoided. Detailed protocol and instruction for primer design can be seen in our Protocol. By this way prefix sequence, pBad, CDS plu1537 and front twenty bases of mCherry sequence can be ligated seamlessly.

plu1537 R (R, 5’-3’): CGGACTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATTATTAGCTTACAATCATATATTC
Transformation and confirmation
After seamless assembly, standard plasmid pSB1C3 containing plu1537 gene was transformed into E.coli DH5α. When single colony appeared on the LB plate, we picked out 10 colonies, respectively, as our template for bacteria solution PCR. In order to avoid the appearance of false positive clones, we used VF/VR as the universal primers. The positive clone and its corresponding raw bacteria solution were stored and samples were sent to do DNA sequencing.

PLASMID CONSTRUCTION
5-μl samples of the single (L1) and double enzyme (L2) digestion products for plu1537-device were loaded onto a 1% BioRad Ready Agarose Mini Gel, then subjected to AGE. See Protocol for AGE parameters. We use PstI for single digestion, XbaI and PstI for double digestion, then products were determined by AGE analysis. The DNA size standards were the DL5,000 DNA Marker (M2; TaKaRa, Cat#3428A). Bands were visualized with a Shanghai Peiqing JS-380A Fluorescence Imager.                 It can be clearly seen the plu1537 is constructed into the pSB1C3 backbone"

Mass action kinetics
Mass action kinetics is the assumption that the rate of reaction is proportional to concentration of the reactants. We chose to create a mass action kinetics model as we could use relatively few parameters. Reducing the number of parameters, whilst keeping the model representative of the system, made it easier to understand the effect of varying each parameter. We built the model in MATLAB first, and later ported it to JavaScript to make it a better design tool for the biologists and better communicate how the model works.
Graph interactivity
We spent a long time reviewing previous teams models. A problem we found was that most models weren’t communicated in a way that was engaging and easy to understand. We’ve tried to explain our model in a way that someone with no experience in modeling could understand.
We’ve used interactive graphs on this page - when you get to them you can drag the sliders to change parameters and see how they affect the system.
We initially ported our model to a webpage so the design team could try out new stuff when they were designing our toehold switches. This turned out to be very useful for both of us. We decided to make it look a lot nicer and improve its compatibility with different browsers so we could put it on the wiki.

2) Self Destructive Plasmid (SDP)
In order for our signal to be reset the signal plasmid must be able to self-destruct. The Self Destructive Plasmid (SDP) is degigned to test this functionality. It contains a GFP message, inducible endonuclease gene, and restriction site of this endonuclease. The plasmid is able to degrade itself after receiving the destructing signal.
3) Delay device
It is important that there is a time delay between the time that the signal plasmid is received and its destruction. This gives the cell time to pass the signal plasmid to other cells. If the signal plasmid is degraded too fast after it is received, our relay race would end before reaching the finish line. We therefore constructed a device which is capable of delaying the expression of the endonuclease.
Some potential applications for this project are
Grasping of bacterial communication - the communication between bacteria using DNA can advance through bacterial networks, and in this sense our project would allow to send multiple messages in a single DNA, thereby to better understand those bacterial communication networks.
Understanding of bacterial antibiotic resistance - these days, bacterial infections are often treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, bacteria have the tendancy to pass antibiotic resistance to other bacteria through the process of conjugation , thus making the antibiotics useless. Using our project, it might be possible for future researchers to better understand the mechanism by which antibiotic resistance passes among bacterial colonies, and perhaps even inhibit it
To test one condition and return to the original state without killing the cell or changing any of its previous genetic and physiological characteristics
To generate a pulse in the expression of a certain gene
To control the amplitude of the pulse created by the plasmid
The Team
This is the second year, TUDelft participates in the iGEM competition.  The group consists of 6 students, 3 instructors and a lot of advisors from TUDelft willing to help out and think with us when it is necessary.

To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be 360 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 837 bp long.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes for cut-check.
WESTERN BLOTTING
After cloning GadE into pET45-b successfully, we did Western Blot experiment through  N-terminal located His Tag in proteins, so we managed to show the production of required proteins.
FUNCTIONAL ASSAY
To understand if the proteins we produced are functional, we designed and performed  a functional assay. We incubated these two types of bacteria in liquid culture for 13 hours at 37 C; pET45-GadE plasmid  containing BL21 bacteria and another BL21 bacteria which contains only pET45-b plasmid for negative control. At 13. our, we added 100 mM IPTG into these liquid cultures. By doing this, we removed the suppression on GadE protein expression. After adding IPTG, we incubated 3 hours more at 37 C.
We prepared LB mediums with different pH values to show produced GadE proteins’ functionality. These LB mediums’ pH values are respectively 7, 5, 3,5; 2,5 and 2. We added thebacteria whichis incubated for 16 hours into LB mediums at the rate of 1:9. This means, for each pH value we added 0.5 ml liquid culture into 4.5 ml LB medium. We also added 1.5 mM Glutamat in each mix and incubated the final mix at 37 C. We made spectrophotometric measurement in 600 nm periodically for the samples that we incubated. Thus we observed how long the bacteria survives in different pH values.
The measurement results are shown below.

iGEM conference
There used to be several iGEM conference before the final. This year, SYSU-China participated the 2014 iGEM Conference organized by National Chiao Tung University in August 3, 2014. Five members, Mingxuan Zhang, Runwen Yao, Wei Tang, Jianhua Zeng, Dengwen Lai presented. This conference provide a platform for us to exchange ideas and experiment experiences.
Our team prepared a poster a presentation for the conference, and we successfully introduced our ideas and designs to the teams presented. Our project attracted several teams’ attention, like YMU, NCTU_Formosa, BIT, etc. We argued about some doubts in our project and this helped us to better our project. Moreover, we better understood many teams’ designs during the discussion about their project.
Apart from academic exchange, we also made a small survey about the laboratory condition of some teams. We found that the teams in Taiwan usually have better laboratory condition than mainland. Colleges in Taiwan are more willing to offer independent laboratories and funds to their teams.

Oscillator System
We plan oscillations using western blots and densitometry analysis to track the different phosphorylation states of KaiC. In order to synchronize a population of cells, we used M9 minimal media with no carbon supplements in order to limit the ATP provided to the E.coli cells. This shock was conducted for both one and six hours (See results).
 
In addition to examining oscillations of our KaiABC biobrick, we also aimed to optimize these oscillations by altering the concentrations of KaiA, which is driven under an L-rhamnose inducible promoter. The input to output ratio of KaiA was first investigated using a 10 fold gradient of L-rhamnose concentrations. We assayed the amount of KaiA produced using Bradford assay and western blots. We estimated the correct concentrations of L-rhamnose as well as the time of induction data from the Paris-Bettencourt 2014 team. Induction was completed for 10 hours. We additionally conducted a time-course of induction for 16 hours in order to determine the saturation point of KaiA, and to examine the degradation rate of KaiA after removal of the inducer from the synchronization/shock in M9 minimal media.
 
Read-Out System
We plan to assay the read-out system by putting together pMC002 or pMC003 with the KaiC phosphomimetics pMC004-7. pMC004-7 exhibit different phosphorylation states of KaiC, essentially portraying a snapshot of KaiC throughout its oscillations in the KaiABC system. We will pair each of these phosphomimetics with pMC002, containing the master regulator RpaA, its activator SasA, and a response regulator RpaB (the function of this has not been clearly characterized yet). We will also pair each of the phosphomimetics with pMC003, exhibiting the same factors RpaA, RpaB, and SasA with the addition of CikA, a negative regulator of RpaA. We will assay the activation and deactivation of RpaA by measuring the fluorescence of GFP under a plate reader. Given that the LVA-Stop tagged GFP is directly downstream the circadian kaibc promoter, we expect differences in activation/deactivation of RpaA to"

This Club taught students the key concepts in molecular biology and practical lab activities to use living organisms, such as bacteria, to modify a product or process for a specific use. The activities given in the Club were microbiology, prokaryotic cellular cultures, bacterial transformation, DNA purification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and electrophoresis techniques.
We had the opportunity to help researchers and staff of the Club by preparing everything the students were going to need to make the scheduled activities mentioned above. We provided them with lab materials such as Petri dishes, culture media, competent cells, and GFP and RFP vectors so they could proceed with the activities.
On the last day, there was a space scheduled in the closure of the event called “Programs for an approach to science in Mexico”. Throughout the week we related to Oscar Pineda-Catalan and Sonia Hernández, both instructors from the University of Chicago. They showed interest in our team and were amazed by the social impact we had been making with beekeepers. For this reason, we were invited to talk to students in the closure of the Club “Material Science: it looks like magic, but is real”.
In this Club, we presented who we were, what we were working on, and how synthetic biology has led us to contribute something to the beekeeping field. For us, this was a great opportunity because we wanted to wake up youth's curiosity by introducing them to the synthetic biology field and also inspire them to participate in programs that offer an approach to science in Mexico.
iGEM as LIFE
At this point of our Education and Public Engagement section, we have already done activities that involved beekeepers and people completely unrelated to science. In this case, we wanted to have a different approach to include people of different ages. We discovered that adults and beekeepers had a great response
to technologies and that they were open-minded to learn new things. For this reason, we wanted to try this teaching method in a distinct sector. We wanted to reach the learning community which led us to get close to it by looking for ways to get involved with young people. After establishing our plan on how we could achieve this, we found the LiFE department at our university and asked for information about it.

In a later period, the theses of the Leuven theologian Cornelius Jansenius provoked a large and heated controversy both inside and outside the Church. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, K.U.Leuven was an important training centre for Roman Catholic intellectuals from Protestant countries. At the end of the Age of Enlightenment , in 1783, the chemist Pieter Jan Minckelers discovered the suitability of coal gas for lighting. In the nineteenth century, at the instigation of Pope Leo XIII, K.U.Leuven became an important centre of Thomist philosophy .
Not all has been trouble-free, though, in the university's illustrious history. It has had its share of difficulties during the various social and political upheavals in this region from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. More recently, the two World Wars of the twentieth century deeply scarred the university. In 1914, the University Hall with its precious library was set in flames by German troops and 300,000 books were reduced to ashes. Afterwards, an international solidarity campaign with a major American contribution helped construct a new library on the present Ladeuzeplein . Unfortunately, this library was burned down in 1940 during the Second World War and this time only 15,000 of its 900,000 volumes were saved. Since then, the university library , and in fact the entire university, has undergone a thorough reconstruction.
The university is located in Flanders , the Dutch-speaking northern part of Belgium. With the Dutch language's steady rise to renewed prominence, 1968 saw the university split into two new universities. The French-speaking Université Catholique de Louvain moved to the newly built campus in Louvain-la-Neuve . The Dutch-speaking Katholieke Universiteit Leuven remained in the historic town of Leuven.
The Present
Procession of Togati
Such a rich history of nearly six hundred years has provided K.U.Leuven with its own dynamic international dimension. Today, international co-operation is regarded as essential for a modern university. Top-level research is judged according to international standards and implies interaction, co-operation, and exchange, both of researchers and results. As such, K.U.Leuven is a charter member of the League of European Research Universities , and European surveys rank K.U.Leuven among the top ten European universities in terms of its scholarly output. Likewise with regard to teaching, several quality surveys demonstrate that K.U.Leuven stands on par with internationally respected institutions"

While the phage purification team was working out a kink in their cesium chloride gradient, we focused on modeling the relationship between capsid size and plaque size. Then once the cesium chloride gradient was perfected, we performed another round of mutagenesis, hoping that we would now be able to see mutant T7 bacteriophage.

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," were unable to grow.
The gels of the PCR products that we have been getting lately have not been working properly. We think that there is a problem with the buffer due to how many times it has been reusued, or possibly by the new TBE that was recently made.
-Jacob
August 16
The supposed metA constructs still appears unable to complement a metA knockout. It has been suggested that the concentration of metA may have been too high, and this would have led to a severe detriment to the cell, and it has also been suggested that the IPTG, being a rather old stock, was no longer good. Another step that we are going to take is to see if the expression of the construct can be seen on an sds page under induction.
Despite, or perhaps because of this failure, we are moving on, trying to make new constructs that will be used for tunability. The YFP has yet to give us a solid band, so we are trying to move it into the psb1c3 plasmid in case there are some plasmid specific sequences that were giving us poor results. The ligation and transformation has been done, and we are waiting for colonies. The PCR products necessary for the gibson assembly of the GFP-IPTG-TrpA gene were also all available, and that gibson assembly has been done. However, due to the failure of several gels, there was very little product left, and PCR purification would likely result in unusuable quantities, so we tried a Gibson assembly with the straight PCR product, and we will see if it works.
All of the parts necessary for the assembly of the kill switch plasmid have been successfully PCR'd, but several of the parts fall victim to the same caveat as that of the previously discussed products. That being said, we tried it anyways,and will check for colonies tomorrow.
The TBE that we were using for the gels has not been working for anyone in the lab, although it has been suggested that that may simply because people don't change their buffers. The TAE gels work fine.
Another PCR was done to generate some of the other parts required for assembly of other parts. The new forward primer for the arabinose promoter does not seem to be working, although the old one worked well. We recently ran out of phusion polymerase, and have resorted to using an eclectic mix of collected polymerases in our PCR box.
A cPCR of the colonies with the MinC protein with the Sce VME intein showed that the gene for the intein was present"
METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," and pre-combined constructs     such as devices and systems. Availability of combined constructs is     important to the researchers as combining individual bio-bricks one     at a time will be very time consuming. These previously merged constructs,     serve as the repository for puzzle and they can be used for different     purposes. Up to date the largest and most trustworthy source, for synthetic     biology and its components, is iGEM’s parts registry. In 2010, iGEM     provided over 1000 parts that have initiated many projects. Having more     atomic parts available in the iGEM’s repository, will lead to the design     of more complex and robust constructs, and we would have a better chance     to design different constructs for unique purposes. Also, for the parts     that are already available, extra steps needs to be taken for the quality     control and surveillance of these products. The quality control of the     information for the parts is essential for the future of iGEM and synthetic     biology. Even though we have found pre-determined RFC standards useful     and included those to our standardized template, some individual parts     still requires re-organization of the information as RFC standards alone     for the functionality of parts, does not satisfy the needs for wet lab     biologists.
Without a question there is an urgent need to build a distinct and     specific database well organized with its own standards for synthetic     biology; however, development of such a database is not an easy task.

Table 2: The above table simply depicts information about possessors     of parts and their contact information and the popularity of the parts     for groups. Parameters heading, refers distinctive experimental details     unique to the usage of parts which should be decided by groups.
Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.

November Festival and Open Campus at Kyoto University
Kyoto University has some big events for people out of our university. We iGEM Kyoto joined two of those events: November Festival(NF) and Open Campus.
November Festa. is one of the biggest college festivals in West-Japan. It is held in 4 days, and many people of all ages come not only from Kyoto City but also from far away. In this festa. we presented what our team does in iGEM 2011 with a poster. We also explained what synthetic biology and iGEM are.
Kyoto University's Open Campus was held in August 9 & 10. Many high school students visited our univ. We talked with them about iGEM as one of the activities which college students can join. We believe that some of them will join iGEM in the future.
Science Agora
""Science agora"" is the biggest event in Japan about science. Last year, we exhibited our results of research that we created ""carnivorous E.coli"" and ""Flower Fairy E.coli"" as a member of iGEM Japan. In Science agora, a variety of people with various backgrounds were there.  Many children learned about synthetic biology here, and we communicated with many people.
Tie-up with Super Science High school
We began to communicate with  students and teachers of Toyonaka high school. Toyonaka high school is authorized Super Science High School by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and conduct a policy that they will increase the number of students who learn university-level education in biology. As a one of the program, we decided to conduct the lecture that let them get into synthetic biology and experimental technique. We will be having the lecture about synthetic biology for three days in November. We thought this activity has several meaning that we are able to encourage regional development of science and technology and diffuse synthetic biology. We would like to continue a communication like this.
Cooperation -a meeting in iGEM Japan-
In Japan, there are more than 10 teams, so communication with other Japanese teams is very important to make our activities better. This summer, we held a meeting of iGEM Japan at Tokyo Metropolitan University. Each team presented and discussed its theme with other teams. Moreover we held an online meeting among iGEM teams in Japan and practiced presentations.

Our design has great potential to simplify the process of spawn rejuvenation                                 as well as increase the profit for companies. We use an intracellular signal                                 correlated with the plasmid numbers and realize the selection process without                                 any human interference. Through keeping the plasmid numbers above a threshold,                                 we can realize the population quality control and improve the production efficiency."

BBa_K561005 SequenceAndFeatures
BBa_K561005 is designed for middle layer expression, conducting the conversion of cellubiose into glucose. It is based on Rainbofilm bottom layer BioBrick BBa_K561000 , with substitution of eYFP ( BBa_E0030 ) by BglX. To get the beta-glucosidase exported from cytoplasm, PelB tag( BBa_J32015 ) is added in front of the coding sequence of BglX.The sequence is under regulation of micro-aerobic promoter vgb, and the TetR expression would repress upper-layer device (Ptet regulated) in micro-anaerobic condition, which mostly exists in the middle part of the biofilm.
Coding sequence with regulation of Ptet would be suitable as the   upper-layer device (such as BBa_I13602 used in   Rainbofilm system). Expression of the device would be repressed either   in the bottom or medium layer, and would do its job faithfully in the   upper-layer region.
This device is an expression cassette of alsS, Kivd and Adh2 each with a RBS. alsS gene is from B.subtilis, encoding alpha-acetolactate synthase protein, which is a substitution of E.coli ilvHCD to optimize the production of 2-Ketoisovalerate. Kivd gene from L. lactis and Adh2 gene from S.cerevisiae encodes 2-keto-acid decarboxylases and alcohol dehydrogenases, respectively. These two enzymes catalyze the last two reactions in the pathway producing isobutanol from 2-Ketoisovalerate.
 
Modeling
Introduction
Three kinds of enzymes are needed to turn cellulose into glucose. Enzymes Exoglucanase and Endoglucanase are placed in bottom layer of bioflim, and β-glucosidase are in layer 2. layer 3 could be used to further degrade glucose to further degraded molecule such as alcohols. Our application is a combination of stratified bioflim and bio-conversion of celluloses which is a part of the project of Team Edinburgh of igem 2011. Therefore their model (with matlab) could be used to describe our system with some adjustment"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," little to no vesicles, suggesting that those values are a background from the protocol used, due to a cell destruction during the centrifugation step.To test this hypothesis, the protocol could be adjusted to see whether GFP is still present at lower centrifugation speeds. Regardless of these possible changes, the fluorescence intensity of both GFP-TA with and without TolR in KEIO is significantly higher than GFP-TA in WT. Taken together, we can conclude that GFP is transported into the vesicles.
Figure 45: GFP fluorescence in vesicles. Intensity of GFP in vesicles. The fluorescence intensity of the samples TorA-GFP with TolR in the KEIO strain, TorA-GFP in the KEIO and WT strain and the empty backbone in the WT strain.
Conclusions
The goal of this module was to transport proteins into vesicles. One of the things we have shown through Dynamic Light Scatter (DLS) experiments is that hypervesiculation occurs in E.coli BW25113 of the Keio strain with a TolA deletion. Produced vesicles have a size of around 18 d.nm. Additionally, by measuring fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm and periplasm, we have demonstrated that GFP with the TorA tag is transported to the periplasm. To determine if GFP was transported into vesicles, we combined the two plasmids and measured the intensity of GFP in vesicles. Modeling determined that after 25 minutes post induction the concentration of GFP in the vesicles did not increase anymore and reached its maximum. On top of this, it we had shown that the amount of vesicles produced was higher after 20 hours. Combining this, the vesicles we harvested after 20 hours post induction. The same purification method as in the DLS experiments was used, after which fluorescence was measured in the plate reader. With these results, we can conclude that the fusion of TorA and GFP is transported into the periplasm.

Overview
In this section we will look at our project and synthetic biology from a very different perspective. As students of the emerging field of synthetic biology we feel very much drawn towards the science and technology that makes our project possible. However, as scientists in the making we are part of a society which means that this project also provides us with the opportunity to reflect on how our work affects and is affected by the social and ecological environment in which we work. We therefore have to imagine how our current and future societies would go about dealing with the implications of synthetic biology. This kind of reflection has been termed by the American sociologist C. Wright Mills as sociological imagination in order to describe our awareness of how individual experience and the wider society relate to one another (Mills 1959).
Here we will use our sociological imagination to look at how our project can help to conceive a sustainable governance model for synthetic biology. The Goodbye AzoDye Project is instrumental in achieving this because it enables us to explore and examine the dual nature of the technology as synthetic biology promises to be highly beneficial to society while at the same time creating increasing uncertainty in terms of incalculable risks and issues of biosecurity. There are signs that the community of synthetic biologists is prone to be confronted with a potential public controversy revolving around the environmental hazards that their dual-use technology can be perceived to bring to society. At the same time, however, by taking part in the Environment Track of the Giant Jamboree, UCL iGEM 2014 is also engaged with the idea of solving an ecological problem. Hence, a paradox emerges within the team in which discourses of environmental decline - in relation to the misuse of synthetic biology and the problem of azo dye effluents - are forced to coexist with discourses of environmental innovation to solve these problems.
Considering the complex and novel nature of scientific practices in synthetic biology there is a need to look at adapted forms of governance that deal with processes of innovation in a reflexive manner. This is seen as necessary in order to devise policies that can accommodate a sustainable development of the emerging technology within society. Considering the environmental risks to which they are ascribed, policy frameworks ought to engender"

The second (and last day) had two interesting activities. The first was the meetings with different experts from the university, which privately asked each team about controversial issues. To see if these issues had been taken into account and the possible solutions and consequences were debated.
To close the event, a poster presentation session was held, which was very enriching to know how to present our project in Boston..
One of the things that were achieved in this meet up was the agreement with the UPF-CRG-Barcelona group to organize an activity in their meet up. Activity that is explained in the following session (and that gave rise to a greater collaboration).
Barcelona
Spanish Meet Up (Barcelona)
This meet up took place between Saturday 18 and Monday 20 August in the city of Barcelona and was organized by one of the two teams of this same city, the UPF-CRG-Barcelona. In it, all the teams from Spain were called, which all but the Valencia team attended. To this meet up they were representing the whole team: Laura, Iván and Francisco. The meet up took place in the Biomedical Research Park of Barcelona (PRBB), center where the host team operates and where they started with a welcome activity. This activity consisted of a game where each one of the assistants of each team presented themselves, so that the subsequent environment was much more relaxed.
The next activity was the one organized by our team. In this activity we proposed to carry out a collaborative guide in which each group would give the main ideas on how they have solved the main problems that have arisen in iGEM. The structure we proposed was followed. We collected these ideas and wrote a complete guide. We explain this collaboration in a later section of the collaborations. After this, some playful activities were carried out on the beach, including volleyball games.
During the morning of the second day, a more detailed presentation of each team's project was made. There was 30 minutes to expose each project in detail. This activity was very useful because the rest of the teams, besides getting to know the details of each project well, could intervene to give advice on how to make the presentations. Each team took a series of points in which they could be reinforced in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.

Human Practices
A big hurdle for getting many synthetic biology parts into use (especially into public use) is the general public's fear of genetically modified anything.   We wanted to create an early education program that may one day lead to a deeper public understanding and acceptance of products like ours (such as our bacteriophage library for pharmaceutical delivery or E. coli modified to kill cholera in drinking water).  We created a children's book ""The Adventures of Baxter Bacteria"" that has a fun fantasy story followed by an educational parents guide, including information about bacteriophage and plasmids.  In addition, we conducted pre- and post- tests to see if reading our book improved basic understanding of synthetic biology concepts.  We are currently talking with publishers agents to get this book distributed on a larger scale.
Continued Outreach
After our statistical analysis of the ability of ""The Adventures of Baxter Bacteria"" to promote increased understanding of synthetic biology, we now desire to share this book with the world. ""The Adventures of Baxter Bacteria"" is being taken to a publisher's fair in Germany and it is our hope that it will be published on a large scale. The scientists and discoverers of tomorrow need to be inspired today! We have enjoyed our role in promoting synthetic biology as a means of improving our World. In the event that a publisher publishes our book, a part of the proceeds will be given to fund future BYU iGEM teams!

motivated, calculator and always up for challenges.
Hey, I am Wanwan and 100% made in China. As a first-year  Master student in ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" in University Göttingen, I like exploring the macroscopic world as well as the microscopic world. After working on genetic modification in Fusarium during my bachelor, I realised that it’s a powerful tool to use synthetic methods to design and construct new genetic materials for industrial applications. I am here in the iGEM team to learn more about biosynthetic field and also have fun together with creative people. See you guys in Boston!

Towards harnessing bacterial nanotubes by and for synthetic biology
The interest: A recent ground-breaking paper [1] described a new cell-to-cell bacterial communication system: nanotubes. Through excellent electronic microscopy images, antibiotic resistance transfer, faint fluorescence transfer, and cross-antibiotic resistance, previously unknown exchange channels were revealed between B.subtilis cells and even between completely different species. Results suggest that protein and/or RNA can travel through these tubes. This discovery may lead to a redefinition of individuality in bacteria. Given the many applications of known communication systems (e.g., quorum sensing, conjugation) in synthetic biology, harnessing the capacity of the nanotubes will open endless possibilities for new applications as amorph computing....
The challenge: Using synthetic biology to characterize the nanotubes: the structure, composition and control of which are still unknown. We decided to work on this challenging problem by providing other proofs to support this discovery.
See our work!
The project:
We bet-hedged our chances using different reporter systems by creating several devices relying on protein or RNA diffusion. Our devices rely on an emitter cell and a receiver cell that amplifies the signal. We chose to work with signaling molecules of different sizes and natures to test thoroughly the diffusion possibilities. Experiments were coupled with a thorough modeling approach tackling both the detection devices as well as diffusion, assisted transfer within the tubes and the membrane fusion within.
Our lab achievements
We worked very hard to test the presence of nanotubes and characterize them. Come and find out more about the results of this scientific summer.
The values:
Ethics and safety are two main concerns when building genetically engineered organisms.

Gluten is a protein (proteins?) in wheat that is in most breads and beers.  Many people have allergies to these proteins, and so have to carefully avoid gluten-containing products.  Maybe we could engineer a pathway to specifically break down gluten in the brewing process?

Bacterial interaction
Overview
Some kind of social behavior, like quorum sensing or self assembly based on communicating only with neighboring cells would be cool.  This would be a good way to take advantage of Advait's cellular automata expertise before he leaves.  This would also be somthing that would require good quantitative characterization of our genes and could be combined with the promoter characterization stuff, maybe.
Enhanced regulation of cellular replication
Overview
The implications of the ability to control cellular replication are tremendous.  The possibility of increasing or decreasing the rate of the cell division cycle via gene manipulation has very broad scope, from increasing metabolite production to decreasing or terminating unbounded cell growth.  In the arena of biofuels, it would be of enormous value to create a large mass of cells capable of producing certain metabolites of interest in a short time period.  Since cell replication uses large amounts of energy, it would be beneficial to reduce or terminate cell replication once a large amount of cells have been produced.  An idea mentioned by George involves manipulating the cascades of quorum sensing to achieve these purposes.
Regulate insulin gene expression in insulin producing E. coli
Overview
Chemical production companies find it useful to control the rate that they can produce their product.  This makes it possible for them to cope with varying rate of demand.  Insulin is a valuable drug that is mass-produced.  A simple way to control insulin production by E. coli would be a valuable tool.  We could use bio-bricks to insert the proper DNA sequences into E. coli to produce insulin then regulate that gene’s expression by manipulating either the promoter or the ribosomal binding site. -Kevin
Does anyone have any insight on the metabolic pathway for insulin and the enzymes that are involved.  Maybe like a paper to read or something?
Interesting suggestion, Kevin.  I don't know what promoter/RBS combination is used in front of the coding region for insulin in current biotechnological practice, but it could be possible that more powerful combinations exist and could be predicted using quality part characterization.

The effort put into our social media strategy and our goal of following it has paid off. Social media has shaped our outreach and made it possible for us to talk about iGEM and our project to people we did not know. Several times our outreach has led us to public discussion of GMO and solar panels due to persons contacting us, wanting to know more.

Prospects
The aim of our prospect section is to expand on the vision of the PowerLeaf; a vision we would love to see realised. An overview of the project has been created, in the hope that it will benefit future iGEM teams. Additionally, it is aimed to assist iGEM teams-to-be, should they wish to take the PowerLeaf to the next level.
Perspectives
Building a Product for a Better Future
The purpose of the PowerLeaf is to provide a greener alternative to the currently available sources of energy. An important aspect of such an undertaking is to limit the use of depleting resources in the construction of the device itself. This is accomplished through the use of the most common resources available, namely recyclable plastics and bacteria. In turn, this will contribute to our dream of building a better future. A future where fear of reaching a critical shortage of natural resources has been eliminated. Another benefit of the PowerLeaf is the bacteria's ability to self-replicate, if provided with the essential nutrients.
As tools for genomic editing improves, the advancement of biological devices will conceivably become even more complex and independent. They will do so by introducing new metabolic pathways originated from other organisms using genetic engineering. This could potentially allow the PowerLeaf to become completely independent through its self-replication. Independency would occur, when the bacteria are modified to produce their own essential nutrients directly from unwanted pollution in the environment. This trait would lead to cleaner cities, along with providing a natural solution of sustainable energy.
Genetic Code Expansions for Biological Engineering
In an effort to advance the current technologies used in synthetic biology, research groups are working on genetic code expansion. We had an interesting talk from postdoc and former iGEM participant, Julius Fredens, about his work on genetic code expansion. Once a technology like this expands, it will completely revolutionise biological engineering, including that of the PowerLeaf. Genetic code expansion could be used for optimisation of the systems in the PowerLeaf, such as optimisation of nanowires, improvement of the light-sensing system, and making the breakdown of cellulose inducible.

Tokyo Tech Meetup
August 8, 2018
During the summer, iGEM teams from across Japan attended a meetup held by Tokyo Tech University. The teams attending were KAIT, Bochan lab, Gifu University, Tokyo Tech, and ASIJ. Each team gave a presentation about the progress they had made on their project so far. Each team's presentation was wrapped up by a Q&A, where other teams were often able to give many good suggestions. After all the teams presented, we were able to further interact and follow up on various suggestions. Our team received a helpful comment from the Tokyo Tech and Gifu teams, suggesting we use of a histidine tag to simplify and speed up the protein purification process and get more accurate results.
i-GEM Pakistan Video Call
June 2018
During the summer portion of our lab work, we participated in a Skype call with a Pakistani high school iGEM team, known as LACAS Biobots. We explained our projects to each other, took virtual lab tours, and got to know another HS team and the different ways in which various teams work.
Survey to other iGEM teams
We also worked on gathering advice from other iGEM teams using SurveyMonkey. In our survey, we asked a number of questions regarding the use of genetic engineering for medical therapy. From SurveyMonkey, we were able to obtain a wide variety of insight from other countries, including Pakistan and Mexico. Most countries had similar responses, that as long as genetic engineering was not used for aesthetics and was solely used for therapy that their culture and ethics agreed with the practice.

After ligating these fusion gene fragments to pET30a(+) empty                     vectors, we transformed the target plasmids to Trans5α. When colony PCR was done for screening, we                     picked correct colonies shown in electrophoresis gel(Fig.3) for plasmid amplification.
Fig.3 Result of colony PCR
Arrows show the correct size of fusion gene fragments:                             α-tubulin-YNE is 1866 bp, α-tubulin-YCE is 1650bp, β-tubulin-YCE is 1629bp,                             α-tubulin-nluc is 2640bp, α-tubulin-cluc is 1857bp.
Sequencing results further confirmed that α-tubulin-YNE, YNE-α-tubulin, α-tubulin-YCE, YCE-α-tubulin,                     β-tubulin-YCE, YCE-β-tubulin, α-tubulin-nluc and cluc-α-tubulin expression vectors were constructed                     successfully.
By Gateway Technology
We also tried to construct fusion protein vectors by Gateway Large-scale Cloning technology. We used                     Invitrogen pENTR/D TOPO to clone β-tubulin into entry vector. Primers were designed based on                     β-tubulin sequence and PCR was done for verification. Electrophoresis result (Fig.4) showed that                     β-tubulin was successfully cloned into the entry vector.
Fig.4 PCR verification result of the constructed entry vectors
In order to do LR reaction, we used the restriction endonuclease Not I to digest the entry vector.                     Electrophoresis result (Fig.5) showed that single digestion was efficient.
Fig.5 Single endonuclease digestion result of entry vectors
Using Invitrogen Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix, the entry vectors were ligated with                     pCambia1300-nluc and pCambia1300-cluc respectively. Thus the destination vectors were complete.                     After transformation and running PCR with β-tubulins primers, electrophoresis result (Fig.6) showed                     high positive rates, indicating β-tubulins was successfully cloned into the vectors.

Safety
Safety Questionnaire
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety?  No
public safety? No
environmental safety?  No
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
Our project does not raise any safety issues.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? Yes
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? They think it's safe
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?  N/A
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Have a stricter distribution policy for the more risky parts.
Public Safety
Our strain of E. Coli is not pathogenic, so no epidemic disease will occur as a result of our project.   Additionally, it does not pose a threat to public health, as no toxins, chemicals, or any dangerous substances are being produced.  Furthermore, our project does not serve as a stepping stone for potential bioweapons.
Environmental Safety
In any type of genetic engineering, there is always the hidden danger of horizontal gene transfer between the synthetic organism and other microbes co-existing with the synthetic organism.  Thus, the possibility of horizontal gene transfer must be taken into consideration if and when the synthetic E. Coli enters the real world.
If our strain of E. Coli ever gets leaked outside of the lab, there would be no effect on the surrounding environment because it would not grow well in soil in the first place.  In order to grow it effectively in lab, we had to grow it on nutrient-rich broth or agar plates and incubate them in a warm room overnight.  If our E. Coli were able to survive in the outdoors, no effect will be made on the ecosystem.  Microbes that receive our E. Coli’s plasmids will not gain any selective advantage over other microbes, since our plasmids were designed to create a visual pattern.  They may, however, receive some slight"

Discussion with Cell Product Purification Experts
Feedback and advice from experts actually working in the fields of concern are valuable contributions to a successful iGEM project. To get advice on how to improve our purification column EluX , we met with two experts: Prof. Dirk Lütkemeyer, General Manager of BIBITEC GmbH, and Dr. Benjamin Müller, CEO of Biofidus AG for Analytical Services. BIBITEC GmbH was founded in 2001 and specializes in the production of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Biofidus AG is a bioanalytical company offering services with a wide variety of bioanalytical methods. They are specialized on spectroscopic, chromatographic or mass spectrometric assays focused on characterization of proteins as well as small molecules. We demonstrated and explained our prototypes and elution technique. We also prepared specific questions, such as ‘What do you think about our elution technique compared to common techniques?’ and ‘Which problems and limitations could our column encounter in real world applications?’. As described in the following sections, we benefited greatly from these exchanges and made several improvements to our hardware to address the predicted challenges. Therefore, we are very thankful for their opinions and great advices.
Meeting with Prof. Dr. Dirk Lütkemeyer, General Manager of BIBITEC GmbH
We met Prof. Dirk Lütkemeyer at the 24th of August at the Center for Biotechnology. We presented our purification column and explained our light-induced elution technique. The presentation was followed by a fruitful discussion about possible challenges in real world applications, like using this purification technique to purify recombinant proteins produced by our local fermentation technologies working group.

Demonstrate
Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."
UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html," our construct would need to be able to be fed to bees.  This was also a common way to distribute Fumagilin.
Application: This suggestion from multiple beekeepers led to us using Bee. coli, as it was something that could be used by beekeepers in a feed form. It was also something that could live in a bee midgut.
Question: Knowing everything about our product do you think you would use it?
Quote: “As long as it works” - Paul Greidanus
Answer: Beekeepers told us that they liked and were excited about the project. They also told us that as long as it worked, they would use it as the is an immediate need for a solution.
Application: There has been overwhelming support for the project by those who we interviewed. This has lead to us knowing that our project will be well received and have a positive impact.  This achieved our primary goal of helping the community.
Other Stakeholders
Past producers of Fumagilin the treatment for Nosema.
We met with Ursula De Rugna, former CEO of Medivet. Medivet was a pharmaceutical company which produced Fumagilin, an antifungal treatment that was used for decades to treat Nosema. Recently, the production of Fumagilin was halted. Being the main source of income for Medivet, the company was force to go out of business. This loss of Fumagilin resulted in panic in the beekeeping community, and increased risk of Nosema infections.
“It’s not gonna be pretty” - Ursula De Rugna
Ursula is an important stakeholder to consider when discussing Nosema, because her product was responsible for the prevention of Nosema infections in Alberta. We felt that with her expertise she could give advice on how to improve our project. Ursula felt it was a good concept and encouraged us to look into Alberta regulations surrounding the production and application of this product. She also suggested that we explore patents; we have heeded both of her suggestions. Ursula  also reassured us that a treatment for Nosema was integral for beekeepers. She also spoke about how amazing beekeepers are, and how important it is that we do this work because Nosema puts that all of that at risk. “Beekeepers are amazing people”
But Ursula also remained hopeful about the future of beekeeping the “beekeeping industry has overcome a lot of adversity… beekeepers keep going, they are resilient, they work with that they have.”

Characterization of activities of promoters
Parts J23100 through J23119 are a family of constitnutive promoters. The absolute promoter strength of J23100 has been measured by iGEM Warsaw 2010 Team (13,1pg RNA/minute/ug substrate DNA for J23100) and the relative promoter strength of other family members are given here . Our values of forwardPromoterEfficiency could be easily obtained by unit conversion. For example, it is 2.18E-7 /s for part J23100. All values of forwardPromoterEfficiency are listed below to character the activities of those promoters  where the second column is the relative promoter strength for promoter family members and the third column gives the absolute values.
promoter strength: the absolute values are measured as unit concentration of RNA/second/unit concentration of substrate DNA

St_Andrews,2012,Team:St Andrews#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to discover that our 2Ni colonies did not contain our insert, so these were re-ligated into the pGEX vector and transformed into DH5.  We cut more pGEX with our restriction enzymes (Xho1 and EcoR1) and miniprepped more pGEX  and more of our nickel containing plasmid and run them on a gel getting positive results for both (eventually).
""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
This week has been full of ups and downs for Squad Omega. We started off with a lot of hope when we found that the digestion of all necessary genes and plasmids worked. So we were ready to go for ligation and transformation into DH5-α cells. Much to our surprise, these transformations were then largely unsuccessful. However, we decided to pick some colonies from our plates and cultivate them to perform a miniprep. After analysis of our plasmids with numerous digestions and PCR reactions, and trying to re-do ligations, we finally were able to obtain some colonies containing our D15 gene, D6 and ELO6. D15 and D6 were sent off for sequencing, while for ELO6, we are still trying to confirm its presence in our colonies. Hopefully, next week we will be able to send off ELO6 and the missing D12 for sequencing, and start doing some protein expression.
Even though in the beggining of this week we felt like we needed a motivational speaker telling us not to give up, now we feel like we are finally getting somewhere and making progress.
Week 7
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
We ran a PCR of our Ni 2 vectors using the GST forward and the Ni 2 reverse primer to see if they were correct inside the vector. The results showed that they were not present.  We decided to do a giant colony PCR of the colonies on all the plates we have gathered over the last 6 weeks, intending to keep those that are of use and bin the others. This resulted in us finding plates with successfully ligated Ni1 and Ni2 inserts. These colonies were grown up in LB. However, successful Pd and Pt inserts were not found. The Pd and Pt inserts were religated into the pGEX vector.  The sucesfull overnights of Ni1 and Ni2 were miniprepped and transformed into BL21 for protein expression trials.  We decided to try using a gBlock synthesised by IDT to make a 500bp protein in which we would insert our own metal binding peptides."
EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," need to try to speak to the public. In the end they’re paying our research, right! They should have a right of deciding what we are doing and at least we should explain to them what we are doing. We should have more open discussion on where the new technologies should be applied and how far should we go.
Actually, last year’s EPFL iGEM team did little interviews in the streets of Lausanne. They explained to the passengers willing to give them their time what synthetic biology is and all the different applications. People thought it was really interesting. But when they started talking about genetically modified organisms they were reluctant on the idea. What is your opinion on that?
With GMO it is kind of a difficult subject anyway. When the techniques initially emerged it was really badly handled by the scientists I would say. Now, this word has a sort of stigma. As soon as you mention GMOs, people don’t like it. I think we should learn from what happened then and do better this time. What better opportunity than now with synthetic biology?
On the other hand, I also think it is not something really specific to synthetic biology generally it is every emergent technology has potential risk and also benefits.
Maybe the problem with synthetic biology is that it’s something complex enough so people within the general public may not truly understand it, but it’s relatable enough that they have opinions about it. Maybe other emerging technologies doesn’t always face the same barrier. For example, work in physics. People may not understand it but they don’t relate to it either.
And I also think that there are several different aspects to be considered:
There is a safety aspect: for example, whether we should release modified organisms in the environment or maybe even inject them in tumor of a patient.  There are also social aspects: who should get the patents? Should the techniques be open? who has access to the technology? Finally, there is the third level, the ethical aspect. That’s more about what’s our relation to the natural world. Should we engineer the living creatures around us?
All these different aspects should be discussed.
Do you have any like opinion specifically on what you just said, like on the patent and the access of synthetic biology? I guess you are referring to certain companies wanting to patents gene as intellectual property.
I don’t have a solution. I guess it is a complicated problem. Especially in synthetic biology there is this open source movement. Which I welcome greatly, especially on the academic side. On the other hand, I also see that companies need to have some kind of protection of their research and development, therefore the patents"
Tsinghua,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," for esophageal cancer that are currently in clinical application?
No. There are currently many researches focus on miRNA working as potential biomarkers for esophageal cancer. But none of them is fully demonstrated enough to be used clinically. The most popular research method is screening large number of miRNAs, measuring their expression level in subjects, and find possible relations. However, limited by time and expense, the sample capacity of these researches is not able to be large enough to represent the entirety. Thus the results of these researches have limitation. Even so, as statistics of each research accumulating, and human technology developing, biomarkers are a promising trend of disease detection.
What do you think about our project?
It’s a really interesting one. Your test paper can work as a preliminary screening of esophageal cancer high risk people, because it’s convenient and noninvasive. To do this, you need to ensure the sensitivity, not specificity, of the test paper. Though at present you may not be able to work out a test paper that can be used in clinically, it’s a very good idea, or concept.
The Result of Our Questionnaire
Q1: Our country(China) is one of the areas of high incidence of esophageal cancer in the world, there are more than ten million people died of esophageal cancer each year. Do you know the causes of esophageal cancer? (Nitrosamines and other chemical carcinogens, fungi, micronutrient deficiencies, poor diet, genetic factors, etc.)
Q2: Have you ever heard which poor eating habits are related to esophageal cancer? (Tobacco and alcohol addiction, swallowing hot or irritating esophagus excellent food, etc.)
Q3: Do you know how the hospital diagnose esophageal cancer? (Ultrasound, barium meal, endoscopy, etc.)
Q4: Do you know the symptoms of esophageal cancer? (Weight plummeted, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, indigestion, etc.)
Q5: If there is a strange feeling esophagus (such as dysphagia, pain, etc.), will you immediately go to the hospital to check it?
Q6: Which of the following is the main reason that you do not choose to go to the hospital to check?
Q7: How much would you like to pay for the test paper if it’s result is trustful?
Q8: Which of the following choice is the most acceptable one for you to diagnose cancer?

Neptune is an open-source software tool available to biologists through Github and Nona using the BSDII license. Specifically, it is a web application that runs on a node.js express server using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. To get the software running, the biologist has to go though a couple of easy steps. First, they would have to download node.js, and our project repository.
After running our project through node.js, the biologist would be introduced to the home page of Neptune. Here, they could look at documentation or get started with their project. They can either continue working on a pre-existing project, or start a new one. The user would then be redirected to the dashboard page where they can see a layout of the entire workflow.
The first step to designing a microfluidic chip would be the specify page. Here they can specify the layout of their chip from a very high level description. This would be a simple verilog-like language. Once the description is mapped onto the chip using an automatic place and route tool, the user can then proceed to the design stage. Here, the user can fine tune their work to edit the experimental setup. Once that is complete, the chip design will be outputed as a JSON and an SVG. The SVG would be used to mill out the chip, and the JSON would help the user control the experiment later on. Following the design page, the user would be redirected to a Build page where they can select their hardware based on their requirements. Once the user maps the hardware to their microfluidic chip, they can proceed to Assembly where they would learn how to put all the pieces together. They can set up their entire experiment here including building the hardware infrastructure, milling out their microfluidic chip and sealing the control and flow layers, and so on. Last is the Control page. Here, they can Control their microfluidic device by opening and closing valves, and dispensing liquid through Neptune"

Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#Policy and Practices#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," is increasing, and importable solutions such as Minecrobe could pose to be an immense benefit when compared to domestic research and development efforts.
Potential Issues
There are some potential concerns with our specific application of genetic engineering. By modifying our bacteria to produce the iron chelating phytosiderophores, we are intending to increase the bioavailability of iron in plants which would otherwise be iron deficient, thus fighting micronutrient deficiencies. This approach has a few potential issues if it were to be “too successful”. For example, increasing the bioavailability of iron in the target plant due to soil content may also increase the bioavailability of iron in non-target plants, possibly contributing to harmful algal blooms. There is also a looming threat that our organism would spread beyond our control and lead to excess iron in our natural waters systems. Higher iron water content could lead to a reddish brown or yellow slime that can clog plumbing and causes an offensive odor. This is a possible downside to altering the bacteria in the soil rather than the operation of the plant itself, though there are many upsides to our method which tip the balance. However, even if this is an issue that isn’t solved by our bacteria, it is an issue that has similar implications by the use of fertilizers as well. Increasing the bioavailability of iron to the target plant may also lead to an excess of iron in the plant, resulting in iron toxicity. In addition to that, iron competes with manganese, so an excess of iron availability may lead to a deficiency in manganese. Iron deficiency, manganese deficiency, and excess iron all typically result in characteristic discolorations. Such discolorations would discourage consumer purchasing and reduce farmer profits. These issues, if they do turn out to be concerns, are the same problems one would have with traditional fertilizers, and the solution is to simply avoid overuse of Minecrobe, as with iron-chelator-containing fertilizers.

Introduction
Figure 1. Fusion of Tn5 transposase with dxCas9. During purification, the Tn5 part of the protein forms a dimer with another Tn5 structure from another fusion protein, thus forming the fusion dimer structure represented here in proportion.
The core of our detection method is our novel targeted Next Generation Sequencing platform. This technology reduces the enormous amount of data generated by whole genome sequencing and reduces the time and resources invested in analyzing multiple samples, for the detection of gene doping. We accomplished our goal by designing an innovative dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein shown in figure 1. The dxCas9 part is responsible for guiding the fusion to the target site via complementary matching between the sgRNA and target site. Whereas the Tn5 part is responsible for performing the integration of the adapter. This fusion thus has the capability of performing target specific integration of adapters required for sequencing. We could therefore replace the random enzymatic protein, Tn5, used for fragmentation during sequencing library preparation, transforming the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform to targeted Next Generation Sequencing.
Fusion protein In Vitro functionality
We constructed, expressed and purified the fusion protein, and demonstrated its intended activity: targeted integration of specific DNA sequences. For this, we analyzed the integration of small DNA sequences (DNA adapters) directed with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to a specific site on a substrate gene, generating two DNA fragments of known length based on the position that the sgRNA targeted.
Figure 2. (A) Experimental design to prove targeted integration of our fusion protein. The fusion was directed by sgRNA at position 179 bp in EPO cds, adding two adapters of 50 bp (one at each side). The product of the integration are two separate DNA molecules of different lengths that can be seen by PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis, (B). Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer native 5"

SUMMARY
Improved Parts
The Baltimore BioCrew’s research into projects relating to blood coagulation led them to research about Lethbridge HS’s 2016 iGEM project. We observed that their team had previously created a construct using a serine protease from the Cerastes cerastes (Desert Horned Viper) called “Cerastotin” and that it had the ability to coagulate mammalian blood at a faster rate than usual.
However, a few modifications could have been added to their construct to overall improve its functionality. The first improvement made to the Cerastotin construct was an overall codon optimization specifically optimizing it to work better in E. coli.
Next, we decided to implement in our optimized construct was a 6xHis tag. This tag gave us the ability to purify our protein through a Nickel-affinity column, and thus more effectively isolate our venom for various experimentation purposes including testing the potency of our venom, as well as to compare its overall level of regulation, as well as to test whether or not it can be purified.
Lastly, we replaced their constituent promoter with the Lacl promoter because the Lacl promoter is more regulated than that used by the Lethbridge construct. Another additional improvement that the Lacl promoter gives us is the possibility of inducing it using either lactose or IPTG.
Overall, we made three separate constructs for every step of the improvements, and we renamed our constructs from ""Cerastotin"" to ""Cerastocytin"":

His-Tag: BBa_K2893002
