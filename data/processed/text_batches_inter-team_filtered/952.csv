Research is ongoing to find ways to use cyanobacteria in commercial production of carbon compounds such as sugar, biofuels, and pharmaceutical ingredients.  Since cyanobacteria obtain their energy through photosynthesis, producing these compounds in industrial quantities may require outdoor production. We can also use cyanobacteria in this experiment as a predictor of how certain plant cells will react in lower temperatures, helping to predict how crops will be affected by certain conditions.1 Our project was designed to look at ways to improve cyanobacteria’s chilling tolerance which opens the possibility of utilizing colder and less desirable geographical regions for production.
In our research, we found that “the chilling tolerance of cyanobacteria can be enhanced by genetic manipulation of fatty acid desaturation”.2 A plant-type desaturase (desA) affects the lipids in the membrane through the addition of double bonds in the fatty acids.  What if we were able to insert that protection into a cyanobacteria that is widely-used for the production of green commodities?  Our project was designed to do just that.
• Design and construct multiplexed chemostat to allow cyanobacterias to grow continuously, as they would in an industrial setting.
• Express desA protein from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, a species of cyanobacterium that is able to survive in a large range of conditions, in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, another species of cyanobacterium that is widely used and studied for the production of the green commodities listed above.
• Clone desA plasmids.
• Transform plasmid into Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 to create engineered cyanobacteria.
• Using Gibson Assembly, insert cloned desA genes into Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Gibson Assembly usage provided a tightly-controlled riboswitch vector.
• Place engineered cyanobacteria and wild types of cyanobacteria into the sterile chemostat culture chambers.  Place chemostat in various temperatures for continuous growth.
• Determine viability of engineered and wild strains of cyanobacteria after being subjected to various temperatures.
• Examine lipid membrane for differences in fatty acid make-up.
Future work on this project will focus on gradually decreasing the temperatures to further increase the freeze tolerance of the"

SPL was ligated with combinations between pAT12-pAT16 into pSB2K3; J23100 and J23116 promoters were also ligated with pAT15 into pSB2K3 as references for measuring with SPL.
Once the above mentioned ligations were complete (x10) they along with J23100, J23116 and J23101 were transformed into DH5-alpha cells and then plated in amounts of 20ul, 100ul and 200ul.
Hopefully the plates will give some good results tomorrow.
18-10-2010 Repressor group Annemi, Lisa and Maya
Ran a gel of the verification PCR Lisa did yesterday. Unfortunately the bands were nowhere to be seen.
Did a PCR of the pIGR12 construct (Z2). Looks like we might have an insert in some of them. However in the lanes where our own primerF was used, no bands were visible.
Wrote some descriptions of our BB's GR1, GR2 and Z1 and got it approved by Seb. So we should be ready to send those within the next few days.
Sent the minipreps to sequencing and are now very excited to get the results.
Started O/Ns of the minipreps that were sent for sequencing so we have backups.
Thomas was very kind to do a verification PCR on our pIGR05 and pIGR06 constructs.
17-10-2010  Juliet and Patrick- Antiterminator group
I (Juliet) learned what not to do in the lab today :P but then Patrick and I made a new gel and ran a gel of the (50X) re-verification PCRs that Thomas made last night. We found that most of them were successful so we were able to proceed and make duplicates of PCRs of pAT12-pAT16.
A gel was ran of the PCR's and their clean ups and turned out good, they are ready to be digested, ligated and transformed tomorrow.
Parts to be sent to iGEM HQ have also been registered in the parts registry.

Newsletter
We also participate in the newsletter project organized by Amoy_China. We were always keeping in touch with them and our contributions were published on three issues. The topic of each issue is different from each other, so they would make an arrangement in advance with us for our contribution to publish in the next issue. Through the newsletters, we shared the thoughts of how to build an iGEM team and introduced the team members, and most importantly, the detailed illustration of our project. Besides, the both teams shared thoughts about top events at that time and we gave some advices about topic selection. With our cooperation, the bond between both teams becomes stronger; we sincerely wish that the newsletter would be even better in the future! 
SKLBC Meet Up
Our team members participated in the iGEM meet up held by SKLBC-China on 19th,July. Students and teachers from SKLBC-GDSYZX, SYSU-software, SCUT, and SCUT-China also participated in this meet up. First was the ice breaking part, in which all the participants introduced themselves, bringing everybody much closer together. The second part was the presentations from each team. Those who listened were asked to write down their advice and questions and show it to the presented team. During this part we made a brief introduction of our track. Many showed great interest and appreciation to our project, many other appreciated our PPT, and some gave helpful advice. We also discussed many problems of the projects of SCUT with their team members, and talked about some mistakes from the biobricks. The third part was called the world cafe, in which all participants were divided into groups and were asked to discuss over iGEM issues( biosafety, the relationship of software and experiments, etc.). The meet up lasted for 3 hours, and the online discussion is still proceeding. The meet up was very successful, as by sharing and discussing, not only had we gain better understanding of other teams' projects, but also deeper recognition of our own project.
Team Selection
This year, we received an offer to attend SCUT's team selection competition. Prof. Huang had attended the selection competition at 8th July. Professors form SCAU had also presented. Finally, one team got the permission to attend 2015 iGEM competition held in Boston.

Polymerase Chain Reaction
Purpose: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique that is used to help amplify specific sections of DNA. These strands of DNA are then able to be analyzed and put into new cells to see how their behavior is affected. This technique is mostly used when a cell is being designed that will use genes from multiple sources. DNA is able to replicate on its own, but it takes several hours to occur. PCR is able to optimize the temperature and process that is needed for replication to happen so that instead of taking several hours in order for one copy to be made, thousands can be made in the same amount of time. Each reaction follows the same three steps; denaturation, annealing, and extension. This procedure is the suggested protocol by New England BioLabs Inc.
Procedure:
1. A bucket of ice was gathered to ensure that all materials remained cold.
2. The following components (total 50µL) were added to a PCR tube, from largest quantity to smallest:
Nuclease-free water - 37 µL
5x Phusion HF Buffer - 10 µL
10 mM dNTPs - 1 µL
10 µM Forward Primer - 0.25µL
10 µM Reverse Primer - 0.25 µL
Template DNA - 1 µL

The Potential
While use of diesel-powered vehicles is relatively         uncommon in North America, use of such vehicles in Europe is         incredibly popular. To emphasize the impact of such a trend         reaching North America and the potential savings to families,         we decided to end this cost analysis with data on current         gasoline expenditures. While reading these data, keep in mind         that our production processes represented a savings of 32%         and that similar savings could be observed should similar         advances be made in gasoline production processes.
The American Family
According to the 2009 American Consumer Expenditure         Survey, the average family with dependents has an average         annual expenditure $68,841 USD or $72494.24 USD after         adjusting for inflation.xi Of these expenditures,         gasoline accounts for $2,868 USD or $3020.20 USD after         adjusting for inflationi. (Inflation is based on a rate of         5.3%.)
If the price of fuel could be reduced by a similar 32%,         the average American family with dependants could save         $996.46 USD per year. This reflects upon direct savings         seen at the gas service station.
Moreover, further potential savings could be incurred         resulting from reduced transportation costs of various         household goods.
The American Individual
Similarly, the average American individual with no         spouse and no dependents spent an average of $1,360 USD on         gasoline in 2009. After adjusting the figures for inflation,         in 2011 the amount spent on fuel would approximately be         $1432 USD. Taking the savings of 32% we could reduce those         expenditures by $458 USD.
The Canadian Family
According to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian         household will spend 3.8% of their income on motor vehicle         fuel.xii The average Canadian family with         two children and two working adults earned $85,600 CDN         in 2009 according to Statistics Canada.

Cold growth rate enhancing proteins
These CryoBricks are chaperone molecules closely involved with the folding of other proteins. They bind substances like RNA or other proteins, and can then inhibit or stimulate conformational changes. Such interactions may protect protection against degradation or unfolding, or even refolding of denatured proteins. This, in turn, can safeguard the functionality of a chaperone's target. Certain chaperones from psychrophillic have been been described to convey enhanced growth capabilities at low temperatures when introduced into E. coli [2] [3] . We intend to put these genes into the BioBrick chassis and describe their effects on growth rate. Since these proteins protect our cells against cold conditions by protecting proteins from improperly folding, we suspect they might convey resistance to freezing as well. The following chaperones will be used in our CryoBricks:
OaCpn10 (From Oleispira antarctica)
OaCpn60 (From Oleispira antarctica)
SheDnaK (From Shewanella sp. AC10)
Freeze survivability proteins
Freeze survivability proteins are actually cold shock proteins that allow cells to survive after being frozen. A large partition of cells still die, but a five to sixty-fold greater partition of cells has been observed to survive depending on the number of freeze-thaw cycles [4] . We will utilize these previously described proteins and characterize their behaviour in E. coli. Since these proteins protect our cells against cold conditions, we suspect they might enhance growth rate as well. Therefore we will also determine the effect these proteins have on growth rate in a cold environment. The following cold shock proteins will be used in our project:
PiCspA (From Polaribacter irgensii)
PiCspC (From Polaribacter irgensii)
Antifreeze Proteins
Antifreeze proteins, or AFPs, facilitate survival at subzero temperatures by binding small ice crystals and inhibiting their growth, preventing fatal ice crystallization. Some of them are also suspected to interact with cell membranes to protect them from cold damage. AFP has been named as superior to other substances(such as NaCl), for its ability to  greatly lower the freezing temperature of water [iGEM Tokyo Tech 2009 ]. Other iGEM teams have also worked with AFPs, such as team Mexico 2010 and, This year, the teams of Leuven and Yale also incorporate AFPs in their respective projects.

NYMU-Taipei,2010,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Project#Speedy protein degrader_-_-_TEXT.html,"her et al., 2003). Therefore, regulated degradation is expected to be critical for the development of synthetic circuits.
To control the half-life of specific proteins, we utilized the regulated proteolysis machineries   naturally employed to bacterial systems. Regulated degradation is ubiquitous for prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998; Jenal and Hengge-Aronis, 2003), because they need to clear damaged or aberrant proteins while ignoring functional ones. A common strategy for substrate selection is adding degradation tags to target proteins. Then, certain proteases execute energy dependent degradation of those proteins. One prominent type of degradation tag in prokaryotes is the ssrA tag, a tmRNA encoded by ssrA gene. This tagging system is engaged in protein quality control throughout all eubacteria (Karzai et al., 2000). Though it was first described as a mechanism to clear obstructed ribosomes (Keiler et al., 1996), recent studies suggested ssrA-mediated tagging also plays a regulatory role in the expression of lac operon (Abo et al., 2000). This motivated us to control the protein expression via manipulating controlled proteolysis.
SsrA tag
SsrA tag, encoded by the ssrA RNA, is important for protein quality control in bacteria. SsrA RNA is recognized as tmRNA because it has characteristics of both tRNA and mRNA (Atkins and Gesteland, 1996; Keiler et al., 1996). When E. coli. ribosomes stall during translation due to absence of a proper stop codon, ssrA ribosome-rescue system mediates C-terminal modification by adding the sequence AANDENYALAA to the the incomplete peptide (Keiler et al., 1996). SsrA tagging frees these ribosomes for other mRNAs, and targets the defective polypeptides for degradation by ClpXP and other ATP-dependent proteases (Gottesman et al., 1998). Previous studies suggested that 0.5% of protein products in E. coli.. receive ssrA tags (Lies and Maurizi, 2008). Bacterial strains lacking functional ssrA gene show slower growth (Oh and Apirion, 1991), reduction in motility (Komine et al., 1994), and subsided pathogenesis (Julio et al., 2000). These results indicate that ssrA tagging system play a major role in bacterial physiology.

PennState,2008,Team:PennState#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," University.  Research in their lab has constructed a biosensor containing just the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen receptor (ER). Our plan for this project is to work on the sensitivity of the biosensor in hopes of using this for water prescreens, similar to the Smart Fold Reporter project.  The sensitivity will be focused for BPA which has a very different conformation than the natural agonist of the ER system (estradiol).  This difference causes BPA to bind weakly but still disturbs normal ER function.
We intend to analyze the LBD of ER and perform directed evolution to increase BPA sensitivity.  During directed evolution, certain regions of the ER LBD would be targeted for random mutagenesis providing a library of mutants in the trillions.  The mutant library would be induced with BPA and the best growing colony would be selected, tested, and mutated for further sensitivity.

Human Practice Summary
What we discovered through our findings in policy and practice helped shaped the trajectory of our project. We gathered data from researchers, medical doctors, veterinarians, cataract patients, and public opinions to find out the best way to develop our project so that it can benefit as many people as possible.
Our Policy and Practice is separated into three categories, Research, Outreach and Impact. In the Research category, we collected and analyzed data from researchers, doctors, vets, investors, patients and the general public. This information shaped the direction of every part of our project, including the construct design, nanoparticle prototype synthesis and delivery, biological modeling and the development of a marketing plan for selling our final product. In the Outreach category, we educated the public and spread awareness of our cataracts project, synthetic biology and science in general.  We also collaborated and communicated with two iGEM teams to help solve problems together.  Through educating and raising awareness, we hope not only to get more people involved in finding a solution to cataracts, but also to get more people involved and interested in synthetic biology research. The final category, Impact, includes working with organizations and infrastructure that is"

AND GATE-input
This is the input part of AND GATE. After being induced by IPTG, plac promoter activates the expression of T7 RNA polymerase which contains two  amber mutations (T7 ptag) . After being induced by L-arabinose, pBAD promoter activates the expression of a special tRNA (supD), which is used to identify amber mutation. In the wild-type E.coli, amber mutation will inhibit the translation of T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, only when the two inputs exist together, T7 RNA polymerase can be expressed, and then T7 promoter can be activated to express the downstream gene.

How often do iGEM teams take into account biocontainment when designing their projects? What form do these biocontainment strategies take? The University of Virgina iGEM team wants to find out, and we filled out their survey and chatted with their team members to help them. We are particularly interested in these questions as well, since biocontainment is a major issue surrounding the exploration and colonization of Mars. NASA's Planetary Protection Office notes that biological contamination ""may obscure our ability to find life elsewhere – if it exists""!

NERVE GROWTH FACTOR (NGF) SECRETION: BBa_K2616000
Part description
We built a part which should permit to secrete proNGF directly in the extracellular medium using E. coli type I secretion system. We used an inducible promoter T7 in order to control proNGF production thanks to IPTG induction. We added a His-tag in order to purify it.
Figure 1: Schematic diagram of BBa_K2616000
Secretion
Type I secretion systems transport proteins in one step across the two cellular membranes [1]. The secretion system we chosed it is coded by the Hly operon, which is composed of an inner membrane protein HlyB, a periplasmic channel protein HlyD and an outer membrane protein TolC. As every secretion system, secretion is mediated by the specific recognition of a signal sequence, which in this case are the sixty C-terminal amino acids of alpha-haemolysin HlyA. This sequence binds with the HlyB-HlyD complex and is then translocated into the channel [2].
There are several problems to address when secreting recombinant proteins through the Type I secretion system:
First, the signal sequence HlyA is not cleaved when crossing the channel, but it needs to be cleaved to obtain a functional protein in the medium. That is why we fused the proNGF sequence with this sixty-amino acid long sequence, separated by the cleavage site for Tobacco Etch Virus protease (TEV). As we co-express TEV protease, the signal sequence will be eliminated once it is out the cell, and our proNGF can be active.
Secondly,  whereas TolC endogenously exists within E. coli, this is not the case of the transporter complex H"

VirA receptor
Fig. 1: The VirA receptor of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
The VirA receptor is used by A. tumefaciens to detect acetosyringone and other phenolic substances which are secreted by plants after injury. In presence of these substances VirA phosphorylates itself and afterwards VirG, a response regulator which activates vir box containing promoters. These promoters control genes which are used for infecting the injured plant.  Actually we tried to use the VirA receptor already existing in the partsregistry (<partinfo>K238008</partinfo>). But due to sequence problems (compare results in characterization ) we had to isolate the virA gene from the Ti-plasmid of A. tumefaciens C58 ourselves and convert it into a BioBrick conform part. We removed an illegal PstI restriction site in the virA gene by site-directed mutagenesis.

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," active sodium ATPase while NHA1 is a secondary active antiporter relying on the proton gradient over the plasma membrane
Because the Δena1 mutant lacks most of the sodium efflux ability, the intracellular sodium content is increased when compared to that in the wild-type [24]. This organism then heavely relies on the internal       detoxification system to survive salt stress.
2. Nhx1 transports sodium into prevacuolar compartments [25,26]. The GEF1 channel causes the follow-up of chloride ions:
This system is described with the sequestration model, characterizing the sequestration of sodium in the prevacuolar compartments and thereby       lowering the toxic cytosolic concentration in the Δena1 mutant [25,27]. Nhx1 is a Na+/H+ exchanger and mediates the sequestration of sodium into the prevacuolar compartments, but is       not contributing to the efflux of Na+ to the extracellular room [26]. It has been shown that NHX1 is localized exclusively in unique endosomal/prevacuolar compartments [25]. Through       enhancing the sequestration of sodium in the endosomal membrane system, it was possible to restore the salt tolerance of the Δena1 mutant [24]. This is due to the reduced salt        concentration in the cytosol but increased concentration in the prevacuolar compartments. Responsible for that is Nhx1 that uses the proton gradient over the membrane of this acidic       compartments generated by the vacuolar ATPase, to sequestrate sodium [26].
Fig.5 b: 2D Topology of the GEF1 chloride channel
Thus, and due to other mechanisms, the organism is able to maintain a healthy ratio of sodium and potassium in the cytosol, even if the environmental conditions strongly fluctuate.       If a hyperosmotic shock occurs, S.cerevisiae can reduce its intracellular water potential by importing these ions into the compartments via NHX1 and GEF1 and consequentially survive,       making the organism capable of a certain natural salt tolerance [26].
In order to achieve our goal of accumulating as much sodium chloride as possible in the cell, we have modified some of these channels to prevent the salt from leaving the cell.       At the same time, it is to be ensured that as much salt as possible is stored in the prevacuolar compartments.
The changes we made in the yeast native channel system are shown in Figure 6. They can be subdivided into two areas:

At a panel discussion it became clear that the conscious use of resources and especially the recovery of these in Germany have to play an important role in the future. The Darmstadt iGEM team became clear that their project had met the ravages of time. Apart from the other projects the teams were able to provide an overview of the development of biotechnology in Germany. It was was clear that as well as the Red and White Biotechnology has precedence the furthest in the development. New technologies such as Systems Biology and particularly Synthetic Biology were observed more critically. Here the iGEM teams were aware that it applies to the next scientific generation to discuss topics like synthetic biology in an open and honest way and especially integrate the people. For this reason the German iGEM teams have pronounced an event day on 25th of August. All German teams in common should try to inform the people about their projects and also synthetic biology. It is up to the young scientists to inform about new technologies and to reflect them so that they can be explored and used in Germany.

Lambda Red recombination
Background
Recombineering (recombination-mediated genetic engineering) is an efficient molecular engineering technique used for gene replacement, deletion and insertion. Compared to the traditional technology like digestion and ligation, it’s based on the homologous recombination (HR) and can achieve DNA modification without the restriction enzyme and ligase.
The homologous recombination in E.coli is mediated by proteins called recombinase. The traditional way is dependent on the RecA protein. Nevertheless, there are some limitations like the requirements for long homologous region and the low efficiency of successful recombination. In 1998, a new technique based on Red recombination system is firstly reported to dramatically improve the capacity of gene replacement on the chromosome of E.coli [1]. In recent decades, Red recombination has been extensively employed in gene editing of E.coli due to its distinguished advantages, such as the high efficiency of recombination and the requirement of short homologous arms.
Mechanism
Cloning methods based on cleavage and joining reactions are used for DNA modification and amplification on plasmid vectors, but it’s limited to the gene editing on chromosome. According to the DNA double strand break and repair recombination pathway, the modified tool—“Red recombination” was created for efficient operation on chromosome [2].
To generate recombinant DNA molecules and achieve gene replacement, three steps are required. Firstly, primers containing 30-50 nt sequence identical to the target sequence are synthesized to attain the PCR product homologous with the target. Second, cells are induced for Exo, Beta and Gam function and are made competent for electroporation. Finally, recombination occurs between the amplified PCR product and the target site on chromosome after electroporation [3].
Application in our project
The phenomenon of plasmid lost is very common. To prove a new concept of plasmid quorum sensing, we need to adjust our design according to different situations. Typically, the losing of plasmid will happen both in low-copy plasmid and high-copy one. Since our gene circuits for sensing and controlling the plasmid numbers are also loaded on the target plasmid, we need to avoid the completely lost of plasmids or the system will not reach the expected effects"

I also happen to be very fond of molecules that fluoresce.  My experience with iGEM last year opened my eyes to the possibilities which engineering biological systems can offer.

Nanobiotechnologies give us the ability to manipulate and sense at the level of individual molecules, with a tremendous potential impact on both human health and the economy. To a large extent, this potential is likely to be realised through the development of Lab on Chip (LOC) technologies. Although the LOC technologies are powerful, the complexity of the infrastructure required to support LOC operation has hindered the widespread adoption of LOC methods in life science applications. A central theme in the work of the Backhouse lab ( the Applied Miniaturisation Lab, AML ) is the development of extremely inexpensive (e.g. $1000) systems for implementing nanobiotechnologies/molecular biology, especially for medical diagnostic applications.

. Thus, we could imagine an alternative strategy for our treatment: an engineered Lactobacillus that would transfer a plasmid with correct version of the gene HFE to human enterocytes !
Destruction system implementation
We do not want our bacteria to colonize human gut, or to spread in the environment. Thus we will need to add a destruction system in our Iron Coli. Here are some exemple of systems we could use:
Kill-switch
Kill-switch are one of the most know destruction system and are frequently used in the iGEM competition (see the database created by Paris Bettencourt 2012 team). As we designed a capsule to deliver our Iron Coli in a viscous matrice (with HPMC), we could imagine to incorporate a molecule that will repress the kill-switch. Once the viscous matrice is no longer on the intestines, and so our repressor molecule, the kill-switch would be activated, and then kill the bacteria that remain in the guts. A suitable kill-switch would be for exemple the Biosafety-System araCtive system developed by Biefield 2013 team, which is repressed by L-rhamnose.
Unnatural amino acids
It is possible to introduce  unnatural amino-acids (UAA) with orthogonal system. As for the kill-switch, the orthogonal system would be regulated by the presence of a molecule in the viscous matrice. Then we could use in 2 different ways. First, we can add UAA in our enterobactins enzymes genes. When the molecule is no longer in the intestine, the orthogonal system would no longer be produced and so our different enzymes. Then we can also use UAA as a kill-switch by mutation of an essential gene, exemple Tyrosyl tRNA synthetase, that would be expressed only on the presence of our molecule. Without the recquired molecule, our Iron Coli will die. For more detail, see P.A.S.E 2 System designed by BGU Israel 2013 team.
Chromosomal integration
Horizontal transfer, intra or inter specific, is very common with bacteria. To limit this problem, we could integrate our systems directly into bacterial chromosom of our Iron Coli, thus stopping at least plasmid transfer with the microbiom.
Enterobactin engineering
Even if we made a safe Iron Coli using previous system, a major issue remains:  enterobactins produced by our bacteria are released in the lumen of the du"

In this case, nanopore must accurately distinguish mutant sequences that contain different point mutations and accurately detect Product and Reference Cytidines.
After the sequencing we have successfully retrieved information about both the different mutant sequences and also their activities. After that, it was extremely important to compare the sequences and activities retrieved by CAT-Seq and the precise, low-throughput esterase mutant measurements we have performed earlier using standard methods. The proof of concept was a huge success, as activities determined by CAT-Seq closely followed the beforehand low-throughput measurements by standard methods.

First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. What compartment does the product locate in if the two product templates locate in different compartments? A reasonable solution is to halve the quantities of the product and add it into both compartments. Another problem is that the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. The source of the two problems is essentially the same: how to describe intra-molecular reactions in framework of MoDeL language definitions. At present, it is not supported. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans to refine our MoDeL language.

Introduction
2'-Deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate (dCTP) - one of the four building blocks of DNA - is as a versatile scaffold for a specific enzyme substrate immobilization. Cytosine 4th amine (-NH2) and deoxyribose 3’ hydroxy (-OH) chemical groups can be easily manipulated to add modifications of interest.
Such substrate modified dCTP molecules (sub-dCTP) establish two separate states of cytidine nucleotides: Substrate dCTP and catalytically converted Product dCTP.
The switching of substrate dCTP to product dCTP is achieved when an active enzyme catalyzes the removal of the unique modification. Take this into consideration, there could be 3 ways such stable equilibrium of different cytidines could be utilized for activity recording:
1. Substrate nucleotides can be too bulky and thus are structurally hindered to be incorporated by phi29, meaning only catalytically converted product nucleotides are incorporated.
2. Substrate nucleotides can be incorporated into the DNA sequence, however modification did on substrate as it its converted to product restricts the incorporation of product nucleotides
3. Both, substrate and product nucleotides are accessible to phi29 DNA polymerase and can be incorporated into the DNA sequence.
This creates a number of new variable – substrate deoxycytidine concentration and product deoxycytidine concentration – which are proportional to the activity of the enzyme that catalyzed the reaction. These variable can be imbedded in to the very sequence of DNA as incorporated nucleotides and read during next generation sequencing as a ratio to a reference nucleotide. The ratio of incorporated reference and"

Introduction
=Overall Project=
The ultimate goal of USTC_Software 2010 team is to promote synthetic biology throughout the world. To attract more people who do not have biology background to be interested in this area, we plan to develop a modeling-and-simulation game specially designed for synthetic biology. Users are taught to learn the basic knowledge in the area via constructing their genetic circuits as input to our software and try to understand the system behavior as output. This is the basic functional module. We also plan to develop a rating system to grade users' design for given tasks, and a more friendly game interface that can fill the process of input with joy and ease. Though more functions are expected, we focus on the basic module, modeling-and-simulation, at the first stage of our project.
In practice, many CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides."

Sensing
Sensing of Staphylococcus aureus
Sensing of S. aureus AIP-II by the two-component system AgrCA BBa_K1351036 was evaluated in B. subtilis using the target promoters P2 BBa_K1351037 and P3 BBa_K1351037 .
The W168 strain was discovered to possibly be incapable for this experiment due to extracellular proteases destroying the synthetic AIPs. We identified the protease deficient strain B. subtilis WB700 as proper candicate for the sensing. We successfully transformed the WB700 strain with the sensor construct pBS4S-PxylA-agrCA. Unfortunately, the resistances of this strain were incompatible with our reporter construct.
Sensing of Streptococcus pneumoniae
The two-component system ComDE BBa_K1351016 from Streptococcus pneumoniae, introduced into B. subtilis, can sense the QS-peptide CSP and activate the corresponding promoters PcomC BBa_K1351024 and PcomAB BBa_K1351025"

APPROACH 1
Details
Auxotrophe approach
Photocaged ONB-tyr
Our aim is to create a rapid UV-response system, so people can be rapidly warned of an UV-exposure.  For this reason, we’ve decided to work with a photocaged amino acid. One of our PIs, Professor Patrice Soumillon, has already worked with those compounds during his doctoral thesis and knows how efficiently they work. We’ve used the ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONB-Tyr) for its relatively low price compared with other photocaged amino acids. The cage, the ONB molecule, is cleaved when exposed to UV rays, and releases the tyrosine for protein synthesis (Fig 1).
We placed the ONB-Tyr inside a liquid cell culture. Our cell culture is a tyrosine auxotroph (TyrA-) E. coli culture. Those cells contain a plasmid with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene. We used the RFP gene from the BBa_K577882 Biobrick, developed by Boston University and Wellensly College for iGEM 2011 (Fig 2). It consists of a pBad promoter, a RBS, a RFP, and a terminator. The RFP originally comes from a coral, Discosoma striata and gives a red color.
We used a pBad promoter to induce the RFP expression when the biomass is sufficient to produce a good signal.
We worked with a liquid M9 minimal medium, adding ONB-Tyr. As our chassis is Tyr auxotroph, it can’t produce the RFP, except when exposed to UV rays, as the uncaged tyrosine is free for protein synthesis.
Finally, when the badge is exposed to UV rays, the tyrosine is uncaged, making it available for RFP synthesis, and the solution turns red!

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Internal_-_-_TEXT.html," related to themselves. Indeed, since there is production of AHL and LuxR in the cell, the transcriptional network is always active so the steps concerning the transcriptional network lose their importance. It is thus only a matter of understanding the metabolism, production and degradation terms to correctly model cell A.
Figure 7: Sensitivity analysis of parameters in cell A
We do the same for cell B. In cell B the output is the production of CheZ and RFP and the results are plotted in figure 8. We notice that CheZ-GFP is highly sensitive for the association rates of the LuxR/AHL complex and the LuxR/AHL dimer. RFP production is also sensitive for the association of the LuxR/AHL dimer.
We see that in cell B the dimerisation steps are really important. This is logical since cell B is dependent on external AHL concentrations to boot the transcriptional network. Thus, the steps concerning the binding of AHL to LuxR and making the activated LuxR/AHL dimer, which starts the transcription, are the most important steps. They determine the sensitivity of the network to AHL and as so, form the major component of the network.
Figure 8: Sensitivity analysis of parameters in cell B
Conclusion
We conclude from these results that our model displays the desired behavior. In both cell A and cell B, there is a big difference between cells in ON and OFF mode. In addition, the presence of AHL also has a big effect on cell B. The simulation also show a problem: altough we equiped the proteins with a LVA-tag, the degradation rate is still very slow and this can affect the cell behavior. We can also get semi-quantitative results from this model, but our assumption of an unlimited substrate pool leads to very high amount of biomolecules. A next step would be to fit some model parameters to wet lab data.
From the sensitivy analysis, we know which parameters are the most important and should be optimized. For cell A we should focus on metabolic, transcriptional and translational terms and for cell B we should focus on the dimerization steps.

Bordeaux,2018,Team:Bordeaux#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," in available cellular energy caused by the inhibition of enzymes such                         as alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (4), and two key glycolytic                         enzymes (hexokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (5). The reactive aldehyde groups                         in furfural family increases accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequences of ROS are                         well known for causing DNA damage, membrane damage and protein misfolding (6).
We decided to investigate the toxicity of HMF. We found out through social media, that the project of                         iGEM Leiden involved the detection of bacterial cell stress. Because HMF is a known to be a toxin,                         we suggested that it would be interesting for us to test this on iGEM Leiden’s bacterial stress detection                         system, and they wholeheartedly agreed.
Following a skype session to discuss the details of our collaboration, we send them 2mL of solution containing                         5 g/L HMF.
It allowed them to test the compound at various concentrations on four of their stress detection strains:                         pDnaK (10), pRpoE (11), pSoxS (12) and pCspA (13).
Results of exposure to HMF show no stress reaction for the pCspA-GFP (figure 2A) and pRpoE-GFP (figure                         2C) strains. CspA is involved in metabolism related stress and RpoE is involved in protein synthesis                         stress. Because both strains did not invoke a stress reaction, there is no indication that HMF delivers                         stress in these pathways. However, to firmly conclude these stresses are not being experienced, more                         extensive testing is needed, since these are just two promoters involved in these stress pathways.
Both the pDnaK-GFP (figure 2B) and pSoxS-GFP strains (figure 2D) do show some responses when exposed                         to 0.5µg/mL HMF. DnaK is involved in the process of chromosomal DNA replication and SoxS is involved                         in DNA damage repair. Therefore, these results indicate that HMF delivers stress to bacteria by damaging their DNA and disturbing their replication process.
However, the stress being experienced at these HMF concentrations seems to be low. They shared these                         results with us which help us with our project, provide us with insight into the effect of HMF on                         bacterial cell processes. We are very thankful for this meaningful collaboration and look forward"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," their effects. We are also interested in creating hybrid silk with more than one bacteriocin incorporated, to see if they have a better effect than single bacteriocins between the silk. Our hypothesis is that silk fiber, which is proven to be immune neutral and promotes wound healing, combined with the antimicrobial effect of the bacteriocins, would create a synergistic effect resulting in decreasing infections and also a decrease in healing time in patients with severe wounds.
We tried to ligate the bacteriocin together with a silk fragment, but we did not succeed despite having the proper overhangs. The next step will then be to make more experiments with the goal of making a successful ligation between the bacteriocins and a silk construct. In theory we should succeed, so it might just take some more trials before we do.
Improving the production of PHB
PHB should be used as the envelope for our Bacto-Aid. To do this, we first need to optimize the production of PHB even further. This can be done by changing the current gene (phaCAP) in the BioBrick from Tokyo Tech 2012  with a stronger promoter and an additional stronger RBS. The use of a weak promoter and an additional weak RBS might also be an aspect in how much PHB there can be produced in the cell. The new device should then be added to our secretion system instead of the old from Tokyo Tech 2012 BioBrick, and hopefully make the E. coli produce even more PHB than we see now.
To produce more rentable PHB, we should first consider which microorganism to use to make the mass production of PHB most efficient. We have considered using Ralstonia eutropha and Bacillus subtilis, which are two commonly used organisms in the industry. Secondly we need to develop our production so it fits with a continuous stirred-tank reactor. We will imply this reactor for large scale production, so we will be able to regulate parameters such as temperature, oxygen level and amount of required nutrients for the chosen organism. It will likewise also be good if we could decrease the use of chemicals to make the production more profitable.

Achievements
Our project is focused on fundamental issues related to measurement and computation in cells. For our Human Practices work, we decided to educate people about our project. For which, we made a game, Codonut, which describes codon preference in a fun way. Apart from this, we pondered over what avenue we should direct our energies for human practices and public outreach. We settled on Genetically Modified foods for several reasons, the most important being the raging debate ongoing in our country over certain crops like GM mustard and the impact it would have on agriculture and farmers.
GMO in India
Agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector in India which accounts for approximately 13.7% GDP and 50% of the workforce (approx. 600 million). The conventional technology currently in use is not self-sufficient for the ever-growing population. Several pesticides and insecticides are used which deteriorates the environment. Owing to the genetically modified (GM) crops' high productivity, low pesticides and insecticides usage, drought resistance and high nutritional quality, we took the task of exploring more about the GM technology and creating awareness on both the fronts, pros and cons.
Currently in India, 93% of cotton grown is Bt cotton. There are several genetically modified crops including rice, maize, mustard etc. are under field trials, with a huge ongoing debate scrutinizing its bio-safety levels. For a new GM crop to be introduced, it has to go through many regulatory processes by the government.
Since most of the population is unaware of GM technology, we tried to understand the advantages and disadvantages of GM crops along with how it is tested for safety in India. This prompted us to investigate GMO related issues by reaching out to it's stakeholders, general public (consumers and farmers), NGOs and regulatory authorities. Our objectives were to make them answer the following questions:
1. What percent of general public have heard of GMO and are aware of it's economical, technical and political implications?
2. What is the perception of public regarding the consumption of GM foods?
3. What do people believe as better in GM patenting regime of the country?
4. What makes a person opt for GM food consumption? Is it better knowledge and understanding of GM?
Considering these, we designed our survey. We conducted our survey in colleges of four different states with the help of SVCE Chennai , IISc Banglore , IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur (total"

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb. The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," main focus was dedicated to ethics in science. We did this to underline two things - how important ethics are, and how aware you must be of them.
In our project, the main focus of ethics have been on the discussion if it should be okay to bring life to Mars.
At the moment, international legislation is not yet ready for the extensive phenomenon that is space exploration - regarding anything outside of Earth as international waters, and decreeing that any cargo brought into it be sterile. This is not possible to achieve when dealing with a bioreactor, and as such our task was less in considering the ethics and more in engaging the public and starting the dialogue that might end in more enlightened legislation.
Current rules are stopping humankind from developing outside of Earth, and we have attempted to get the ball rolling to a more sensible and specific legislation.
To investigate the yield of the workshop, we asked our participants to answer a survey, where 66,66% answered that they found the ethics part useful. This shows us that ethics of science still needs more focus.
Social media
As another way kind of media, is social media, where people from all over the world can share, tweet and snap about their life, we found it very fit for us to be on both Facebook and Twitter.
On Twitter we have 386 followers and have tweeted 256 images and stories.

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," would be happy with a set of algorithms that work for n parts, and either a fully fledged top-down or bottom-up approach to creating custom tailored designs for certain permutations.
6/29/11
- Today I began playing with a simple algorithm called the Pancake Algorithm.
Pancake Algorithm
The pancake algorithm is a sorting method which can take any permutation of n parts and sort the permutation with 2*n steps or fewer.  The following explains how this algorithm works:
For iteration i = 0 to n-1
1.  Looking at the subset of elements 1 to n-i of the current permutation, find the largest value and set this as your current element of interest.
2.  Check if that element is already the last element in the current subset.  If it is, then leave it alone and move on to the next iteration.  If the element is at the beginning of the subset, then complete only step 4.  Otherwise, if the element is not at the beginning or the end of the subset, then complete both steps 3 and 4.
3.  Place the current element at the front of the configuration by flipping every element to the left of the current element's position, including the current element.
4.  Now that the current largest element is at the front of the configuration, we want to place it at the end of the configuration.  Thus, we can flip the entire subset.
The following is an example of pancake sorting, given the input 4,1,3,2.  Each line below shows which flips must be made in order to sort this permutation:
Starting configuration 4,1,3,2.
4,1,3,2
2,3,1,4
3,2,1,4
1,2,3,4
Since the pancake method is a sorting algorithm with a permutation input and a sorted output, we can imagine that the pancake algorithm could instead take in a sorted input and spit out a permutation within 2n steps.  I am working on translating this design into a scalable invertase architecture.
6/30/11
- I now have a function that takes in the number of parts, n, and spits out a string design with all of the invertases in place.  These invertases should allow us to use the pancake algorithm to create any permutation of parts.  The complexity of the this invertase placement pancake algorithm is O(n^2).  My next goal is to create a key generator which takes in a permutation of parts, and"

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," have common momments and vinyards don't heasitate to mix anti-mildew and anti-oidium solutions making the concentrations of these chemicals twice more concentrated in the grounds.
Downy mildew requires optimum conditions to reproduce and infect. A warm, moist, and humid environment is required. Studies in Sicily have shown optimum time for oospore germination is between the end of February and the middle of March. With this understanding, if fungicides are used just before these conditions occur, and have proven to be efficient measures. Other methods include proper watering, and a good location where the plant can receive continual sunlight.

Business time : SWOT Analysis
Using Strengths to take Advantage of Opportunities
The reproducibility of our project and the high quantities of E. coli and Saccharomyces c. are in line with the future demand of vineyards.
Using Strengths to avoid Threats
The Curdlan ecological argue will convince biovineyards to use it. Indeed, we told you before that Bouillie Bordelaise wasn't good for the ground whereas Curdlan hasn't side effect on it.
Overcoming Weaknesses by taking Advantage of Opportunities
The Lack of expertise and our limited synthetic biology knowledge are overcome by our PhD presence.
Minimizing Weaknesses to avoid Threats
Being undergraduate and inexperienced team leaves us in a questionnable position compete against experienced laboratories. Moreover, our no recoil on the project may not be interested laboratories and societies.
iGEM Bordeaux: Contacting vineyards
To try to see the effect that mildew has on wine producers, iGEM Bordeaux contacted numerous castles in the region and attended the two biggest wine assemblies in Bordeaux: La foire au vin and Vinexpo. This allowed us to speak to the producers on how much their production is threatened by oomycetes such as mildew and to see if they would eventually be interested in an alternative preventive solution that would be eco-friendly. At the same time, this allowed us to search for sponsors in the region to raise money for our lab work. Unfortunately, since these assemblies bring together mostly the commercial team who's aim is to land big clients, our sponsoring wasn't successful.

According to the Nanodrop manual, ""If the ratio is appreciably lower, this may indicate the presence of co-purified contaminants. "" It seems that Z0842 is entirely suspect, so we should try re-doing the miniprep tomorrow.  Should innoculate a culture tonight in order to do that.
Also, realized that it would be beneficial to miniprep some of the yeast plasmids in preparation for the necessary insertions of parts into shuttle vectors.  Thus, in addition to Z0842, also innoculated three cultures with pRS304*, pRS305, and pRS306.  Put these cultures in around 5 pm.  Will try to check up on them around 10 am tomorrow, giving them roughly 17 hours in the incubator (again, put tubes at a slant).
Transformations of remaining limiter parts will be postponed until their significance can be demonstrated in the construction scheme.  For now, it is more important to construct the simple test devices to show that the functional parts we received are, indeed, functional in our testing conditions.
These simple test devices consist of two constructs.  The first construct is either a repressor or an activator, while the second construct is a reporter that has specific paired activity with the first.  We will be testing their function not only in a different yeast strain than that used in the original testing of these parts (MHY500 or MHY501 as opposed to PSY580A) but also in different media (i.e. a mixture of methionine and galactose at set concentrations rather than galactose and raffinose?).

Figure 8 The experiment results of Group 1-3 original HPLC peak area result shown in bar. Green bar is eGFP as control. It's                     clear that M9 and anaerobic cultivation performed better for urate consuming.
Here's the original experiment result.
To verify the theory whether the consuming of the urate is due to the cell lysis after cell death, we centrifuged the M9                     anaerobic cultivated medium and added its 100ul supernatant and 10min-heated 100ul supernatant respectively                     into 900ul PBS with 3M Urate(PH=8.0) to react in 37 ℃ for 2h. To our surprise, result shows that there’s                     no urate consuming detected for each experiment (Figure 9). We suppose that the enzymes might not be leaked to the outside, and the bacteria can utilize urate when the environment is fully loaded, which                     leaves a pressure on them. More experiment and repeats should be conducted to find the mechanism in the                     future.
Figure 9 The result shows that the supernatant cannot utilize urate, which is not consistent with the hypothesis we raised                     before. It may indicate that the bacteria can utilize the urate in a special stage without leakage.
No matter what, the urate concentration outside is lowered anyway, even in LB medium it can meet our requirement to reduce the urate about 100uM. But the real condition in the human gut is so complicated: a. Nutrition environment is hard to simulate because of the circadian rhythm of food intake, the food eaten and the enzymes released by intestine. b. The effect of gut microbiome. c. the peristalsis process in the intestine. d. the oxygen environment. To evaluate whether our project can work in the real condition, we decided to do the animal experiment.
Our animal experiment is conducted with the permission from the Institutional Review Board of West China Medical Center,                     Sichuan University.
Firstly, we measured the ability of bacteria colonization. E .coli Nissle 1917 transformed with eGFP-pSB1C3 was given by                     oral gavage[7]. After gavage, we collected the feces every two days and cultivated it in 3x chloramphenicol                     LB medium overnight."
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". Probably by then we would have the VibriClone strain that can live in colder temperatures, eliminating the fridge problem.
Our vision is to establish our Vibrigens Interlab study over the next years by improving everything we learned this year, and subsequent years. Vibrio natriegens made an appearance in many labs in europe, but next year we want to expand to other continent, to share with more people how this organism can truly change the day to day workflow in labs everywhere.
German Meetup
As this years Marburg iGEM Team 2018 had the honor to continue the tradition of our predecessors to host the german iGEM Meetup. The meeting was established to exchange experiences earned while participating in the competition as well as getting feedback about our projects from people with a fresh perspective.
People discussing at posters
Marburg is not only at the heart of Germany, but also a very charming city with a rich academic tradition while balancing at the cutting edge of Science.    On Friday the 22th, the teams started arriving in Marburg, where our city's campground had been booked for the meetup. Quickly, the tents were set up and everyone settled in. After giving out some welcome gifts, a tour of the old town was undertaken. Small groups of iGEMees were led by a member of Marburg’s team to discover some hidden gems in the narrow alleyways between the medieval buildings.
The Marburg iGEM Team proudly presenting the meetups schedule
The next day, Saturday, started with a breakfast buffet at the great auditorium, followed by speakers from the German association of synthetic biology (GASB), crystals first, a startup, and Rüdiger Trojok, a well-known member of Germanys growing biohacker scene.   To sharpen our presentation skills as well as getting fresh impulses and new directions beyond the current state of the projects, the participating teams brought posters with an outline of their work and preliminary results. All teams decided on interesting projects covering a wide range of topics, and presented those convincingly, resulting in a very stimulating atmosphere for all iGEMees.   We want to thank all the people who came to our little town and made this weekend the great experience it was. We want to thank the teams from Bielefeld , Düsseldorf , Hamburg , Erlangen , Darmstadt , Würzburg , Aachen , Hamm Lippstadt , München , Tübingen , Stuttgart , Göttingen and our visitor from Taiwan for attending!   We are looking forward to seeing you again in Boston!

BBa_K1166001
The Fumarate-Nitrate Reductase protein or FNR helps hypoxic promoters to have a more sensitive hypoxic response, it works as an activator and repressor for oxygen-dependant genes. Activity is proven by comparing the expression of GFP (BBa_E0040) by promoters with and without the simultaneous expression of the FNR protein (BAL38390.1).
BBa_K1166002
We assembled this device to save time and ligation reactions for future teams wanting to use the E.coli secretion system. This secretion device includes all the necessary elements (linker-HlyA secretion signal peptide and the expression cassette for HlyB and HlyD) for the secretion of expression cassettes cloned in the 5' terminal of the device.
This secretion device is usable by Silver standard fusion in its 5' end for proteins with no stop codon. Codes for both the proteins HlyB and HlyD (native from uropathogenic strains of E. coli), which, along with the constitutively expressed TolC protein, form a secretion channel. This secretion system recognizes proteins tagged with the C-terminal secretion signal peptide HlyA, and secretes them to the exterior of the bacteria.

Entrepreneurship
Cornell iGEM recognizes that synthetic biology is so much more than just work done at the lab bench. That’s why this year, we have decided to take our policy and practices to the next level by pursuing our fishPHARM idea from the perspective of a profitable business. To this end, we have engaged in the following entrepreneurship endeavors to facilitate the growth of fishPHARM as not only a synthetic biology based project, but as a locally-based business venture capable of curing BCWD worldwide.
Biotech Resource Center, McGovern Institute Family Center for Venture Development
We have spoken extensively with Marla Coppolino, the Director of Business Development and Outreach for the Institute of Biotechnology at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. Marla has helped to guide Cornell iGEM through the business start-up procedure as well as connect Cornell iGEM to the necessary business experts on Cornell campus. At the McGovern Institute, we also presented fishPHARM to a potential investor with fish farm industry expertise, allowing us to develop a clearer hypothesis of customer demands.
eLab @ Cornell
eLab is dedicated to accelerating top Cornell University startups. Established in 2008, by Student Agencies Foundation in collaboration with Entrepreneurship at Cornell, eLab has worked with hundreds of students in turning concepts into real businesses [1]. Cornell iGEM has collaborated with eLab to present fishPHARM at the eLab kickoff event. At the pitchoff, team members .......

Oil Sands Initiative Project Proposal
Reducing the Environmental Footprint of Oil Sands Extraction
Why are we interested?
As a team from Alberta, we know of the economic benefit that the oils sands have brought to the province.  Many members on our team have friends and family employed around the province in the energy industry, however, we are also aware of the environmental impact of the oils sands, specifically the tailings ponds.  We feel it is important not only to clean the tailings ponds, but be able to extract the potential energy of the residue bitumen concurrently.  Our team has previously worked on related projects in past years providing us with experience in techniques required to complete this project and potential problems that may arise.  Also, being able to work on a project where we will be able to test our bacteria on real life samples gives us a physical goal as opposed to other, more esoteric projects.
The Approach
The long term goal of our project will be to create a dry powder that will enzymatically degrade tailing ponds with no live bacteria, similar to how the pills taken for lactose intolerance contain enzymes for dealing with lactose.  However this will require many intermediate steps.  The initial goal of our project will be to create three separate modules for use in a bacteria test chassis.  These modules will 1) degrade target contaminants into useful metabolites , 2) induce cell death and 3) concentrate the modules in microcompartments .  Upon successful testing of each module, they will be combined into one cell chassis (E. coli).  This chassis will then be optimized to live in a tailing pond environment by selective evolution.  By combining our modules in microcompartments, we can extract the enzymes required to process tailings ponds and avoid putting live genetic organisms into the wild.
The Modules
Bacteria have been found in tailings ponds and even in asphault.  They have been shown to be able to degrade many organic compounds in nature.  The pathways responsible for degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons produce catechol, a colourless, ortho-substituted benzene with two hydroxyl groups as an intermediate.  Our goal is to increase the rate of catechol degradation by optimizing the pathway for introduction into the tailings.  We will use a pathway which degrades catechol into a semialdehyde which is usable by the bacteria and can be further degraded into usable resources such as ethanol or methanol.

We used E. coli strain DH5a for plasmid replication and BL21 for high level expression of our protein of interest. We would like to build a non invasive home diagnostic kit for Dengue Fever. Engineered bacteria will produce scFv antibody which has ability against glycoprotein of DEN virus envelope which contained in urine as sample. Our part contains osmY coding reading region, histidine, TEV cleave site, and scFv antibody. osmY coding region will produce peptide as signal which work due to osmotic shock. Histidine as protein tag for the nickel column purification. TEV cleave site will cut the scFV antibody from other protein. scFv which contained in our part consist of light chain, heavy chain, and Myc tag. We work at laboratory which has safety level 2 procedures. We wear rubber hand gloves, google glasses, and safety jacket. We sterilize all the waste based on the safety procedures that we used then wash our hands after work. We will put our antibody inside a small enclosed device that ordinary people can buy, like a test pack for pregnancy. It will has a very low risk. It will not harm human health, because it will detects the envelope glycoprotein of Dengue Virus that present in urine. If it reveals any threats in the future, we will withdraw all the products from market and examine what is wrong with our product or its system that we used then we fix it. From the device, it will give a result form the test. If it is positive, we also build a software to record personal data from patient which will be saved in the central database of the Ministry of Health.

There are several step that we made to create
1. Design
We design envelope glicoprotein DENV 1 and DENV 2 antigen also there EDE1C8 antibody include TEV protease. That design is sequence of nucleotide that sticky-ended.
2. CoCulture

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"-assisted food production. Since our crops are not genetically modified themselves, we had to look past existing legislation for answers.
First, we contacted Barbara Lifton, New York State Legislature Assemblywoman and member of the Assembly agriculture committee. We felt that contacting our local state representative was a great baseline into synthetic biology policy. Assemblywoman Lifton was glad to talk to us, and told us that most genetic modification regulation is based on the federal level rather than the state level. She also emphasized the distinction between legislative and regulatory departments in government. Therefore, we looked into current policy by regulatory agencies such as the  Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [2].
In 2010, shortly after the first “synthetic organism” was produced at the J. Craig Venter Institute, the Obama Administration released a report on emerging issues in bioethical research. One of its primary goals was to describe how oversight of synthetic biology projects would move going forward. The report posited that many cases should be regulated on a case-by-case basis with the FDA and USDA, while others should be generally monitored by the two agencies (as well as the EPA) [3]. Our project would specifically fall under APHIS, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection service. Currently however, APHIS lacks a robust approach to regulating technologies that rely on engineered organisms to assist crop growth. There is ambiguity on how to proceed, as a rule that would allow for the USDA to assess risks and use existing policies to regulate such technology has been stalled for years with no signs to indicate a change in the near future [2].
The EPA and FDA are even less clear on policies regarding our project. It is unlikely OxyPonics would be subject to EPA regulations, given that the only chemicals produced are our enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, which are commercially available and do not fall under the category of “new chemicals” that the EPA regulates [4]. The FDA’s general policy towards GM crops is that they are fine so long as they are “substantially equivalent” to non-GM crops [5]. Despite its jurisdiction, the FDA has unclear policies regarding products that utilize genetically engineered organisms to produce a separate end product, as is done in our project. Our unique approach, which doesn’t modify the crop itself, places OxyPonics in a grey area with the FDA regarding their GM-regulations.
However, we aim for OxyPonics to eventually be used in full scale hydroponic systems. This means we must guarantee our end products follow"

safety concerns
As a software team, our team does not produce any typical biological safety or ethnic issues. However, we still take safety into account from as many aspects as possible:
1. Safety for programmers
Most of our work is mainly done in front of computers, which is not ergonomically to programmers as working in such environment may cause much exhaust and stress. Therefore, we made a series of regulations to guarantee they are not exposed to computers constantly for too long time and recreational area is within 10 meters. What is more, every time our programmers go to web labs, we make sure that there would be safety equipment as well as accompanies for them.
2. Safety for public
We are aware what our software will bring to teenagers or youngsters, and our software is ensured that no violent or sexual scene or content is included. We also did a lot of work to estimate and reduce the possible errors or faults users may encounter in the future.
3.Safety for software
To better protect our intellectual property rights, we have consulted IPRs centre of USTC in case of future problem. We will restrict the use of our software and we will apply for a patent later.
4.Safety for campus
We are quite aware when we perform our work or lecture in campus, and no disorder or turbulence has shown during in the above activity.
5.Other safety concerns
(i) Our team made no new BioBrick parts (or devices), and no safety issues happened from this. (ii)No biosafety group or committee protested our project.
Suggestions for future development of safety in dry lab.
Although a lot of work is done to ensure the safety of programmers in dry lab, a lot of work still remains to be done. And here we present some brief ideas on how we can develop the safety for programmers.
1. In many conditions, programmers in a dry lab have to share places with experiment operators due to limited space, which may lead to underlying health problems. Therefore, we suggest that strict rules should be made to provide independent space for programmers.
2. We take it for granted that not only safety for programmers, but the safety for intellectual property should be taken into consideration. Thus we suggest that all codes and other achievement should be granted with copyrights before sharing.

Will is also thinking of opening a silver chloriding company called ""NaCl bois"".  Unfortunately, they now have to glue all these electrodes into the holes. Luis did grocecry shopping on Ocado, while chatting with Josh. Luis finally ordered BreakOut boards (15), which costed 140£.  Also there are bad news: Sigma Aldrich (now Merck apparently...) made a mistake with our order and there is no more Pyocyanin until next friday. We only have 5 mL left and we are rationising it for the most significant experiments. Therefore , we could not do the whole plate stimulation experiment, which also  took longer than expected.

Project Introduction
As the field of Synthetic Biology is on the rise, iGEM is growing up very fast and the number of parts in the parts registry is increasing with the addition of more complex parts each day. After facing some difficulty while running our algorithms on the parts registry, the need for standardization of parts entry was apparent.
 
By following the basics of professional software development approaches, we are aiming to overcome the issues that can be observed while building extensive and complex databases. Entity Relationship Model (ER) diagrams has been applied in order to design an extensible database. We are currently developing Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to define the requirements for each part in the registry and building blocks of the software such as algorithm, user interface, web server etc. Software Design Description (SDD) approach will be helping us while developing the final software and design art elements of the software that will deliver the database requirements . Our Quality Plan (QP) will point out the risks of the designed software and help us with the risk management.These professional software development approaches are helping us to communicate with a common language between the Software oriented and Biology oriented members in the team. We are using graph theoretic modeling to visualize the relations between iGEM Parts and to standardize the represantation of the parts as much as possible by graph theoretical methods. It will help us when we try to find input output relations between the parts. Furthermore, our program will be able to provide alternative pathways to construct the most reliable Biobrick devices with respect to given inputs and expected outputs as a Biobrick Guide.

Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Safety#QA_-_-_TEXT.html,"ization contributes to the bio-safety. With a proper standard on BioBricks, the utility of parts and devices and the synthesis of new ones will be of safety. Therefore, we hold the idea that a library with detailed information and explanation in registering and sorting BioBricks should be established.
As for bio-safety engineering, nucleotide near the gene of BioBricks can be edited, in order to protect the nucleotide sequence from unexpected change. With a certain protective method, gene will become steady and involve less possibility to do wrong, then, parts, devices and systems can be made safer.

We then analyze the broth though SDS-PAGE and western blot (showed in Figure 3). According to the results, molecule weight of injanus was around 8kDa and the injanus fermentation broth was mainly in two states, monomer and dimer. Dimer injanus binds better with the primary antibody of injanus.
In addition, we compared the production of injanus after fermentation in bioreactor and flask cultivation. The concentration of injanus in broth was measured by UPLC, and the standard curve of concentration with adsorption area of UPLC was measured using pure injanus samples. Figure 4b shows the cell fresh weight and injanus production in different methanol induction days (Figure 4b). After 4 days’ induction, in bioreactor the cell fresh reached 365g/L and in the meantime the injanus density reached 0.3g/L, which was about 10 times the production of injanus in flask cultivation. Results of SDS-PAGE indicated that the production of injanus kept increasing during the 4 day’s induction (Figure. 4a).

Enquete Gowanus Part 1: Collection from Genspace NYC on YouTube.
Presentation of our iGEM Project to Gowanus Canal Conservancy staff and volunteers
Our team was invited to present our proposal for biosensors along the canal at the Gowanus Canal Conservancy volunteers meeting. At the meeting we were able to explain that Biosensors like canaries in the coal mine. We explained that our project consists of creating a combined nitrate and quorum sensing biosensor that will detect nitrogenous wastes and E.coli present in human feces from sewage leakage into the canal after the dredging and capping operations. The biosensor would be an efficient way to detect whether sewage or nitrogenous wastes are present in the canal after it has been dredged and capped (with clay, sand and rocks) in the future. The biosensors would provide a visual output by the amount of red fluorescence displayed on the biosensor. we emphasized that at the moment the deployment was hypothetical, and that we had come to get their input about the desirability of our proposed sensor.
Individual community members had differing reactions to the biosensor. Some were surprising to us. There was an almost fatalistic feeling around the pollution in the canal, and one resident  expressed the opinion that they had concern around “dumping something else into the canal” but that it would be “acceptable if it had a good purpose” and one commented that “ As long as the intention is not to dump harmful waste into the canal then we are fine”              In general they were intrigued by the possibility of a real-time biosensor. Some suggestions were “maybe you would need to do some mktg so it does not get lumped into the GMO category” and   “the design of the membrane is super important”.
When queried about what the ideal form of sensor would be, they asked if it could be made to sense different types of pollution, if it could be made “visually stunning” and if it would give real-time feedback. One thing that surprised us was that, given the choice between a sensor that was in the canal and a kit that they could use to pull a water sample out and test it (eliminating the potential danger of the sensor releasing genetically modified bacteria into the canal) they overwhelmingly preferred the deployment into the canal. The reason was that they felt a visual reminder along the canal of the polluted state of the waterway would more effectively drive community engagement and potentially move residents to action. It occurred to us after the meeting that perhaps if we had engaged a group"
