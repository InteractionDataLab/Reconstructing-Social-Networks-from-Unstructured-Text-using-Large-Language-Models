As the iGEM web said, before you pick up your first pipette you should think about Human Practices.                     Human Practices is an integral aspect of iGEM.
As we advance our project, we always think about how our work be responsible and good for the                     world. At                     the same time, we want the society to influence the direction of our project. In order to show what                     we                     did in Human Practices part, we divided an iGEM project into four parts: purpose, design,                     execution,                     and outreach, demonstrate respectively in the Integrated Human Practices                     and Education & Public Engagement modules.
Now, we present you how we use HP as a channel to open up the gap between the laboratory and the                     society.

The bright red cells seen in Marchantia transformed with the TsPurple construct
It is notable that in the red cells, the vacuole is not visually distinct from the cytoplasm. As GFP, a protein of similar structure, is not accumulated in the vacuole without specific targeting, this implies that either the colour we observe in the bright cells is not due to chromoprotein expression, or perhaps that tsPurple is toxic enough to cause cellular damage and leaky organelles.
Plants transformed with asPink (which is also known as asFP595 due to its fluorescence), nuclear localised with an N7 tag, while not visibly pigmented, did have areas that fluoresced at the literature wavelengths.
Part of an asPink::N7 transformant visualised using a fluorescence microscope with under a GFP filter (this particular filter gives a yellow signal for reddish fluorescent proteins. signal is present in the RFP filter, but difficult to image due to chlorophyll fluorescence)  one with wavelength windows that intersect those of asPink's absorption and emission peaks)  Taking a confocal stack of a small portion of the plants, we observed the following.
Left: asPink-N7 transformed plant. Right: GFP-LTI transformed plant. The laser excitation wavelength was 595nm. The red channel corresponds to 597-614nm, and the blue channel corresponds to chlorophyll autofluorescence at 647nm+
These images suggest that what we observed was indeed expression of asPink.  We also did absorbance assays of the chromoproteins in E. coli for comparison.
Raspberry ketone production
As another example output module, the biosynthetic pathway from coumaroyl-coA to raspberry ketone was assembled, to allow the smell of raspberries to be used as an odour signal that the input module has been activated.
To characterise the enzymes involved, a bacterial constructs was made, and the E. Coli transformed with it we called RaspberrE coli. The construct consisted of an arabinose inducible expression plasmid coding for 4-coumarate coA ligase, benzalacetone synthase, and benzalacetone reductase, and the strain of E. Coli we used had the TnaA indole synthase gene knocked out to somewhat reduce the faecal odour associated with this molecule."

Mind the Gut promoters
Yesterday we got new backbones with Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance. So now we can finally clone the promoters Gad, Gad+RBS and PyeaR into these backbones and start assembling them with effectors. Today we started this process by digesting the backbones, a small but important step which we forgot to do last time,and the promoters with EcoRI and SpeI.
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We have cloned and transformed 6 IDT gBlocks today: antiTNA1, antiTNA2, KAT, GAD, FldHC-TPH1 and Pyear-TPH1
Thursday 30th July
Interlabstudy
The colonies of the promoters grew well, we got colonies on all three plates and they all showed green fluorescence! Hurray! So we picked three colonies from each plate to make glycerol stocks which we are going to use for the final step which is making liquid cultures that we are going to use for measurements. Hopefully, we can finish the Interlabstudy next week.
Mind the Gut: Effectors
Our transformations did not work. We PCRed even more PSB1C3 so that we can repeat everything all over again.

Much to our disappointment, we had no colony growth for the effector transformed. We decided to incubate the plates longer.
Meanwhile we also made mini-preps of GAD and FldHC-TPH1 with thermoscientific kit. We also ran a diagnostic digestion gel but only one band was visible, which we believe was only our plasmid of approximately 2kb. As we had only use 2ul of DNA and nano drop had shown considerably lower concentration of DNA, we decided the repeat the diagnostic digestion the next day.

He did not agree with my idea, which had neither theoretical backing nor experimental support. Because of the disagreement on the experimental procedure, I started to work alone at one side of a table while, on the other side, Dr. Johnson and his assistant Yo Saiga continued their efforts to extract a luciferin by grinding luminous tissues with sand. It was an awkward situation.
The basic principle of isolating a bioluminescent substance is to extract it from the tissue under conditions that reversibly inhibit luminescence, or that cause a selective inactivation, consumption, or removal of a component necessary for light emission. In the case of a luciferin- luciferase system, for example, the luciferin is usually extracted with methanol, which stops luminescence by inactivating the luciferase. And the luciferase can be obtained from an aqueous extract after the luciferin has been exhausted by several minutes of spontaneous luminescence reactions. If a cofactor is involved in light emission, its removal or exhaustion can cause a reversible inhibition of luminescence, as in the case of the firefly bioluminescence system that requires ATP as the cofactor.
In the case of the jellyfish Aequowa, however, the presumed lack of luciferin and luciferase severely limited the range of techniques usable for the extraction of the lightemitting principle. I did believe that jellyfish luminescence requires molecular oxygen like all other known bioluminescence systems (later proved to be incorrect!), but we had no other information about the luminescence system or cofactor requirements. In an effort to find a way to extract the luminescent principle, I tried to inhibit the luminescence of the squeezate by using the anaerobic conditions that were created by vacuum or by the addition of reducing agents, but nothing worked. The results forced me to assume that the jellyfish system, like that of Cypridina, requires a very low oxygen tension-a level less than that attainable in my evacuated container. Furthermore, all of the known enzymatic cofactors, such as ATP, FMN, and DPNH, showed no effect on the luminescence when added. Finally, the only recourse was to try various chemicals available in the stockroom of the Lab, with the hope that one would reversibly inhibit the luminescence. This was clearly an approach that relied entirely on good luck,"
DLUT_China_B,2018,Team:DLUT China B#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"pi r^2}$$
Molecular dynamics calculation:
$$g(r)=\frac{1}{\rho 4\pi r^2}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^N \Delta N(r\to r+\delta r)}{N\times                         T}$$
Where \(N\) is the number of molecules and \(T\) is the calculated time (steps), \(\Delta N\) is                         the number of molecules between \(r\) and \(r+\delta r\).
The radial distribution function can be computed via computer simulation methods. Because the                         peak of the radial distribution function appears at 0.5nm, so the spacing of 5CB molecules is                         around 0.5nm.
2. Calculate the range of β2-M that can perturb 5CB
We assume 5CB molecule as a ellipse (\(a\)=1nm, \(b\)=0.1nm), we got the tilt angles of three                         molecules by Matlab.
Fig.14 The tilt angles are 43°, 64°, 90° respectively.
\(\therefore\)Maximum radius of β2-M that can perturb 5CB (Fig. 10):
\(R_1=[2\times\sin (64^\circ )+1]\mathrm{nm}=\)2.8nm
3. Verification
In the liquid crystal experiment, the droplets dropped on the slide have a radius of about 2                         mm.
$$\therefore S=\pi R^2=4\pi\times 10^{12}\mathrm{nm^2}$$
The molecular weight of β2-M is 11800, the volume of the droplet is 10μL.
The area disturbed by each protein molecule is:
$$r=2.8\mathrm{nm}$$
$$S_0=\pi r^2=7.84\pi\mathrm{nm^2}$$
When the picture is just full colorful, the number of molecules contained in the droplet                         is:
$$N=\frac{S}{S_0}=5.1\times 10^{11}$$
$$m=\frac{11800\times 5.1\times 10^{11}}{6.02\times 10^{23}}=10^{-8}\mathrm{g}$$
\(\therefore\)Maximum concentration is:
\(c=\frac{m}{V}=\)1000ng/mL

You want to know about our project idea in detail? Then this is the right page for you! Here we describe the complete and detailed implementation of our ideas into one project and working parts.
Plasmid design
Optogenetical AND-gate construct (high copy):
The basic idea of the logical gate we are using was developed at UCSF in the lab of Prof. Voigt [ 1 ]. It is based on amber stop-codon suppression via the non-canonical supD tRNA. We designed the part as followed: Our plasmid insert starts with the sequences ( BBa_K322123 and BBa_I15010 ) needed to produce the red light sensing chromophores. Downstream, we cloned the red light sensing promotor ( BBa_R0082 ) in front of the supD tRNA ( BBa_K228001 ). To stop the transcription directly behind the supD tRNA we put in a double terminator sequence ( BBa_B0015 ) downstream. This is followed by a blue light sensing promotor ( BBa_K238013 ). In order to allow ribosome-binding upstream of the next part we introduced a ribosome binding site ( BBa_J44001 ) directly downstream of the blue light sensing promotor. The AND-gate construct is completed by a T7 polymerase with the amber stop codon mutation ( BBa_K228000 ). Since all standard biobrick vectors include a termination sequence after the suffix there was no need to introduce a further termination sequence.
Reporter construct (low copy): Our second plasmid carries the reporter construct, which can be exchanged, depending on what kind of reporter system you want to use. For simple proof of principle we used lacZ ( BBa_I732017 ) as reporter gene downstream of the T7 promotor ( BBa_I712074 ). Since the used lacZ part already includes a ribosome-binding site (rbs), it is not necessary to add another rbs. For the same reason as mentioned under ""Optogenetical AND-gate construct"" we did not add a terminator sequence downstream of lacZ. As alternative we also used gfp behind the T7 promoter( BBa_I746907 ). This made the testing of the other parts easier due to an assay easier to handle than the Miller assay.

Parts
We enabled our bugs to degrade hydrocarbons using standard biological parts, also called BioBricks. These are nucleic acid-encoded molecular biological functions, along with the associated information defining and describing the parts. You can find more information about this on the website of The BioBricks Foundation .
Using these molecules any synthetic biologist or biological engineer can program living organisms. All our parts are available to anyone for free via MIT's Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
After designing the parts, we operated them in E. coli cells. The methods we used are described on the Characterization page.

      Sincere thanks to all those who                                 have helped us over this year, not                                 only for helping on the project, but also for experiencing an unforgettable journey                                 together. Here we describe what we have done by ourselves this year and what was done by                                 others in detail.
  SCU_China in 2017 iGEM
      We started to prepare for                                     2017 iGEM a few weeks after the 2016 iGEM. Team leader, vice team leader and group                                     leaders and reserved team members were determined at that time. We held a short                                     training lasting for almost one week in winter holiday with the help of our                                     instructors. Brainstorms were held to come up with our new project during the                                     training. Several reserved projects were chosen and being considered carefully in                                     Spring semester. During the Spring semester, we held project analysis for several                                     times to learn from other teams. ACMA was successfully held as well. General project                                     frame was determined in May with the help of our teachers, advisors, as well as                                     previous iGEMers. Experiments were done from July to October.
     Details of our winter training will also be introduced                                     to you here.
     Winter training was held a few days after Fall                                     semester. In a training lasting for                                     one week, teachers and speakers will present the basic ideas and knowledge related                                     to molecular biology and synthetic biology. Laboratory safety will also be                                     emphasized. Our primary PI Dr. Nianhui Zhang will lead students to do some basic                                     experiments. Timetable of this year’s winter training is shown in figure 1. Students                                     in winter training mainly are reserved team member selected before. The training is                                     not obligated to reserved team members.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Killswitch#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"oswitch ( BBa_K902023 ) is an RNA element which responds to the presence of the metabolite molybdenum cofactor (MOCO) (Regulski et al, 2008). This RNA element is located in the E.coli genome just upstream of the moaABCDE operon ( BBa_K902024 ), containing the MOCO synthesis genes. MOCO is an important co-factor in many different enzymes. The MOCO riboswitch has 2 regions: an aptamer domain and the expression platform. When MOCO is present in the cell it will bind to the aptamer region in the riboswitch causing an allosteric change. This allosteric change affects the expression platform by physically hiding the ribosome binding site which prevents translation.
Figure 3: This picture depicts the MOCO RNA motif which is upstream of the moaABCDE operon.
Building the Systems
Using these riboswitches, we wanted to design a system where we would place our kill genes downstream, and then supplement our bioreactor with the appropriate ions to keep the systems turned off.  We biobricked and submitted DNA for the the mgtaP ( BBa_K902009 ) and mntP promoter ( BBa_K902073 ) as well as their respective riboswitches ( BBa_K902008 ) ( BBa_K902074 ) and the MOCO riboswitch ( BBa_K902023 ).  In addition, we also biobricked some of the regulatory proteins: PhoP ( BBa_K902010 ), PhoQ ( BBa_K902011 ), mntR ( BBa_K902030 ) and the Moa Operon ( BBa_K902024 ). Our final system would inovolve constitutive expression of these necessary regulatory elements upstream of our riboswitches and kill genes.  An example of the manganese system is shown in Figure 4.

HexaHistidine Encapsulin-OT1
This image was taken in Scaffold Viewer 4, where the peptides identified from mass spec are aligned to the HexaHistidine Encapsulin-OT1 sequence using a peptide threshold of 1% FDR. The OT1 peptide has alignments with peptides at the encapsulin’s                   C terminus which indicates that the OT1 peptide is successfully expressed.

HexaHistidine Encapsulin (control)
Here the HexaHistidine Encapsulin sample’s peptides are aligned to the HexaHistidine Encapsulin-OT1 sequence at 1% FDR cutoff (first image) and at 95% probability cutoff (second image). There are no peptides aligning to the SIINFEKL part                   of the sequence, which is the expected result since our protein does not have the peptide.
Overall the purity of the samples is relatively good, and the important parts of the sequence were clearly identifiable.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that we successfully incorporated the OT1 peptide at the C terminus of our encapsulin vaccine.
Vaccine Validation
Two experiments were performed for the validation of our vaccine system. The first experiment tested the ability of dendritic cells to uptake encapsulin, our vaccine platform. The second experiment tested encapsulin’s ability to mediate                   the neoantigen presentation on MHC-I complexes on the surface of dendritic cells. Note that the word ‘encapsulin’, throughout the whole Vaccine Validation part refers to encapsulin with inserted Hexahistidine (HH) linker.
Validation of Encapsulin Uptake by Dendritic Cells
We hypothesized that an appropriate method of checking the ability of dendritic cells to uptake our vaccine platform encapsulin is through the fluorescent tagging the encapsulin protein, presentation of 60-mer nanoparticles assembled from                   encapsulin monomers to a dendritic cell culture, and then imaging to check for the vaccine uptake by the dendritic cells.

Philip and Cesar attended the Oxford iGEM meetup but since they didn’t write up their logs they have been lost to history.
Friday 20th
The famous transformation efficiency kit was a complete failure – our first failed experiment! The first biobrick transformations seemed to have transformed quite well however, so the cells are at least competent.
Not a lot else happened today. Elize continued with the film, some more wiki research was done, and otherwise the day generally consisted of reading and research. The first minipreps will be done on Monday.
Weekend 21st-22nd
Recovery, mostly. First day of Summer, and the approach of July, all starting to get a bit stressful.
Week 5 (23rd June – 29th June)
Monday 23rd
Lab work is now a major component of every day – as it should be. Today we performed our first minipreps of the three biobrick plasmids, ran them on a gel, and prepared for our first PCR. With then weeks to go until the end of August, it’s good that . We also have our first lab book!
The sugar project lumbered onward. We had a meeting with a resident expert on the subject who gave us a list of potential sugars we might use. The ongoing quest for potential metabolic pathways seems to be making some headway too, with some good potential operons found. Getting them on the other hand...
The film submission idea seems to be looking more doable – we churned out the first draft of a script and we have a vague idea of what we might do. The deadline is in seven days though...
Tuesday 24th
Some real progress on the theoretical side today. We gave Jon the list of strains we might need for the metabolic wiring – if we can get them it would save a lot of time and money as we wouldn’t need to sequence some pretty large chunks of DNA. Jon will enable ‘superhero mode’ and look for them. Some good putative sugars were also identified – to quote Charlotte, “things are looking up for sugar.”
In the lab things were equally encouraging. While six of the PCR products failed to appear when run on a gel, nine of them did, and we were able to perform our first ligations using these. This is probably a good sign. It will be taken as such anyway.

Promoter mutation
Background
The regulation of gene expression is always the key point for most scientists to study. Traditionally, the functional gene is recognized to be controlled by the transcriptional promoter. And the promoter DNA interacting with RNA polymerase during the initiation of transcription has been extensively researched over recent decades.  Among the defined findings, the binding affinity and the open rate of complex formation are two key factors governing the promoter strength.
There are two regions predicting to play essential roles in prokaryotic transcription initiation, which are located at -10 and -35 regions. According to the specific effects of these two conserved sequence, plenty of mutations were built to investigate. It is important to make the mutational analysis to establish library with varying strengths promoters and to make the basic biological research easier.
Mechanism
As the first step of gene expression in prokaryote, the promoter is the DNA sequence affecting the frequency and location of transcription initiation through interaction with RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Two conserved regions about the -35 region and the -10 region were regarded as carriers containing those properties.
－35 Region:
During the transcriptional initiation, RNA polymerase and its associated Sigma factor will recognize this element. The RNA polymerase attaches itself to the template DNA strand and proceeds to slide the entire strand from 3’ to 5’ direction. Defined by sequence data, the overall strength of a promoter is important while various mutational analysis showed this region is involved in the initial binding affinity of holoenzyme. For a mutational analysis, kinds of strength revealed promoters have been constructed by replace each base. Higher-strength the natural promoter is, the wider range of efficient hybrid promoter will be get. Considered there is 6 bases of a group comprised in -35 region, 4096 mutations are the upper limit.
Base substitutions at position —31 gave only a little effect; base substitution sat position -32 caused significant reduction independent of which base replaced cytosine; base substitutions at position —35 also led to reduction, although the effects were somewhat smaller than those of -32 base substitutions; the effects of base substitutions at position -33, -34 and -36 were variable depending on the actual base introduced. The rate of open complex formation (parameter II) was slower for most variant promoters than for the wild"

Aug 30 ~ Sep 5, 2010 Plan: Think about what database modification tool a senior user would like to use. Write full database that includes the whole oscillator. Read more on XML. Have fun working.
Summary: Not having much fun working, with both sides’ tasks to be done. Full database for oscillator is done 2010/9/2. I haven’t checked it in detail yet. It is very likely we are going to change the db structure yet again, good thing though. Learn from libsbml the sbml modification tool, our db modification should somehow like that. It should focus on adding and constructing new model. Discuss on UI&input with Liao, writing the new UI draft.
Sep 5 ~ Sep 12, 2010 Plan: Discuss UI&input with Soimort. Discuss ODE solver with Kun. Teaching junior students how to write DB. Have fun working.
Summary: This is a crazy week for me! Together with Liao, we make huge modifications on the structure of for at least 3 times! We change the xml structure for storing data, revise the attributes on each item, and have heated debate on our standard of bio-modeling. At first the modification process seems endless, but by the end of the week, we have come to agreement on most of the details. This gives me a lot of hope, and this week has definitely been a big leap for our DB. This time Liao finally realizes that we are actually making the next-generation"

Mentoring IISER iGEM Mohali Team
Mentoring a team initially sounded to be a little intimidating idea for us because we weren’t much experienced in mentoring teams. But it turned out to be a really great experience for our entire team, as we grew more comfortable with IISER Mohali team. So much so, that we now are really confident about mentoring new teams and look forward to it in years to come. IISER Mohali Team members were really awesome, we had a great time mentoring them and we wish them all the best for all their future endeavours in the field of Synthetic Biology.

To get a good overview, we invite you to have a look at our tree of thoughts. This tree catches ideas as new light in its leaves, and by making the right choices, it grew to a great height. Furthermore, we had great conversations on how to let our tree grow further after our iGEM journey has ended. We discussed how to scale up our product StyGreen, which safety procedures we have to keep in mind and how to eventually implement our product in society successfully. These insights plant a seed for a greener future.
Our Interactive Human Practices Tree
Click on the icons in the timeline and find out all about the insights we gained from our stakeholders and how their input shaped our project.
Prof. Dr. ir. M.W. Fraaije
We needed an assay to detect cellulase activity. Luckily, Prof. Fraaije could help us out .
Prof. Dr. B. Poolman
We learned about the effects of styrene toxicity in production. Thus we reached out to an expert who helped us with finding a solution to overcome this limitation.
Carbon footprint analysis
To investigate whether our technology is actually beneficial for the process towards a greener planet, and to what extent, we performed a  Carbon Footprint Analysis. In collaboration with Tjerk Douma we calculated the energy costs to create StyGreen compared to syrene. See here how we made this analysis.
Katja Loos
In the process of developing our project design, the decision on what our final product should become was essential. Katja Loos had an enormous influence in this phase, as she explained that biodegradable plastics are not as degradable as we imagine. See here what she explained to us.

In this page, you can know about what experiments have we done and our protocol used.
Experiments
Assay
We have done assays on pure chemicals and bacteria synthesized chemicals.
The aim of doing these assays was to test whether the substances are attractants or repellents to C. elegans. And we used response index to describe whether the chemicals are attractants or repellents to C. elegans.
Below I explain the steps and calculations involved in these assays in detail.
General Steps
As shown in the picture below, we mark the substance loading spots on the lid of a petri dish where we put volatile substances. For droplet test, same labelling were done on the plate.
Mark the same spots with extra circles around each loading spot. Label two opposite area as ‘T’ and the other two as ‘C’. they stand for ‘test’ and ‘control’ respectively.
Load 10 ul of medium containing about 200 worms on the centre of the the agar.
Loading chemicals
For volatile test Pipetted 2 ul of tested volatile substance on the loading spot in the two ‘T’ areas on the lid. And load the same volume of water on the ‘C’ spots on the lid.
For droplet test Pipetted 5ul of tested liquid on the loading spot in the two ‘T’ areas on the agar plate. And load the same volume of water on the ‘C’ spots on agar too.
Then, we put the assay plate aside and leave it undisturbed for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, we obtained the total number of worms in the ‘T’ areas and ‘C’ areas.
Responsive Index
The response index was given by formula [(T-C)/(T+C)]. T is the number of worms in the ‘T’ areas. C is the number of worms in the ‘C’ areas, which means the number of worms that entered the areas by chance. The denominator [T+C] represents the total number of worms in the counted areas, that is the number of worms inside the 4 circles. The numerator [T-C] is the number of worms which made response due to the effect of the tested substances.
The index value will range between -"

Along with developing this master plasmid, we plan to spend time refining our lesson designs. We got a lot of really useful feedback from our first high school visits and we hope to incorporate the comments/critiques that we received into any future high school outreach efforts. We expect that future UMaryland iGEM teams will continue to use this lesson plan as a basis for engaging the community and teaching students about the wonders of synthetic biology.

Understanding Panama Disease
iGEM projects reside in their context, and the purpose of human practices is to learn more about the problem and the situation that surrounds the problem. This requires a multi-disciplinary approach that involves discussing our project with stakeholders that are from a variety of backgrounds. To understand the potential impact of our project, we contacted multiple individuals in a wide variety of fields and asked for their feedback and their possible concerns.
Business / Administration
From the business perspective, we contacted Beyond the Peel, an organization that aims to empower independent banana farmers in Ecuador and Peru, and to import fair trade organic bananas. We were told that the lack of Panama disease in South America meant that farmers are more concerned about local diseases that are currently afflicting the banana plant more than a disease localized in Asia and Africa. These diseases, along with the daily concerns of the weather and pests, are the farmer’s primary concerns, although we were told that if we had a good product that would protect the farmers, and if the disease has begun to manifest in the Americas, there would be no backlash against using foreign or GMO solutions.
In addition, we learned that there are many reasons beyond the technical challenges why the Cavendish banana is the major crop being imported. This mainly is due to infrastructure challenges, since shipping times, routes, and distribution mechanisms all depend on the Cavendish, whose ripening properties are well known. In addition, consumer demand for bananas that aren’t the Cavendish is miniscule, and no investments on building the infrastructure for different types of bananas that may be more resistant to Panama Disease, isn’t being made. We also spoke to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) about our project and received the perspective of a policy administrator. We found that there was a World Banana Forum hosted by the UN FAO that aims to tackle labor, disease, and agricultural issues through a collaboration of industry, academia, and governments. From our conversations with those not in the scientific community, we found that biosafety and biocontainment was"

Today we electroporated Pc + T7 polymerase in pC13F, PpelA in pC13F, and T7 polymerase in pA13AM and pC13P. We prepared pAK13AB and pC13AG for glycerol stock. We ligated pAK13CS and pC13CV. We electroporated and plated pC13I, pC13J, pAK13CS, pC13CV. pC13J arced, so we ran a new Q5 PCR to begin preparation of insert from pC13A. We re-digested pC13Q with XbaI and PstI and pC13F with EcoRI and PstI, and subsequently dephosphorylated pC13CD and pC13F. We set up ligations to create pC13BC, pC13BV, and pC13CE.

In particular, the group is developing technology for data integration, computational modelling and comparative genomics (e.g. Microbase).  I also researches computational design strategies for Synthetic Biology, with a focus on the role of modelling and data integration in the design of biological systems. Laboratory facilities have been estalished in collaboration with the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology allowing computational designs to be tested in-vivo.   The biological applications of his research are quite diverse ranging from microbiology and metagenomics, through to the mechanisms of human genetic disease and ageing. Traditionally the group has a strong interest and background in microbial genomics and functional genomics particularly for Gram-positive microorganisms such as Bacillus and relatives.

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Computing Science at Newcastle University. My current research area is verification of biological and cyber-physical systems via model checking. I work with Anil Wipat and his group at the Center for Bacterial Cell Biology, in particular for verifying synthetic biology designs. Earlier, I worked with Edmund M. Clarke at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was the Technical Coordinator of CMACS. I am also interested in quantum and reversible programming languages, and formal methods for specifying and deriving code (a la Dijkstra) for quantum algorithms.

Dr. Wendy Smith
I am a research associate based in our wet lab in the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology, Newcastle University. I studied Medical Microbiology at Newcastle University and my PhD was analysing functional genomics of group A streptococcal virulence factors.  My initial research involved investigating the mechanisms of pathogenicity utilized by the Gram positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes. This experience equipped me with considerable expertise in the physiology/molecular biology of Gram-positive bacteria.  I first encountered the concept of synthetic biology (at local seminars) in the context of a Gram-positive bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) and my interest stemmed initially from recognizing that this was a completely new and ‘exciting’ area, where I could make a valuable contribution exploiting my existing expertise.  I have now extended my interests into the field of synthetic biology and am specifically researching into synthetic quorum peptide mediated communication systems in Bacillus subtilis.

Results
Testing the predictions with the remaining non-trained twenty percent of our datapoints shows that our predicted ddG-value on average never surpasses a difference of one from the test-values. Considering the interval of ddG-values of about eleven in our overall trainings data these results aren't incredibly convincing, but certainly usable. The very low size of the training dataset and more importantly how the dataset was generated makes predicting the ddG a very difficult task. Since the dataset was created from values submitted by different groups using different methods at different points of time, the ddG values contained in the dataset are likely to not be perfectly accurate.
Figure 6: x-coordinates show predicted ddG-values, y-coordinates show real ddG-values.
Final Workflow
Overview
All three modular tools together are part of BERT, our powerful deimmunization workflow.
Figure 7: Here, the interplay of our three modular tools which are the building blocks of BERT is shown. The user enters a protein sequence, the corresponding structure file in pdb format and a set of alleles which he wants to deimmunize against. The generated output consists of the deimmunized protein sequence.
First of all, the user inputs his protein sequence, a corresponding structure (required for the identification of neighbour amino acids which are in contact with each other) file (*.pdb), a generated MSA for example using the very popular and easy to use webservice Clustal Omega and finally the name of the alleles that the user wants to deimmunize his protein against.
First of all the set of even considered point mutations is greatly reduced by running EvoCS. This allows subsequent, iterative runs of either MHCBoost or NetMHCIIPan in conjunction with CoReM to score all remaining possible point mutations according to the factors explained below.
Point Mutation Evaluation
To evaluate which amino acid should be substituted by another amino acids, we took two different factors into consideration. The first factor is the overall immunogenicity of the protein, before and after the amino acid substitution.  The second factor is the structural stability of protein, which account for the protein being functional. In the process of the deimmunization we seek minimum value for the protein’s immunogenicity while maximizing the free folding energy ddG. For the"

Collaborations with other iGEM teams
 
1. Team Tianjin
 
At the beginning of the summer vocation, team Tianjin contacted us for help and support. They wanted a kind of bacteria called Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. We eagerly contacted Prof. Aijun Liao in our university asking for this species, cultivating it and then mailed Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 timely. After that, when they encountered some difficulties cultivating this species, we assisted them to get technical support about the conditions for culturing this kind of bacteria.
 
Later, in CCiC conference, we are pleased to know that team Tianjin managed to use Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 successfully and achieved crucial experiment results based on this species. Therefore, we took a picture with each other’s posters together to witness this collaborations. Besides, some of the team members in team Tianjin or team Nanjing-China made great friends and team Tianjin gave special gifts to us during CCiC to express their thanks.
 
 
2. Team NEFU-China
 
We got in touch with NEFU-CHINA during the CCiC conference by asking questions after their presentations. Most of our team members were really interested in their project so we meet them after the Q&A time of the presentation. In this meeting, our team members came up with some great ideas to improve their project. What’s more, when advisors in team NEFU-China put forward their difficulties of proceeding experiments, we offered to share some equipment with them and invited them to our lab. All of the teachers and students in team NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their lab for a visit. Team members of our team gave presentations in their lab and both of the teams had a great team communication about iGEM and experiments. However, because of the long distance and the big expenses, they cancelled the plan to come to our lab proceed experiments. Nevertheless, we are communicating through emails and we have supported them with experiment materials as well as suggestions on their experimental design.

We formed collaborations with team UCAS during CCiC’s poster time. We are impressed about their hard work and great courage because they are the youngest team and the oldest students of their school (UCAS has been established three years ago).

Methylococcus capsulatus Culture Conditions
For the cultivation of M. capsulatus NMS medium was used. The cultures were incubated at 42 °C at 50 % methane atmosphere.
Measurement of Growth Curves
Overnight cultures in 2xYT medium containing the appropriate antibiotic were inoculated directly from -80 °C glycerol cell stock. Cells were grown in non-baffled-flasks at 37 °C and 250 rpm. The next day, main cultures in 2xYT medium containing the appropriate antibiotic were inoculated from overnight cultures to an OD600 0.1. Cells were grown in non-baffled flasks at 37°C and 250 rpm.  Samples from each flask were taken at appropriate time points depending on the growth phase of the cells. Optical density was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm. Cells were left to grow until the stationary phase was reached.
Preparation of chemically competent cells
100 mL of 2xYT media containing required antibiotic were inoculated and incubated at 37 °C and 250 rpm until OD600 0.5. Subsequently the cells were incubated on ice for 15 minutes and then centrifuged at 4 °C and 400 rpm for 5 minutes. The excess was discarded and the pellets resuspended in 7.5 mL ice-cold TFB1. Afterwards, the solution is incubated on ice for 90 minutes and then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4000 rpm. Finally, the pellets were resuspended, aliquoted and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The vials were stored at -80°C.
Cryopreservation
The respective strain was grown on 2xYT medium at 37 °C and 250 rpm overnight. Afterwards a 20 % Glycerin solution was prepared with the liquid culture, aliquoted, shock frozen and stored at -80 °C.
Minipreparation of Plasmid DNA
Miniprep was done with Plasmid DNA purification Kit by Macherey-Nagel following the manufacturer’s protocol. First 3-5 mL of the cell suspension were spun down for 10 minutes (5000 g). For the alkaline lysis of the DNA the pellet was resuspended in 250 μL Resuspension Buffer A1. 250 μL of Lysis Buffer A2 was added and incubated at RT for 5 min. 300 μL of Neutralization Buffer A3 was added to stop the reaction.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Interview1_-_-_TEXT.html," after the results of the NRP59, not be a pioneer in GMPs to raise the acceptance elsewhere? How could one convince the Swiss of GMPs?
A: One must let the Swiss carry the can of their decision. They will realize when it is too late, there are existing precedents.
Q: Even though the government founded research had a positive outcome towards GMPs: does nothing change from a researcher’s point of view? Are there a few that are scientifically well informed, but the majority feels ensured in their fears and prejudices because of the continued moratorium?
A: Of course, this is also the Medias fault.
Q: How do you explain the success of genetically produced medicine in industrial countries while they are sceptic against genetically altered food?
A: All people in rich countries know that they will at some point need the advance in pharmacy. Since they are not hungry and can afford the luxury of ‘bio-labeled’ food, they do have no reason to question the anti GMP propaganda of NGO activists.
Q: Can the higher acceptance of golden rice in the population of poor countries be explained by the fact that the use of GMP is better communicated? Are the people in those countries informed well enough?
A: The people that face the danger of their children becoming blind or die due to the lack of vitamin A have no problem with GMPs yet. Never the less Greenpeace etc. work intensively towards changing this fact.
Q: How did you experience the influences of different groups with different interests, e.g. industry or critics of gene technology, on the golden rice project?
A: The industry kindly supported the project with free licenses. The enemies of gene technology are one of the main reasons that golden rice was delayed for ten years and could not help those whose life and health rely on it.
German original Version
Q: Ist die Verlängerung des Moratoriums ein Indiz für die geringe politische und gesellschaftliche Wertschätzung oder die Angst vor der Forschung auf dem Gebiet der GVP in der Schweiz?
A: Sie ist ein Indiz für den Einfluss der Bauernlobby, die einen höheren wirtschaftlichen Ertrag mit dem label „Gentechnikfrei“ erwarten kann.
Q: Wie begegnen Sie Menschen, die die Forschung an GVP im Feldversuch sabotieren?
A: Ich halte sie für irregeleitete Idealisten, die nicht wirklich etwas von der Sache verstehen. Trotzdem sind ihre Aktionen ungesetz"
Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,"Yassen asked what advice Patrick would give to future synthetic biologists.
Patrick said he wouldn't presume to give advice, but he would hope people working in any new branch of technology think not just about solving the challenges they face in their work, but ask what impact their work will have on people and the world we share.
What impact will it have on inequality in our society? What impact will it have on human wellbeing, not just in a direct way, but in indirect ways? How will it impact on the relationships between people? If we ignore those aspects of what it means to be human, and we still come up with clever technologies, the benefits will not be as great, and the downsides may be unexpectedly large.
Armin Grunwald
Amongst other things, Armin is a philosopher of technology. This interview was conducted by email.
You seem to do many things, from directing the Buro fur Technokfolgen-Abschatzung (Office for Technological Assessment) and the KIT's Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis to being a philosopher and ethicist. What does your typical day involve? Do you have a typical day?
I have a typical distribution of presence over the week. Monday and Tuesday are typical days at Karlsruhe (ITAS and university, colloquium, lectures, internal and external committees etc.), Wednesday is a typical Berlin day, and Thursday/Friday are ""on demand"" (project meetings, external lectures, EU meetings, meetings at ministries etc.). Of course there are many exceptions because of certain requests. My ""office days"" (Monday to Wednesday) are full of meetings of different scale, reaching from institute plenary meetings to supervising PhD students of talking to individual researchers. My research (reading, thinking, preparing papers and books etc.) usually takes place in Deutsche Bahn (German railway). I try to avoid short distance flights and prefer railway because it provides an excellent opportunity for working without disturbances (5 hours Berlin - Karlsruhe).
When you hear the term Synthetic Biology what do you think of?
First the idea of creating artificial life comes into my mind (knowing well that at the moment SB is more on technically modifying existing life instead of creating new life from scratch). This thought is related with fascination and concern simultaneously.
What role, if any, do you think biotechnology will play in the future?
I am convinced that SB will be key to many innovative developments in the future. I see SB as an emerging ""enabling technology"" which will lead to applications in (probably many) different sectors. Main application fields might be, seen from now:
health and medicine

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Killing I_-_-_TEXT.html,"id.  This two component system has some important advantages: You do not need to put the genetic information you want to transfer on a big conjugation plasmid like an F-plasmid or an RP-plasmid. This makes conjugation much faster and more effective, because the time and the effectivness of conjugation depend on the length of the plasmid to transfer. Additionally, you can use every kind of plasmid as a mobilizable plasmid. This makes it perfect for our purpose: We can use the lambda genome as a mobilizable plasmid in cloning an oriT into it and providing a suitable helper plasmid.
There are different groups of conjugative plasmids that can also function as helper plasmids in enterobacteria: the classic F-plasmid, RP4/RP1 among others. We decided to use an IncP (incompatibility group P) plasmid and a complementary oriT as our conjugation system, because they proofed to be very efficient [11] . These are plasmids with a broad host range that carry multiple antibiotic resistance genes. The plasmids of this group do not need host-chromosome encoded components for the mobilization of plasmids, like RSF1010 for example needs [12] . Therefore they have a very broad range of hosts and fit in very well in the modular concept of synthetic biology.
The prototype of InP plasmids is the RP4 plasmid, which is a close relative of the RP1 plasmid of which we use a derivative. The tra genes are organized in two operons, tra1 and tra2. Tra1 encodes for all of the DNA transfer and replication system, especially for the relaxosome, the complex, which initiates the transfer replication [14] . Tra2 encodes for proteins necessary for mating pair formation.
The plasmid we use is called pUB307 [15][16] . It is a derivate of RP1, which lacks the transposon Tn1 (Ampicillin resistance cassette) by spontaneous excision.
To avoid that our probiotic bacteria, which would contain and transfer the phage to the target pathogenic bacteria, would also be killed by the phage, we used the natural way to make them immune. Therefore we took the lambda cI gene and put it behind a constitutive promoter. The cI protein will then prevent the expression of the lambda genome in our bacteria and prevent them from being lysed.

I know what you did last summer! KU Leuven iGEM Team 2017 has gone through some ups and downs, but that didn't stop them from being creative and to explore the world of science. Other than that, a lot of fun activities were planned. To know more about their adventure, feel free to go down the memory lane with us.
21 - 27 Feb
First Meeting
This is the meeting where the team spirit was established and missing pieces of our adventure to success were collected. For example, who is going to be our PI? How do we get sponsors? Who will be our leader to guide us all the way through to the end of the project? Every team member was assigned a subcategory, which they will complete with passion and dedication. A very subtle move towards possible project ideas was made during this meeting.
27 Feb - 7 Mar
Project Ideas
This week, we discussed the many proposals about project ideas along with some professors. There were some remarkable ideas on the table: Development of an ecosystem in a space station, DNA fitting to predict an individual’s health, weight and nutrition, introduction of a filter over intestinal villus for better uptake of gluten in Coeliac patients, and more.
We also completed our team registration and team leaders were chosen for the subcategories. Nothing could stop us from entering this!
7 - 13 Mar
Brainstorming
The voting deadline for project ideas was nearing. In the meeting, a lot of brainstorming happened and a lot of new ideas were added to the list. The layout for a sponsor brochure was also created. We reminisced about our childhood and our first contact with science for inspiration on how we might educate the local children. During the meeting, one of the students who is an avid traveler booked flight tickets.

This week, we had a very special meeting. Two ex-iGEM members came over and gave us advice about their struggles and experiences in their iGEM team in 201"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," European foulbrood disease presence in Canada, he stated European foulbrood predominates over American foulbrood in Canada, but in Mexico, American foulbrood is a severe problem.
Finally, we were curious whether there were any regulations regarding experimentation on bees in his country, to which he answered there are none in Canada concerning experimentation on them, yet, he doesn't consider there should be since regulating it would hinder and inhibit research with them. Ultimately, he wished us luck and referred to our project as good and novel.
Beekeeping Societies
We had the great privilege of being able to get closer to complete and organized associations that show how beekeepers gather, collaborate and strengthen beekeeping. Dialogue is fundamental in a society and what a better way to join this dialogue than by discussing in these reunions, listening to the concerns or contributions expressed by the societies and building-up new group insights.

Monthly beekeepers’ association meeting
Until that meeting, our project consisted of the production of antimicrobial peptides in Pichia pastoris for the exclusively inhibition of the pathogen Paenibacillus larvae. The intention was to apply these yeasts in a solution with hexane extract of the plant Achyrocline satureioides in the presence of surfactins, the surfactin would have a synergistic effect with the hexane extract. This solution would be applied to bee bread, which we knew, the larvae ingested in their diet.
They said there is not much research in the beekeeping sector, so it seems excellent that we intend to carry out scientific research in this field and try different combinations of peptides thus ensuring the best combination.
From this meeting, we set out to investigate the export requirements of honey, which is the main product exported by beekeepers, and how our genetically modified yeasts would affect or play a role in these requirements.
Through their feedback, we evaluated the risks of using yeasts in our product and the risks of introducing GMOs in what is known as ""harmless honey"".
They emphasized that an overdose of yeasts would cause a fermentation of honey and an alteration in the microbiota of the bees which could be counterproductive since this would cause diseases such"

Yuze WU
I will go to bed before 12 today!
Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.

Dennis
Head of Lab and Molecular Biology Advisor
Jonathan Dennis is the Molecular Biology advisor for the team, but when we started this project we soon realized we didn't have a place to conduct our research. In response, he let us set up our experiments in his lab and even gave us his resources to conduct the research. More than just giving us his space, he continued to be a mentor for our Create team and taught them the techniques to use in the lab, helped us buy lab resources through VWR, and assisted in designing the analytic assays that we used.
Michael
Blaber
Protein Engineering Advisor
Michael Blaber is the protein engineering advisor for the team. At the beginning of the project, we came up with the three-module system and even decided on what proteins to use on the membrane, but the main issue was that these proteins were too large. He helped us refine our solution by using a truncated protein (keeping only the extracellular part). After this key suggestion early in the project, he continued to give feedback on our progress and helped us troubleshoot problems.

This summer I mainly worked on the conduction of Measurement tract and the construction of standard parts.
Being an iGEMer has opened to me a brand new world of life science‒to design a life purposely, to test the possibilities. The process of parts construction was just like treasure hunting‒searching for possible solutions out of weird errors and abnormal results. A long-awaited positive result was one of the sweetest moments. It's fascinating to work with a group of people and brainstorm from time to time. I've experienced a wonderful summer.

The expected length of ThuricinS, LacticinQ and Laterusporulin-ThuricinS is 304 bp, 406 bp, and 459 bp, respectively. The red box marks ThuricinS clones. GeneRulerTM 100 bp DNA ladder was used ThermoFisher scientific. .
Successful cloning of the bacteriocins into the IMPACT vector pTXB1 was a key step in purifying the bacteriocins. Cloning into the IMPACT vector pTXB1 was validated by gel electrophoresis (Figure 1). A successful cloning was verified from the results of a cPCR performed with specifically designed primers according to the theoretical expected length (304 bp) of ThuricinS with IMPACT overhangs . The clones were verified by sequencing. The results in the red box (Figure 1) show bands of similar lengths, thus showing a successful ligation of ThuricinS into pTXB1.

Week-1 (Brainstorming)
This was a fresh first week. It’s so cool to have an international team like us. We are so sure to generate many novel and interest ideas. After several brainstorm meeting, 12 innovative project proposals was freshly born. All idea are compared and discussed by their advantages and disadvantages but finally only 2 were selected to be further studied.
1.Thermometer
This would be a practical project as it develops a common device in our daily life and the idea is quite simple. We plan to insert 2 colour protein genes in to E.coli and those genes are controlled by temperature sensitive sensors. The designed cells can display different colours under various temperatures within 10 to 45. Our idea is based on a related project by UCSF team in 2005 i . With the help of several cold and heat shock sensors that UCSF team has synthesized, we could improve the sensitivity of the sensor and make a more instant thermometer with colour indication.
2.Singing E.coli
It would be super cool if we could hear the sound of E.coli, right? What a crazy idea! But we are going to make impossible happen.  The project is based on researches on a kind of special bacteria called magnetotactic bacteria. Those microorganisms are widely existed in condensation of fresh and salty water and play important role in circulation of iron. This specie can move to the North point of magnet since containing a magnetic protein complex called magnetosome ii . This magnetic property is a hot topic in recently years and could be used in many area of industry. However, those magetotactic bacteria are mostly anaerobic and hard to cultivate. We could introduce magnetosome into E.coli and grow those special cells in a tank. With the help of"

A rose from Munich
As part of their project dealing with the most prevalent mutation in the CFTR protein, which is responsible for cystic fibrosis, the team from Tel Hai Academic college dedicated themselves to raise awareness for the severely life-shortening genetic condition. The “65 Roses” story itself dates back to 1965 when an observant 4-year-old, hearing the name of his disease for the first time, pronounced cystic fibrosis as ""65 Roses."" Nowadays, “65 Roses” is a term often used by young children with cystic fibrosis to pronounce the name of their disease. We are very happy to be a part of their noble efforts and dedication for this project.
BioBricks for the world
Due to the history of interesting projects from Munich, it did not take long for the first Biobricks requests to come in from all over the world.
Media:Muc16_Toulouse.jpg
Vive le France!
The first inquiry came from our cave-saving colleagues from Toulouse , who were in need of a BioBrick for their Bacillus subtilis originally developed by the team from LMU in 2012. Go save those caves! ;)
The far east
Not long after, a more distant call reached us all the way from - 2016 XMU-China iGEM team . They required components from the biosensor part of the LMU team 2014 in order to detect and kill Staphylococcus aureus.
Our dutch neighbours
Last but not least, the team from Groningen got in touch with us regarding yet another Biobrick for Bacillus subtilis from LMU 2012.
Double Kill
But we did not only ship BioBricks, we also requested some ourselves. For our Kill-Switch, we asked iGEM Freiburg (2010, BBa_K404113) and Slovenia (2012, BBa_K782063) for their parts. Since both parts inherited a pstI mutation site, we repaired this and enhanced the part with an additional poly-A sequence.
HowTo
In order to properly showcase our project, we decided to use the hightech 3D animation software Maya by Autodesk . As we consider this an awesome way to show people what you have been doing all summer long, here's an introduction video on HowTo do it.
We hope this helps you to get started and as we really want to see more of these animations, we also added our ""cell"" template file for you to download:

PetroBrick Validation Assay
In order to identify if there were any hydrocarbons that could be produced with the PetroBrick.  A validation assay was performed based on the 2011 Washington Team Wiki.  Their protocol was modified slightly as we had difficulty replicating their results with the conditions they described.
Prepare LB broth and Washington Production Media .
Grow up PetroBrick construct overnight at 37oC shaking in LB broth.
Make a 20 mL 50:50 LB:Washington Production Media solution in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add 5 mL of the grown PetroBrick into the culture and incubate for 72 hours. (in subsequent experiments other medias were used containing naphthenic acids or cyclohexane pentanoic acid at a concentration of 50 mg/L).
Sonicate the culture using a Misonix Cell Disrupter at dial 11 for 2 min.
Extract the solution with 5 mL of ethyl acetate, shaking vigorously, and spinning down the solution at 4000 RPM for 5 min.
Take off 1.5 mL of solution.

Abstract
Ligase-Independent Cloning as a Standard for BioBrick Preparation
While there is an established BioBrick format, there is not yet a standard method for turning a gene of interest into a BioBrick. Ideally, such a standard method would be easily adopted, even by amateurs, and would lend itself to automation.  A significant  drawback of several existing techniques is their dependence on ligase treatment, which is often problematic.  We propose a ligase-independent cloning (LIC) method, based on the technique of Aslanidis & de Jong (1990) , as a possible standard for novel BioBrick preparation.  Instead of short overhangs and ligase treatment, LIC uses long overhangs to circularize plasmid vectors for transformation without the use of ligase.  The LIC method reduces the number of enzyme steps required for cloning, thus lending itself to easy adoption, automation, and real biological 'engineering.'
Rationale
The underlying idea of iGEM is that an engineering approach can be applied to biology.  Using a computer analogy, the goal is to have software (DNA sequences) that can be run on compatible hardware (microorganisms) anywhere in the world.

The portability of such a biological hardware-software interface requires extensive standardization.  The requisite standards exist for the definition of BioBricks, and for the use of BioBrick parts in composite devices.  There is not yet a standard method, though, for constructing new BioBricks.
Ideally, whatever standard method is chosen would not only be highly portable, but also simple. The BioBricks used by iGEM are advertised with Lego® blocks, implying a very easy-to-use set of tools.  Our team of high school students discovered that synthetic biology is"

public engagement
During the summer vacation, our team members went to country schools in Ningxia and Jiangxi Province to promote the popular science of synthetic biology. Furthermore we successfully designed a series of educational lectures and open-laboratory-festival                     for high school students. As a team rooted in solidarity, we successfully collaborated with OUC, UCAS, UESTC, HBUT, ZJUT, HUST and took an active part the CCiC conference. Most importantly, we were the first iGEM team applying logical                     circuit to human practice. In order to intuitively demonstrate the core idea of synthetic biology and inspire people to participate in gene-designing process, we deigned e-SAM©, the first electronic-display system of synthetic biology                     based on SCM parts, and we drafted a detailed description of experiments that can be performed with it as well as suggestions for customers. We are convinced that e-SAM© system can greatly facilitate future iGEM teams to promote their                     ideas to public.
Introductory courses
Since we came from a special college for teachers, we wanted our goals for the event to inspire more people to get involved in science. The head of the program emphasized that we should try to get students interested in the field of molecular biology and participating in research in college. Every summer, Beijing normal university hosts an education campaign for bachelors of all major to learn iGEM and do basic biological experiments, in order to arise their curiosity of synthetic biology and life science. The BNU-China iGEM teams always collaborate with the School of Education in the past to do teaching activities with students, so we launched a series of introductory course for new students, and invited them to visit our lab.
The courses include 4-week training of basic theory, two molecular biology experiments, and a mini-iGEM meeting. To guarantee the quality of these courses, we chose four of our best teammates and rehearsed privately for several times. Moreover, we made thorough plans and got the full rights from both college leaders and former iGEMers, each of whom assigned a team of freshers matched according to students’ speciality. The mentors monitored the study pace of each student by weekly meetings and students responded to learn the required materials. The courses were liked by most of apprentices. More importantly, we had a real bonus that we met two excellent students with both talent and enthusiasm, and they were"

Introduction
The main objective of our modeling section was to create a mathematical system that could explain the relationship between blood glucose levels, the size of the bacterial population, and the resulting insulin production, for different conditions related to state of energy homeostasis in the human body. The relevance of our model is such that it provides a theoretical framework that can be applied to the development of our device for people that depend on insulin, while predicting the behaviour of their blood glucose when using it, ensuring a proper insulin administration.
Bacteria
We obtained experimental data from laboratory section of bacterial population growth over time. After observing the growth curves, we assumed a logistic growth based in a qualitative approach, and what has been reported in previous works [1] Using linear regression and applying limits to estimate the variables to generate the corresponding values for the minimum and maximum regions of the equations, it was possible to develop a function that was similar to the experimental results.
Glucose
The glucose that is being considered is, primordially, correspondent to the levels that are present on the human blood, the main reason is that the sensor that is present at the bacteria membrane is thought to detect the levels on the surroundings, which should be at an equilibrium with the glucose levels on blood. Our system is thought to detect the glucose that the user has assimilated in his/her blood, in order to produce an adequate transcriptional response resulting in insulin that might be beneficial for the user’s metabolism. Glucose is considered as being negatively regulated by the amount of insulin in bloodstream and is consumed at a basal level at a rate proportional to the glucose already present.
Figure 1: Experimental values on bacteria population over time, it is possible to appreciate that the development seems to be logistic, shuffle bacteria is used as an example of this method, but similar models on EnvZ, Rosseta and DH5a were developed.
The process of ingesting is considered as very chaotic and specific to each person , we decided to elaborate a system of pulses with an aleatory amplitude and periodicity. This aleatory amplitude was considered as following a Poisson distribution. The decision to implement a Poisson distribution was made under the considerations that we had to generate pulses that represented a general person from a certain population, the Poisson allows to have values related to the population average without generating values that would be unrealistic such as negative or extremely high that would surge from other distributions like the normal distribution"

“A” indicates antioxidant, and can also                     represent the best in the grade rating. So the core of our project is to build an antioxidant                     detecting system to rank antioxidants.
Antioxidants are
compounds that inhibit                     oxidation.They can scavenge the excess ROS in the organisms. The antioxidants mentioned here is the                     one working in our bodies, helping us defect the damage of oxidation.
Oxidation damage is very common in our daily                     life. It may be caused by UV in the sun, unhealthy living habits, irregular work and rest times,                     and its accumulation will eventually infect the normal function of our body, lead to gene mutation,                     cell cancer and aging. Therefore, antioxidants are urgently needed to defended the damage of                     oxidation.
Even though antioxidant is so important,                     there’s no standard ways to tell us which antioxidant works better.
Our goal is to build a system with function                     of detecting the antioxidants and has the advantages of high biological relevance, simple                     operation, low-cost, good reproducibility, accuracy, and high sensitivity for antioxidant                     detection. More importantly, we hope to establish an efficient standard for evaluating antioxidants                     through our system"

These plates were incubated overnight and the growth was observed in the morning as shown in the following image (figure 2).
Figure 2: Bacillus subtilis Growth Condition Test
As can be observed from the image, all of the colonies on each plate exhibit healthy morphologies, something that did not happen in the first test. This can be attributed to the use of nutrient agar rather than LB-agar. Plates 1, 2, 3 and 4 all show growth of colonies of the blue-green colour associated with X-gal screening tests with the darker colour shown by plates 1 and 2 being a result of the higher concentration of X-gal used. Plates 5 and 6 were expected to show growth of white colonies as no X-gal was present in the nutrient agar medium. These results informed us that in future tests, nutrient agar and an X-gal concentration of 200μg/ml should be used.
Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis
As the optimum conditions for growing Bacillus subtilis had been found, the main experiment proposed could now begin. The first stage of this experiment involved initiating sporulation of the cells such that they produced endospores. This was achieved by following and slightly editing the protocol developed by the collaboration between the Bonn and Freiburg iGEM teams from 2016 (iGEM Bonn 2016 and iGEM Freiburg 2016, 2016) [2] . Once the sporulation of the cells had been successful, the spores were stored in a refrigerator for two days where the cold temperature would be detrimental to normal Bacillus subtilis cell growth. To ensure that there were no live, unsporulated cells remaining, the eppendorf tube containing the spores was placed into a dry heat block at 90°C for "

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Human Practices#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," as much students as possible in one day, we created a poster informing about our project, iGEM and Synthetic Biology. By baking delicious waffles that were scenting all through the university we were able to attract a lot of students and stuff them with food and information. The team was divided in different responsibilities such as presenting the poster, answering questions and waffle baking. By rotating the shifts we made sure that everyone got in front of the poster at some point.
Conclusion: Since it was our first presentation in public, it took some time to present confidently but in the end everyone was self-reliant and enjoyed talking and spreading the word. We noticed that even people which are not into the topic of Synthetic Biology were very interested in hearing more about our project and thought that the purification of waste water is a topic of high relevance for them. We were surprised by the open-mindedness of the students, the faculties and staff of our university. We had expected a lot of controversial questions and bioethics discussions, but what was brought to us was above all curiosity for Synthetic Biology, our project and the problems in water treatment. This could be due to the academic environment and the respect that is brought to a fellow-student. Anyway we were sure when we step outside the university the people would not always be that nice to us. All in all we were glad to have held our dress rehearsal under cozy conditions in a known environment and even with some waffles. Now we were ready to reach out even further.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," experimental competences in the laboratory of Professor COUVREUR, working on an anti-cancer nano-particle.
Combining theory and experimentation, he brought to light the underlying problems of vectorisation and elaborated with the rest of the team a double vectorisation system (DVS) to provide an answer.
After that, he selected, for the iGEM adventure, the students of the team according to their competences related to the project.
Enguerrand decided to take the lead of the R&D team and entrusted the communication team to Gaëlla AZZI.
Due to their common and complementary experiences in the creation and development of projects, Enguerrand was convinced of the asset of having Gaëlla in the iGEM project. Being a 5th year student specialized in Commercial Marketing in biotechnologies, she has obtained her competences throughout various professional experiences.
All along the iGEM adventure, she has managed a team of 3 students with whom she prospected the market for sponsors . She has been brought to negotiate and oversee the orders of laboratory material suppliers so as to satisfy the internal needs of the R&D team.
She then turned her attention to the external problems of the project, particularly the ethics and social questions that were brought up by our concept. She thus supervised the creation of an ethics conference focused on synthetic biology.

Eve Ranya JAMALI and Emma VALETTE, 4th year students, as well as Yolène MONEDERO, a 5th year student specialised in Commercial Marketing in biotechnologies, have accomplished several different missions during the adventure. They prospected for sponsors and worked on the elaboration of different communication medias.
It is especially their double competence in the scientific and communication fields that have rendered them interesting for this adventure.
A good visualisation of the concept and understanding of the ethical and societal questions brought up by it, aided by the numerous experiences in this field, have enabled Ranya to organize, and lead as best as possible the ethical conference and Emma to answer questions based on Safety .
The concept had already been defined when the iGEM adventure started out. We knew the characteristics of our vector and target cell, yet many questions remained unanswered.
Damien PARELLO, a 5th year student specialized in R&D in biotechnologies, was assigned the task of studying our target cell and its mutations. He studied its membrane proteins in order to determine THE protein that would be specific of our target cell.
Thus, he established that the protein c-kit is solely found on the membrane of our target cell."

Extension rate was dropped to 0.01 mm/min because the fibers were breaking too easily. Data is being weird. 0.01 mm/min is too slow to be continuous, so the data is more or less discrete. Will need to average each data point before analyzing. Additionally, the fiber has a permanent kink in it.
Holy crap 0.001 mm/min took over 2.5 hrs and still didn't break. I bumped it up to 0.01 mm/min to get it going faster.
I then bumped it up to 0.1 mm/min
0.001 mm/min takes literally over an hour. Would recommend 0.1 mm/min.

SAFETY
Safety Considerations
SAFE LAB WORK
Being a hardware team, we work in a computer laboratory with no chemicals, toxins, or extreme cold temperatures. However, we do have machines and tools. To ensure lab safety, we wear eye protection when working with the drills and soldering irons, and wear gloves when necessary.
In all collaboration experiments involving mammalian cells, no team member handled biological materials.
PROJECT DESIGN
To create our microfluidic chip, we use a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer to bind the control layer and the flow layer. This is a polymeric organosilicon compound that has 'no marked harmful effects on organisms in the environment' according to Ullmann's Encyclopedia. Thus, it is a safe silicone to use for our consumer market, which are biologists in labs. Consequently, the materials and tools we are using will not harm any living organism.
When all of our materials are used up, our materials can be safely dealt with. Our polycarbonate base for the entire setup and microfluidic chip is recyclable, and the rest of the plastics (the 3D printed parts and PDMS layer) can be easily discarded. However, these materials are safe and much cheaper than other technologies that do the same thing."

IRIS Website
IRIS is a website containing resources which are available to over 450 schools from across the world which have signed up for it. Its main aims are to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM subjects and to enrich the work of teachers. The website contains resources covering a wide variety of scientific topics and is a truly unique tool for the schools that can access it.
Being the first UK state school to go to the Giant Jamboree in Boston, our team felt our work was noteworthy enough to have an involvement on IRIS. When we saw that we had been given a small segment with our frog site link included, we were extremely excited. We now have access to thousands more students and teachers who will hopefully be inspired by our work in synthetic biology and the IGEM competition. Because of this we have raised awareness for this fascinating area of science. You can visit the IRIS website <a href="" http://www.researchinschools.org "">here</a>. which shows one of the greatest successes of our human practices.
March for Science
<img src=""
"" style=""width:20%"">
The March for Science took place on April 22nd 2017, where thousands of scientists, journalists and enthusiasts came together in over 500 cities worldwide to stand up for evidence based research, scientific rigour, sound methodology and expertise. Amongst the thousands were five members of the Judd iGEM team carrying a sign to demonstrate their support. This caught the eye of Peter Capaldi – the twelfth incarnation of Doctor Who! After getting his signature and photos, the team continued with the march where they saw many incredible banners and took in the atmosphere where these thousands of people were all marching for one cause. At the end of the march, a variety of scientists and journalists gave 5 minute speeches on why the movement was so important and how this needs to be promoted within society and politics. This march caused the whole team, not only those who attended, to reflect on"

The aim of the science sketches is to make a collaborative educational playlist with videos from teams all over the world, about their projects and/or the scientific principle behind their project. This playlist will be made public, so that any iGEM team can use it in their outreach activities, thus enabling all teams to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology to their communities.
We have also created a detailed description of how to make a science sketch to help other teams in creating their science sketches.

We collaborated with iGEM Team Linkoping Sweden in their Dear Diary initiative. We recorded interesting and fun things happened inside and outside the lab. We then sent it to Team Linkoping Sweden, who collected the diaries from each team and compiled them into a book/document. Through this initiative, we were able to showcase our excitement and interesting work for iGEM with the wider public.
We collaborated with iGEM Team IlT-Madras in their Language Project Initiative, aiding them in creating several synthetic biology educational videos in various languages. We received the English script of the video from IlT-Madras, translated in into different languages, as well as recording the audio of the script. Due to the diversity of our team, we were able to help them with 6 different language versions of the videos, namely, “Introduction to Synthetic Biology” in Mandarin, Bosnian, Korean, and “DNA and RNA” in Arabic.

Cell Free Protein Synthesis Systems Optimisation: Design of Experiments (JMP)
Abstract Overview of DoE for CFPS Systems: Components of the CFPS supplement solution premix were the factors of CFPS systems which were analysed, and the software program JMP (SAS Institute Inc., 2016) was used to apply Design of Experiments. In the first step, each supplement was created as a continuous factor within the JMP software, and the second step was to create an experimental design using DoE (the type of design depends on the question being asked; e.g. which supplements are the most important or what are the optimal concentrations for supplements A-D). CFPS reactions were then performed according to the generated design (step 3), and data was collected to be input back into the JMP software (step 4). The fifth step was to use the JMP software to produce models and statistical analyses of the data. The results could then be used to create a new experimental design (e.g. to further analyse factors highlighted as important), or predictions could be directly tested through experimental testing and observed results compared to said predictions.
Rationale and Aim
Previous research has shown that the concentration of some components of the supplement solution are crucial for efficient protein synthesis, and that for each batch of extract produced the optimal concentration may need to be found (Yang, et al., 2012). Studies which have explored this have only focused on, at most, a few components at a time (Garamella, et al., 2016; Kelwick, et al., 2016), which means that important interactions between the components may have been missed. In this study, a multifactorial approach will be taken to investigate the effect that all supplements have on the protein synthesis activity of CFPS systems simultaneously. The specific aims for this section of the project were: (i) to demonstrate the applicability of DoE to determine important components of the supplement solution premix, and (ii) to demonstrate the ability of DoE to predict concentrations of CFPS supplements which yield optimal protein synthesis activity.
Background Information
Traditionally, biologists tend to use One Factor At a Time (OFAT) approaches to determine the effect and importance of factors on a system, which can sometimes be a poor method. By only determining the effect that a single factor has on a system at a time, important interactions can be missed. For example, removing only factor A may have no effect, and removing only factor B may also have no effect, but removing both may cause an adverse effect. Therefore, it"
Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," so agar dilution testing is both labor intensive and expensive. And agar dilution cannot be used to test more than one pathogen at a time.
Broth Dilution Method
The tube dilution test is the standard method for determining  levels of resistance to an antibiotic. Serial dilutions of the antibiotic are made in a liquid medium which is inoculated with a standardized number of organisms and incubated for a prescribed time. The lowest concentration (highest dilution) of antibiotic preventing appearance of turbidity is considered to be the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). At this dilution the antibiotic is bacteriostatic.
Varying concentrations of the antibiotics and the bacteria to be tested are then added to the plate. The plate is then placed into a non-CO2 incubator and heated at thirty five degrees C for sixteen to twenty hours. Following the allotted time, the plate is removed and checked for bacterial growth. If the broth became cloudy or a layer of cells formed at the bottom, then bacterial growth has occurred.
The broth dilution method can be used to test the susceptibility of bacteria to multiple antibiotics at once. Broth dilution is also highly accurate. The Other advantages include the commercial availability of plates, the ease of testing and storing the plates, and the ability for the results of some tests to be read by machines. However, the broth dilution method is only effective for testing Bacteroides fragilis. It could potentially be used with other bacteria populations, but the results would have to be correlated with agar dilution tests to be considered reliable. Although the tube dilution test is fairly precise, the test is laborious because serial dilutions of the antibiotic must be made and only one isolate can be tested in each series of dilutions.
ß-Lactamase test
Beta-Lactamase Test is a means of detecting the enzyme beta-lactamase, which confers penicillin resistance to various bacterial organisms by cleaving the beta-lactam ring of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. A wide variety of bacteria produce this enzyme, including both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. This acidimetric method is recommended for use in testing beta-lactamase production by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus species and Staphylococcus species.
E-Test
Etest, (previously known as Epsilometer test) manufactured by bioMérieux, is a manual in vitro diagnostic device used by laboratories to determine the MIC and whether or not a specific strain of bacterium or fungus is susceptible to the action of a specific"

The iGEM Experience: At first I was worried that I couldn't make it into the team, but once I started I realized that there was a lot I didn't know about synthetic biology, much less to have it so close, I understood that there is so much that can be done in that field and it has been a great learning experience.
Research Interests: I'd llove to have the opportunity to work with marine ecosystems, specially with coral reefs or whales. I love to dive and snorkel, I believe that the ocean is greatly diverse and it is impressive. Earth also has a great diversity but, the depth of the ocean is something so marvelous with all of the creatures and it is a shame that we cannot study it so easily.

Little Conference in NCTU
Towards the end of July we co-hosted a small iGEM meetup with Mingdao High School. Along with National Tsing Hua University, all three teams presented their projects. This was our second opportunity to share our ideas with other iGEM teams and receive criticism. The improvements we’d made after our first meetup in Wuhan made our project more understandable this time; of course, we were asked new questions that we’d yet to consider, such as how long our proteins would last in the environment. We found that the smaller scale of this meetup allowed for longer and more intimate discussions and really helped us identify some issues with our project. We were very lucky that Mingdao approached us with this amazing chance at improvement, and hope the other two schools benefitted as much as we did!
6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
This summer, NCTU_Formosa participated in the 6th annual Asia Pacific iGEM conference held at Chung Shing University in Taichung. Over twenty other teams attended the event, and each team took the opportunity to share their projects. We received a lot of constructive criticism from not only other students but teachers and advisors as well. From this, we were able to improve both our content as well as our presentation style. Additionally, we bonded with many other teams and schools and made long lasting friendships.
Phone Meetup (Abu Dhabi)
During the spring our team called Abu Dhabi over Skype to discuss both teams’projects. We explained our plan to control microbiota in soil, and Abu Dhabi shared their goals of making an incredible sensor. It was a great opportunity to practice expressing our ideas to others, and both teams learned more about both projects."

Introduction
This year our project is the introduction of acrylic synthetic routes in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce acrylic acid.
Primitive metabolic path map in E.Coli
We have a rational new design and transformation of the core enzyme ceaS2, at the same time,                                 we also want to be optimized to improve the acrylic acid production in the metabolic flow.
We know that for Escherichia coli, the carbon flow rate of its original glycerol metabolic                                 pathway may not be sufficient, and if the new glycerol metabolic pathway can be used to increase                                 the carbon flow of DHAP or G3P, the substrate of the core enzyme ceaS2 can be increased Concentration                                 to increase acrylic acid production.
Therefore, through the literature review, we found two enzymes which can achieve efficient                                 conversion of glycerol to generate DHAP the same way.
In our new approach, Glycerol dehydrogenase (Gly DH) is capable of efficiently converting                                 glycerol to 1,3-Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and then phosphorylates DHA to DHAP via Dihydroxyacetone                                 kinase (DAK).
New route map in E.Coli
Before the implementation of the formal experiment, we need to model it to analyze the impact                                 of the introduction of new routes on the original metabolic flow, especially the two intermediates                                 of DHAP or G3P. Specifically, we care about the following two issues:
1. Has the DHAP or G3P's carbon flow improved after the introduction of new metabolic pathways?                                 Is it compared to the previous increase in production?
2. The introduction of new pathways after the entire metabolic pathway is stable and robust.                                 How is it?
In order to answer these two questions, we established a carbon metabolic flow model.
The overall workflow is as follows:
Parameter estimation
There are many parameters to be determined in the model. Most of these kinetic parameters can                                 be found in the literature or in the database, but at the same time, there are some kinetic                                 parameters of the enzyme we are looking for. Its organic matter, or the temperature and ph"

Reheat the autoclaved LB agar in the microwave carefully until boiling point, cool down until you can hold it with your hands and add the antibiotic matching the resistance of your cells in the required amount. Make plates under sterile conditions using roughly 10 to 20 mL. Store them in the fridge upside down until usage.
Before printing, plate 500 µL of calcium chloride (0.1M) on the LB agar plate using standard plating technique to enable formation of a hydrogel. If further cell growth is desired, keep the plates at room temperature. At 37 degrees the alginate dries out within 24 hours.

Experimental approach on how to 3D print bacteria
When we started our first experiments on 3D printing bacteria, it became quite obvious we would need something to support our cells:
Printing RFP expressing cells in LB medium in the shape of a circle worked, but gravity and surface properties were working against us making the line almost 1 cm thick.
Sodium alginate is commonly used in biology to create a hydrogel by using calcium chloride and can be redissolved again by complexing the calcium ions and replacing them again with sodium ions. This hydrogel is both viscous enough to be immobile, while at the same time provides optimal living conditions for the bacteria.
Therefore we decided to disperse our bacteria in a solution of sodium alginate which would form a stable hydrogel during the printing process.
Our initial idea was to simultaneously extrude the bioink containing sodium alginate and the bacterial cells from one needle and the calcium chloride solution from another needle which is in direct contact with the first one. The idea was to directly jellify the alginate when leaving the needle, thus creating a cylinder with a thickness of the needle’s inner diameter. However, at low flow rates droplet and thus bead formation was unavoidable and high flow rates resulted only in dissatisfactory results (low control).
Since the mechanical setup additionally posed some difficulties, we tried a different approach: direct extrusion of the sodium alginate solution into a larger volume of dissolved calcium chloride. The flaws of this setup quickly became obvious: instead of extruding a cylinder, the hydrogel was mostly sticking to the needle and clogging was inevitable at low flow rates. Finally, the hydrogel was floating around freely in the liquid thus the required spatial precision for 3"

The ones that were cut with Xba I failed ( J23022 , J23032 and B0015 ) - we didn't get the expected result with gel electrophoresis.
Dry Lab
General
GFP primers were finished and ordered. Antisense LuxI primers were written down and will soon be ordered. The primers have been given their place in the notebook section of the wiki.
As we noticed problems with M30109 - the ""physical DNA"" description of the part on the Registry proves nothing good and Melbourne 2007 reported problems with the part - we contacted the Melbourne 2008 team. They work with this part, and we hope that they can help us out.
We did some research about the origin of the EnvZ::KmR mutation in V1012 and found the paper of Mizuno and Mizushima. Based on the information in that paper, we will make primers to check whether the transduction has been a succes (or not).
Modeling
Mainly chillin' out, memory was finished and complete model is functional.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," some of their strains in our plate reader.
During our own project we have worked with the microplate reader extensively. We tested eight different constructs in a microplate reader: three different BioBricks for expression of various fluorescent proteins and five different devices for the expression of GFP, each with a different promoter. The protocol used for this experiment can be found here .
Figure 1. We grew and tested 8 different strains from Delft. The figures they made with our data can be found in Figure 1 on their Collaborations page .
On top of that, the Delft team performed an experiment for us. An essential part of our in vitro toxicity assay were vesicles made from the gut membrane of Varroa mites. We were hoping for a picture showing the presence of these vesicles. The TU Delft team helped us with this by making pictures of our vesicles using an transmission electron microscopy!The pictures as shown in Figure 2. In short, we are content with the results we got and the practice we had through this collaboration.

Groningen
For the Groningen iGEM team, we tested and improved their system ""CryptoGERM"". CryptoGERM was developed to encrypt messages in the DNA of Bacillus subtilis spores, that can only be decoded using a key that is also in a spore.  We received a message to decrypt from the Groningen team. As we tested the system in an early stage, when it was not fully developed, we used a translator webpage instead of spores containing the key.
The procedure is as follows:
Grow spores.
PCR the encoded message.
Sequence the PCR product.
Unfortunately, the first attempts of PCR amplifying the message failed. We tried to perform colony PCR and tested different adjustments of the protocol:
Longer initial denaturation time.
Less DNA as template.
Addition of DMSO.
However, we could not obtain the correct PCR fragment. Subsequently, we tried to isolate the genomic sequence of the bacteria first. After doing this we obtained a nice PCR product that was sent for sequencing. Thus, we proposed to change the protocol from colony PCR to PCR from isolated and purified genomic DNA.
