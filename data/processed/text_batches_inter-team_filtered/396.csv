System Regulation
Our regulatory team has decided to reconstitute the light induction system or Coliroid which was the work of the 2004 joint University of Texas at Austin and UCSF iGEM team and is described at http://partsregistry.org/Coliroid 5 . The Coliroid is a two component response mechanism which is composed of three genes. First, heme is used to create a phycocyanobilin by two genes isolated from Synechocystis, pcyA and ho1. This phycocyanobilin then associates with a chimeric light receptor, Cph8 which is the fusion product of Cph1 and Envz-OmpR. Stimulation with red light inhibits autophosporylation of the receptor which can be used to produce a differential output of INP-Silicatein.
After attempting and failing to recover the Coliroid parts from the DNA distribution kits (BBa_I15008, BBa_I5009, BBa_I5010, and BBa_M30109), we began cloning pcyA and ho1 from Synechocystis. The Voigt lab was kind enough to send us the Cph8 part in a plasmid which we were able to successfully clone into our own vectors. Below is a schematic describing the construction of the complete Coliroid regulatory system.
Figure 4. We began constructing our regulatory cascade by cloning pcyA and ho1 into pUCBB-pBad and Cph8 into pUCBB-pTet as shown above.
Figure 5. pUCBB-pBad-pcyA was digested with XbaI and PstI and pUCBB-pBad-ho1 was digested with SpeI and PstI. The pcyA insert was then ligated into the ho1 backbone to yield pUCBB-pBad-ho1-pcyA. This arrangement"

After infiltration, the plants were left in a normal light/dark cycle at room temperature for 24 hours before being put in the dark for 24 hours. In the dark the plants would break down the stores of starch in their leaves.
After the dark treatment the samples from the infiltrated plants as well as control plants that had not been infiltrated were decolorized to remove the green chlorophyll and stained with iodine, which stains starch granules. A duplicate set of experiments was allowed to grow in the light for the rest of the day to build up new stores of starch. These were then assayed in the same manner to determine if expression of the putative acyltransferases interfered with starch accumulation.
RESULTS:
Colonies of A. tumefaciens were screened by PCR to confirm the presence of the binary construct (Figure 1).
Figure 1: The gel lanes are as follows – 1 = Ladder, 2 = BBa_K1618033 control, 3&4 = BBa_K1618033 Agrobacterium, 5 = BBa_K1618035 control, 6&7 = BBa_K1618035 Agrobacterium, 8 = Ladder, 9 = BBa_K1618036 control, 10&11 = BBa_K1618036 Agrobacterium, 12 = BBa_K1618034 control, 13&14 = BBa_K1618034 Agrobacterium. The comparison between the agro-transformations and the sequence confirmed control suggests that the cloning was successful.
After 24 hours in the dark the leaves from all samples were free of starch (Figure 2A). This allowed us to determine the amount of starch accumulated in the following 24 hours. Leaves sampled after 24 hours in the light all stained dark with iodine. There is no difference in the amount of staining observed in samples from leaves infiltrated with the A. tumefaciens strains that contained the binary vectors expressing putative acyl transferases as compared to the control samples (Figure 2B).

Abstract
When information flows through gene-regulatory networks, noise is introduced, and fidelity suffers. A cell unable to correctly infer the environment signals from the noisy inputs may be hard to make right responses. What factors can possibly alter the circuit's ability to sense extrinsic information?
There are many “parallel circuits” in gene-regulatory networks where independently transcribed monomers assemble into functional complexes for downstream regulation. We wonder if those frequent dimerization designs are fundamental in improving the circuit properties. In addition, would higher affinity between monomers boost the quality as well?
Inspired by these thoughts, we construct synthetic biology circuit by using split florescent proteins. And we add inteins to split florescent proteins to the make the binding tighter. Then, we quantitatively measure the capacity of these information channels aided by information theory. Computation and wet lab work are combined to optimize our understanding of such systems, and to interpret potential biological significance of reoccurring parallel designs in nature.
introductory Story
Let us tell a simple but interesting story to help you understand what our project is about and also relax yourselves before you look into our project.I believe all of you know about a term called binaural effect which means you can judge where a thing is with less deviations when you use both of your ears. Similarly, here is the story.
Li lei is an undergraduate from Tsinghua University and Han Meimei is an undergraduate from Peking University. They met and knew each other when they attended the Jamboree of iGEM. After that they always communicated through WeChat and fell in love with each other. So Li lei often called Han Meimei to make sure that how she is going and wanted to make her feel happy. But he had a problem. The telephone line was very noisy and Han Meimei could not hear what he said clearly every time he called her. He knew that and he was very depressed because he worried about that Han Meimei would be angry with him. One day he came up with a good idea and he bought two. Since then he bought two amplifiers and used them both when he called her. Now Han Meimei can hear him clearly and this tells us that when you use two paths other than one to transmit your messages, the noises"

Outreach
Another aspect of our policy and practice project entailed outreach within schools to educate the next generation of scientists about synthetic biology. As this is an emerging science, these are the individuals who will be pioneering the technology and so we believed they would be the perfect target audience for our session. We carried out the outreach sessions in Porto, Portugal and Manchester, England.

Collaboration
Collaborations
While it is of vital significance to carry out experiments in the lab, we also need to step out to seek for collaborations with other iGEM teams which will certainly give us a better understanding of our project and make it more far-reaching. This year, collaborations with teams and conferences came out and take a look at our collaborations now!
Instructor of SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
Both located in Shanghai and took part in the iGEM 2017 Championship, ECUST established contact with Shanghai Xiehe High School. Serving as the instructor, we held several discussions on experimental design and assisted them on the Interlab experiments. Working with other members and teams is a necessity in scientific field, and when it comes to iGEM, it is even more indispensable.

Collaborations with SJTU
Apart from Shanghai Xiehe High School, ECUST also had collaborations with Shanghai Jiaotong University. This summer, we invited the members from SJTU to take a Lab Visiting Day in our campus and exchange ideas on iGEM competition. On top of that, we two teams also carried out collaborations on experiments such as plasmid transformation and monoclonal screening. By communicating viewpoints, we gained many valuable suggestions which are useful to refine our project.

CCiC
This August, the 4th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was held in Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University and some of our members attended the conference. There were many professors and scholars delivering speeches on synthetic biology and China iGEM teams sharing their projects. By communicating with professors and other teams, we gained a much deeper understanding of the principle and mechanism of Synbio.
Besides lectures and workshops, there was also time for social activities to know about other teams.

Tongji-China
Late in August, Tongji University hosted a Community Open Night for iGEM teams in Shanghai, which was a workshop for us to communicate with each other. The night was a great success and gave the Shanghai teams a chance for collaboration and communication.

The negative reference did not show any detectable activity. It should be noted that the growth medium for the strain containing PalcA was different from the growth medium of the reference strains. Furthermore, the PalcA strain did not grow well in the glycerol containing media. This means that in principal PalcA can not be compared to the reference. The figure above shows that the specific activity of PgpdA 1.0 kb is more than double the specific activity of DMKP-P6. The figure also shows that the specific activity of PalcA when compared to PgpdA 1.0 kb is more than three times as high. Compared with the qualitative analysis, we would have expected that the specific activity of PalcA and DMKP-P6 would have been similar to the activity of PgpdA 1.0 kb this was however not the case.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#Cholera - Detection#Winterexp#Period1#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," we when arrived at class and began discussing, Dr. Grose presented a better idea. We can use a lysogenic phage specific to E.Coli, rather than a cholera specific phage. We’ll engineer this phage with EPS depolymerases on its tail proteins, and then we will infect our E.Coli with the phage and grow E. Coli with copies of the virus prophage incorporated in its genome. If we can then engineer our bacteria so that the prophage DNA will be excised and expressed when E.Coli detects cholera, lysing the E.Coli and attacking the biofilm, then that will be an incredible iGEM project. Clarice, Kelton and I transformed plasmid IG78 into E.Coli and plated on about 10 plates of LB Amp. During the transformation of our first 50 microliters of E.Coli, we think the hot water bath failed to achieve 42 degrees Celsius, and it’s likely the transformation didn’t work. For that reason, we did the transformation again (using only 1 microliter of plasmid instead of 2 microliters because we’re very low). We shocked the DH5alpha with the hot water bath in Dr. Griffitts lab instead of the one in ours. We hope to harvest the plasmid on Friday.

-CH More discussion of where our project is going. Redid the transformation with help from Jordan. RESULT: No contamination issues. The transformation rate was very high. Two colonies were streaked to singles and grown up in overnight cultures (LB Amp) in preparation for a mini prep.
-KK Bad news: our transformations were infected by who knows what type of bacteria. It wasn’t the LB, because the solution was clear on wednesday and was clear today as well. The tips were autoclaved. We think the plates we used may not have been completely sterile. So today we did the transformation again with 1 microliter plasmid and 50 microliters of DH5alpha. It is about the last of the plasmid we have to use. Jordan supervised the transformation to ensure it went well. He made a few new plates of LB-AMP just today so he’s confident they are sterile. NOTE: during the transformaiton we again had issues with the temperature of the hot-shock plate. The reading was 42 degrees C but our thermometer showed that the true temperature was lower. We increased the temperature of the hot plate to 46 degrees and the thermometer read the correct"

Our project draws on the work of several previous iGEM teams, including the 2009 UCSF team’s investigations into potential safety issues associated with conducting synthetic biology experiments outside of academic or corporate settings and the 2012 Edinburgh team’s efforts to increase the accessibility and user-friendliness of synthetic biology. We thank these teams for their contributions and hope that future iGEM teams will join us in building upon their work.

I. Why we design this project?
The relationships between populations and individuals are very complex. For gregarious animals like ants, there exists an ant society, in which a clear division of labor can be seen. Despite of it, how the society is organized is still a mystery. For animals so simple as ants, the interactions between individuals still involve lots of genes. Similarly, for us human, how our society works is also a very complicated problem. Though difficult to study, the knowledge of the organization of societies is really precious as it directs our further research into behaviors and more importantly, gives us more angles to view history and instructs us to make the present society better.
As all of these systems are too complicated and uncontrollable, it is hard for us to study these systems directly to understand the nature of these relationships. To achieve this goal, this year we decided to use our knowledge of synthetic biology to construct a simple system which can be used to simulate many kinds of relationships between individuals and populations. Through this system, we can simplify the complex natural system so we can get a better understanding of these relationships.
What is more, we found that it will be much easier to consider effects of some factors (Like initial number of each populations and spatial factors) on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War ( Game Overview & Discovery ) to satisfy our needs.
Despite of the research values of our system, we found that as it is very simple and even kind of fun, it can be easily understood by the public. Therefore, we use our game to make more kids"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Labnotes_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmid is shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7. plasmid contained circuit one and circuit three (a,b)
September
Content: we constructed the first repressilator and change the vector of detection device from high copy to low copy.
1.The construction of first repressilator: The first repressilator contained three gene circuits: circuit one, two and three, and at that moment, we connected circuit one with circuit three, lacking of circuit two. We tried our best to construct it and due to the special condition that we needed to connect this two part reversely and change the vector of repressilator from high copy to low copy, we designed a new method to connect two parts reversely that we digested circuit one and three by EcoRI enzyme and PstI enzyme, meanwhile, we digested circuit two by EcoRI enzyme and XbaI enzyme and target vector by XbaI enzyme and PstI enzyme, leading to the result that there was a common EcoRI site for ligation between circuit two and the compound contained circuit one and three. We’ve tried at least five times in this construction and we tried to separate this procedure into two steps: connection first and then change the vector, but all tries failed. Surprisingly, in the sixth trial, we may design an optimal system of ligation including the proportion between target DNA and vector, we constructed this repressilator successfully. Gel electrophoresis spectrum diagram of plasmid is shown in Figure 8
Figure 8. plasmid of repressilator
2.Changing the vector of detection device from high copy to low copy: we should change the vectors of two detection devices including the compound contained circuit four and circuit six and the gene circuit eight, and at the same time, we changed the vector of RNA aptamer generator which played the same function as fluorescent protein. The indicator to judge whether it had changed successfully or not was the resistance gene: the vector of high copy had chloramphenicol-resistance gene and the vector of low copy had Ampicillin-resistance gene.
October
Content: we constructed our seventh gene circuit about quorum sensing and tested the intensity of GFP through fluorescent microscope and microplate reader.
Construction of gene circuit seven: We divided this circuit into four parts: AiiA protein generator, LuxI protein generator, LuxR protein generator and GFP generator. Both the parts GFP expression controlled by LuxR promoter and luxR protein generator under  regulation were found in Plate Kits. As for another two parts, we did them the same thing as the construction"

UChile Biotec
As part of our Human Practices, we collaborated with the UChile Biotec team. Last year they published a magazine called “iGEM Latinoamérica” to recognize all the work being done by teams all over Latin America. In this magazine, they mostly included descriptions of the different projects, of their Human Practices, and the difficulties they had been experiencing along the way. This year they decided to launch a second edition of the magazine and in the process of doing so, we contributed information about our project, difficulties, and even information about Peru, as a country involved in tourism. Because of their experience with creating magazines, we asked them to help us with our own magazine: the “Journal of FDR Science.” In this issue of the “Journal of FDR Science,” we decided to spotlight our iGEM project this year; in order, to promote the work we’ve done to the rest of our community. Our journal includes our abstract; articles about the health effects resulting from mercury contamination coming largely from metal mines in Peru; and lab safety. Throughout this last month, we have been in frequent contact with UChile Biotec asking for their feedback on each and every one of our drafts. Most of their feedback helped us review the content in our articles, the layout of the journal, and added crucial information about iGEM."

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Applet_-_-_TEXT.html," to use some successful projects and cases to carry out scientific popularization of synthetic biology for a large number of potential users. If the public can learn more about synthetic biology, be able to participate in discussions about synthetic biology and give timely feedback, they may change the original idea of resistance to synthetic biology. Therefore, there is more concern and support for the research and exploration of synthetic biology.
Example
For our iGEM team
At first, we put our three ideas through brainstorming in our applet We wanted to see what do the public think of our thoughts. According to their feedback from the applet comment part, we finally decided to do the cockroaches project to meet their urgent need . It can be proved that we can collect people’s timely feedback and get a guidance with the help of our applet
HP and public engagement platform for all teams
At the mid term of our project, we wanted to have a closer contact with the public to make our whole project reasonable and comprehensive. Therefore, we posted our recent works to the applet and looked for the possible human practice.
After posting, a teacher from Yueliangwan Primary School made a phone call to us for a science popularization and we found a suitable place to offer our help to prevent cockroaches and test our application.
For the public
Fortunately, we have some fans that are quite interested in our cockroach project. At first they ask us many questions for they know little about that. After they had a general understanding of our project, some of them even gave us a litter bonus to support us. When our Green Ground finally came out, they gave us suggestion to make it better used in the house.
How it works
1. Make technology close to unprofessional people
Q: As a person who knows nothing, how do I participate in advanced technology and give advice?
A: You can just click on an article on this page, or read the idea that the article belongs to. This is an HP platform for the public with popularization of science.You can easily understand and comment on the response.
Q: I can just read articles in technical magazines. Is it really necessary to use your app?
A: Reading technical articles is only an one-way output for the public, without participation. If you use our mini program, you can join in the whole process of R&D. Each of our teams has a reward code. If you like this idea, you can give advice and sponsor it. So this product may develop in the way you want, developing the technology product that suits you. Just like raising a child. You can read all kinds"

Teaching
Part of iGEM is not only about contributing to our current community but also expanding that community. Duke iGEM always enjoys getting others involved and teaching is a main tenet of our overall human practices strategy. To not only teach people about what science is we also wanted to teach practical skills to as many as we could. As a result, we taught two different students wet lab skills.
During the course of our project we had two different students work with our team. Justin Park joined our team during the summer; he is a high school student from William G. Enloe High School. Emma worked with Justin to teach him basic lab skills and show him how academic research actually works. After the semester started, Daniel joined our team and Azim was able to teach him valuable skills that Daniel hopes to propel into future iGEM projects. Below is more information about each of their experiences.
Justin's Testimonial
This summer during my research internship at the Lynch Lab, I was given the opportunity to work with the Duke iGem team. The opportunity to work on a college iGem team was one-of-a-kind as I was only a high school student. It was amazing that as a high school student I had access to all of the lab and iGem resources. I learned a lot about synthetic biology and I learned various lab skills. I actually loved the experience so much that I shifted my high school extracurricular focus to synthetic biology and I am currently laying out the plans to start an iGem team at my school in preparation for next years competition. Working with college students on the iGem project every day cemented my passion for science and I hope to pursue a degree in Biomedical Engineering in college. Working on the iGem team was a truly extraordinary experience and it is something that I will never forget.

Talking with Experts
Trevor Charles, PhD, Department of Biology, University of Waterloo Dr. Charles is an expert in functional metagenomics, as well as the co-founder of Metagenome Bio Inc, a company which makes and screens metagenomic libraries for industries like mining, and agriculture. In June of 2017 he welcomed members of Dalhousie iGEM into his lab to teach the basic of metagenomic library construction. Dr. Charles’ team are the reason we got as far as we did, offering their experience, as well as giving us their cosmid, and the bacterial host.
Su-Ling Brooks, PhD, Department of Process Engineering and Applied Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada Dr. Brooks’ research revolves around bioprocessing, food engineering, fermentation, extraction of natural products, and waste utilization and treatment. For this reason, we eagerly wanted to speak to her about the biofuel component of our project, and our ideas surrounding bioreactor construction. We presented her with two bioreactor ideas (see images below). The first option involved two bioreactors, one specifically for E. coli to degrade cellulose into glucose, and another for yeast to convert glucose into ethanol. The second option involved one bioreactor and a E. coli-yeast co-culture. During the course of our presentation, Dr. Brooks posed many insightful questions primarily surrounding the logistics of co-cultures, and the requirements of our organisms. At the end of the meeting we came away realizing that we still had a lot to learn about bioreactors. It was at this meeting that we began drawing up plans for future shake flask experiments.
Mark Dubé, Port Hawkesbury Paper, Cape Breton, Canada Mr. Dubé elaborated on the cellulose waste treatment at the Port Hawkesbury pulp and paper mill in Cape Breton and identified two main types of waste: bark chips and a mix of clay, cellulose, and organic phosphates. All this waste goes into a biomass boiler to produce the steam needed to dry the paper in downstream processes. “We have looked into biofuel production, but it is too expensive…the technology isn’t efficient enough.” Currently, Port Hawkesbury Paper buys wood waste from surrounding companies to fill it’s need for steam.

There are ethical and safety concerns regarding the use of a probiotic therapeutic. We discussed these issues with the Professor of Health, Law and Policy: Jane Kaye. Following her advice, we went to the public to discover their concerns. This acted as a springboard for our ethics and safety research.
Throughout the project we aimed to educate and engage the public on a local, national and international level!
We also heavily integrated discussions with patients and doctors into our design.

        INVESTIGATE AND SURVEY
 
 
        We have designed  a questionnaire to survey the masses' attitude toward sewage treatment, power    generation, and MFCs. This questionnaire was made up by 16 questions and the  respondents are random selected by all ages, genders and positions in China and    U.K. 
 
 
Complete the survey
Students are taught to complete the survey made   by our own.
 
        We have found that in China, 68.23%  of the respondents believe that they suffer from water pollution   and 15.38% of  them think their hometown is seriously polluted. But in U.K., surprisingly, 70.59%  of the people believe that they do not suffer from any kind of water   pollution.  This interesting phenomenon appears in London (which we initially thought the  water was serious polluted by industry long times ago), all of the   respondents  from London think that the water, for example in Thames, was clean and clear.
                
        People  show hesitation towards sewage treatment using bacteria. 32.31% of the Chinese  respondents can   fully accept the recycled water using bacteria. For 64.62% of  them, recycled water using bacteria is not drinkable but it is acceptable for  toilet flushing. When   gene modified bacteria involved, this number is decreased  to 61.54%. Obviously, 9.23% of the Chinese people refuse to using this kind of  water and even 3.08% of them   fight against gene modified gem using for sewage  treatment. This situation is similar in U.K.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eucaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html," of VDR with retinoid-X receptor, the complex is transferred into the nucleus and binds to several promoters (vitamin D response elements) thereby increasing or decreasing the transcription of the appropriate genes. The genes modulated by the VDR-calcitriol complex are involved in activating the immune system, bone formation and protection of cancer [32] . Many studies for example indicate a relationship between vitamin D signalling and reduced breast cancer occurance [33] . Furthermore the transcription of the VDR gene itself is positively regulated by the presence of calcitriol.

Zink fingers interacting with DNA. Image under GNU license
Zink finger protein 5 (ZF5) is transcription factor playing an important role as a transcriptional repressor. ZF5 is composed of 5 zink finger motives enabling the multimerisation process and the binding of ZF5 to GC- rich DNA elements [34] .  Both the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) promoter [35] and the c-myc promoter [34] are targets of the ZF5 transcription factor. The appropriate genes are repressed as a result of the binding process. However, ZF5 is not only a transcription repressor, binding to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter leads to an enhanced transcription of the appropriate gene.
WT1
Wilms' tumor protein 1 (WT1) is a transcription factor containing three zink finger motives. The WT1 transcription factor regulates genes being involved in developmental processes (for example development of the urogenital system, kidney, blood vessel formation and heart [36] ) and cell survival [37] . The many isoforms of WT1 in different tissues are the reason for the multitude of functions.  Mutation of the appropriate gene can result in the formation of Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma).
RAR
Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a transcription factor belonging to the family of nuclear receptors. RAR builds a hetereodimer with Retinoid X receptor (RXR), this complex is able to bind to specific response elements. Transcriptional activation of the appropriate gene occurs when the ligands all-trans retinoic acid or 9-cis retinoic acid bind to the complex. Genes regulated by RAR are thought to be involved in developmental processes [38] .
NFAT
Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is a transcription factor family consisting of 5 members (NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, NFATc4, and NFAT"

A Miniprep from RBS 4G was performed using NucleoSpin® plasmid kit and following the manufacturer’s protocol (Macherey-Nagel).
Saturday
Izadora
The DNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop (NanoDrop 1000 3.8.1) in the following samples:
InvFull long: 40.9ng/μL
Ehaj 1: 45.9ng/μL
LacZ-beta Stop: 41.0ng/μL
LacZ-beta Stop: 37.6ng/μL
Signal peptide: 65.2ng/μL
RBS - pSB1C3: 32.3ng/μL
An A3 assembly was done using RBS - pSB1C3, but after digestion the digested products were tested in a gel electrophoresis with agarose gel (0.7%).
No fragments were seen, but the ladder.
In an attempt to correct subsequent failures of A3 assembly, the iGEM’s protocol was changed and 500ng of DNA was used, instead of 250ng suggested. For that reason, the digestion was performed at 37°C for 1hour.
In addition to that, the transformation efficiency kit from iGEM was used following the protocol to check the efficiency of the competent cells being used.

We helped Freiburg spreading their survey and wrote together with the other iGEM teams a letter to the iGEM HQ concerning property rights . See also our collaborations .
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
We used a new Policy & Practice approach to address possible application scenarios . We also investigated unwanted impacts of our project in a techno-morale vignette . As a result we adopted our pathway under the aspect of downstream processing.

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," took the ECFP from a previous part (BBa_E0020) and split it at the A155 site and use the addition of leucine zipper (BBa_K2886006) as a positive control, and test it in both E. coli BL21 and our two cell lines (Figure 3).
Figure 3. BiFC tests. (a) Split ECFP with leucine zipper is expressed in E. coli to verify its reliability.  (b) VEGF-scFv-nECFP and VEGF-scFv-cECFP are expressed in HEK293T and HeLa to see if our extracellular domain works.
After the BiFC test is done we are able to test the whole STEP system. To guarantee a reliable reporter expression we first built a stable cell line of mCherry reporter with pTight promotor of both HEK293T and HeLa cells, and used transient transfection of transcription factor tTA to select a best monoclonal cell strain. After that we transfect it with a single chain or both chains of VEGF-STEP, adding VEGF to the solution and see if it makes a difference. We also test different transfection quantity and ratio of two chains, and build a model to study the best transfection condition (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Principles of our modelling work.
Another work we decide to do is to raise the binding affinity of the scFvs and ligands. An improved binding affinity means a stronger attraction between the two chains when signal protein exists, thus increasing the dynamic range of our system. A little change of sequence on the interface of the extracellular domain can affect the structure of that interface to a large extent, and the binding affinity might be greatly increased or decreased. As it should be, we can certainly try every permutation of residues on the interface by mutating residues again and again and screen out the best sequence through wet experiment. A better strategy is to look before you leap. Instead of enumerating those possibilities of the sequence in wet lab, we can first test it virtually in dry lab. Here, we use Rosetta, a software for computational modeling and analyzing of protein structures, to accelerate the process of designing and redesigning. Through Rosetta we can achieve structure predicting, macromolecule interacting and sequence designing for the ligand binding domain of these two chains. After acquiring a certain mutation with the lowest energy, we can express the mutant protein, compare its binding energy with the original protein through ITC test and in turn model our work or optimise the algorithm we use"

Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN

Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the following definition for endocrine disruptor: Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere at a certain level with your endocrine (or hormone) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders.[Ref.]
To conclude these questions about air pollution and its impact on our society, we asked two questions about the solution we are developing. Respondents were asked to rate their interest on a scale of 1 (not interested) to 5 (I'm really interested). With an average of 3.89 / 5, it seems that our device meets a strong interest. We also asked the participants which scale seems most effective for combating air pollution. A very large part of the participants thinks the fight against pollution must take place at a local and then global scale. These findings have influenced our scenario, which you can find here. Indeed, we imagined a scenario where global foundations or health organizations take care of aether financing. The product will than have a life cycle on a local scale, between the consumer’s house and the local collect center.
In the overall study, we found that most people were interested in a solution using synthetic biology but that more than half did not think this branch of biology was safe. We observed similar conclusions in our European subsample. We have therefore conducted our investigations further to better understand this finding and to raise awareness among people with limited knowledge. We asked questions to evaluate the knowledge of people regarding synthetic biology and see if they would accept a solution based on it.
As can be seen, a vast majority of respondents, more than 69%, do not know the term ""synthetic biology"", while on the contrary, 97% of respondents think they know what a ""GMO"". The word GMO, associated with several scandals including food, is connoted very negatively in Europe. Looking at the third graph, we can see that the majority of interviewees do not have any problem with GMOs and consider that they are a great technical tool to address certain issues linked to health, environment or energy. What annoys most respondents is the fact that this is a new science that we do not have enough perspective to judge the effects. They are also concerned that GMOs are released into the wild and have an unintended effect. We realized the importance of communicating around the safety of our device and the fact that we produce GMOs, but we do not take them out of the laboratory.
We gave the following definitions on Synthetic biology: “Synthetic biology is a field in biology where biological functions found in living systems of nature, are used as solutions to address technical issues in"

I cut everything with X,P with the exception of J23101+TetR which was cut with E,S and S,P.  The gel showed correct sizes for the pCat+TetR+pTet+R/YFPc as well as the RD of K156026.  However, the bands of J23101+TetR were too faint to extract from the gel, but they appear to be correct.

Enzyme Assays
Overview
In order to determine the successful activity of our chosen enzymes, we used a number of assays to measure levels of reactants and products in the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production pathway. Assays were designed to measure the presence of tryptophan (initial reactant), indole-3-acetamide (IAM, the intermediate reactant) and IAA (product).  As a simple, fast, and inexpensive test we used a Salkowski assay, previous described by iGEM Imperial College London 2011, which measured levels of IAA production over time.  An HPLC assay was additionally used to gather more detailed data about the relative abundance of each of the reactants and products over a given time period.
Introduction
IAA biosynthesis was selected as our candidate pathway for investigating the performance of our Assemblase scaffold. The IAA biosynthesis pathway involves the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide by the enzyme IaaM, followed by conversion to IAA by the enzyme IaaH (Figure 1). In order to examine the performance of the IaaM and IaaH enzymes in our Assemblase scaffolding system compared to when they are free in solution, it was necessary to set up assays to quantify reaction turnover. To this aim, we established the Salkowski assay and HPLC in our lab. These assays allow us to determine the relative abundance of each of the reactants and final product in the IAA production pathway.
Figure 1: The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis pathway.
Aim
Our aim was to be able to determine the relative abundance of each of the reactants and final product in the IAA production pathway. In doing so, we hoped to evaluate the effectiveness of our scaffold by comparing the quantity of IAA produced by the scaffolded enzymes with the quantity of IAA produced by the non-scaffolded enzymes over a certain time period"

Function B: MRI Contrast Agent
This is a detailed description of an individual function of our circuit. To access other functions and get an overview of the whole circuit, visit the Circuit page.
Introduction
Since the beginnings of modern medicine, doctors have been eager to see what's happening on the inside of the body rather than to just treat blindly.
Therefore, it comes as no surprise that one of the characteristics that the ideal bacterial cancer therapeutic should posses is external detectability. The ability to see from the outside what's happening on the inside would allow the doctor to get critical information about the state of the tumor, the success of localization and the efficacy of treatment. [1]

The Imaging Modality
To achieve this in CATE, the first step was to choose the imaging modality. Several methods have already been used to visualize contrast-producing bacteria, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI), Fluorescence Imaging, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). [2] [3] [4] To pick one, we carefully evaluated advantages and disadvantages of these different techniques (Table 1).
Our final decision: MRI. We chose MRI because it is a well-established imaging method in humans, readily available in the clinics. It offers good spatial resolution and does not use ionizing radiation, which means it is in no way harmful. Finally, focused ultrasound, an integral part of our Heat Sensor , uses exclusively MRI image guidance. Therefore, for both theoretical and practical reasons, we decided to incorporate an MRI reporter gene into CATE.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", although deGFP may show improved expression in CFPS systems than other GFP variants, sfGFP still shows higher fluorescence levels.
Figure 6: CFPS Expression of J23100-deGFP and J23100-sfGFP Constructs. Time course for increase in fluorescence intensity of CFPS systems expressing GFP constructs over time. Each data point is an average of triplicate results, and error bars show +/- standard error. CFPS system with no DNA (Red) was used as the negative control.
Conclusions and Future Work
We have successfully managed to BioBrick standardise deGFP for the first time, and have fully characterised this reporter, both in cells and in cell-free systems. As expected, this GFP variant showed fluorescence in both types of chassis. We also compared this GFP variant to superfolder GFP (sfGFP), which as far as we are aware has not been done before. We found that sfGFP had a higher fluoresence intensity in whole cells and CFPS systems compared to deGFP.
deGFP was engineered from the eGFP variant originally by removing RBS-like binding sites from the sequence, and truncating the sequence in an attempt to enhance translational efficiency. It may be possible in the future to engineer a better alternative to deGFP by using sfGFP as a starting point, rather than eGFP.

Project Summary
Design
In order to achieve our specifications of design, we require the following devices;
Light sensing device - Converting a light input into a PoPS output
Biomaterial production device - Converting a PoPS input into an output of biomaterial production
Motility Control device - Converting a PoPS input into an output of motility arrest
Integration device - To allow integration and selection of our genetic constructs and devices into B,subtilis
Each of these constructs makes up the final device which is shown below:
(AB is our antibiotic resistance cassette, ytvA is the gene controlling the light-sensing pathway, SB is the biomaterial, epsE the clutch and the 5' and 3' sections are integration sites. Light-inducible promoters are labelled with an 'L')
Modelling
The Dry Lab used computational simulations to explore the different properties of the Biofabricator. Our activities are summarized on this page. To find out more please visit the Dry Lab Hub .
Growth Curve
We have developed a simple model for the growth of B. subtilis where the rate of growth is related to the amount of nutrients available. To this purpose we have exploited the ideas put forward by last year's Imperial College  iGEM team for their modelling of F2620 in a cell-free system.
Genetic Circuit
We have also built mathematical models for the time evolution of the basic genetic circuits that comprise our device. We have verified which model best describe the behaviour of the circuit better by using laboratory data.
Motility Analysis
Finally, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the swimming motility of B. subtilis, which led us, among other  things, to develop a simple mechanical model for the swimming motility of B. subtilis. Using manual tracking, we were able to extract x,y coordinate data from the cell trajectory. This has allowed us to fit experimental data with our model. The data suggest that flagellar force of B. subtilis is"

Northeastern_Boston,2015,Team:Northeastern Boston#Open Source_-_-_TEXT.html," Dengue-fighting mosquitoes, gene flow from transgenic crops can have unpredictable effects on the ecological landscape. Herbicide resistant plants can confer their immunity to weeds and other species. Long term herbicide usage eventually will lower its effectiveness, as the resistant weeds become dominant over their vulnerable brethren, causing farmers to switch to less environmentally-friendly herbicides, and lowering crop yield as once farmable land is overrun.
Any organism bestowed with a fitness advantage in the laboratory might have a similar effect when introduced into the wild. As more transgenic crops enter commercial use we may witness an increase in invasive species, biodiversity loss, or other unforeseen threats. Though these side effects likely will be too localized to warrant global concern, even marginal influences on an ecosystem can harm the quality of life and economy of the surrounding human population. Further down the road, too, synthetic biology will undoubtedly produce organisms capable of more severe damage that do demand global regulation.
As organizations like iGEM continue to catalog and standardize parts for open access, it will be easier for synthetic biology to be used in criminal and malicious ways. While it may be possible to screen orders for custom genetic strands now, it will not be when the technology for nucleotide synthesis becomes widespread and cheaper. One potential danger is the production of a super pathogen or other bioweapon. Current consensus [ 5 ] downplays the feasibility of a terrorist organization or other actor being proficient enough in the lab to reproduce professional experiments. However, difficulty level is unlikely to remain the sole barrier. We can safely assume that any sufficiently funded and knowledgeable organization—terrorist or otherwise—will be able to produce a bioweapon such as smallpox in the near future while facing little to no obstacles, if security measures remain at current levels.
Additionally, synthetic biology is also a huge boon for the narcotics industry. Labs have already devised new pathways in yeast for producing opiates using sugar instead of poppies, traditionally the key ingredient. Drug cartels of the future may be able to string together different biomachines into a veritable heroin factory, like building a meth lab out of LEGO.
For all the unending possibilities synbio brings to the table, current regulations are relatively sparse. United States biosecurity is focused on a predetermined list of toxins and biological agents and legislation addressing genetically engineered organisms is almost non-existent. The USDA, FDA, and EPA are responsible for the policing of specific end products, but do not oversee the processes that produce them. Additionally, the Controlled Substances Act does not prohibit drug-synthesizing microbes.
One hope is that synbio can be self-regulating. The same advances that will"

We shared some of the Biotech Week balloons, collaboration postcards and patches at the event and our banner was placed on a visible place outside the auditorium, so we hopefully reached a lot more people than just the listeners. In addition to organizing the event, Pauli Kallio was also kind enough to give us an inspiring tour at their laboratory and to tell us about their Cyanobacteria research. The Finnish fall was for once showing it’s best and all in all, we had an absolutely wonderful day in the beautiful city of Turku!
It deserves to be mentioned that even if this was our last visit before the Giant Jamboree, we will make several visits to the different departments and faculties of the University of Helsinki and Aalto University, as well as visit one high school and at least Thermo Fisher afterwards in order to spread the word about iGEM and synthetic biology even further.
Kampuskarkelot
Kampuskarkelot is an event organized by AYY - Aalto University’s student union. Its target audience is the freshers and new exchange students, and it is therefore organized in the main lobby of the university’s main building. Kampuskarkelot is a chance for student associations such as choirs, theatre clubs and events to market themselves to the new students. It was the first time that our iGEM association (Aalto-Helsinki Synthetic Biology ry) has participated the event. We got a chance to discuss with many interested students, who were eager to apply for the next year’s team! Even students from the Aalto Business School expressed interest in the project - a good chance to make our team even more multidisciplinary!
BIOTECH WEEK
Finnish Bioindustries (FIB) organized several events as part of EuropaBio’s European Biotech Week 25.9.-1.10.2017. We attended meetings, advertised the events on social media especially for bio students, shared Biotech Week balloons in Heureka and made a video (down below) about synthetic biology with Finnish narration, English subtitles and accompanying assignments. The video was released in our and FIB’s social media and in addition it was put to team Tübingen’s Youtube channel. You may find a version with English subtitles from here . After releasing both the video and the assignments were also added to Opetin, which is a free Finnish material bank for teachers. You can find it from here.

He was in the ICU for several weeks and underwent brain surgery, but he finally recovered enough for Nyesi to go to the local library to email us back. She provided us responses to our questionnaire and apologized for her absence. We are so grateful for Nyesi’s efforts for our project, especially in these difficult times for her family. Read More >> The responses we received through Nyesi were different than the others we’ve collected; one woman argued that having more accessible contraception encourages youth to become sexually active at earlier ages. Her viewpoint was similar to that of a woman from India, and our team realized that this was something we must consider if we want to encourage more contraception use. We also discovered another method of contraception in Africa: uterus removal. We weren’t aware that women used uterus removal as a means of birth control, and this news encouraged us to pursue our birth control method since it would be safer for women to use.
Promote Africa Foundation
We discovered the Promote Africa Foundation (PAF) through the Joy Women’s Group. The PAF is a united women’s group that runs programs related to female reproductive health and women’s rights. According to Evelyn Lewsley, the leader of the PAF, they “encourage women to space their children because most children are abandoned by families who fail to provide for their children”. The PAF encourages birth control methods throughout the Kasese District, and are currently encouraging birth control injections; however, they struggle to find users since injections sometimes cause bleeding and therefore deter women from use. The PAF hopes our birth control method will be safer for the women in Africa.
Rita Women Development Association
The Rita Women Development Association resides in the Rwenzori region of Western Uganda. This group empowers women in their community and promotes contraceptives to prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases. Through the recommendation of Kabugho Beatrace of KUWA, we met the Rita women. Masika Vicky, the chairperson of Rita, informed us of the stigma on birth control (primarily condoms because they are the only contraception available).

BACKGROUND
In 2009 research Cloning and expression analysis of a predicted toxin gene from Photorhabdus sp. HB78, plu0840 fused with GST is expressed in .coli BL21(DE3). Engineered strain BL21 was both orally fed and injected in hemocoel to two kind of moth (S. litura and S.exigua)(1).
According to the result, on the one hand, oral feeding effectively inhibits the growth of larva while has only weak oral toxic effect. On the other hand, hemocoel injection showed negative results.
The research mentions that Plu0840 (Figure 1) shares 55% sequence identity with an enterotoxin Ast from aeromonas hydrophila. Aaeromonas hydrophila, which is connected with gastroenteritis, may lead to altered fluid secretion in mouse. According to a 2002 research, enterotoxin Ast makes weak contributions to fluid secretion compared with two other genes (2) However, judging that TT01 is nontoxic to animals at all, we think Plu0840 may share little similarity with Ast.

We use primer pBad F / pBad R to amplify pBad and standard F / plu0840-right R for CDS plu0840.
Seamless assembly
We used seamless assembly as our assembly method so restriction digestion and T4 ligation can be avoided. Detailed protocol and instruction for primer design can be seen in our Protocol. By this way prefix sequence, pBad, CDS plu0840 and front twenty bases of mCherry sequence can be ligated seamlessly.

And this step is where our project is involved.
""Only a well-informed public is able to develop a non-prejudiced and profound opinion about synthetic biology.""
From the past we learned, that modern bioscience is not always accepted and fully integrated in the public interest. A good examle is the public view on green biotechnolgy in Germany and Europe. Many people in Germany are afraid of eating genetically manipulated food, although most do not even know the difference between genetically manipulated food and normal food. And a real problem arises when nescience about the scientific backround is added to this scepsis. The combination of nescience and scepsis is the sward of Damocles of every new, upcoming scientific field, such as green biotechnology once was, because this combination in many cases leads to fear and by that to non-acceptance in the society. And this is what green biotechnology has to battle every single day.
""Science can only work successful and develop useful inventions if it is based on a high level of acceptance in the society.""
Synthetic biology is up to now very young and far away from experiencing the same problematic lack of acceptance that genetic engineering and green biotechnology underwent in many European countries. But there is a risk that the public becomes sceptical towards the uprising star in the fields of lifesciences. And that could lead to unsubstantial prejudices and by that to non-acceptance of the modern synthetic biology research area.
A non-acceptance of synthetic biology by the public could lead to a retarding of the advance of synthetic biology and possibly to the non-development of many useful inventions. Our project is organized around the idea that only a well-informed public is able to develop a non-prejudiced and profound opinion about synthetic biology, which will be the basis for a healthy development of the relations between science and public. Therefore we worked on the following levels:

Week 8
This week we worked on the last details for the debate. We made a scheme with all the different tasks and divided them between the K.U.Leuven and ULB team members. For next week we have to print the info kits and the questionnaires. We also need to search for presents for the panel members and moderator. As soon as we know how many people will come, we can make the goodie bags. Alice made a presentation which she will give on the debate. UCB announced that they will be an Affiliated sponsor of our team ! Tom also designed the sweaters that we will wear on the debate and in Amsterdam.  We’re still working on a text for the human practices (the goal of our bacteria).
Week 9
This week we were very busy with the debate: Next to updating the info-kit and creating a flyer to thank our sponsors (and printing them), we assembled 150 goodie bags to give away after the debate. We also received 8 large boxes filled with free lab consumables from VWR international! Most of our time and energy, we spent on optimizing everything for the debate. The debate went well: it was very interactive, interesting and gave us lots of new idea's for our project! Especially Prof. Vanhelden had some remarks about the our safety documents, so we hope that he will send us these asap, so that we can still make some changes or at least update the text with his remarks/questions. Otherwise we'll probably implement his thoughts on our debate page.
Week 10
This week we worked on the ethics and education part. We wrote a small text for the children’s workshop to put on our wiki team page. Tom, Alice and Katrien gave their opinion about how they experienced working with children, explaining what DNA and synthetic biology is. Furthermore, we made graphs from the questionnaires distributed at our debate on September the first. These results will be the starting point for our text on the wiki, pictures and movies will be added. Tom put an extended project description online, with links to the BioBricks that we used. You can also find links to additional information about AFP and INP and CeaB in nature (really interesting)! Tom also created preliminary figures for the extended project, which probably will be 'pimped' by Chris and Stefan.We started with a global outline for our presentation and poster at the Jamboree in Amsterdam.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," work done by Weber et al, 2016 . Using the interaction between Phytochrome B and PIF6 they designed an optogenetic switch for enabling and disabling transcription of a chosen gene. It is based on the tetracycline operon and the transcription factor VP16. The tetO operator is located upstream of a minimal promoter which in turn is located upstream of the gene of interest. The tetR repressor binds to the tetO sequence. Fused to it is PIF6. Phytochrome B is fused to the transcription factor VP16. Upon illumination with red light, Phytochrome binds to the tetR-PIF6 complex. VP16 is now located in close proximity to the minimal promoter, which enables the RNA-polymerase-2 to start transcription of the gene of interest.
We designed a promoter part for the Dueber toolbox which consists of tetO and the minimal promoter region. This can be used as a promoter in a level 1 ligation for any desired gene of interest (a GFP-tagged Pex11 in our example).
Figure 9.3 Level 1 plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-Pex11 fusion protein with the tetO-pmin promoter
Transformation into S. cerevisiae is accompanied by co-transformation of a level 2 plasmid containing both the tetR-PIF6 and PhyB-VP16 constructs:

Verification methods depend on which gene is expressed. See size and number and secretion for details.
Design Rules For Genome Engineering Regarding Customization of Peroxisome Properties
In order to reach the ultimate goal of creating a fully controllable artificial compartment, genome engineering can be utilized for customizing the compartment's properties,.These include aspects such as membrane permeability, size/number, or decoupling of peroxisomes from the cytoskeleton, the peroxisomal proteome or metabolome. In our project we used the Crispr Cas9 system for knocking out several genes (Pex9, Pex31&Pex32, INP1, POT1) at the same time in order to engineer the previously mentioned properties. Furthermore, we designed a yeast strain  with a completely replaced protein-import machinery for controlling the entire peroxisomal lumen.
For the future one could think of much more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering with a final goal of a “minimal peroxisome” by redirecting metabolic"

4.What are the common ways to detect the two toxins, DON and ZEN? Is it time- consuming ?
——It usually takes us  3-4 days to get the final results. Basically, as soon as we got the samples. We would firstly process the samples, and then we sent these samples to  be tested by HPLC(High performance liquid chromatography). This device is complex and expensive. Few institute can afford that.
4.Could you tell us the rough content of two toxins that circulate in the food chain?
——It’s hard to say. The content of toxins is climate dependent. For example, in 2015, the content was way higher than the standard. According to the law, the content of DON in wheat should lower than 1000ug/kg, and ZEN should lower than 60 ug/kg.
Handbook
we created a handbook to introduce our project to almost all farmlands in Nanjing and students in our university and a high school in Nanjing.

The sequence of the second kinetic model is AT, ACP, KS, AT, KR, ACP, TE(Module 2 ignored).

Then we compare Model 1 with Model 2.
Analysis: According to the graph, we can conclude that two models have relatively large differences( The difference of Subtraction Model has a range of -0.10~0.06 μM and the difference of Division Model has a range of 0.65~1.05 ). This difference may result from the concentration difference of module 1 products and the extended units. When the concentration of the extended units more than that is needed to participate in the reactions, the concentration of Module 1 products is critical. At this time, it is suitable to choose Model 2. On the contrary, it is suitable to choose Model 1.

Compared with model 2 :
Analysis: According to the graph, we can There are relatively large differences between Model 3 and two models showed before. The initial rates of two models are relatively quicker than Model 3 and the concentration is more a half too.
In comparison of three models, we draw a conclusion that the simulation of DEBS1 catalyzed reactions is not accurate.
The possible reason are:
(1) Determination of kinetic constants is in specific environment. The constants provided from literature are not companied with the related data of environment. Therefore, we have no evidence to select the constants.
(2) In modeling work, we just simply mathematically stacked the kinetic equations. The model is too ideal. However, the model of the whole DEBS 1 is suitable to reality. So it is common of large differences.
(3) According to the related literature, reactions may occur on some linkers between two domains. We predict that we should consider the kinetic mechanism of reactions occurring on linkers. But this time, we have ignored it.

Only the strain transformed with pJEJAM16 targeting GFP to the mitochondria did not result in any transformants and due to time limitation the experiment was not repeated.
The obtained transformants with the different constructed devices integrated into the genome all had a different morphology and were growing slower than the wild type strain. Especially the strain transformed with pJEJAM14 looked sick. The fungi also had a pronounced number of undefined vacuoles that can be seen on the images obtained from differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Such 'symptoms' are not uncommon when DNA is introduced into the genome by NHEJ. Below the images of the microscopy are presented.

Make sure both preparation 1 and 2 are completed at the same time before the measurement.
Preparation 1:
Transfer Ptac Promoter - csgA – SpyTag in cell ΔMG1655 (Experiment Group)
Transfer Ptac Promoter – csgA in cell ΔMG1655 (Control Group)
incubate overnight
Dilute as 1:100 using LB media (both groups)
Incubate for 3 hours till OD≈0.6 (both groups)
Take 1.5ml of OD≈0.6 and add to 96 well plate (both groups)
Add IPTG, final concentration 0.1mM/L (both groups)
Induct in plate at 25℃ for 48h (both groups)
Centrifuge after induction and remove the supernatant (both groups)
Weigh the cells (both groups)
ΔMG1655 is MG1655 wild type with gene csgA knock out from its genome.
Preparation 2:
Transfer Ptac promoter - SpyCatcher – GFP (BBa_K2684004) into cell incubate overnight
Dilute as 1:100 with LB media
Incubate for 3 hours till OD≈0.6
Add IPTG, final concentration 0.1mM/L
Induct at 25 ℃ 220 rpm for 20 hours
Centrifuge and weigh cells
Add 5ml TBS buffer and ultrasonic to create reaction stock
Measurement:
Dilute reaction stock as 1:100 with PBS buffer
Measure florescence of the reaction stock after dilution
Add 1ml reaction stock after dilution to centrifuged cells from preparation 1 (to both group)
React for 1 hour
Centrifuge
Measure florescence of the supernatant
How much florescence the reaction stock lost could indicate how much the palette gains. In that logic, how much sfGFP-SpyCatcher protein the palette gains could be indicated by the difference between the reaction stock after dilution (step2) and the supernatant after reaction (step6).

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html," In the United States, it is expected to reach $15.3 billion by 2016 (BCC Research). Environmental consulting in the United States made $1.2 billion in profit in 2012, and is expected to grow with a compound annual growth rate of 8.7% until 2018. About 40% of this industry is focused on water and soil quality management (IBISWorld Industry Report 54162). Globally, the water and wastewater monitoring market as of 2012 was valued at 8 billion dollars.
In addition to the increased amount of legislation around environmental monitoring, many companies are moving towards adopting a greener image, and with it, more environmentally sound policies and management practices. Alongside a need for continuous monitoring, there is a demand for technology to pulse-spot test tailing ponds alongside sites with increased ecological significance with both regular testing as well as increased frequency tests during a water quality detection event.
As a portable, fast, on-site, and easy to use toxin detector, our technology could be used to meet the need in the market for a fast, pulse-spot testing system. With this technology, results could be obtained with shorter wait-times, on-site so that sample composition changes are minimized, and could be integrated into data management processes already used in industry. This would make our system ideal for environmental sampling in many remote locations, as well as for the analysis of water composition to detect corrosive compounds that could damage oil processing equipment when reusing process water.
Beyond environmental monitoring sites, contaminated water can cause significant issues when recycled back into oil sands processing systems. Oil companies are a robust second customer base, as we could provide fast on-site monitoring for compounds that could corrode and impair machinery. Our system would act as a simple tool that could spot test monitor a given water channel providing valuable simple readout to the operator. This would add a valuable new monitoring system for oil sands plant operators to measure compounds which would potentially lead to a corrosion problem which were previously unable to be monitored on-site.
Target Markets
Our primary target market is water quality monitoring related to the oil and gas industry. This market segment is dominated by government environmental regulation. As such, it will be critical to align with government mandated requirements for monitoring technology as we will discuss in more detail. This regulation has led to a significant market opportunity due to large increases in the already numerous number of government mandated water quality monitoring sites. General toxin sensing of these government regulated sites fits into a market opportunity of approximately $50 million as shown below:

3.     Complete genome sequence of the probiotic lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005;102(11):3906-12
Gene Cloning
To engineer Lactobacillus acidophilus by chromosome integration through homologous recombination, the selection of integration site is very important for successful recombination and not disturbing bacterial internal metabolism.
Based on the method created by Grace L. Douglas and Todd R. Klaenhammer1, the region between slpA gene (LBA0169) stop codon and the terminator was chosen as the intergenic insertion location.  The gene of slpA encodes a surface-layer protein with a strong constitutive promoter activity, which can also drive the expression of the inserted gene.
Fig 1. The schematic diagram of gene integration location (modified from Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011)
Recombination Vector - pLBA169
To make pLBA169, the downstream region of LBA0169 and the upstream region of the terminator were amplified by PCR. Then, the two PCR-amplified DNA fragments were ligated to pSB1C3 by tripartite ligation.
Next, CP29-RBS-aeBlue was cut from Part: BBa_K1033280. And this gel isolated DNA fragment was further inserted between two recombination regions on pSB1C3. This process created the standard EcoRI-XbaI-PART-SpeI-PstI assembly position.
To delete the extra SpeI recognition site within the one of the recombination region, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to change one nucleotide of SpeI recognition sequence. The final product has been confirmed by DNA sequencing.
You can refer to the following flow chart of gene cloning of the recombination vector.
Erythromycin Resistance Gene as a Selection Marker
RBS-EmR-TT/pSB1C3
Erythromycin is a common selection marker for engineering lactic acid bacteria2. And teams Uppsala and TMMU_China were using it to select the engineered Lactobacillus with erythromycin"

So 8F has chemotaxis towards malate. On the other hand, McfR and 5A were not significantly different and quantity of cells of McfR was little less than it of 5A. So McfR shows no chemotaxis towards malate here.
Succinate: The tendencies of curves of 8F and McfR towards succinate are same. As the attractant concentration increased, the number of cells arose and reached the maximum at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and fell sharply with the minimum at attractant concentration of 10-1 M. The quantities of cells of 8F and McfR were almost equivalent and did not have significant difference. But there were significant differences among 8F & 5A, and McfR & 5A: the number of cells of 5A are far less than 8F or McfR (p < 0.05), which demonstrated that 8F and McfR have chemotaxis towards succinate and the capacity of chemotaxis of 8F and McfR towards succinate are almost equal. Compared with chemotaxis towards malate, both of 8F and McfR show stronger chemotaxis towards succinate.
Analysis
The tendency of the chemotaxis towards chemical gradient may be influenced by two factors: pH and phosphorylation state of McpS. The motor of flagella is energized by a H＋ (or Na＋ in some species) gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (Schmitt, 2003) , but the mechanism is not clear. Lisa M. Maurer and Elizabeth Yohannes proved that low pH (at pH 5.0) induced the expression of some flagellar and chemotaxis genes and proton export, while coinducing oxidative stress and heat shock regulons to maintain internal pH homeostasis and to prepare the cell to survive future exposure to more extreme pH conditions (below pH 5 or above pH 9 which is higher or lower than the cytoplasmic pH 7.6) (Maurer, Yohannes, Bondurant, Radmacher, & Slonczewski, 2005) . The pH of attractants showed below (Fig.5) is at the range of pH 1"

MySQL
  We have use MySQL as our relational database management system (RDBMS). The MySQL database has become the world's most popular open source database .Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including Facebook, Google, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent and Zappos rely on MySQL to save time and money powering their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and packaged software. Given these considerations, MySQL has many attractive features to offer:
  
Speed. MySQL is fast. Its developers contend that MySQL is about the fastest database system you can get. You can investigate this claim by visiting http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/benchmarks/, a performance-comparison page on the MySQL Web site.
  
Ease of use. .MySQL is a high-performance but relatively simple database system and is much less complex to set up and administer than larger systems.
  
Query language support. MySQL understands SQL (Structured Query Language), the standard language of choice for all modern database systems.
  
Capability. The MySQL server is multi-threaded, so many clients can connect to it at the same time. Each client can use multiple databases simultaneously. You can access MySQL interactively using several interfaces that let you enter queries and view the results: command-line clients, Web browsers, or GUI clients. In addition, programming interfaces are available for many languages, such as C, Perl, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby. You can also access MySQL using applications that support ODBC and .NET (protocols developed by Microsoft). This gives you the choice of using prepackaged client software or writing your own for custom applications.
  
Connectivity and security. MySQL is fully networked, and databases can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet, so you can share your data with anyone, anywhere. But MySQL has access control so that one person who shouldn’t see another’s data cannot. To provide additional security, MySQL supports encrypted connections using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
  
Portability.MySQL runs on many varieties of Unix and Linux, as well as on other systems such as"
Duke,2017,Team:Duke#HP#Silver#Economics_-_-_TEXT.html," our team is not only cheaper than current options but can also diagnose HIV earlier. As a result, the test designed by our team is not only an effective solution for sub-Saharan Africa but also the United States. Furthermore, the modularity of the test allows for its use to be expanded to identify other viruses including ZIKV. As a result, this testing tool can be considered objectively better than most diagnostic options for a variety of diseases.
However, we do not stop simply at modularity and efficacy. Our project pays special attention to the direct cost of the test such that it can be easily and widely distributed across an entire continent and still function in every environment. What truly separates our device from others is the specific use of thermostable GRFT. The result is a molecule that will not denature until at least 90 degrees Celsius. Typical GRFT denatures at 60 degrees Celsius.
A difference of 30 degrees ammounts to huge quantity of money. Not only does this allow for rapid purification of the protien from others that come out of e. coli, but it also allows for a greater shelf life in the sub saharan climate. Other e. coli protiens also denature at 60 degrees celsius. By being able to denature these protiens, huge sums of money may be saved on the purifcation process. Furthermore, as the highest recorded temeperature on the continent comes in at close to 60 degrees as well, we can say with almost certainty that our RDT can survive every environmental temperature fluctuation. In short, thermostable GRFT is a perfect choice for this intended function

Tongji_Shanghai,2016,Team:Tongji Shanghai#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", we had a visit to NYU-Shanghai. We had a good talk about genetically engineering machine. The old team member, also known as the founder of IGEM in Tongji, shared their project at the year of 2014.
Afterwards, our team introduced the project this year, and have a heated discussion. The third part is NYU-Shanghai introducing their project. We raised important conflict that their work might be repeating one team in 2015, and gave some suggestion for improvements. In the end, we visited the NYU campus in Shanghai, then send farewell to each other. This meeting improves the relation between both teams, and we all gained vital information by collective minds.
Meet-Ups
NCKU Asia Pacific Conference
We took part in the 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 at National Cheng Kung University from 2016/08/08 to 2016/08/14.It’s the first time for Tongji, a young iGEM team to join such an international conference, We get a opportunity to communicate with teams from Asia-pacific region.
We held an impressive presentation and poster exhibition in NCKU with the topic of an optimized targeted breast cancer therapy. Meanwhile, we received plenty of constructive advice from our audience, especially experienced related scholars, which help us to optimize our cancer therapy design.
We truly believed that by this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, we, as well as all the other teams are able to have communications, achieving better results. What’s more, we build a consensus that multidisciplinary cooperation could be better improved by involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competition.

A practice transformation was preformed at the Cohen Lab with Ilaria.
The OD600 was 0.651 which was low, but used in order to speed up the experiment.
The PMKV005 loxKanlox Plasmid (McCusker 2005 Yeast, 21: 163-171) was used into transform wildtype yeast.
The plates used were Kan positive plates created on 6/24.
However it was later found that these plates might not correctly select for drug resistance.
Two plates were made, one with the transformant and one with a control.
The attached procedure was used and annotated during the experiment
2010/07/01
Examined the Sample and Control plates from the practice transformation on June 29th.
Two colonies had grown on the Sample plate and none showed on the control plate.
The low colony number could be due to a low OD600 (0.651) used in the transformation.
Plated the two colonies on a G418 plate in order to conduct the first round of purification
2010/07/02
PRACTICE YEAST TRANSFORMATION:
Colonies grew on the first purification plate for both colony 1 and 2.
Two colonies were plated from both transformed colony 1 and transformed colony 2 onto a second and final purification plate

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.
Discussion Session
After the lecture, we held an discussion session in which we freely talked about multidiscipline studies with our audiance. Biology is full of amazing questions, ones that can be seen from other perspectives, with tools of other subjects. These approaches can often sparkle new ideas and discoveries.
We introduced our own project, and demonstrated how mathematics help us investigate the system of living things. Probablity theory, information theory, ect. all make our project different. They asked us questions about the rationale of our design, showing great interest. One freshmen from Department of Automation later told us that she had never heard of such amazing things before, and that we opend up a whole new door for her.
Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline in a booklet and handed out the booklets to more high school students. Two students e-mailed us to express their interest in synthetic biology and consulted to us about how to be admitted by Tsinghua University.
What deserves to be mentioned is that most participants of our human practice is from College of Information Technology and we had a wonderful communication through the human practice. They asked us many questions and we also got some inspirations from them. What impressed us most is that a student from department of computer told us that the circuit switching and packet switching in computer network when transmitting information. We got a great inspiration from his words after we asked him for details about the two terms. Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching"
