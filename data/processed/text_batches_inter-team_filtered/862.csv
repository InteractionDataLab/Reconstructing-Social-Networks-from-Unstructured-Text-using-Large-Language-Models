Bacteria has urea channel which is regulated positively by protons, opening at acidic pH values to allow more urea in to buffer cytosolic and surface pH, and closing at neutral pH to avoid over-alkalinization [1].
Ammonia (NH3) buffers the cytosol and periplasm, and creates a neutral layer around the bacterial surface[1].With this surface created by bacteria, protects itself against low acid coditions of the stomach.
Figure 1: Helicobacter Pylori Environment.
Autoinducer 2 (AI-2)
Such as many gram-negative and gram positive bacteria has the quorum sensing (QS) molecule, H. Pylori has this molecule too. QS molecules are specific, low-molecular-weight signal molecules which used by bacteria to regulate expression of genes in response to changes in population density.[2]
H. pylori has Quorum Sensing molecule “Autoinducer-2 (AI-2)” which is produced depended on the activity of the LuxS enzyme [3].
Based on the information given above, we expect to find ammonia and Auto-inducer 2 molecules in the existence of H. pylori. Thus we aim to sense both of these molecules to find out if H. Pylori’s presence.
Figure 2:Our “AND GATE” system diagram: According to our system, TnrA transcription factor represses TnrA promoter which produce Toehold. In the presence of NH3 this press will be eliminated and Toehold will be produced. Lsr transcription factor represses pLsr promoter which produce Trigger mRNA. In the presence of AI-2 (Autoinducer-2) this press will be eliminated and Trigger mRNA will be produced. In conclusion Trigger mRNA opens the toehold system and TEV-Protease will be formed.
As a result, our “SENSING” system composed of three parties:
1.NH3 sensitive TnrA promoter
2. AI-2 sensitive Lsr promoter
3. Toehold system
1. NH3 Sensitive TnrA Promoter
Bacteria use nitrogen which is present in nearly all macromolecules such as proteins, carbonhydrates and peptidoglycan. Prokaryotes have developed transport and assimilation systems for a variety of nitrogen sources for living under optimal conditions and regulate their own systems. This regulatory network allows an adequate response to situations of nitrogen"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,"tease was obtained from the Biobrick BBa_K1319004. This variant contains the anti self-cleavage mutation S219V. Using overhang-PCR we created a split version of the Biobrick protease based on work done by Wehr et al, 2016 and the iGEM team Munich 2013 . The split was made between amino acid 118 and 119.
Our construct for attaching proteins N-and C-terminally is highly variable: it consists only of a TEV-cleavage site, the PTS2 sequence and a short linker and was designed as a 3b-part for the yeast-toolbox . This means that we can attach any protein to its N- or C-terminus we desire.  We planned on attaching different fluorescent proteins to each sides of the 3b-part in a level 1 ligation. For our experiment we planned on using the pairs mTurquoise-mVenus and GFP-mRuby.
Figure 9.2 level 1 plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-PTS2-Ruby fusion protein
The two other constructs were planned as follows: Phytochrome B was fused to the C-terminal TEV-half, PIF6 was fused to the N-terminal TEV-half. The PhyB-TEV2 part and the TEV1-PIF6 part were supposed to be inserted into a shared plasmid via a level 2 Golden Gate ligation. Finally, the level 2 plasmid and the remaining level 1 construct were to be co transformed into S. cerevisiae. Our experiment consisted of illuminating one sample with red light (660 nm) while keeping another sample in the dark. Fluorescence microscopy would then be used to check whether the import was successful [3]. If cleavage and subsequent protein import was successful, fluorescence of one protein would be localized to the compartment while that of the other would be observed throughout the cell.
Optogenetically controlled gene expression
This project is based on work done by Weber et al, 2016 . Using the interaction between Phytochrome B and PIF6 they designed an optogenetic switch for enabling and disabling transcription of a chosen gene. It is based on the tetracycline operon and the transcription factor VP16. The tetO operator is located upstream of a minimal promoter which in turn is located upstream of the gene of interest. The tetR repressor binds to the tetO sequence. Fused to it is PIF6. Phytochrome B is fused to the transcription factor VP16. Upon illumination"

The manager show us around and introduce the situation about the production, yield, the development of PET industry and so on. When talking about our project, the manager said that the PETase is one of the best ways of PET degradation. And according to our accomplishment with Training Protein System, the value of modified PETase canbe explored more.
The talking gives us confident about our project. Before we leaving, manager gave us some PET samples (plastic films and bottles) as a present. Finally we use the bottles into our experiment as a connection of the lab and the reality. The result is on the page of demonstrate.

Discussion on environmental protection
We made an appointment and visited the Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau in August. Two solid waste management center staff welcomed us. They introduced how present China dealing with garbage and plastic methods: burning power generation and landfill.
Burning power generation hopes that a large number of plastic can provide carbon source. However, it will produce large amounts of exhaust gas. Landfill will be buried the garbage for 20 years underground, but the soil can no longer be used. It is a waste of land resources.
After understand our main idea about PETase, the staff said, if our biological method is available, land using efficiency will be greatly accelerated. Meanwhile, they argue to the contrary that if the bacteria will affect the land, if farmers use this method to deal with land insulation film, will it cause biological invasion or not. This is the security issue. After discussion, we reached a consensus that it might be no problem. The best situation is the used microbe can be treated with sterilization reagent, and the soil has already have fungi, it will not be affected.
The discussion let us realized that our PETase is vital for environment protection, but its not enough. We should be more in-depth thinking about that.
Sponsorship
In order to have more collaboration with companies, we contact with more than one hundred companies, most of which are biotechnology companies. We introduced the iGEM and our project to them and showed our sponsorship proposal in order to make them interested in our team, sponsor fees and provide experimental materials, technology support. There were quite a few companies directly refusing us which made us very depressed at first. In addition, some experts in companies talked with us very friendly and put forward useful suggestions for us although they did not provide financial support. It's believed that collecting the opinions and suggestions of some officials helped us to improve our project, making it"

1. Final development sharing and discussion
I) Sanghoon Han, Kyeongwoo Jang
- Display system using bacteria
- Further researched about 2011 Washington team's magnetosome toolkit, how to adopt magnetosome formation system into E.coli.
- Searched about 2009 Valencia team's project, Light Cell Display. Refered their modeling.
- Found some reference papers about 2D distribution of bacteria and arrangement of bateria in certain direction using light (not electric field).
- The concern mentioned last meeting was not solved and for that, changed point of view with magnetosome to use it in distribution of bacteria, not to arrange in direction. Also decided to focus on displaying, not to build polaroid using bacteria.
II) Haerim Song, Byeongnam Min
- Partner offer research
- Among 6 questions suggested by OSLI, they gave brief solution about producing hydrogen gas from carbon dioxide.
- Purple non-sulfur bacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris applies protein from fixABCX operon for the nitrogen fixation and when it faces environment with insufficient nitrogen, it produces hydrogen gas instead of producing ammonia gas.
- Same gene exists in E.coli as well, but doesn't work, as known.
- Whether to use this species directly or clone genes and transform them into E.coli would be decided after enough searches done about the species.
III) Jihoon Jung, Jeongmin Lee
- Logic circuit
- Found out that 2011 Peking team already did the idea, but was just simple, AND/OR circuit design.
- Additional  XOR gate design and building full adder circuit to make binary calculator (only processing addition) would be much advanced form compare to previous iGEM team
- Possible molecules for XOR gate : proteinA - Fc region of IgG, (His)6-nickel ion(II), etc"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project#Glucosemodel#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to reduce the burden on the plant cell’s metabolism and attract predators only when needed. This external signal is honeydew, since aphids produce high amounts of this. Honeydew is a very glucose rich substance, which is the reason why ants ‘farm’ aphids, so they can milk their honeydew.
Tet repressor under low glucose promoter
AroG*-LacI construct
pCaiF is a low glucose promoter, so when aphids are present on the plant and thereby honeydew , TetR will not be transcribed. ptetR, a TetR repressible promoter, will be active in this case so that lacI and aroG* will be transcribed. aroG encodes for the enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase, which will convert erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate into 3-deoxy-arabine-heptulosonate-7-phosphate, a precursor of chorismate. We have mutated aroG into aroG* in order to inhibit the negative feedback mechanism of phenylalanine to increase the activity of DAHP synthase so that the chorismate concentration is increased.
MeS construct to convert salicylic acid into MeS
The following construct will convert the chorismate produced into salicylic acid and then into MeS. The original BioBrick from the 2006 MIT team ( Bba_J45700 ) contained a lac promoter in front of the pchBA gene. The pchBA gene encodes two enzymes (isochorismate synthase and isochorismate pyruvate/lyase) that convert chorismate into salicylic acid. Since this would interfere with our system (we use LacI), we replaced this promoter with another tetR promoter.
cpram is a constitutive promoter so the EBF synthase gene will be constitutively transcribed and EBF constitutively produced. However, there is a lac operator present and since LacI is transcribed when honeydew is present (see above), EBF synthase transcription is inhibited in the presence of honeydew.  In the absence of aphids, EBF is constitutively expressed and aphids are thus repelled. However, as mentioned before, EBF could lose its aphid repellent effect due to habituation.
EBF construct
So if certain aphids do happen to escape the EBF repellent signal"

Dr. Guzmán has advised or co-advised the theses of more than 50 DVM, MSc, and Ph.D. students. Research in his lab focuses on three main areas: genetics, behavior and parasitic mites of honey bees, identifying factors that affect honey bee health.
On October 2, we met with Dr. Guzmán on a video conference to speak about our project; he referred to it as something new since to the best of his knowledge, no one has worked with bee’s antimicrobial peptide genes to treat diseases in these arthropods. He mentioned there might be some questions we won’t be able to answer until we get into bee experimentation, but we should consider possible risks such as the addition of external AMPs to the colony atrophying the natural production of AMPs in bees, as well as the possibility of weakening their microbiota.
He emphasized that it is not an easy project to develop as working with American and European  foulbrood  of  honey   bees   is   extremely   complicated  because  of   the
specialized infrastructure, techniques and studies required to work with honey bee brood diseases. It can take months or even years to standardize the protocols needed, so he was curious if we were planning to continue working on this project after the competition.
Regarding American and European foulbrood disease presence in Canada, he stated European foulbrood predominates over American foulbrood in Canada, but in Mexico, American foulbrood is a severe problem.
Finally, we were curious whether there were any regulations regarding experimentation on bees in his country, to which he answered there are none in Canada concerning experimentation on them, yet, he doesn't consider there should be since regulating it would hinder and inhibit research with them. Ultimately, he wished us luck and referred to our project as good and novel.
Beekeeping Societies
We had the great privilege of being able to get closer to complete and organized associations that show how beekeepers gather, collaborate and strengthen beekeeping. Dialogue is fundamental in a society and what a better way to join this dialogue than by discussing in these reunions, listening to the concerns or contributions expressed by the societies and building-up new group insights.

USTC-China,2014,Team:USTC-China#modeling#modeling#gene_-_-_TEXT.html," regulatory mechanism by which the C.c. bacterium integrates cell cycle and nutritional signals to control development of an adhesive envelop structure known as holdfast.
They discovered a novel inhibitor of holdfast development. HfiA, that is regulated downstream of lovK-lovR. They also discovered a bio-synthesis related gene named HfsJ. And the suppressing mutations in HfsJ attenuate the HfsJ-HfiA interaction.
These results support a model in which HfiA inhibits holdfast development via direct interaction with an enzyme required for holdfast biosynthesis
In conclusion, author says: We demonstrate that the predicted glycosyltransferase, HfsJ, is a required component of the holdfast development machinery and that residues at the C-terminus of HsfJ mediate a direct interaction with HfiA, leading to a post-translational inhibition of HfsJ.
The binding affinity and cellular concentrations of HfiA and HfsJ are tuned such that this regulatory system is responsive to small changes rather than robust to large changes. This prediction is consistent with a highly responsive and sensitive regulatory system.
So the block is clear. Upstream promoter Expression Rate $\rightarrow$ HfiA $\rightarrow$ HfsJ $\rightarrow$ Catalyzing Rate

Transform E. coli with construct / synthetic gene.
Test insert length.
(If needed) Silence restrictionsites in gvp cluster by PCR.
Add BioBrick pre/suffix by PCR.
Clone the terminator in to the construct.
Vectors (Sven, Frans (Modelling aswell?)):
Transform E. coli TOP10 with pSB3K3 and E. coli DB3.1 with pSB1AC3.
pSB3K3 contains a p15A ORI and Kan resistance.
pSB1AC3 contains Amp + Cam resistance markers, a ccdB death gene and a pMB1 ORI.
Add different promoters to the vectors:
Inducible are: pBAD-AraC  in pSB2K3 and the Lac promoter  in pSB1A2.
Constitutive are: High expected expression yield,  and Low expected expression yield, Lac promoter with mutated operator . For these promoter sequences are too small, oligo's have to be ordered + BBa pre/suffix !!without RBS!!
Metal sentitive are possibly copA  (order oligo's) and ??
Clone in such a way that they are nicely -10 / -30 in front of the start codon.
Test functionality of the promoters by cloning GFP + RBS + Terminator behind the promoter (BioBrick??).

Project Manager
Have both modellers and labworkers up and running.
Labworkers have choosen the parts and tested those. The bouyancy, metal intake and accumulation should be tested and working seperatly.
Have a start-up model and make sure the labworkers know which parameters the modellers need and can or already have provided these.
Have choosen a tester, a ""testplan"" should have been made, the necessary equipment should be at least ordered.
the tickets and hostel should be booked, so plans for jamboree or thereafter should be known roughly.

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

Environmental and General Public Safety
Improper disposal of biological waste might result in leak of biological materials to the environment,      which might cause contamination, and improper disposal might also cause infection to those who process the wastes.       However, there is little biological risk associated with our project in the first place, as described above because       we are using innocuous bacteria strains that are unlikely to propagate in the environment. Despite being so, we       autoclave all solid biological wastes before they are discarded as landfill garbage.      We also treat liquid waste with 10% bleach to ensure that no biological waste could escape to the environment.       Commonly used chemicals are mostly buffers and therefore pose little threat and risk to the environment.      For chemicals that are hazardous, they could cause damage to other people if leaked out. We avoid these risks by       collecting these chemical wastes and sending them to a centralized chemical waste disposal       center within our university, where they will be processed by professionals in chemical waste treatment.      The only living biological material that could escaped from the lab would be our E. coli host for DNA cloning and"

NCTU_Formosa,2016,Team:NCTU Formosa#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," the fusion protein, we constructed Hv1a-lectin with the original three-alanine linker and a longer GS linker. Besides, there is also a Hv1a without the linker between the repellent peptide and the lectin served as a comparative sample. Figure13 shows the pictures of the remained leaf disks after twelve hours of feeding assays. After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratio, we measured the area with the software imageJ. Figure11 shows the ratio of the remained area on the leaf disks. The higher the bar is, the larger the remained leaves area is. The observed phenomenon can be analyzed below.
We purified Pantide into three quantitative concentration with 0.4μM, 2μM, and 10 μM. The remained leaves area decreased as the concentration of PANTIDE decreased, which shows the dose response of Pantide.
In comparison with the two other design, we could find out that the remained leaves area with improved Hv1a-lectin were all more than that of the original Hv1a-lectin and Hv1a. The result shows that by enhancing the length of the linker, the fusion protein works performs its toxicity better.
Preference Test
In the two-hour test, we can see that most of the tobacco cutworms move to eat the negative control group, which proves the repellent effect of Pantide.
Conclusion
After the three experiments, we have three conclusions.
Pantide performs its toxicity as a repellent in vivo. It is a noticeable finding that goes beyond our original hypothesis. The mechanism of the repellent effect is so far unknown.
The toxicity efficacy of Pantide is equal to Bacillus thuringiensis.
With the elongation of the linker, the improved fusion protein has the best repellent effect.
The tobacco cutworms have a preference on the leave disks without applying Pantide.
Although Pantide does not act as a biological pesticide as our hypothesis had mentioned, we may conclude that it is a biological insect repellent, which corresponds to our ideology of lowering the artificial impacts on the environment and simultaneously achieve effective pest control.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," support one of the Clubes given at our campus which was “El mundo real de la biotecnología”.
This Club taught students the key concepts in molecular biology and practical lab activities to use living organisms, such as bacteria, to modify a product or process for a specific user. The activities given in the Club were microbiology, prokaryotic cellular cultures, bacterial transformation, DNA purification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and electrophoresis techniques.
We had the opportunity to help researchers and staff of the Club by preparing everything the students were going to need to make the scheduled activities mentioned above. We gave them material that, for lack of time, didn't arrive on time such as Petri dishes, culture media, competent cells, and GFP and RFP vectors. After their theoretical explanation, sometimes students took a look at how the team prepared everything for their activities.
On the last day, there was space scheduled in the closure called “Programs for an approach to science in Mexico”. Throughout the week we related with some of the instructors participating in these Clubs with whom we shared experiences about our projects. They showed interest for iGEM Tec Chihuahua 2018 and were amazed by the social impact the product would have for beekeepers, that's why we were invited to talk to students in the closure of the Club “Material Science: it looks like magic, but is real”. We presented who we were, what we were working on, and how synthetic biology has led us to our final project proposal. For us, this was a great opportunity because we wanted to wake up youth´s curiosity by introducing them to the synthetic biology field and also encourage them to participate in programs that offer an approach to science in Mexico.
XXVI International Apicola Update Congress 2019
After 25 years of development, the International Apicola Update Congress will be held for the first time in a northern entity of the country. In 2019, Chihuahua, our state, will host this important event thanks to its great contribution to the national honey production with great quality products.
The congress is organized and carried out annually by the National Association of Veterinary Doctors Specialists in Bees, A.C. (ANMVEA, A.C.). It is really important for beekeepers because here they have every tool they need at the back of their hands to solve beehives issues. Here, they have international beekeeping researchers whom they can ask every question they might have.
For our team, keeping in touch with experts is essential for the diffusion of synthetic biology and for receiving feedback of the project, that"

MODELING:
We  read chapter 2 of Predictive Microbiology by T.A. McMeekin et al., 1993. It  taught us the standard stages of a modeling process, the purpose of  mathematical models.
The  suggested stages of the modeling process are:
- Planning
- Data  collection and analysis
- Mathematical  description
- Validation  and maintenance (Including Function Fitting, Model Validation and Model  comparisons)
Remarkably  this chapter also mentioned the changes of the conductivity of the medium  depending on the cellular metabolism, therefore pointing out the importance of  having a cellular population which isn’t growing; this to prevent the noise and  minimize the conductance change due to bacterial metabolism.

Our proposed system (modified from Iwig et al. (2006)):
RcnR, LuxR and aiiA synthesis  rates will be assumed as constitutive and already on stationary state. Nickel entry to the cell will only be mediated via Unk (Unknown) (NikABCDE is only active during anaerobic phase and our experiment will be held in  aerobic conditions) and is also constitutive as long as extracellular nickel  isn’t rate-limiting.
We also defined the variables  and equations for our first approach and built our stoichiometric matrix. This "

Standardization of MoDeL
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. Knowing the importance, USTC_Software puts a lot of effort on the standardization of MoDeL. We have requested BBF RFC55 for MoDeL, and constructed a beta version of XML schema to describe the XML structure of MoDeL.
BBF RFC55
BBF RFC55: Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) mainly describes the detailed language specifications of MoDeL with concrete examples, which provides enough information for serious database constructors to build up a database on his own. As a highlight of MoDeL, the concept and the syntax of Chain-Node Model are described in detail. The content of document is currently arranged as follows:
Figure 1: Draft document of RFC55 - Table of Contents
The document of RFC55 has already been submitted. You can find it on the webpage of The BioBricks Foundation:RFC . Following are some more previews at the draft document.
Figure 2: Preview at draft document of RFC55
Figure 3: Preview at draft document of RFC55
XML Schema
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. Being written in XML fashion, a Schema is perfect for MoDeL to allow software to perform check on syntax. Following is the preview of the beta version of XML Schema for MoDeL. The Schema can be downloaded at iGaME project page on SourceForge.

Nevertheless, these metabolites were not analysed because of natural isotope distributions, coelutions or too low concentrations.
Experimental Setup
Four 200 ml reactors for cultivation in the 13C experiment.
Achievements
We proved at methanol is not assimilated into the central metabolism of E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) when the bacteria carries the polycistronic plasmid of the four missing enzymes to complete the MCC.
Despite no detectable production of 13C carbondioxide in the offgas we showed significant Mdh activity with samples from the respective reactor (see Mdh Characterization )
Expected Results
3 different sugars were analyzed: fructose-bis-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate.
Expected mass shift if 13C,d4 is assimilated: methanol - m+5, formaldehyde - m+3
all other sugars in the subsequent pathway should have a shift of m+3 in the first cycle of the functional MCC.
Expected mass shift if 13C is assimilated: methanol - m+1, formaldehyde - m+1
all other sugars in the subsequent pathway should have a shift of m+1 in the first cycle of the functional MCC.
Results
In no sample of the polycistronic clones was a mass shift of m+3 observable. The detected peak areas are similar to the analytic standard samples of 12C carbohydrates. The mass shifts m+1 & m+2 are as frequent as it is usual in the natural composition.
Plot of natural FBP, G6P & R5P as control
This figure shows the natural mass shift composition of the measured metabolites.
The measured data and average values of reactor 5 with #AW9K# and 0.75 M methanol do not differ from this mass composition.
The same is valid for reactor 6 with (#AW9K#) our polycistronic construct with 0.3 M methanol.
Our Mdh strain (#IGEM#) in reactor 7 does not differ at all.
Conclusion & Discussion
It was not possible to show a completely working  ""Methanol Condensation Cycle"" [5] (MCC) in E. coli.
Although no labeled cytosolic metabolites could be detected we proved qualitatively the functionality of the Mdh."

Survey
Our team understands that a survey with such a small sample size is not the most reliable of methods to gain information. However, we still decided to conduct a survey in order to gain a general public opinion on various aspects of our project. Applying synthetic biology components to open wounds can be a very sensitive subject that needs to be carefully evaluated. In addition to considering the ethics of our project, we also wanted to examine how exactly people in our community would respond to our proposed blood clotting agent.  Mainly we wanted to gain an opinion on possible application methods for our product. We created paper copies of the survey, that we handed out to respondents in the city as well as a digital copy that we shared on social media in the hope of collecting a more diverse sample. In total, 40 individuals respondent to our survey. From the survey, we gathered that a bandage form is the most popular form for applying our product. This informed our final decision on the application of our product. We also learned that people have heard of snake venom being used for clotting blood, and are somewhat comfortable with using components of snake venom to heal a wound. People would also consider using synthetic biology as a clotting method. Overall we conducted this survey out of curiosity to learn what others would think of our product.
School Presentations
We believe an important aspect of iGEM is to spark interest in synthetic biology and iGEM in other students. This year, we decided to present to Grade 11 classes in several High Schools in Lethbridge about our project and the iGEM competition in general. As part of the Grade 11 curriculum, students learn about the components of blood and the blood clotting pathway. Our project and presentation therefore integrated very well into the their curriculum. Through our presentation, we raised students’ awareness for the application and significance of some of the concepts they learned in school and made them more interested to become involved with iGEM in"

Overview
Since the concern of Lab accident or biological contamination has been increased year by year, we attached special importance to the safety issue of our project. Here we present our efforts on safety assurance in 4 different ways, which are Lab Safety, Public Safety, Project Safety, and Suggestion on Safety.
Information
Risk Group: Group 1 (low risk)
Laboratory Safety Level: Level 2 (moderate safety procedures)
Lab Safety
No immediate risk can be found on the researchers’ safety in our project, as we formulated several regulations concerning safety management. The regulations includes researcher’s signing in rules, instrument specifications, and, of course, the basic Lab behavior specifications.
We require every researcher to sign in and out with their name and time on a notebook, thus making research progress known by the whole team.

This final product that is produced would then be able to be discharged into the environment.
Lastly, the plant focuses on the environment in the procedures they carry out, as wastes such as methane that is produced from the plant will be transported to co-generation motors where it will then provide heat and electricity for the plant. This ensures that the Wastewater Treatment Plant’s energy costs are low.  This inspired us to turn our attention to the potential impacts our project could have on the environment -- how our project could be used to improve the efficiency of metal removal from wastewater, and how this could impact the dependent ecosystem as a result.
INTERVIEWS
Dorothy Lok
We interviewed Dorothy Lok, who is a Municipal Approvals Engineer at Alberta Environment and Parks to explore the possibility of implementing our system into the Lethbridge Wastewater Treatment plant. Upon interviewing her, we learned that though our system is innovative, it would be unnecessary to implement it into the Lethbridge Wastewater Treatment plant as there is not a high concentration of metal ions in the wastewater. She also mentioned that the wastewater treatment plant already uses the metal-laden sludge produced as fertilizers for various crops. However, Dorothy Lok did propose that we should look into applying our system in other wastewater treatment plants of specific cities such as Flint, Michigan or industrial wastewater treatments plants, as these facilities contain a higher concentration of metal ions. In addition, she also suggested that the issue of mining and oil tailings ponds is a problem we could potentially tackle as tailings ponds contain a high concentration of metal ions that are detrimental to the environment. This would be more efficient for our system as the concentration of metal ions would be higher and therefore there would be more metal ions to remove. In terms of our system, Ms Lok told us, “You would really have to have a purpose for doing it [implementing our system in the wastewater treatment process]… whereas with tailings ponds, they need to be dealt with.” As a result of her advice, we pivoted our project goal to focus on the removal of metal ions from mining and oil tailings ponds rather than wastewater treatments plants. The successful implementation of our project could benefit communities locally and globally!

As mentioned, the environmental concern that tailings ponds cause is a crucial issue that many places around the world face, specifically Alberta. While our provincial economy relies heavily on the oil and gas industry, and we are very fortunate"

Le Projet ""DVS""
Dans le cadre de la compétition iGEM , nous avons choisi de développer un projet sur le thème de la santé. A l’heure actuelle, bien que les produits thérapeutiques soient de plus en plus efficaces, ils deviennent également de plus en plus fragiles.
Dans cette optique, nous avons décidé de développer un procédé permettant la protection de principe actif biologique, principalement de type nucléotidique. Ce type de procédé existe déjà, c’est ce que l’on nomme un vecteur . Il peut être de nature biologique, tels les virus, ou chimique telles les nanoparticules polymériques. Mais de quelques natures qu’ils soient, les vecteurs rencontrent de nombreux problèmes : stabilité, ciblage, passage de membrane, mais également réaction immunitaire.
C'est pourquoi, nous avons tenté de réaliser le vecteur idéal, étant le plus stable possible, le mieux ciblé, pouvant pénétrer aisément sa cible et surtout pouvant se déjouer du système immunitaire. Nous avons donc créé un ""système de double vectorisation"" (DVS) utilisant conjointement une bactérie et un phage. Le premier vecteur , de type bactérien, sert au ciblage tissulaire et à la résistance au système immunitaire, quant au second vecteur , de type phagique, il sert au ciblage cellulaire et à la pénétration des membranes. La combinaison des deux systèmes offre une amélioration des capacités intrinsèques aux vecteurs, mais offre également de nouvelles possibilités d'applications.
Au vu des problématiques de santé publique dans le monde, il nous a semblé intéressant d'appliquer notre concept au cancer du poumon, ce qui ouvre une toute nouvelle stratégie thérapeutique en matière de lutte contre cette physiopathologie.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#HP Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"5/12- Meeting with Paul from Mars Advanced Research division. During this meeting we discussed the problem that would define our project: companies want to make the change to all natural dyes due to legitimate health risks associated with coal-tar dyes and vocal consumer concern. However, these companies do not have exact replacements for colors. Paul opened up a bag of M&M’s and poured them on the table. He lined them up: brown first, then red, then orange, then yellow, then green, and blue at the end. He explained that brown was the easiest to replicate with naturally occurring means, and that red has replacements that, while somewhat unsavory, were not devastating. However, they had yet to find a blue dye in nature that was quite what they were looking for. Recently approved Spirulina extract was not entirely off the table, but the color was too light. We asked about industry processes for coating the foods, and learned that the candy coating was around pH 2. We took this challenge into account as we looked into the kinds of bacteria that might produce blue, with a preference for those that may have proteins that would not denature with that level of acidity, and focused on extremeophiles.
5/13- First skype meeting with UCSC team! One of the UCSC students had grown up in Davis and spent some time in the lab with our teammate Jon Chen, so we set up a preliminary meeting to talk about collaboration possibilities and resolved to speak again at the UC Bioengineering Conference.
5/19- Choose to accept Monsanto Sponsorship. After some discussion, our group determined that a mindful approach was the right way to engage with Monsanto. We did not condone the entirety of their corporate practices, but kowtowing to blind assumptions that any involvement was somehow poisonous seemed incorrect as well. Instead, we would engage with the lunch group of hard scientists working in the genotyping and phenotyping projects to talk about what science and society could do to make progress.
6/13- iGEM Meetup at UC Bioengineering Symposium (UCSC HP collaboration initiated). We woke up at 5:30 am and (following a brief coffee stop) met up with other UC iGEM teams to present our project idea and consider collaboration.

Human Practices
To ensure that our project would stay on track to tackle real-life problems,    we continuously sought input from people working ‘in the field’. This included    professionals with backgrounds such as synthetic biology, computer sciences,    education, academia and industry. By presenting our project at several events    and always engaging in discussions, we received a lot of opinions and feedback    and worked to evolve our project according to this interdisciplinary spirit.
Rapid Prototyping Workshop, EPFL
A first step in this direction was taken when one team member went to the    Rapid Prototyping Workshop : “Teaching how to develop creative and practical    solutions to real-life, complex, scientific and engineering problems” on June    8th 2017 to represent EPFL iGEM and gain valuable insights on problem solving,    how to approach problems in general and as well as feedback on organizing the    Wiki space and our web page. The workshop consisted of small groups having to    solve individual problems by making use of a given ‘toolbox’. The problems    included making prototypes for a project webpage, improvising an informative    video describing a project, organizing the lab/office space optimally, how to    improve the team performance and identifying the composition of an ideal curriculum    for future (bio-)engineers. We later on implemented a lot of the feedback    (for instance in teamwork) and believe it helped us for getting more efficient    at organizing ourselves and meeting deadlines.

Laura Hoover
Entering her junior year, Laura is a Biology major focusing in vertebrate physiology. As a trained EMT, Laura plans to pursue a career in the medical field. However, her academic interests vary greatly. After learning about synthetic biology in a molecular biology course, Laura joined the Penn State iGEM team eager to learn more about the emerging field. Beyond being able to participate in undergraduate research, the experience offered her an in depth education in the planning and execution of research projects. Laura worked on both the CesA and promoter projects. In addition, Laura is heavily involved in Penn State’s IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon as her sorority’s THON chair for the past two years.
Michael Easterbrook
Michael is a Penn State junior, studying Chemical Engineering with intended minors in Entrepreneurship and Molecular Biology.  He has had a passion to work with genetic engineering since high school and he has been involved in genetics research since his freshman year of college.  iGEM was an exciting next step for developing his skills in synthetic biology research.  He was heavily involved with the design and construction of the cellulose synthase, cas9, and plant promoter projects.  He also learned html/CSS this summer and was responsible for a majority of the coding for the team wiki.  In his free time, he enjoys discussing philosophy, playing soccer, playing video games, and visiting family and friends.
Michael Stokes
Michael is a Penn State Senior in the field of Biotechnology.  He has had a longstanding fascination with synthetic biology and biofuels, and other biotech applications such as organ cloning.  His plans for the future to include research in biotechnology to develop these things for use in everyday life.  He joined iGEM in order to gain experience working with biotechnology.  At the start he primarily worked on the butanol project, though he became more involved in website design later on, learning html/CSS programming language, and using his previous experience with Photoshop and attention to detail to help in its construction.
Nayab Gill
Nayab recently graduated with her bachelors in Biology from Penn State. With the goal of becoming a high school Biology teacher, her next step is to pursue a masters degree in Science education. Since her undergraduate studies focused on vertebrae physiology; iGEM served as a crash course in plant and synthetic biology. Although difficult at first, it has proven to be a rewarding experience for her."

V Original parameter set of the model
VI Results of model
1. Results under original parameter sets:
    As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the response of the warrior. Therefore, from this original parameter set and result, we can see that there is no distinguish between the response of warrior I without with warrior II, so orthogonality is not good. In the real situation, this means that the warrior I has high amount of LacI even without warrior II and thus almost no CmR. Therefore, it has no resistance to chloramphenicol and will be killed by itself.
    However, how could this happen? Intuitively, we may hypothesize that TetR actually not inhibit the expression successfully when its expression is activated by C4HSL-RhlR. So we may solve this problem by increasing the maximal expression rate of TetR. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS afterPrhlof TetR in warrior I.
2. Increasing the maximal expression rate of TetR in warrior I
    From the results of the model, we are delighted to see that warrior I just respond when there is warrior II.(Fig.4) Therefore, the orthogonality of gene circuit is satisfied!
    However, if the level of TetR is too high, we will see thatwarrior I cannot respond with or without warrior II.(Fig.5)
    In conclusion, the core is that we can make the gene circuit orthogonal by regulating the TetR level to a moderate level. This can be easily achieved by change the RBS after Prhl of TetR in warrior I.
    According to the results obtained from our model, it is clear what we should do in the experiment to achieve the goal.

Simulation Results
Figure 8. Simulation of the IPTG-lac repressor system.
We infer that the situation of TALE will be similar with IPTG. When TALE protein binds on the plasmid, the expression of lacI will be repressed. Consequently, the concentration of RFP will be increased. If no TALE proteins  are expressed, the concentration of RFP will be very low.
Figure 9. Situations that TALE successfully express and not express.
From the simulation, we can conclude that RFP can be a signal of whether our TALE has successfully expressed, moreover, the concentration of RFP, which shows as the fluorescence intensity, has positive correlation with the quantity of TALE protein.

We will calculate θ1 first, which only involves the points, circles and lines p, CA1, A1, and P1.
Find the plane where CA1 's circle resides in. Use it to cut the sphere around P1. For future reference, call CA1 's circle C1 and the circle resulting from the cut C2
Define xo1, for x offset, for the difference in the x coordinates of the center of C1 and the point P1.
xo1 = TR - BR - x
Define D1 to be the distance between the center of C1 and C2. It will also be the line connecting the centers.
D1 = sqrt(x12 + z2)
Obviously, D1, CA1, and linkage form a triangle. The angle between CA1 and D1 is a close approximation to θ1, but it is not exact. We will find the error in the next step. We will call this angle θ11. We use the law of cosines to calculate θ11.
L2 = CA2 + D12 - CA * D * cos(θ11)
θ11 = cos-1((D12 + CA2 - L2)/(2*D1*CA))
One endpoint of D1 is on A1. Thus, we can make another triangle, and the angle between D1 and A1 is the difference between θ1 and θ11. We will call this angle θ12. If we have the length of the side on A1 be z, then the last side will be xo and the triangle will be a right angle triangle. Since only xo1 changes sign in the good interval, we should use a trigonometric function that involves xo in the numerator. Thus,
θ12 = sin-1(xo1/D1)
θ1 = cos-1((D12 + CA2 - L2)/(2*D1*CA)) - sin-1(xo1/D1)
You just have to rotate the model φ1 degrees counterclockwise for θ2, and another φ2 degrees for θ3 using the following three dimensional rotational matrixes:
Once you rotate the model, use steps 3-7 to get the next angles.
θ2 = cos-1((D22 + CA2 - L2)/(2*D2*CA)) - sin-1(xo2/D2)

Face to face interaction with doctors and patients at Peking University First Hospital
We paid a visit to Peking University First Hospital in Beijing and discussed with the doctors and patients.
“Diabetes Mellitus has become the main concern of public health in China in the past 30 years, especially the type II Diabetes Mellitus.”said by Doctor Wang of the Endocrinology Department. There are various causes for the increasingly high morbidity: high-fat diet, reduction in physical output, high pressure and environmental pollution. However, Dr. Wang holds a positive attitude towards the treatment for this common disease and highly supports the development of potential gene therapy, which may bring evolutionary changes.
In the hospital, there are posters for regularly held lectures about diabetes, which help to build a community between patients and specialists. Also, there are free devices like self-service rapid glucometer that make it convenient for the patients to monitor their condition.

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," biological sensors is that they can analyze samples through processes that require many enzymes, something that is not as easy when using other systems (Yagi, 2007).
Modern bacterial biosensors produce a substance, generally a protein, which is considered the “output” that results from the detection of the substance of interest. The amount of reporter protein is taken as a proxy for the cellular response to the target. Reporter proteins are preferably easy to detect, quantify and not present in the native organism (van der Meer & Belkin, 2010). Today, whole-cell biosensors exist for a wide variety of target substances, ranging from potentially dangerous compounds and contaminants to many types of carbohydrates and heavy metals. However, there have been few mentions of biosensors that not only detect the presence of a substance but that are also able to distinguish different concentrations of the target compound and react differentially depending on the amount detected. One reason for this is that the amount of genetic engineering required to achieve such a goal is considerable, and for many purposes it is not practical. However, Synthetic Biology may offer a reasonable alternative by providing a standard genetic frame to achieve a biosensor capable of reacting differentially to various concentrations of a substance of interest.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description-backup_-_-_TEXT.html," MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD] biofilm growth assay
Figure 15 shows the effect of inducing the expression of BBa_K729004 [pBAD] on the ability of the host to form biofilms. The control (MG1655, pBAD/HisB, 0.2% ara) and MG1655, BBa_K729004[pBAD], 0% ara are both able to grow biofilms, as shown by the intensity of the crystal violet staining. When BBa_K729004[pBAD] is expressed, the intensity of the crystal violet staining is reduced, showing a diminished ability to grow biofilm. This data suggests that the secretion of DNase is able to inhibit biofilm formation.
Conclusion
Through our experimental work, we have successfully created and submitted 12 sequence-confirmed BioBrick parts, 7 of which we rigorously characterized for antibacterial and/or antibiofilm function. We validated that Art-175 and Microcin S are both potent antibacterials, the former of which is shown to be even capable of killing antibiotic-resistant biofilm-encased bacteria. On the antibiofilm side of things, we not only showed that the enzymes of interest, DNase and DspB, were successfully exported across both membrane layers of E. coli following our modification of them with secretion tags, but also proved that the enzymes are able to refold properly post-secretion such that they retain their enzymatic function.
In conclusion, we achieved our aim of creating bacterial ""living therapeutics"" - strains of bacteria genetically engineered to secrete functional antibiofilm and antimicrobial proteins towards the treatment of UTIs.
Future
Our modelling of diffusion out of the AlgiBeads showed that we would need too great a number of AlgiBeads for this to be realistic design approach. To overcome this problem we would need unrealistically efficient enzymes or unrealistically high protein synthesis rates. The other way around this is to create a system that provides a high local concentration of antibiofilm/antimicrobial agents at the point that is needed.
To develop our project beyond a proof-of-concept design, we would adopt a more suitable chassis, such as Lactococcus lactis. L. lactis has been widely used as a host for the production of proteins to target Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Using E. coli as our host was purely a starting point. We predict that moving to L. lactis to secrete our antibiofilm/antibacterial agents will overcome the problem of induced host cell lysis.

Methods & Materials
What’s the specialty of our cyanobacteria?
Invasin(protein names: P11922  INVA_YERPS) is a  protein that allows enteric bacteria to penetrate cultured mammalian cells. Listeriolysin  O (LLO) facilitates bacterial escape from the internalization vesicle into the  cytoplasm, where bacteria divide and undergo cell-to-cell spreading via  actin-based motility[2]. And Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 was the first  cyanobacterial strain which could be transformed by exogenously added DNA. When  engineered with invasin(inv) from Yersiniapestis and  listeriolysin O(llo) from Listeria monocytogenes (both  provided by Pamela A. Silver, Harvard Medical school[3]), new S. elongatus was  able to invade cultured mammalian cells and was capable of symbiosis with  eukaryotic cells.
Additionally,  invasin(inv) from Yersiniapestis and  listeriolysin O(llo) from Listeria monocytogenes have been studied by 2010 Warsaw igem team. Our further study and novel  observation relative to their research were posted not only on our wiki, but  also on the partregistry website(BBa_K299810, BBa_K299811,BBa_K299812)
What’s the platform of coculturing?
Three types  of mammalian cells were chosen—two stages of induced pluripotent stem cells  from mice and J774 mouse macrophage cell line. Here are the protocols of  cell culturing (two stages of mice induced  pluripotent stem cells: iPS cells separated from embryonic  fibroblasts (MEFs) click here, embryoid body (EB) stage of iPS cells click  here, J774 mouse macrophage cell line click  here)
Cells were seeded on the 24-well plate. After 80% full in each well,  PCC7942(wt/inv-llo transform) suspensions in  PBS were set to the same OD and 50 µl of this suspension were added per 1 ml of  Leib"

The Public and Peanut Allergy
Alongside our main project, to build a portable peanut detector, LiU iGEM has conducted several                     projects to make the everyday life more secure for those in fear of getting dangerous allergic                     reactions from their food.
We were fortunate to have insightful discussions with participants in our side projects. One of them                     suffered from multiple food allergies, with peanuts causing the most problems, and stated the                     following about the public awareness of food allergies.
“Lack of knowledge is the biggest problem and the ignorance stems from this lack of knowledge. How                     will you know of you don’t understand the consequences? How will you be able to respect it?”
Becka                     Lexén, 22, student.
It goes without saying that LiU iGEM wants to reach out to the public and raise awareness of food                     allergies, especially peanut allergy. We have thoroughly researched and emotionally explored the                     world of food allergies. Our goal is to communicate what we have learnt, and to do so in several                     different ways to cover as much ground as possible.
Get the word out - Synthetic biology
Apart from spreading information about peanut allergy, we also want to inform the public in how we                     by using synthetic biology can deal with real life problems. We have made a particular effort in                     getting in touch with the youth in our area to convey the possibilities of synthetic biology. By                     holding lectures for students in secondary school, high school and university we are hoping to spark                     their interest.

By this processing, we could easily tell which biowave system is actually preforming a synchronized oscillation. If the histogram shows a concentrating distribution, then we could say the system has make the oscillation synchronized; if the distribution disperse, we could tell that the oscillation of each cell is independent, there is no communication between cells.
Application
Since every cell has its own oscillation, tumor cells must be no exception. However, the spectra of different cells distributes distinctively. We are concerned with the utilization of this oscillator in cancer therapy. Taking energy transformation into consideration, we believe that the formation of the oscillator can initiate changes that should not be ignored to the surroundings. We are curious about it, whether the parameter of the oscillator can be adjusted to a certain number, under which the Escherichia coli or other attenuated strains can inhibit the growth of tumor cells without doing harm to normal cells.
The oscillator can be used as a tool for the exploration of the evolution of Optogenetics.  We propose to culture the E. coli strain with the transformed oscillator respectively on each of the three culture media: full nutrition, basic nutrition and lack of different nutrients. By comparing the ratio of plasmid loss and other indices of strain under natural evolution and strains under stressful evolution, we might have chances to find out the reasons that cells seldom use light, which has many advantages over chemicals in our view, as a signal.

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

Additionally, we propose in this report two tools that might contribute to avoid misunderstandings and to make a simplified decision process available for       a wide audience. In order to accomplish the former objective, we have prepared the two common-languages short dictionaries listed in Annex II. To achieve       the latter, we propose, for the first time for the best of our knowledge, a math-based equation that could contribute to make IP issues available to a wide       audience (for a complete description see Annex I). We have prepared the equation in two steps. First, we combined the patentability requirements (novelty, inventive step, industrial       application) in a mathematically logical way to reach our draft equation (F0). Then, we submitted the formula to several experts to have their feedback, and thus       modify F0 accordingly to yield F1 (this reflexive process, combining design with improvement rounds, elegantly evokes a biotechnology strategy called directed evolution).
Figure 2. Human decisions are only acceptable if no help is used? Left, chess player. Right, graphic representation of the equation F0 we initially proposed for patentability determination, as a function of the Industrial Application (I) and the Inventive step (A). See Annex II for details.
The very idea of using maths to decide whether something is patentable may seem odd. The opinion of the law experts was useful; but we wanted to have a       broader feedback from other social actors. We thus carried out a survey to probe the opinion of iGEMers, scientists/engineers and law students, but also of       general population to compare their view on our proposal. The C section of Annex II describes the results of this survey that can be summarize as follows: the       vast majority of the 526 respondents (70 to around 80%) found that a math-based approach could be a useful tool, but should not substitute humans as the final decision makers. We       could not agree more on that.

Since we using a new chassis, the cloning method is significantly different from other teams, as well as the experimental conditions. Therefore, we discussed a lot during the cooperation in transformation methods and the successful Transformant confirmation. We learnt so much from each other and were so happy to cooperate with each other.
Based on our model, we formulated a criterion to the promoter library. As we got the statistics from, we found the data was variable in different order of magnitude because of diverse  experimental methods or condition. Having obtained natural logarithms and normalize these data, finally, as show below:
From the heatmap, we can see the result of JNFLS is very similar with us. Only one promoter has significant difference. About other teams, we still found great difference, but the relative strength between promoters is not much discrepancy. These data can be an serve as a reference for us.
After all , we thank them for their enthusiastic help again!
SDU-CHINA
SDU-CHINA and us come from the same university, so it’s pretty convenient for us to communicate with each other. Because we were both freshmen to iGEM, we helped each other with all kinds of issues during the iGEM season,from project design to experiment support and competition issues. From the beginning, the projects were polished by two teams together through holding some seminars. What’s more, we did the interLab experiment together, experimental materials and equipment were shared together, besides, we analysed the data and discussed the consequence we got together.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM philosophy. We believe that education is key to generate new hypotheses and experiment with the creation of new concepts in synthetic biology. Ethics, a topic of great importance within the field of synthetic biology, was discussed to address concerns about ‘playing God’ with nature, and the potential risk of GMOs.
 
Safety was our third focus, as we believe young scientists should be responsible with the workflow of their project and its output. We believe it is crucial to ensure the safety of the environment and personal health. Many of the techniques used in the laboratory and the handling of a variety of organisms have the potential to be dangerous. Therefore, risk assessment of planned projects is essential, see the Safety section . Safety was also one of the elements in our outreach work with the high school students. We examined the potential consequences of the work, and encouraged the students to raise concerns about laboratory work, project design and the implementation of innovative ideas into real life. This is elaborated upon in detail in  Ethic implications on society .
Ethical implications on society
Introduction
During outreaching activities such as the BioBusiness Summer School 2015, important questions were raised about the ethics in relation to field of biotechnology. This sparked an inspiration in our iGEM team to raise the questions ourselves and analyze our project and educational elements in a bigger perspective. According to guidelines from the “European Commission, research proposals towards the Horizon 2020 funding” we contacted a local expert for guidance. A session was established with Bioethics specialist Martin Mose Bentzen from the Technical University of Denmark, to have a talk about ethical concerns of relevance in relation to our project. He highlighted numerous important aspects to consider and the team left the session with a clear direction to make an ethic self-assessment. From these considerations, our team identified the following aspects to be essential in the assessment of how our project may affect society:
 
Bioethics
Environmental ethics
Ethical dilemmas in teaching of high schoolers
 
What have we created!?
The Synthesizer-project has many delicate elements, which could be analyzed for bioethical concerns. Our final product is a tool that allows any individual to design a synthesis of a desired product and help fellow scientists all around the world. With this in mind and the method being accessible for everyone, many crucial questions should be addressed - how do we as the creators make sure, our tool is not being used with a bad purpose? What would happen if the tool would be used to make disastrous findings? As inventors, are we directly related to someone's bad intentions or are"

When the first population is re-injected into the coalescence chip with higher channel height compared to the channel height they were initially produced in, the droplets acquire spherical shape. The second population of droplets are produced in the coalescence chip. These droplets acquire a flat circle shape in the channels.
Scheme with a channel, wherein on droplet is flat circle shape (second population) and another is spherical shape (first population)
The interfacial tension of droplets produced with nonionic type of surfactant follows the nonlinear adsorption [4]:
(5)
Microfluidic droplet coalescence is based on application of alternating electric voltage. The value of interfacial tension created by surfactant adsorption is further modified by electrical field effect on a contact angle. This influences the interfacial tension γ for both produced and re-injected droplets.
The interfacial tension of the three-phase interface follows the Young-Laplace equation:
(6)
We also know the electric field impacts the contact angle θ:
(7)
The initial contact angle θ0 (before applying the electric field) is expressed from Young- Laplace equation (6) and inserted into the relation for electrowetting :
(8)
The applied electric field does not impact the interfacial tension between solid ( PDMS ) and oil γSO or solid and water γSw. We introduce the effective interfacial tension γ(eff) which will account the effect of electrowetting \(\gamma_{WO}^{(eff)}=(\gamma_{SO} - \gamma_{SW})/\cos \theta\). This relation is inserted into equation (8) to give a result:
(9)
In the last equation we find a dimensionless factor called the electrocapillary number ECN, showing the ratio of electric to capillary forces:
(10)
In our experiments we have ECN<<1, that shows the capillary forces have the highest impact in our system. Finally the interfacial tension is expressed in a following way:
(11)
Using the arguments from the electrowetting, the term for capillary pressure in equation (1) will be changed accordingly. The capillary pressure of two droplets is written as a sum of two pressure components coming from the different interfacial tension:
(12)
3. Energy supplied by electric voltage
The electric field energy is created by applying the voltage to the electrodes. To define the electric response of droplet coalescence system, we used the concepts of electrokinetic model described by Tan et al. This"

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,", left unchecked, may lower economic efficiency and threaten public welfare. …By contrast, intellectual property rights actually create a monopoly.  The monopoly power generates monopoly rents (excess profits), and it is these profits that are supposed to provide the incentive for engaging in research.  The inefficiencies associated with monopoly power in the use of knowledge are particularly serious, because knowledge is what economists call a “public good”: everybody potentially can benefit from it; there is no cost of usage.” (Stiglitz, 2006) Stiglitz writes in terms of a solution concerning the particular medicinal problem, but given the artemisinin research that plays so much a part in perception of synthetic biology, this problem is of vital importance to synthetic biology to assert its position in global trade, justice and public perception and far more importantly potentially vital for many in the worlds poorest nations.  He recommends a more nuanced set of intellectual property rules rather than simply enforcing Euro-American regimes (which he argues are even counter-intuitive to their own national interests) but also suggests ‘One of the simplest ways for the developed countries to help developing countries is to “waive” the tax, allowing them to use the intellectual property for their own citizens, so that their citizens can obtain the drugs at cost.  Critics might say: But then the developing countries are simply free-riding on the advanced industrial countries.  To which the answer is: Yes, and they should.  There is no additional cost imposed on the developed countries.  And the benefits to the developing countries would be enormous: increased health is not only of value in its own right, but it would contribute to increased productivity.’  He follows this with perhaps the key point for this particular review, ‘A start in this direction has already been made.  Students at some research universities are arguing that the universities should insist that, as a part of their licensing agreements with drug manufacturers, drugs be provided to developing countries at deeply discounted prices.’ (Stiglitz, 2006) Surely iGEM, as an undergraduate international collaboration, featuring universities from many different nations is a perfect forum for the ethical agenda of synthetic biology to take part, a role already started, though by no means complete or assured, with the Creative Commons nature of the BioBricks registry.  There is a great tradition of the free flow of information throughout academia and of collaborative, open work throughout such institutions, the Human Genome Project being a great example of the potential that arises from an amalgamation of pure, scientific inquiry fostered in a socially considerate context.

3. In Benchling, open the recombinant plasmid sequence, choose alignment button on the right side of the screen and paste the sequence we copied from Snapgene viewer into the sequence box.
4. Analyze how the gene sequence align with the expected recombinant plasmid.
5. Our desA plasmid sequence looks really well-aligned with the expected recombinant plasmid, but we lost a big chunk of sequence in our SFR2 and tSFR2 gene sequence.
Next step: While we re-clone our SFR2 and tSFR2 gene, we were going to transform our desA gene into wild type cyanobacteria and wait a couple days to let them grow in BG11 plate.
(08/04/16)
Repeat PCR for SFR2 and tSFR2
1. Set up the PCR reaction (refer to 08.17.16)
2. Run the gel and extract the gel.
3. Measure concentration with nano drop. SFR2 concentration: 8.1 ng/µl.
Clone SFR2 and tSFR2 PCR product into pJET plasmid
Goal: Since the sequencing result of our SFR2 and tSFR2 gene did not come out good, so we decided to clone them to pJET plasmid to see if we got the actual sequence of our genes , after PCR-ing with the Gibson overhang (~20 bp sequence from the riboswitch plasmid).
1. Set up the ligation reaction on ice:
• 5 ul 2X Reaction buffer
• 90 ng PCR product
• 0.5 µl pJET cloning vector (50 ng/µl)
• 0.5 µl T4 DNA Ligase
• Nuclease free H2O until 10 µl
2. Incubate the ligation mixture at room temperature for 10 minutes. Use ligation product directly for transformation.
3. Thaw the competent cells on ice.
4. Add <2.5 µl ligation reaction to 25 µl cells. Mix gently by flicking the tubes and incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
5. Heat shock at 42°C for 30 seconds. Place back on ice for 2 minutes.

Quantify the plasmid DNA with the Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The DNA can be stored at -20°C.
If the concentration of the plasmid DNA is too low for sequencing (less than 50 ng/µl) you can transform E. coli with the plasmid and isolate the plasmid again.
Isolation of plasmid DNA from E. coli
The Material
Liquid LB medium
NucleoSpin® plasmid kit, Macherey & Nagel
The Procedure
Use single colonies from your transformation plates to inoculate 4 ml (15 – 20 ml for low-copy plasmids) LB liquid medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and grow the culture over night at 37°C with agitation.
Collect the cells from 1.5 ml (15 ml for low-copy plasmids) of the overnight cultures by centrifugation (1 min, 13,000 rpm). Re-suspend the pellet in 250 ml of buffer A1, add 250 ml of buffer A2, mix gently 6 – 8 times and incubate the suspension for 5 min at room temperature. For the isolation of low-copy plasmids add 500 ml of buffers A1 and A2 to the cells.
Add 300 ml (0.6 ml for low-copy plasmids) of buffer A3, mix gently 6 – 8 times and centrifuge the lysate for 5 – 10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Transfer the supernatant into NucleoSpin® plasmid column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
(Optional: for sequencing of low-copy plasmid DNA add 500 ml buffer AW to the column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13000 rpm and discard the flow-through.)

Where Do We Go from Here?
iGEM 2010
After all of the points I've mentioned above and other criticisms I have, I still care about iGEM, and I still think it's an incredible experience to be a part of. We all know that synthetic biology is still a young field of study — we can see the potential in it. Being able to learn about this field and experience it first hand is an extremely valuable educational opportunity; and not just for the exposure to this body of knowledge. Learning about the very basic scientific principles, learning how to be an effective member of a team, learning about all the gears that need to turn to bring a project to completion, and learning what inspires and motivates you to work are all part of it.
I think that's the most important thing to keep in mind: iGEM is an educational opportunity. It explains why I have such a problem with the price of competing. It explains why I have issues with attempts to expand iGEM beyond its scope without addressing foundational issues that come along with growth.
If you, the iGEM Foundation, would like to shift focus to have more scientific impact, please, by all means do so. But recognize what foundational changes need to be made to accommodate this, and how straddling the line between two objectives can take away from efforts to achieve both.
iGEM 2011
As for where I stand and what changes I would like to see in order to keep the emphasis on education, I would like to see a return to regional competitions next year. This not only makes travel less burdensome for teams, it also makes the Jamboree less expensive and easier to manage, as there are fewer teams attending. While it is exciting to have thousands of individuals under one roof to share in each other's projects, having too many events simultaneously can detract from the overall experience. Regional championships also have benefits for the high school tracks, as this is more affordable for high school students, and doesn't require the breadth of knowledge needed to understand hundreds of projects. It gives high schoolers more opportunity to interact with university students and advisors, more opportunity to have in-depth conversations about interesting topics, and more opportunity to become acquainted with the field instead of being overwhelmed by it. Learning about local universities and getting an introduction to the world of synthetic biology is much more important for high school students than whether or not they can afford to participate.
With regards to incentive for long-lasting impact"

Introduction
We can think of many relevant questions when implementing a new circuit: how sensitive is the system, how much will it produce and will it affect the growth rate? As such, it is important to model the effect of the new circuits on the bacteria. This will be done in the Internal Model. We will use two approaches. First we will use a bottom-up approach. This involves building a detailed kinetic model with rate laws. We will use Simbiology and ODEs to study the sensitivity and dynamic processes inside the cell. Afterwards, a top-down model, Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), will be used to study the steady-state values for production flux and growth rate. This part is executed by the iGEM Team of Toulouse as part of a collaboration and can be found here
Simbiology and ODEs
Our Simbiology model will be described in the next section. Simbiology is a toolbox from Matlab designed for the simulation of (bio)chemical reactions. It allows us to calculate systems of ODEs and to visualize the system in a diagram. It also has options to perform a sensitivity analysis, which allows us to study the effect of aspecified parameter. We will focus on the production of leucine, Ag43 and AHL in cell A and the changing behavior of cell B due to changing AHL concentration. In this perspective, we will make two models in Simbiology: one for cell A and one for cell B. First we will describe how we constructed the models and searched for parameters.
Quest for parameters
We can divide the different processes going on in the cell in seven classes: transcription, translation, DNA binding, complexation and oligomerization, protein production kinetics, degradation and diffusion. We went on to search the necessary parameters and descriptions for each of these categories. To start constructing our model, we first have to pick a unit. We choose to use molecules as unit, because many constants are expressed in this unit and it allows us to drop the dillution terms connected to cell growth. We will also work with a deterministic model instead of a stochastic model.
The next step is to make some assumptions:
The effects of cell division can be neglected
The substrate pool can not be depleted and the concentration (or amount of molecules) of substrate in the cell is constant
The exterior of the cell contains no leuc"

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," norms will be a fundamental actor of the science production.
1) Why standards?
The initiative of a standardized biology can be read in numerous perspectives, answering to experimental, practical and theoretical needs of biology. Standardization, through it “rational” part and simple decomposition, proposes a new way to wonder about the complexity of life. Drew Endy considers that it offers a “direct and compelling method for testing our current understanding of natural biological systems”. That new theoretical approach, that pragmatical perspective in order to answer unsolved questions has too its practical and experimental counterpart : knowing how a biological system is functioning implies being able to control it. We are now getting to the canons of production of engineering, now biological, mentioned in our previous reflexions. As Ben Howel shows it (Auyoung et al. 2007), standardization in history of technique is mostly about two stakes. Referring at Michael Kershaw’s work in ""The international electrical units: a failure of standardization?"" Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 38 (2007): 108-131) : Standards had “to support the work of scientists taking precision measurements” as well as “commercial measurement systems”. Howel also reveals that the aim of standardization was about resolving security problems : the technical norm permits assurance of the well functioning of the systems which rely on it, permitting its evaluation. The place of techno scientific standards does not need to be proved anymore in the technology that surrounds us, but Howel notices that standardization process wasn't present in the field of genetic engineering. That way, synthetic biology is disconnected from its disciplinary parents and developed its own engineering approaches through abstraction and calibration.
2) Popularization of standard as a strategical stake
Howel offers us a luminous comparison to explain the popularization process of standards in synthetic biology. Howel compares it to the establishment of the big technical standards decided in the 19th century (as railroad, electrical measurement, etc). Technical norms, in the 19th century in a climax of industrialization process, were decided in large international meetings, congresses of norms' constitutions. Thus, delegations of engineers were meeting in order to establish norms. That centralization of decision making is totally unversed in popularization of standards in synthetic biology.
The initiative from MIT, Harvard and University of California of San Francisco's researchers, through constitution of the BioBricks Foundation is a vary different system for standardization. The BioBricks Foundation provides the material and management support of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (a collaborative registry initiated and managed by MIT, making publicly"

On the other end of the process the decoder takes the following     steps to get the message back from extracted DNA:
Look for the start sequence.
Skip the next 4 base-pairs (the padding).
Read the 4 base-pairs that follow it as the length of the substitition sequence.
Cut out all sequences of that number A-bases.
Read the next 8 base-pairs as the length of the message sequence.
Then the following 8 base-pairs as the checksum.
Read the message sequence of length base-pairs.
Verify that the next 12 base-pairs are equal to the footer sequence.
Compute the checksum of the message sequence and verify it with the checksum read earlier.
Decode the message sequence.
Decrypt the decoded message sequence with the key that the user provides.
While this article described the process for translating the     encrypted message to a DNA sequence, it is much the same for the     key sequence. The only difference is that the encryption and     decryption steps are not taken, but the message format is still the     same.

Based on our findings, we finally chose to use intracellular glutamate to synthesize surfactin and γ-PGA to verify the feasibility of our project.
Questionnaire Analysis
In the analysis process,we tried to find the relationship between the two questions ""Do you understand the use of surfactin and gamma-polyglutamic acid?"" and ""Do you think that the intelligent metabolic pathway we are studying meets the needs of current production and research?"". Therefore, we performed the cross-over analysis. The analysis results show that the majority of people who understand the use of both products believe that our intelligent metabolic pathways meet current needs, but need to be improved; while people who do not understand our products have listened to our explanations and believe that this intelligent metabolic pathway is in line with current needs very significantly,which also reflected that our publicity is very effective.
The Result of the Investigation
Do you think our method can meet the needs of current development and production?
22.55%: Very consistent, optimistic about the results
66.63%: Yes, but need constant improvement
7.84%: Does not fit well, need innovative design
0.98%: No consistent, new experimental routes need to be designed
The Result of the Investigation
Do you konw about the production and application of these two kinds of things?
46.08%: Do not know much about it
28.43%: Knowing little about it
21.57%: Knowing
3.92%: Knowing it well
We compared the answers of the same questions pre- and post- presentation. In fact, More people have realized that our intelligent metabolic approach is feasible, at least in terms of ideas that are very consistent with current needs.
In addition, many people expressed concerns about biosafety and the use of antibiotic, which will be showed in the pages of Human Practice and Safety.
The Result of the Investigation
What's your attitude towards the use of antibiotics?
47.06%: Expressing concern because antibiotics are overused at present
39.22%: It is necessary to use reasonably under normal supervision
12.75%: Expressing optimism and it can be used normally
0.98%: Must stop using it as it may produce super bacteria
The questionnaire is issued in Chinese statistics, for the convenience of reading, all of them are translated into English.

Safety
1. Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab
The biological parts and devices that we designed and constructed do not pose any risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab. In this project we work with organisms and cells that are widely used in laboratories and generally regarded as safe, namely the E.coli strain DH5α, and the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. One part of the team worked with these two organisms in a biosafety 1 lab. The other part of the team worked with the human osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS in a biosafety 2 lab. To avoid cross-contamination the part of the team working with the microorganisms were not allowed to enter the mammalian cell lab.
There are potential risks in a number of standard practices performed in the lab, therefore appropriate measures were taken when preparing media and buffers, performing gel extractions, and using molecular biology kits for DNA purification etc. In general nitrile gloves, labcoats, and goggles were worn when required to ensure the safety of our team members in the lab.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
Our standard assembly system is intended for research and development only and does therefore not pose a threat to public safety. If the biological parts or devices should be released by accident there would be no apparent risks, since the biological parts we are working with are not hazardous. They would not constitute any danger or other negative effects, if they were released by accidents. Furthermore our working strain E. coli DH5α does not thrive outside the laboratory, because it is an auxotroph and cannot transmit plasmids to other strains (it is a F- strain).
We have constructed resistance marker cassettes expressing"
UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html,", and 1,000 µM. Aliquots of each induced sample were then loaded into 5 wells of a 96 well plate. This plate was placed into a shaking/incubating plate reader set at 37 C and measured for fluorescence (584 nm excitation 612 nm emission) every 5 minutes for 180 minutes in total. OD600 readings were taken at the beginning and end of this time course and a linear regression was used to approximate the OD600 for each time point. The OD600 data was used to normalize the fluorescence data in order to generate the graph below.
Copper induced RFP expression over time - XL1-Blue cells containing the copper biosensor plasmid were grown to log phase and induced with varying concentrations of copper. Fluorescence was then measured every 5 minutes thereafter and normalized against OD600.
This graph shows clear differences in terms of the expression profiles of the different experimental groups. While the cells induced with 25 µM and 50 µM copper show little to no difference from the non-induced sample, the other induction groups show a clear upward progression in terms of fluorescence against increasing copper concentration. Overall, this figure as well as the qualitative testing show that our copper biosensor can reliably detect copper concentrations greater than or equal to 100 uM.
From our research and after visiting the Washington Suburban Sanitation Commission Patuxent Water Treatment Plant, we found that normal drinking water typically contains around 0.01 mg/L copper. The EPA limit set on copper in drinking water is meanwhile 1.3 mg/L. When converted to µM, typical drinking water copper levels are approximately 0.2 µM whereas the EPA limit is set at approximately 20 µM. Since our biosensor sensitivity is limited to 100 µM, detection of copper levels above the EPA limit would require water samples to be concentrated prior to any form of induction. While this would not be the most convenient in terms of actually testing water for copper contamination, the functionality of this part has served our team well in terms of helping to educate high school students and the next generation of synthetic biologists.
Future Efforts
Going forward, our team is looking to characterize our zinc and lead detection systems that were designed but not tested. Assuming that these systems function similarly to the copper biosensor, we will assemble all three detection systems into a single, master metal detection plasmid. Incorporating the design of this plasmid into our future lessons would to show students one extra way in which synthetic biology can be utilized.
Along with developing this master plasmid, we plan to spend"
