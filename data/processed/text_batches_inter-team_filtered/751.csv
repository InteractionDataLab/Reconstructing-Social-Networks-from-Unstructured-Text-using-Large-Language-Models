Natural rubber is produced from latex extracts, which are obtained by draining the trees. This milky extract is then processed into the different types of rubber, depending on its intended use. The demand is indeed increasing, and the projections estimate the global consumption of natural rubber to reach 13.0 million
tons and total global consumption 27.7 million tons, by the year 2018 (Fig. 1-2). Source: International Smallholder Rubber Conference Phnom Penh, Cambodia  24 June 2009 Panel 4 : Prospects - IRSG

Synthetic rubber is produced in various ways and gives rise to a number of different synthetic rubber variants. It is produced mainly from fossil fuels like petroleum, oil, natural gas, and coal. These rubbers have enhanced properties towards heat resistance, but are inferior to natural rubbers in mechanical performance and low-temperature performances. There exists synthetic rubbers that come close to the performances of natural rubber, but prices are up to 500 times those of natural rubbers. Source: Threadingham, D., et al Synthetic rubber.

Hevea brasiliensis is a fast growing tree that belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae. Though smaller when grown in plantations, the wild tree can grow up to 36 meters tall. The lesser height in plantations is due to the draining of latex. The tree is mature for latex production when it reaches the age of 7-8 years and has a period of employment lasting approximately a quarter century. The percolation of latex is done by attaching a bowl to the tree and making an incision into the cortex of the tree, thus letting the latex slowly drain into the bowl. Source: The Great Danish Encyclopedia (Link) World wide there exists many high-yielding clones of Hevea brasiliensis, ranging from 900-1600 kg/ha/yr from exotic strains to 2000-3500 kg/ha/yr from Nigerian clones. It is only under perfect conditions that such high yields are obtained, and in most of Asia, the production is far lower. Source: K.O. Omokhafe & J.E"

The iGEM Meetup hosted by Carnegie Mellon University
Carnegie Mellon was able to host an iGEM meetup on Saturday, September 6th at the Mellon Institute. A total of six teams and about 50 participants attended including a high school team that the University of Pittsburgh had been mentoring. The following teams were in attendance:
University of Michigan
University of Michigan Software Team
Pennsylvania State University
University of Pittsburgh
Montgomery High School
Carnegie Mellon University
The day started with each team presenting their respective projects while the other teams wrote down feedback and questions. We then transitioned to a Q&A panel of past participants and their experiences with iGEM. Some Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh advisors as well as some members of the Michigan teams had previously participated in iGEM and answered questions relating to the Jamboree, forming a team, picking a project, etc.
As the final part of the meet up, all of the teams socialized and discussed projects while rotating through the workshops we had set up. There were initially three scheduled workshops: poster, public speaking and wiki. However, the representative for the poster workshop was unable to attend. The presentation and wiki workshops were very successful in helping teams recognize their strengths, weaknesses, and working through any technical issues as far as the wiki. Professor Julia Deems of Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business specializes in communication. She was able to give each team feedback specific to their presentation on what they can do to make more of an impact at the Jamboree. The wiki workshop was led by Jonathan deWerd, a graduate student in biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, and he was able to provide feedback to any teams that had questions about putting together their wiki.
Over the course of the day, all of the teams were able to learn more about other iGEM projects as well as advance their own project further due to the conversation and feedback that comes from collaboration. We had great fun learning about what everyone else had been to this summer and we will definitely recognize the"

Education
As a team of highly motivated university students, all of us value, not only the importance of proper education, but also the opportunity to be influenced in an early age at where your dreams develop; the world is our oyster and one should feel so. Through an unanimous vote, our team decided the education branch was one we wanted to pursue with high ambitions. Biotechnology is still a new field in education and who would be better to develop its role in our country than a team working through their summer vacation in the name of science.
Science in Forum
Back in April, we were present at Science in Forum - an annual science festival targeted at children of all ages. Our main purpose was to peak the visitor’s interest in biotechnology and the possibilities that come with it both on a bigger scale and related to iGEM. It quickly became clear, that text-packed scientific papers was a wrong angle and by changing our methods to reaching the children’s level with Jurassic World-references and DNA-strings made out of candy, we managed to communicate the purpose of our project in broad terms to a lot of interested children as well as load them up with sugar.
It was great to see the vast expression of interest in all ages and it was an immense opportunity to practice creating material to the proper audience. It was clear to us, that we did not have a strong enough case as our project at this point and being questioned basic questions by kids and more detailed questions by adults, we got a head start with flaws and gaps we would have to seal to have a strong project.

It is our honor to discuss our project with Dr. Fang Zhengyu from Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. After we introduced and explained our project to him, he gave his opinions from a professional point of view. First, he questioned about the efficiency of using cell-free system to complete a series of reactions and the extremely low concentration of ctDNA in patient’s blood. Then, he also concerned about applying our design onto a screening chip instead of other product forms such as a detection kit. After that, we exchanged our opinions on those questions with Dr. Fang Zhengyu. It is greatl to have others opinion on our project. Dr. Fang’s suggestions helped us improve the design of our product and we decided to carry out further experiments to teat the efficiency of the screening paper.
Product portfolio
Abstract
According to our investigation above, there are already all kinds of ctDNA detecting services existed in the market. Therefore, it is hard to compete with those developed products. Our well designed paper chip has its own unique selling points which can open up a new small market. It is aiming to provide a fast and efficient method to detect ctDNA in individuals, leading to an early diagnosis of lung cancer or a monitor on cancer recurrence.

Part 1. Selection of acid tolerance component ( msmK )
    The key point of this part is selecting the gene related to anti-acid characteristic. Because the mechanism of acid resistance is complicated, and genes are connected to each other, it is hard to confirm the most significant gene.
    Gnomic mutagenesis and high throughout screening are carried out to obtain anti-acid mutant strains with significant higher survival rate under specific acid environment (pH 4.0, 5h). Then analyze the diff-genes data between mutant strain and parent strain on pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 respectively. A dimensionality reduction model is established and five possible acid-resistant genes are obtained. Finally, with experiment verification and pathway analysis, msmK gene is shown to be the key anti-acid gene.
    In addition, we also inferred how the component functions by analyzing the main acid tolerance pathways of lactic acid bacteria. The result shows msmK is related to carbohydrate metabolism and sugar transporters. That means it can help provide more energy for bacteria in acid environment to maintain intracellular pHi.
Part 2. Add anti-cold gene( cspD2 )
    According to previous research, we know that cspD2 can express cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria. Therefore, we obtained the cspD2 fragment by in vitro synthesis, and constructed the cspD2 overexpression strain. Verify the cold resistance performance of the recombined bacteria with nisin as inducer.
Part 3. Demonstration
    It has been verified that cspD2 can effectively exert anti-freezing effect in the recipient bacteria. CspD2 was ligated to the pNZ8149/msmK plasmid by one-step cloning (seamless ligation), and the recombinant plasmid was introduced into the constructed L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2 strain using electroporation. The gfp gene was inserted as a marker gene, and cell viability was characterized by fluorescence intensity. The strain was tested for acid resistance and freezing resistance using a flow cytometer.

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#pttest_-_-_TEXT.html," the Kat Orman's morning show, alongside Monty Python's Michael Palin, and spoke about the increasing threat that antibiotic resistance poses, and what we're doing to combat it. We were asked questions about why we chose this area to pursue, whether our project was likely to be lincensed, and about the basics of synthetic biology.
We answered this by using the analogy of computer hardware: if your computer hard drive is broken, you can buy a new model from the shop without worrying about whether it will fit or not, and it's the same with stretches of DNA sequence that you can stick together. We were also asked about our outreach and the efforts we were making to change the mindset of a society that demands to be prescribed antibiotics.
Finally, Kat ended by asking if we thought we could change the world with our project. After a little nervous laughter, we gave our answer: hopefully! Our section begins 1hr 6mins into the 3 hour show. Click here to have a listen!
UNIQ Workshop
We met with 40 prospective Oxford students to teach them about Synthetic Biology. The students had in interest in Biochemistry but knew nothing about iGEM .
We hammered home the key message of Synthetic Biology - that we achieve more progress by expanding a registry of standardised biological parts - through a 15 minute introductory presentation on BioBrick s.
We then split them into groups and gave each one a mentor from our iGEM team. We worked through questions to test their understanding in a tutorial style and asked them to explain the constructs of previous iGEM teams. They finished by presenting their findings to each other.
See the handouts we gave the groups here . All the groups were given the Synthetic Biology page, and then one of the Group question pages.
UTC Oxfordshire
We gave a presentation on ABR to a class of GCSE students from University Technical College, Oxfordshire (a local school specialising in science) at the Natural History Museum in Oxford, The Pitt Rivers Museum. This was to spread awareness of ABR to a younger age group, inspiring them with the potential applications of synthetic biology.
Our talk covered the discovery of antibiotics, the advantages of them (including their use in laboratory work), how they work, and how bacteria can evolve to gain resistance to them, as well as concepts such as horizontal gene transfer and the consequences of antibiotic resistance on our everyday lives. It also covered our project outline, and pros and cons of Solution, showing how it should help combat antibiotic resistance.

In the poster session, our project intrigued many teams, especially those that also focus their projects on synthetic metabolic pathways. They believed that our comparison between the designed metabolic pathway and the natural biochemical network would help them accomplish their project better.
During the presentation, we demonstrated the background and design thought to the conventioneers and the professors, and they gave us some sincerer and professional suggestions. We also discovered our own shortcomings through this conference. We couldn’t present our algorism lucidly to our audience, so that we will pay special attention to this problem for the Grant Jamboree presentation.

Venezuela
Venezuela as the country that has the biggest oil crude reserve is dominated by heavy oil sand reservoir. Because of the lithology, Venezuela currently using thermal EOR and hydrocarbon gas injectors though still having limited succsess in EOR.  Further research on lithology and oil fields’s characteritics ia needed by venezuela to explore and develop opportunity to chemical EOR[7].
Iran
According to research that already conducted, Irani oil industry payed more attention to gas injection but received poor sweep effeciency. Water flooding alternative has been conducted either, but only few and cost too high . According to EOR Technology Market Forecast 2012-2022, Iranian EOR Technology forecast is increasing [8],[9].
Iraq
In Iraq, some studies has done to describe reservoir’s rock and fluid properties in the oil fields and what kind of EOR technology fits each oil fields. Until now, 78% of EOR project done in Iraq is thermal and chemical EOR . Both thermal EOR and surfanctant EOR used for enhancing production of light oil. Some of oil fields that predicted to fit chemical EOR in Iraq are Bai-hassn, Majnoon, Buzurgan, and Nour. There are also research on chemical properties needed in surfactant to be used in EOR technology . To be brief, Iraq’s EOR technology is getting more attention, opening opportunity for chemical EOR (especially surfactant ) to develop[10],[11].
Summary
With all of its potential of oil crude reserves, OPEC countries has not been advanced in EOR technology. Further research about oil fields characteristics and review of preceeding EOR technology process is needed. But, OPEC countries is open and on their way to improve their tertiary oil recovery.

Project Impact
Proving We Weren't Just Wasting Our Time
Outreach to the Community
Overview
In our project “Outreach to the Community,” we decided to find out how much the public understands the concept of synthetic biology. To do this we went back to the basics at a farmers market. There are 61,000 farms in Indiana many of which make a profit selling their produce at farmers markets. These farmers are being directly influenced by synthetic biology as more and more seed companies rely on synthetic biology to create hardy, robust seeds. Whether or not these vendors use GMO’s in their products or grow them, we hypothesized that they would have felt the trend moving in this direction. It was astonishing to find out that while many people had heard of GMOs, many did not understand the concept or know the connection with synthetic biology. 75% of people said that they would not use a product that contained genetically modified E. coli. We found that there is a gap in what is being used as hybridization and GMOs now and what synthetic biology. In the future we need to work towards educating the public on the potential of our budding field.
Impact
What we found from this research is that although we spend every summer striving to achieve a project where we show that synthetic biology can and will have a positive impact on our lives in the future either through medical, environmental, communication, or a wide range of applications, if we cannot communicate our research to the public there will not be a market for the products we create. If people right now are negative towards using bacteria as a way to improve their lives, we, as synthetic biologists, need to evaluate the way that we carry out our applications or how we can educate the public so that they will be more receptive to our innovations.

Purpose
        Our model aims to figure out the efficacy of the IOS system by comparing the population of B. dorsalis with and without this system. Written in NetLogo(1), , a software designed for modeling complex situations, the model combines both stochastic and deterministic methods. The stochastic part of the model was used to estimate the Metarhizium Anisopliae infection by our traps, whereas the deterministic part was used to simulate natural population growth of the flies. The efficiency of our IOS system predicted by this model is further used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of our prototype.
Rules
Assumption
This model follows the assumptions listed below:
The fly influx and efflux are always the same in the orchard.
The mortality caused by naturally existing anisopliae is considered as natural death while the death caused by M.anisopliae inside the traps and its infection afterward is regarded as IOS-caused deaths
The fly population has already reached the stable stage before the start of the simulation.
Natural Condition
The fly population obeys the discrete time logistic function:
  represents the population of fruit flies at time t.
Population of next generation is proportional to that of this generation by the coefficient r"

    BioBlitz
BioBlitz
The Team has attended a total of two BioBlitz events, one run by the city council and one by the University environment team. Bioblitz events are a fantastic way for the community to get involved with the wildlife on their doorstep. The aim is to record as many different species as possible within a certain time frame and to encourage the public's interest and knowledge of local biodiversity. Scientists, students and the community come together in local green spaces for a great educational day out. This brings together people of all backgrounds, just like the Citizen Science aspect of our iGEM project.
From the events we raised a lot of awareness about our iGEM project as well as giving us an opportunity to sell some cakes and Citizen Science kits. To draw more attraction to our stalls we bought bubble guns and balloons which brought people to the stall for a chance for us to talk to them about synthetic biology and our project, Following up every conversation with business cards to remind people where to get more information about iGEM and our project at our blog.

Hi, I am Yijun ZHANG,and I am going to be a senior student majored in life science. I'm familiar with traditional bio experiments, for I spent my junior year in a lab working on cell biology. And as a member of our iGEM team, I know more about synthetic biology. During experiments, I was always surprised by the interesting results. I really enioy the procedure of genetically engineering our E.coli to achieve amazing function. Hope our creation will also amaze you all!
Hi, I am Mingyuan DU majored in chemical engineering and I am going to have my 3rd year in Tsinghua University. I am the main supervisor of our cute little story about the microorganism --- including the play, the characters, the designing and finally the video. After the whole process, I picked up my confidence and was finally able to speak out loud that I am a capable person who enjoys challenges and difficulties.
I'm Zijian GUO and I'm major in Fundamental Science of Chemistry and Biology. Now it's my final year of my bachelor degree. Everything related to biology and chemistry and their interdisciplinary turns me on and I want to be a scientist in the next 10 years. After that, I'm not sure. Maybe running a café? Cooking is just another version of experiment, isn't it? For this IGEM project, I focus more on the parts design and experiment. It is nice to have such a friendly team to work in. And the exploring during the project is as fascinating as you can expect. I hope that our story could catch your attention.
I am Shude LIU from Tsinghua University, institute of chemical engineering. I feel very lucky to be a part of our IGEM team---THU-E, which focuses on the in vivo evolution for microbial cell factory. I used to think that Darwin’s theory of evolution just happen naturally without the interference of human being. But through our project, I realized that the process can actually be accurately designed and controlled by us, providing a promising way to evolve overproduction microbe.

SHPH-Shanghai,2018,Team:SHPH-Shanghai#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," the future, iGem provided me the valuable opportunity to learn about synthetic biology and bioengineering. I’ve also done other researches on Chinese Traditional Medicine, but apart from natural science, I love ballet, figures skating and writing, and that’s the reason why I’m taking charge of this written assignment in this team.
Yi'an Qian
Hi, this is Yian! I am mainly responsible for essay writing and poster design.  This great team arouses my interest in synthetic biology and promotes me to think about the unlimited possibilities this discipline could give the world. The charm of biology and engineering has fascinated me for a long time and I am always finding a way to combine them. I believe iGem can be a good start!
Chenan Huang
I am a senior student in Shanghai pinghe school, and I participated in wiki design and experiments. iGem is definitely a great experience for me, as I could gather more knowledge on synthetic biology. Apart from my great interests in Botanical science, I am also a dancer and a bassist, which made me one of the artsiest members in the group(this is why I’m in charge of all graphic components in the competition[with Luke]).
Tianze Hua
I am Tianze Hua from Shanghai Pinghe school. I am interested in synthetic biology because of its unlimited possibilities. As a team member, I helped design the experiments as well as did most of them.
Yimo Zhang
I am Jack from Shanghai Pinghe Bilingual School. As a senior taking biology high level, my passion for biology motivates me to step further into researches. With deep interests into neuroscience, I believe genetic modification will provides us with more insights into the function and mechanisms of ourselves, and consequently how to change them. I'm also in charge of the major part of human practice as I'm certain that a successful project, no matter how insignificant it is, it has to address some hinein needs for it to be successful.

Hi! I’m Sean from SHPH-Shanghai Team 2018. I do a large portion of the experiments for the team together with other two team members in summer. At first I barely knew anything about how to do experiments. However, I learned about so much through out the process of experiment from the other two member and, thanks to them, I was able to do the experiment all by myself at last.

BECAUSE SCIENCE IS FOR THE SOCIETY
POLICY AND PRACTICES
Meetups
True spirit of iGEM lies not in competition but in collaboration. With dawn of synthetic biology,  it became absolutely clear that future of biological sciences lies not in closed gate patenting but   in open source innovation. iGEM teams all over the world organize team meetups with other   teams where discussion, critique and feedback over the each team project is given by all. Such   discussions are extremely helpful as they provide a wide diversity of opinions and filter the   subtle nuisances before Giant Jamboree. Our team was invited for two iGEM meetups ­ one   Indian iGEM team meetup by IISER Pune and other an Asian regional meetup organized by   NCTU, Taiwan. Both of the experiences have been very informative as well as enlightening.   Details of individual meetups are described below.
IISER Pune Meetup (July 16-­17, 2015)
The IISER Pune iGEM team organized an Indian iGEM meetup during This meetup had  three of the four Indian iGEM teams (for the year 2015) participate in it, namely IIT Delhi,   IISER Pune and IIT Kharagpur. IIT Delhi had sent three representatives of their team, while two   of our team members ­ Harsheel and Rhushikesh represented our team there. During the first day   (16th July), there was an informal discussion session among all the teams, followed by IISER   Pune’s project presentation in the afternoon. While the second day (17th July) had the   presentations of our team (in the morning) and IIT Delhi’s presentation in the afternoon. IISER Pune made a really comprehensive presentation, which left the entire audience in  awe, and in a way left the other teams with no choice but to further improvise their presentations.   All the IISER Pune team members participated and contributed to their extensive presentation,   which had a significant amount of their project modelling data as well (computer simulation   based work). They had also covered good ground with regard to their wet lab work, and had it   divided into three sub"

How to Conduct Ethical Interventions in iGEM Surveys
Key Points:
We have created a guide to be used as a tool for future iGEM teams conducting surveys to ensure that the data produced does not violate human experimentation rights and can be used in future research.
One ongoing error in iGEM surveys is a lack of Institutional Review.
This opens the surveys up to two risks: 1) that they will visit more than minimal risk on participants and 2) that they will not be able to publish data from their findings.
In order to prevent the negative externalities of iGEM human practices and ensure that the survey work can reach its highest potential, please take a look at our Institutional Review Board guide!

Prologue: How to Perform Best Practices on your Human Practices and Accrue Useful Data
One of the struggles of emerging technologies, like those created by iGEM teams, is that there are very few studies performed on public opinion that are tailored to our specific project. Because we are pioneers in the research, our work leads us to ask questions about possible public acceptance that have never been asked before. A common solution to this problem is to go out into the world and collect the information ourselves. This can be a great tactic to fill the gap of missing knowledge and provide crucial information for future iGEM teams. Unfortunately, there are many pitfalls to conducting proper and thorough surveys. Here is a quick and ethical guide to making surveys that adhere to best practices.
What is an Institutional Review Board and Why Does It Matter?

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," the amount of waste in our society.
He said this has a lot to do with regulation of industry and economics.
Yassen asked what questions an MSP would have for a group building a biorefinery in Scotland.
Patrick said any politician (regardless of party) would ask about the impact on people, the environment, and quality of life. What would the development look like? How much space would it take? How much economic activity and jobs would it generate? How viable is it? How secure an industry is it? Is it speculative or is there a strong business case? People would want to know about the impact on the local environment in terms of the industrial processes going on in the plant.
All developments have to occupy physical space, so we'd have to ask what use the community wants that space put to.
Yassen asked about any immediate concerns.
Patrick said he would need to know more about the specific proposal, and what it would imply in terms of consuming material and energy, and producing pollutants. He would also want to know what the local community's fears and anxieties were.
He said sometimes local people need an independent voice familiar with the subject: someone who's not a politician and not associated with the developer. Politicians are laypeople, not experts. If the community saw there was independent advice they could look at, that would help in persuading them to accept such a project.
Yassen asked what reaction constituents would have to a biorefinery.
Patrick said the reaction would be mixed. It's hard to take a position without further details.
As well as the factors mentioned above, he added that we should consider the aesthetic impact, and whether the jobs created would go to local people or people from outside the local community. If a community is going to give over part of its space to any development, from whatever industry, the community needs to gain something in exchange for the loss of its space, especially if this is high quality green space.
Yassen asked whether the Science and Technology Cross-Party Group has assessed the potential of synthetic biology.
Patrick said it hadn't really come up. If particular developments or projects come along, most politicians would want to take things on a case by case basis, and understand the specifics rather than immediately taking a general view.
Allan asked if the group has discussed genetic modification more generally.
Patrick said all parties have discussed GM, and there is a wide range of views, but there is a majority view in the Scottish Parliament against the commercial use of GM agriculture. His own opposition to this is based on the economics: the control of the food chain by a small, powerful clique"

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.

ProtoCat 3.0 - Project Design
Overview
The design of ProtoCat this year maintains the same basic structure as last year's version but with a more dynamic underlying structure to support our new features. Therefore, in addition to the protocol and user tables, we have added many more (protocol steps, reagents, user info, instances of reagents, categories, comments, and ratings). Our software uses Django to combine all of this stored information and then return it to the user through the templating engine.
Frontend
For the frontend, our software uses the JavaScript library jQuery to manipulate the webpage to make it more dynamic. To make the HTML layout dynamic to the size of the user page, we use Bootstrap, which has the added benefit of cleaning up the design of our webpages.
Backend
On the backend, we used the Django framework and MySQL (SQLite on development computers) to respond to web requests and store the information. The reason we use Django is that it is very simple to do the basic features required of a website, such as authentication and storing to any major database software. It also has a built-in templating engine for sending the data we have stored to the user."

By genetically engineering the brazzein gene into the bacteria in kombucha, the drink could be sweetened without adding sugar or excessive calories.  While still being a GMO product, this beverage would be low in sugar and could appeal to a health-conscious consumer.

pH Sensors
Many of the microorganisms involved in the fermentation of kombucha produce acidic metabolites that lower the pH of the culture. Using pH-sensitive promoters to control the expression of reporter proteins, such as GFP or a chromoprotein, would allow visualization of the pH change. The promoters Cpx, P-atp2, and Cadc were selected as pH sensors to indicate pH in the neutral, basic, and acidic ranges, respectively.1,3,5,6 These constructs have been or will be transformed into Escherichia coli to confirm pH sensitivity prior to introduction to kombucha and to see if these constructs could be utilized as sensors in mediums besides kombucha.
Modification of Gluconobacter oxydans, a bacterium in kombucha, is also planned to avoid disturbing the kombucha microbiome. Three endogenous upstream regions of loci that were reported to show increased mRNA synthesis as pH decreased were obtained.2 Golden Gate assembly is currently being used to quickly assemble these promoters upstream of Venus (pYTK033).4 Once successful, these pH-sensitive promoters with different reporters will be used to visualize the different members of the kombucha microbiome overtime.

To test the reasonableness of our assessment method, we carried out a test assessment of three iGEM team: Yale 2011， Imperial College London 2011 and TJU 2012. The results showed TJU 2012 rank first, and then Imperial College London 2011 and Yale 2011.
Though the data in the above table, we can see that Yale 2011 ranks first in academic level. This is in accordance with our general thought. TJU 2012 behaves relatively poor in academic level, which is just the weakness of TJU 2012.
In all other aspects, TJU2012 ranks first. This result is not so reasonable. We have reflected upon this problem and proposed several explanations. The main reason may be that our sample size is not large enough and our questionnaire has some unapparent flaws. We can further refine our assessment in several aspects, as shown below.
Reallocate weight value to each assessment level. To complete the job, we need to more surveys and data.
Reconsider every question and find out the ones with biased tendency.
Size up sample capacity. We need to carry out more surveys in varies people to decrease random deviate induced by individual assessment.
Risk Evaluation System of Genetic Pollution
Background and Problem
With the increasing concern about the genetic pollution in our society together with the little knowledge about this newly occurred problem, we are more urgently required to establish a reasonable and comprehensive evaluation system to determine the actual genetic pollution level. With this system, we can also evaluate the"

To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"
NTU-LIHPAO-Taiwan,2015,Team:NTU-LIHPAO-Taiwan#Modeling#Pathways_-_-_TEXT.html," we hypothesized 4 days for bacteria survival. Therefore, the time-changing tendency could be utilized for further calculation.
[Fig.1-1-1] Total L. casei cell number adhered on the intestinal tract against time after orogastric intubation
[Fig.1-1-2] Ratio of L. casei cell number to total ingested cell number against time
CPP-PYY Penetration Efficiency
Knowing the L. casei cell number variation against time, we proceeded to simulate the penetration process for the cell penetrating peptide, TAT with PYY. Although the mechanism for TAT translocation depends on the delivery cargo and its sequence, most papers concluded that it is mediated via an as yet uncharacterized pinocytosis/endocytosis related mechanism, which is also receptor-independent. [3]
From the experimental results of CPP-PYY complex production rate, here we took 10-10 μg/min for example, we hypothesized that one-fourth of the products secreted from the cell will be distributed in the direction toward the small intestine epithelial cells, not being digested by the intestine fluid. Liang JF et al. had provided the effective permeability (Peff) of insulin-TAT conjugates by in vitro intestinal absorption assay on cultured Caco-2 cell monolayer, which was calculated based on the following equation. [4]
where Jss is the flux, dCR/dt is the change in conjugate concentration in the receiver chamber at steady-state, VR is the volume of receiver buffer, A is the cross sectional area of the exposed tissue, and CD is the conjugate concentration in the donor chamber. The result from Liang JF et al. was applied for modeling, where the value of Peff was presented as 1.62×10-5 (cm/s). Moreover, the results further implied that the product seemed to be through a transcytosis-like mechanism, which confirmed that our product can penetrate through the epithelial cells. [4]
The parameters for calculation were obtained from literatures, where L. casei cell size range = 0.7-1.1 x 2.0-4.0 micrometer [5] , and the mean total mucosal surface of the small intestine interior averages 32 m2 in recent research. [6] One-tenth of the bacteria height multiplied the mucosa surface area were taken as the donor chamber volume, where one-fourth of the CPP-PYY complexes without being digested were oriented toward the epithelial cells. Finally, the flux of"

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week4_-_-_TEXT.html," extraction for the melanin pigment.
Progress on carotenoids (Wednesday)
Restriction digest results from yesterday indicated that 5 minutes were probably insufficient for FastDigest. Today we wish to investigate the optimal time for restriction.
We carried out test restriction on K152005/CrtEBIY (insert 5412bp, backbone 2079bp, total 7491bp), using XbaI and PstI. We decided to investigate 2 variables: time for restriction (5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 15 minutes) and amount of enzymes used (PstI to XbaI ratio: 1:1 or 2:1 -- the protocol for ""FastDigest"" with 2 enzymes suggested 1:1 ratio, while protocol for ""DoubleDigest"" suggested 2:1 ratio for PstI to XbaI). The results were as follows:
(*""5min 1:1"" and ""10min 1:1"" had larger volume of water than the other tubes, so the concentrations of DNA in them were slightly diluted).
The results indicated that increasing time for restriction digest could improve the yield of doubly cut products (compare ""5min 2:1"" and ""10min 2:1""). And it seemed ""1:1"" ratio was ideal for restriction (compare ""15min 2:1"" and ""15min 1:1"").
Dry Work
MelA Biobrick
The remaining two plasmids were delivered, so a plan was made for creating the melanin biobrick and removing the PstI sites:
The PCR rounds are designed to cut the melA gene away from it's current surrounding plasmid, and change the two PstI restriction sites from CTGGAC to CTGCAA. This should not affect the coding ability of the gene. The primers will also attach the BioBrick prefix and suffix to the gene, allowing it to be easily ligated into the vector.
Violacein synthesis
As the violacein operon is too large to synthesise in one section, four seperate parts were taken (each containing one gene) to be sunthesised seperately. After synthesis they will be spliced back together to produce pigment, before isolating the genes properly to create the coloured logic gates.
Amplifier and the Big Idea
Having looked at the results of the amplification experiments, we considered further development. We wish to create a system that takes an input and at given threshold levels, turns on an output, our pigment. Potential systems have been put forward:

Because the the using of D-Ala we need to find a way that can synthesize protein with D-Ala.We decide to introduce D-Ala into the bacteria translation system.
In the translation process,a kind of amino acid is caught by a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS).The aaRS recognise the corresponding tRNA and connect the tRNA and amino acid together.The amino acid is brought to the activated set in ribosome with the identification of codon on mRNA and anti-codon on tRNA.There is 20 similar paths in cells ,which have nothing to do with each other.[1]
We need to generate a orthogonal path to introduce D-Ala, and All we need is a unused codon ,a corresponding tRNA ,and an aaRS that can recognise D-Ala and the new tRNA.[1]
It is relatively easy to get a codon and tRNA.We will use the amber asthe codon of the D-Ala,which is hardly used in E.coli. We choose a tRNAAlafrom  Aquifex aeolicus to make sure it won't disturb the other path in E. coli ,and change its anti-codon to correspond amber.
The most difficult part is to designa D-AlaRS.We use the AlaRS also from Aquifex aeolicus to mutate.Ala and Gly are similar with D-Ala, so we will analysis the intereation of AlaRS with Ala and Gly[2].
The electropositive amino group is stabilized by interaction with the invariant motif 3 Asp-217 side chain carboxyl.

After discussion, we have to consider more possible pathways from xylose to pyruvate. Therefore, there is another pathway we have to figure out and build the model to check which pathway our e.coli will go. On the other hand, we can know pyruvate where it comes from by node analysis, and we can realize pyruvate from xylose or carbon dioxide uptake afterwards.
Most important of all, it will produce carbon dioxide in glycolysis. Hence, we have to consider the carbon dioxide we produce, and then compare the carbon dioxide we fix. In this discussion, we find out several ways to improve our project including more pathway we consider and node analysis we can calculate.

We have chosen four methods of extraction ; Hypochlorite digestion, Hypochlorite digestion with Triton X-100 pre-treatment, Chloroform solvent extraction and Ethyl acetate solvent extraction.
When we compare the amount of purified material from the different extraction methods, hypochlorite provides the most material, indicating that it has the highest yield. The amount of material alone is not enough to determine which method provides the largest yield of PHB, as the recovered material might not be plastic. In order to get a better view of the actual amount of plastic each method provides, purity needs to be taken into account.
H NMR as qualitative measure of purity for extration methods ( Top )
In order to determine whether the different methods of PHB extraction we used were effective, we analyzed the purified material with H NMR.
We determined the peaks caused by PHB by analyzing a sample of pure PHB as a reference. The sample of pure PHB (Figure 12) can be held against the spectra from extracted PHB (Figure 13). Since this spectrum is based on pure PHB, all the peaks present are not considered contaminations in the other spectra observed in Figure 13.

Figure 12 illustrate the results of HNMR. Each peak is caused by hydrogen atoms. The area under each curve is proportional to the number of chemical equivalent hydrogen atoms causing the peak.

This project was held by our informatics team, and their objective was to create a fun game where the concept of detecting and mapping air pollution would be accessible to anybody playing the game. This idea of keeping the game as close as possible to the reality of our project was what seemed the best, even though there was a challenge on how we could transmit scientific information to a public that can range to children to aged people, with no or few basics in science. The project was still successfully designed in a way that a person with no skills in biology could easily understand what we are doing and how we are doing it. The game is available on the Applestore and the Playstore as we created a multiplatform application in order to reach the largest target population.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

Alkane Metabolism Model
ASS enzymatic reaction model
Formation of alkylsuccinate is the first step of alkane metabolism. The enzyme involved was reported as alkylsuccinate synthase[1].
 
The overall enzymatic reaction:
The mechanism of this enzymatic reaction includes three main steps, H-abstraction, fumarate addition and thiyl radical regeneration [2]. This model used n-butane as the modeled chemical and we assumed the general n-alkane will follow similar reaction mechanism. Each reaction was treated as a sub-mechanism consisting of 3 steps, reactant complex (RC) formation, transition state (TS) crossing and product separation. The following are the rate constants involved in the sub-mechanism
 
The H-abstraction step (1) are modelled as,
The fumarate addition step (2) are modelled as,
The thiyl radical regeneration step (3) are modelled as,
Assume
(1)   The system is in a closed homogeneous batch reactor with infinite capacity
(2)   The reaction proceeds until final alkane concentration is negligible
(3)   Each step of the mechanism follows the Law of mass action
The reaction rates of each component are modelled as a system of ODE
Assume pseudo-steady state for the enzyme and intermediates, such that
Figure 3. Alkane degradation rate catalyzed by alkylsuccinate synthase
 
Discussion
From this ASS enzymatic model, we obtained specific pseudo rate constant with respect to alkane equals to 2.48 X 10-5s-1
while we noticed that hexane reaction flux in shewanella is 6.04 X 10-7 mmol/gDW-h
from the FBA model.The slower prediction in the FBA model might due to limited transport rate of large alkane molecule into the cell.
Assume in 1 L batch reactor and general cell density for one unit of OD600 is 0.3 gDW/L, the hexane uptake rate is estimated to be by the following"
NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,". Although only a few labs pay poor attention to biosafety, it could still probably cause serious biosafety problems.
After the investigation, we organized many activities to get researcher pay more attention to biosafety. Meanwhile, we were also considering whether our project needed a design to avoid the potential risks of our 'controller cells'.
In order to get professional opinions on our biosafety considerations, we had a dialogue with the experts in this field, Jun Feng. After introducing our investigation and consideration of biosafety, Jun Feng gave us highly appreciation. Also he proposed some suggestions on how to construct a biosafety system.
From the dialogue, we know that traditional metabolic auxotrophy strains are hampered by the potential for inadvertent complementation by cross-feeding or by the presence of the metabolite in heterogenous environments, and synthetic auxotrophy systems rely on extensive genome-wide engineering that may be impractical for many industrial production and biotherapeutic microbes.
An alternative approach to biocontainment is to use gene circuits to maintain essential gene expression or block toxin gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions. Upon loss of the biocontainment signal, the circuit blocks essential gene expression or induces toxin gene expression to kill the cell.
After the discussion with Jun Feng, we read plenty of literature about biosafety system design. Finally, we designed a biocontainment system for our AI-2 Controller.
CRISPR/Cas9 method was used to insert mf-Lon tag into 5 essential genes

In conclusion, people thing that synthetic biology have a lot of application field but think that synthetic biology can solve fewer problems than it could in the future.
Then, we have asked some questions about GMO their uses. The problem in France is that GMO have become a kind of swear word because of communication on this subject. Most of people are against them as you can see on the following graph.
Making the street interviews, we realized that people don’t even know what is it exactly, and for them GMO are just plant and “something chemical made in laboratory”. However more and more people realized than the used of GMO depends on the situation that means the modification made, the use, etc. To see how far people are against GMO we have asked a series of three questions. The answers are presented in the following graph.
With these questions we can see that people don’t really know if it’s dangerous are not to eat GMO but almost every is agree to say that foods which come from farming using pesticides is. We can also conclude that people prefer eat GMO than pesticides. Some of then tell us that: “None of the both is healthy to eat. We currently don’t know the toxicity of GMO contrary to the pesticides that doesn’t means that side effects of GMO don’t exist”. And we can also see some person which can prefer don’t eat anything saying that: “With some efforts and time, we can make 100% natural!”.  To finish, we show some example of applications asking if people know this application and if they  agree with this use.
After discover some examples of applications most of people are agree with their use as you can the on the three previous graph. Most of then tell us that they were surprise by this examples because they didn’t know but they think that we should be very careful with the human health and the protection of the environment.  One answer that really shocks us is: “I’m dreaming of a day where we have found biological pesticides, harmless for Human life and targeting better pest.”  That shows the lack of scientific knowledge on synthetic biology of general public and why is it so important to popularize it and communicate about sciences!

It is possible because the reactant may be a complex, such as complex of LacI tetramer and plasmid with promoter LacI (we call it pLacI:LacI4 below). Only the products of the replication reaction will be repressed with a certain rate. In this example, pLacI:LacI4 would not be repressed since it is not among the products of its replication. Via MoDeL language, we design a template reaction with no reactants, two modifiers and one product. The two modifiers are template species containing a certain plasmid backbone (say pSB1A3), and binding state is allowed for both. The product is also a template species containing pSB1A3, however, it has only one chain and no binding is permitted. Hence, modifiers have Chain-Node structure ANY--pSB1A3--ANY, while product has its structure ANYUB--pSB1A3--ANYUB. The listOfTransferTable makes parts transfer from part ANY of either modifier to its corresponding part ANYUB of the product. The reaction rate is <math>-k_{g}C_{mod1}C_{mod2}/C_{max}</math>, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the same as that defined in the replication reaction, <math>C_{max}</math> is the max concentration of plasmids containing pSB1A3 as backbone, and <math>C_{mod1}</math>, <math>C_{mod2}</math> are concentrations of modifier1 and modifier2, respectively. The negative sign in the rate law indicates a repressed effect to the replication of the product.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Biosensor#PromoterCharacterization_-_-_TEXT.html," between -10 and -35 region of promoter PmerT was constructed by degenerate primers. The resulting PCR fragments, each potentially contained one or more random mutation sites at a restricted location.
The merTPCAD (PmerT) variants library was screened and primarily characterized in 96-well plates and the performance of each individual construct was compared with that of the merT wild-type promoter.
Fig. 7 Result of secondary screen. Characterization of semiconserved region variants was performed in 96-well plates after induction with a mercury concentration gradient of 10^-7M, 10^-6M, 10^-5M for 2 hours. Wild typr PmerT promoter is marked by dotted red box and an arrow. Obviously, some mutants indeed have different response behavior compared with the wild type, for example, higher threshold.
Then secondary characterization of the best performing candidates in primary characterization was then performed in 96-well plates by induction of mercury concentration gradient of 10^-5M, 10^-6M and 10^-7M for 2 hours, followed by recording GFP intensity of each well by Microplate Reader. The result of secondary characterization showed Fig. 7.
Fig. 8 Dose response curves of each final mutants. The fitting result was shown by a solid line. Promoter sequences were shown in Table 1. Corresponding graph data were presented in Table 2.
Table 1 Sequences of wild type promoter and its mutants. The MerR binding sequence is lined. The mutational sites are in red.
Table 2 The parameters of  Hill function* fitting.
Among all these candidates, mutant1, 3, 25, 44, 85, 88 (also shown in Fig 3) were selected for the final careful characterization (Fig 8) during which a higher concentration resolution was exploited. Then the dose-response curves were fitted by Hill function (Table 2.)
It can be observed that mutations at the semiconserved region of PmerT promoter significantly influenced the response behavior of MerR/PmerT pair. It is probably because that the mutations alter the binding affinity between MerR and PmerT promoter, which can also be deduced from Table 1. As a result of this, different sensitivity (higher or lower than the wild-type) PmerT promoters were gained by us (Table 1 and Table 2).
In summary, After initially characterizing the dose-time response manner of MerR based reporter system, we constructed a saturated mutagenesis library at MerR binding site, a dyad sequence between"

The observed halos of the BL21 strain with the library and the reference strain had the same size in the negative control where H2Odd was used instead of an attractant. Therefore, every attractant triggered a chemotactic effect in BL21 cells holding the mutagenesis library. After the third round of selection, the fastest clones were identified and their plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced.
Fig. 2B: Exemplary pictures depicting the third round of selection of the first approach of the library selection assay In this figure, exemplary pictures of the third round of selection of the first approach, thus the first thawed cryostock of the library, are shown. In the next step (see figure 2A), the fastest colony again was cut out three times, incubated and plated on LB-agar plates containing chloramphenicol. The plasmid DNA of 2-4 clones for each attractant was extracted and sequenced. In each of the shown pictures, the clones containing the library were faster than the reference strain except for the negative control containing H2Odd in the Whatman paper. Here, the same swimming behavior could be observed. The swimming movement of the cells did not seem to be directed, because the halos had a round shape. Thus, no chemotaxis could be observed. In general, the different attractants caused a differently strong swimming behavior; e.g. the attractant caffeine always led to big halos, whereas the halos related to geraniol were smaller. Ref.: Reference strain (BL21 with pSB1C3_J23100_tar_QC).
Fig. 2C: Swimming behavior of selected clones versus retransformed clonesThe plasmid DNA was extracted from the clones that had resulted from the selection library and was transformed into fresh BL21 cells. The fresh BL21 should indicate, whether the before observed swimming behavior was dependent on the mutagenized receptor or the cells themselves. The cultures and 0.3 % tryptone swimming agar plates were prepared as described in the methods section. The halos produced by the selected clones were always bigger than the halos of the retransformed clones. In many cases even the reference strain showed a faster swimming movement than the retransformed BL21 clones. S. clones: Clones, selected through the mutation library. Retrafos: Clones, transformed with the extracted plasmids of the selected clones.

After the lesson, we had some time to talk to the teacher and he confronted us with a very interesting question: “How do you explain to a blind student how a flame looks and behaves like?”
This is a very difficult task because they, of course, can neither touch the flame nor hear it. Tobias Mahnke showed us how they solved this problem. With a kind of heat formable piece of paper, he is able to emulate the shape of a flame and now the students can feel where the hottest position is.
We were impressed by the different methods of teaching students with visual impairment and could learn many techniques to prepare their visit to our lab. In general, we thought back to our chemistry lessons in school and wished that our teachers also used a variety of methods and not the only visualization by sketches. It would have been a lot easier to imagine and understand the configuration of molecules and other complex topics.
It would be a big win for everyone if there could be more communication and exchange between schools teaching students with special needs and regular schools because both could benefit from each other and learn a lot, as we did during our human practices project.

Excerpt: Study Perspective for the Visually Impaired.
Governments throughout the world can no longer overlook the hundreds of millions of people with disabilities who are denied access to health, rehabilitation, support, education and employment, and never get the chance to shine.
— Stephen Hawking —
With the knowledge from our Open Laboratory Days we knew that most experiments could be adapted to remove barriers, the next logical step for us was to find out why there weren't more disabled students at our departments. What was the university politics regarding equal access to education and how were they implemented? Our university has an office of disability issues which is also responsible for blind and partially sighted students. That was the first address for us to get answers. Contacting them was easy and already in the return e-mail, it turned out that they were eager to hear about our project and the planned cooperation with the Carl-Strehl-School.
We met with them in a relaxed setting and got to ask as well as informing them that, actually, we were neither the first iGEM Team in Marburg, nor the first one to collaborate with the School for the blind and visually impaired.

I found my first design which works for 5 parts today using a pretty simple algorithm!  Now I am working on determining if this algorithm scales properly.  For five parts it uses 11 invertases which is certianly not optimized.  The following is my 5 part design:
Five Part Design
I5 I11 I1 A I6 I2 I6' B I7 I1' I11 I3 I7' C I8 I2' I10 I4 I8' D I9 I3' I9' E I4' I10 I5'
I hope that now I can begin to understand why this works.  The design is a mix of two of my previously defined categories of designs.  It mostly uses reconfigurable sites, but it also has two symmetric preemptive flipped invertases, namely I10 and I11.  I will explain this algorithm in more detail, hopefully tomorrow.
6/16/11
- Today I adjusted the architecture of my checking tool in order to speed up its computation.  To illustrate this fix, we first need to look at how each permutation is generated.  The current permutation algorithm spits out the following, for a set of elements {1,2,3,4}.
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 4
1 2 4 3
1 3
........etc
Before implementing a simple fix, the program originally tested every single one of these test vectors.  However, let's say that we know that when the input vector 1,2 is passed, invertase 2 cannot be added.  Thus, {1,2,3}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,4}, {1,2,4,3} should all be skipped since none of them can produce any new and useful information.  Originally my program did not skip these test vectors, however, now it does.  By making this fix, I am able to test my 5 part design with 11 invertases in less than 5 minutes.  Before implementing this fix, such a design required longer than 30 minutes of computation.
The second fix I am working on is developing a hash table where each key is the"

We then analyzed YFP cell surface expression using an Ice Nucleation Protein-YFP biobrick created by Edinburgh team in 2011 ( BBa_K523013 ). The microscopy images shown below in Figure 2 show sporadic expression of YFP around the outside of the cell, with sparse fluorescent dots in the middle and heavier expression on the dipoles.You can see the E. coli expressing INP linked to YFP also have an abnormal morphology in that they are elongated, most likely due to a fission defect.The  image on the left is E. coli expressing YFP externally using INP for cell surface localization at 100X magnification and the image on the right is this same image contrast normalized and zoomed in on the E. coli.
Figure 2: External Expression of YFP Using INP: Original Image 100X (left) and Contrast Normalized and Zoomed (right)
Lastly, we analyzed YFP cell surface expression using our BclA-YFP biobrick ( BBa_K1423005 ) to localize expression to the cell membrane. The microscopy seen below in Figure 3 exhibits that the expression of YFP using BclA is nearly continuous around the outside of the cell and that the cell has a normal E. colimorphology. This supports our hypothesis that BclA is a more efficient cell surface anchoring motif than INP. The image on the left is E. coli expressing YFP externally using BclA at 100X magnification and the image on the right is contrast normalized and zoomed in on the E. coli.
Figure 3: External Expression of YFP Using BclA: Original Image 100X (left) and Contrast Normalized and Zoomed (right)
It is important to address that in all three figures above, there is a heavier expression of YFP at the dipoles. This is called dipole protein aggregation and occurs in E. coli when a single protein is over-expressed. This dipole expression of YFP  is expected, so it will not have an impact on our agglutination assay because the protein is still successfully extracellularly expressed.
Western Blot
We attempted another proof of principle experiment, in order to support the fact that BCLA causes cellular surface expression of proteins. To do this, we performed a fractionation experiment followed by a Western Blot. We were doing the fractionation to isolate the membrane bound proteins from the cytopl"

We came to the restriction enzyme MvaI. This should cut our plasmid on the right places as shown on the image below:
The MvaI restriction enzyme should cut inside both of the qPCR amplified regions (the regions between IGEM00019&IGEM00020 and IGEM0021&IGEM0022), so that only linear amplification is possible there and that interference should be eliminated.
After all this thinking we ordered the restriction enzyme and just sat back and relaxed (read: Do lots of other work).
09/09 – 13/09
Week 11: Attack of the scissors
First we checked if our RNA concentration was still high enough and intact by doing a nanodrop. The 260/280 values (2.00;1.93;1.97) were still convincing enough to conclude that our RNA is intact and we still have a good concentration to work with.
So we decided to go on with the digest. We took 30 µl of our sample and digested it with MvaI. Again, we ran some PCR’s and gels to check whether we finally got rid of our contaminating DNA.
It might not be clear on the images but all of our samples still show bands which means that our digestion-trick did not work.
The qPCR adventure ends here and we learned one very important lesson: Want to do a qPCR? Then clone it into your genome or use a low copy number plasmid!

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Human Practice#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,", BioQuant and University Press-Devisions wrote articles concerning synthetic biology, our iGEM Team and the ongoing project work. Get an impression of our Media Work here
Additionally, we made a brochure, telling about synthetic biology, iGEM and our wet lab project. These were distributed at schools and scientific meetings. It can be downloaded in english here and in german here .
Besides the contact to the press we tried to get into direct contact with people by performing the public survey and thereby informing on synthetic biology in a very personal and direct way.

The Phips the Phage Portal
Last, but not at all least, we constructed a portal on the wiki called Phips the Phage . Here we present our project and synthetic biology in general to interested people without a deep biological background-knowledge. The idea of this portal is to develop a virtual guide (Phips) who guides the public through our project and adds relevant information every time when necessary- so even pupils should be able to understand what we did during the summer.
With Phips the Phage, the iGEM wiki for the first time serves as a platform to provide background information on synthetic biology and not only the scientific details. The concept we follow with this approach is not very frequently practiced, you could call it risky, we prefer to call it bold:
We aim to integrate the information for non-scientists into the information for scientists, because we do not want to seperate the public from our research - not even from the documentation of our research. But since we know that most of the scientific details will not be understood by non-scientists, we have to provide background information. We organized the arrangement of this information in a way so that somebody who is interested in reading our project descripton, but does not understand everything at first, can directly follow the links to the Phips the Phage page and can find the information he/she needs to understand most of the scientific part. So the optimal way of using our internet portal would be from scientific information to background information and back to scientific information again - now with the chance to really understand the documentation of our project. It can not be mentioned enough: Only with a profound understanding somebody can build his/her own opinion. And this is what we want to enable"

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," al; 1993). This suggests it has a role in cadmium sequestration.
Our Bacillus spores are coated in the metallothionein by making a fusion protein with cotC a major spore coat protein, our metal sponge should locate to the spore making the cadmium bio-unavailable.
Stochastic switch
We developed a tuneable, heritable stochastic switch to stochastically control cell differention and fate. This switch encodes a heads or tails device that can be biased using two inducible promoters and by controlling the rate of degradation of the protein responsible for the switching, Hin recombinase.
In our project we used the switch to make a decision for cells to be a metal container and sequester cadmium, or continue to normal vegetative life. This cell fate decision is given based on a number of stochastic parameters. Hin Recombinase is a protein from Salmonella that is able to invert a segment of DNA between two inverted repeats of DNA (Hix sites). The Hin recombinase CDS is also included in this flipping region. This promoter's activity and direction determines the cells' fate. We carried out stochastic modelling of the system in order to fine tune it to produce a 'biased heads or tails' switch.
The unique part about our stochastic device is that it is controlled in three ways; 2 variable strength promoters (which we tested using inducible promoters Pspac and XylR), and a degradation controller sspB, and so tuning of Hin expression (and thus flipping rate) can be tightly controlled.  We have modelled this degradation control, which we believe is novel within the iGEM competition.
The following diagram shows the device either BEFORE flipping has taken place, or after the stochastic decision has determined it to be in this orientation...
Therefore the germination genes are complemented and we get bacillus cells germinating and carrying out a vegetative life cycle, whilst extra cadmium efflux channels are expressed to ensure cell survival.
The following diagram shows the device afer the stochastic decision has taken place, orienting the flipping region to the right...
Therefore extra KinA is expressed which phosphorylates the master regulator protein Spo0A, activating it and increasing sporulation rate. As well as this, the CotC-Metallothionein (smtA) fusion is expressed, which 'soaks up' cadmium and locates it to the developing spore.
We developed the following bricks associated with the stochastic switch and entered them onto the parts registry:

To physically create our constructs, we researched the DNA sequences of bacteriorhodopsin , Pex3 and PEX26 via UniProt and pre-designed our fusion constructs with the software tool „Geneious“. We ordered the synthesis of three separate parts ( Pex3 , PEX26 and Pex3 -BacR) from IDT. To ease out the process of assembling our plasmids, we used the „ Dueber Toolbox "", containing various parts such as promoters and terminators, to tailor the plasmids specific to your needs. Finally, to combine all the selected parts, we used the „Golden Gate” assembly method.
Secretion
For the peroxisome secretion in S. cerevisiae we designed fusion proteins of the v-SNARE Snc1 with different peroxisomal membrane anchors. We tested the constructs using a GUS Assay. The assays were performed using transformants of the strain BY4742.
Experimental Design
We will adapt the system of  Sagt and colleagues  to secrete the content of our modified compartments (Sagt et al, 2009) .
For the application of this system in S. cerevisiae we use a truncated version of the v-SNARE Snc1 to decorate our compartments (Figure 3.1) (Gerst et al, 1997) .
Figure 3.1 A diagram of the general domain structure of Snc1. V is a variable domain which is not important for the binding to the t-SNARE. TM is the transmembrane domain. H1 and H2 are the a-helical segments, forming the SNAREpin with the t-SNARE (Gerst et al, 1997)
To decorate the compartments with the SNARE we use a peroxisomal transmembrane protein . In our case we use the proteins Pex15 or PEX26, which were further investigated in another sub project, and fuse Snc1 to the N-terminus. We expressed these constructs of membrane anchor and Snc1 constitutively under control of the RPL18B promotor. In case of Pex15 we used a truncated version, lacking a large part of the N-terminus, only consisting of the transmembrane domain (315-383) (Figure 3.1). For PEX26 we use the truncated version published in Halbach et al. (Halbach et"

Lab Pats First Interlab Meeting (10/05/2017)
The Cadets2Vets team had a Skype call with Dallas McDonald from the Lab Pats (AFRL) team. Our teams had Skype’d previously during the summer and we wanted to talk a little more about the Interlab Measurement Study.
We are sharing the results from our Interlab Study and wanted to see if Lab Pats had measured data that was similar to ours. Cadets2Vets had graphed the fluorescence values from the 6 Devices and positive and negative controls, and found that the Devices all had variable performance, although there were a few Devices that had very low GFP fluorescence. We also found that some Devices performed at or below the LB+Chloramphenicol blank, which means that the previously known autofluorescence of LB was being picked up by the plate reader. The Devices that performed worse than LB+Chloramphenicol are promoter/RBS sites that we would want to avoid in the future when trying to express GFP, because the amount of GFP expressed was unable to rise higher than the background autofluorescence under the given experimental conditions.
Cadets2Vets will work with Dallas to establish a collaboration where Cadets2Vets will send Dallas the plasmids we have created so that he can help us characterize the GFP fluorescence. We will base the assay off the InterLab study and we will consider these questions:
Do our plasmids produce GFP as they are expected to?
How does our plasmid compare to the Interlab positive and negative controls?
What is the appropriate density of cells and duration of growth to get significant GFP fluorescence?
Can other labs reproduce our data? ​
FOURTH INTER-TEAM MEETING (10/05/2017)

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"We performed hydrodynamics testing in Cornell's DeFrees Hydraulics Lab . We tested fishBIT at the maximum speed of the Tilting Wind-Water Tunnel, which is approximately 1 m/s. While the maximum burst speed of salmon is 4.13 m/s, this only occurs in nature when salmon swim upstream in the mating process. This maximum speed is never observed in salmon in net pens because the tight living conditions prevent salmon from reaching very high speeds. Thus testing fishBIT at 1 m/s is indicative of the conditions that salmon using fishBIT will be living in.
The main purpose of hydrodynamics testing was to see how well water at high speeds is able to flow over the fish tag. Thus, an orange was used in place of salmon tissue because the purpose of the testing was mainly to observe the flow of water over the part of the tag that is exposed outside the fish’s body. FishBIT was tested in different water conditions by positioning two oranges at varying heights inside the Tilting Wind-Water Tunnel. The orange near the surface of the water represented turbulent water conditions that fishBIT would have to withstand, and the orange submerged approximately 10 cm under the surface of the water represented faster flowing water conditions. Overall fishBIT was able to handle both conditions very well - the clamp stayed in place, and the tag did not twist in a manner that would impeded the natural movements of the fish. One of the improvements that drylab is considering for the future is using a smaller clamp on our fish tag in order to have the tag maintain smooth movements in turbulent waters.
Future Testing
Stress testing - We plan on using a stress machine to apply loads to the fishBIT barb, head/tubing interface, and clamp/tubing interface, in order to find maximum load capabilities. These would be the forces under which we would expect to see any failure of the system.
Tensile strength - Cornell University offers an Instron 8500 Load Frame and data Acquisition System as well as multiple strain gauges. This would allow the estimation of the tensile strength of fishBIT, and to readjust the design or incorporate more durable materials if necessary. Alternatively, a simpler test would be to attach weights to the fishBIT. This would also provide a reasonable estimate of the tensile strength.
Safety
Animal and environmental safety guided the fishBIT and flavocide hydrogel design and development. Industry standards for salmon were used to develop the size and shape of the fish tag [2]. Cornell iGEM’s main goal was creating an efficient and localized drug delivery system that, unlike with current antibiotic treatments"

Talk at the CRI Discovery Days
We had the chance to hold a stand at the CRI DiscoveryDays. The CRI is a recently created research institute which aims at bringing interdisciplinary scientists together to tackle science in innovative and creative ways. This fair was the occasion for us to advertise Medusa to an audience ranging from undergraduates to post-docs with very different backgrounds. It was extremely gratifying to observe the attention and excitement our project sparkled, From designers to cognitive scientists, we felt that the intuitive system behind our light control system was an amazing vector to popularize synthetic biology. For two days, we were happy to welcome everyone coming to us, having amazing discussions and getting a lot of positive feedback about our work. They also gave us a room to present our Escape Game: EscapeTheLab!, which was a blast, people were very interested on how we turned teaching synthetic biology into a fun and exciting experience. They were not disappointed!

CRI iGEM ten years anniversary was an event hosted at the Center for research and interdisciplinarity to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the Paris Bettencourt iGEM team. This event reunited alumni of the teams, now based around the world in different labs and in different fields, allowing them to present what they now do. This event was also attended by iGEM founders , iGEM headquarter Staff and Committee including Randy Rettberg, Meagan Lizarazo, Drew Endy, David Sun Kong, Megan Palmer as well as other prominent researchers in the field including Tom Ellis and Karmella Haynes. This event gave us the opportunity to present our project to researchers in the field and get insight as to how best to apply our project. We were also able to reflect upon our project safety with human practice specialists and decided to further develop the safety of our printer prototype. We also met numerous alumni and researchers involved in the DIY bio community, allowing us to gain further insight about the profile and needs of community biologists.
