Purpose
        Our model aims to figure out the efficacy of the IOS system by comparing the population of B. dorsalis with and without this system. Written in NetLogo(1), a software designed for modeling complex situations, the model combines both stochastic and deterministic methods. The stochastic part of the model was used to estimate the Metarhizium Anisopliae infection by our traps, whereas the deterministic part was used to simulate natural population growth of the flies. The efficiency of our IOS system predicted by this model is further used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of our prototype.
Rules
Assumption
This model follows the assumptions listed below:
The fly influx and efflux are always the same in the orchard.
The mortality caused by naturally existing anisopliae is considered as natural death while the death caused by M.anisopliae inside the traps and its infection afterward is regarded as IOS-caused deaths
The fly population has already reached the stable stage before the start of the simulation.
Natural Condition
The fly population obeys the discrete time logistic function:
  represents the population of fruit flies at time t.
Population of next generation is proportional to that of this generation by the coefficient r.
Population reaches a stable stage regulated by the number of capacity K.
Death caused by naturally existing anisopliae is considered as a part of K.
With IOS system
The addition of our IOS system leads to greater death rate caused by M. anisopliae in our traps and . The additional term is modified from SIR epidemic model:
Male flies within the attraction radius of the methyl eugenol from trap will be attracted to the trap by a certain probability.
After being trapped, male flies will be infected by anisopliae and released later.
Infected males are prone to spread anisopliae conidia to females while mating.
Females are likely to re-mate and thus are likely to spread anisopliae conidia further.

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," is (and are) perceived as means and no more also as an end. This is the core of the technical alienation theory: technique (opposed to fundamental science) tends to alienate people, which means to use us as means for its own perpetuation. Technique was the means to achieve human goals, humans become the means for technique to achieve itself: to sum up, the alienation theory is the scenario of The Matrix.
Team discussion
The intellectual process should definitely be “we want to do that, is SynthBio a good way to succeed?” etc… But within the competition, these questions are a little bit absurd. The thing is, everyone knows that the goal of each project is (almost) always a lie: the goal of the MIT is clear: enhance synthetic biology’s technique. The goal of each team is even clearer: WIN. (Almost) Every team forces itself to find a problem that would fit a cool construction, but the real end is not the “project’s end”, the real end is to win the competition.
On the other hand, the team yet has to believe in it’s project to succeed. It has to dream a little bit. Thus, a collective chimaera is kept alive, and every team maintains the illusion that it tries to somehow “save the world”.
I agree on this point. I just want to add  that if it was a real lab research, we should have think “Is it really usefull to research a new treatment ?” even before ““we want to do that, is SynthBio a good way to succeed?”. But as it was said, it’s a competition and we have to do every part of our project at the same time (bio, modeling, ethics…). It’s a great think that iGEM is not just a biology project and I think that most of us are aware that it is not really how science works.
I partially agree. Actually, the teams’ aim is winning but for each member of a team it could also be: improving oneself skills, strengthening its resume, being a part of a team, leading one’s own project, developing one’s network…
Another interesting point is the (bio)bricks system: this competition allows everyone to be a part of an unknown project, but which would be innovative and flexible.
Does the alienation critic apply to synthetic biology? This specific question can not be answered, because the terms “synthetic biology” refer to many different research activities. Nonetheless, the iGEM competition could be perceived as a dangerous path towards biotechnological alienation because its objective"
Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," This will make the diagnostic readily usable in developing countries, where whooping cough is a particular concern. Besides pertussis, this method can be used to detect the presence of any bacteria for which there exists a bacteriophage using a common pregnancy test.
Background
Limitations of Current Detection Methods
To diagnose whooping cough, doctors are currently limited to observing symptoms and detecting the causative bacteria via problematic laboratory tests: PCR, culturing, or serology. Because early symptoms are non-specific, differential diagnosis difficult. PCR is rapid and sensitive, but is highly prone to false positives, can be triggered by vaccines, and requires expensive lab equipment and expertise. Culturing from nasopharyngeal samples can achieve up to 100% specificity, but performing a culture analysis can take several days to a week, and sensitivity decreases with symptom duration. Additionally, culturing sensitivity decreases rapidly after the first two weeks of the cough. Finally, serology can be used to confirm diagnosis between 2 and 8 weeks after cough onset during suspected outbreaks, but is difficult to use for diagnosis in vaccinated and adult individuals.
Bacteriophage Basics
Bacteriophage are viruses which specifically infect bacteria, hijacking the bacteria's own replication machinery to replicate themselves. Due to host-pathogen co-evolution, bacteriophage are often extremely specific to a particular genus, species, or even strain of bacteria. They may undergo the lytic cycle, in which the genome of the bacteriophage is used to produce new bacteriophage which are released from the bacterial cell following cell death and lysis, or the lysogenic cycle, in which the bacteriophage genome replicates along with the host genome but does not produce new viruses.
Bordetella Phage
Bacteriophage BPP-1 infects the genus Bordetella, which includes the human pathogen B. pertussis and its cousin B. bronchiseptica. It normally binds to the cell-surface receptor pertactin, which is only expressed during the Bvg+ phase of the Bordetella life cycle (during which the bacteria expresses virulence and colonization factors at high levels). However, BPP-1 also possesses a diversity-generating retroelement system which allows it to switch its tropism (Liu et al., 2002) (Liu et al., 2004).
T7 Phage
T7 is a lytic phage that infects E. coli by binding to lipopolysaccharides on the host cell membrane and injecting its DNA. The T7 genome rapidly makes accommodations to replicate itself, turning"

In our project this year, we constructed different expression vectors containing our parts submitted and transformed into Bacillus subtilis , to increase the alkali-tolerance, germination rate and mineralization capacity of B.subtilis . Therefore, we conducted experiments on three aspects and the experimental characterizations of our parts are shown as follow.
THE RESPONDER: PsspB-gerAa
This part，PsspB-gerAa ( BBa_K2232020 ) mainly of the PsspB promoter followed by the first 303bp of the gerA gene, plays the role as Responder in the germination of spores.
The gerA from Baillus subtilis encodes the spore’s germinant receptor for L-alanine. Overexpression of this gene will increase markedly the rate of germination of B. subtilis spores even at low L-alanine concentration.                                 The promoter for the B.subtilis sspB gene (PsspB) is stronger than the endogenous gerA promoter, and only switch on the transcription after the initiation of sporulation.                                 Since B.subtilis exhibits accurate and efficient homologous recombination, a single cross-over event between the gerAa region in the BioBrick and the endogenous gerA sequence inserts the PsspB promoter upstream of the gerA cds, which increases the germination rate of Bacillus subtilis endospores eventually.
The part was synthesized and insert into the expression vector by restriction sites BamHI and HindIII（Fig.1）, and the correct construction of this recombinant plasmid was confirmed by PCR identification and sequencing of the PCR products.
Fig.1 Construction of the expression vector_PsspB-gerAa. The Rep_B and Kan represents replicon of B.subtilis and kanamycin resistance marker. The part PsspB-gerAa was inserted by the restriction site BamHI at 4151 bp and HindIII at 4652 bp

Wet Lab. - Leonard, James and Rhiannon tested the results of yesterdays transformation and found no colonies for our reinvigorated cells. This was concerning as it would take us another week to carry out a second reinvigoration – and so we decided to test the competency a second time. This time we would factor in the two different protocols we had used since commencing the project, and included our advisor Yanika’s cells, which are known to be competent. If one of the protocols worked for none of the cell types, we could consider the possibility that one protocol was less efficient than another. However, if it was the cell line that was incompetent, this too should be obvious.  Also Leonard and James were investigating ways to characterise the adhesive ability of Curli, and found a protocol that used water pressure between two discs to investigate shear force on Curlis. They have presented this to our supervisor Darren, and it will hopefully be possible to have the equipment made by the UCL workshop.
Modelling. Aurelija and Joanne continued working on degradation module. They managed to simulate first order enzyme kinetics on Excel . This is general degradation model that we now need to adopt to our system. Work done on degradation module today will lead to more complex degradation model that we will be specific to laccase. Once the model is finished it will be incorporated with ocean model to see the effect of degradation of laccase to plastic accumulation of micro-plastics.
Sponsorship. We are very excited as Bethan, Bouran and Aurelija got flight tickets to Munich booked!  We are looking forward attending the synthetic biology conference that will take place in Munich! http://www.cas.uni-muenchen.de/veranstaltungen/tag_synth_bio_2012/index.html

The Three-Channel Switch
Introduction
We engineered a three-channel switch that can be controlled with the intensity of blue light. Using a modified lambda (λ) repressor mechanism linked to a blue light sensor protein, we would be able to switch swiftly between the expressions of three different genes. This mechanism could provide a nearly real-time control over the chosen genes, which could advance a variety of industrial bioprocesses, speed up research projects and benefit metabolic engineering. The switch has a modular structure so the users can select the genes. This does not require any additional changes to the mechanism itself.
Features
We chose YF1 fusion protein to be the light receptor protein. The receptor autophosphorylates in darkness but in blue light, it is unphosphorylated. A phosphorylated YF1 protein acts as a kinase and activates FixJ transcription factor, which can then bind to a FixK2 promoter's binding site and activate the production of λ repressor protein CI. The kinase activity of YF1 is inversely proportional to blue light intensity and the effect is carried on to the active FixJ concentration. Thus, CI protein is not produced in bright blue light but the production increases as the blue light is dimmed down.
We used lambda repressor protein CI to regulate the genes A, B and C in the switch. Only gene A is active when there is no repressor protein CI. At medium concentrations of CI, gene A becomes deactivated and gene B is activated. At high concentrations of CI, only gene C is active. The activity and inactivity of the gene C is based on the tetracycline repressor protein that is produced with genes A and B. Gene C is active only when both genes (A and B) are inactive. The activities of genes A and B are controlled with a modified lambda repressor mechanism, which is explained thoroughly later on this page.
So, to put it all together, in blue light the switch activates gene A, in dim blue light gene B, and in darkness gene C as illustrated in .

The real challenge besides searching, collecting and combining all the right things was the communication inside the team - which is why live escape games are a great way to do team building. During this game it’s very important to inform your team mates about new objects, new items etc. so that everyone has an overview on what’s going on, what has been done and what needs to be done.
But now to the most important question: Did we make it out in time?
YES WE DID!
After 55min and 35sec our team found the right combination and held the key for the door in our hands!
In the end it wasn’t about winning though.  Most import was that we improved our communication skills, team work abilities, working  while having serious time pressure (hello wiki freeze), combination skills… and more.
Thank you Team Escape Düsseldorf!
Analytica Munich
The Analytica Munich is one of the largest trade fairs for laboratory equipment and laboratory technology. This year it was held from the 10th to 13th of April and three members of our team made the long journey to Munich. The aim was not only to get in contact with new companies and possible sponsors, but also to get in touch with other iGEM teams, as we knew in advance through social media that many iGEM teams would be on site.
Since we had already informed ourselves about the exhibitors, we first went to the companies in order to find out news about the market. Especially interesting for us were MicroPlate readers that could help us with our project, specifically in quantifying the growth of our co-cultures. We informed ourself about fluorescence measurement for the determination of the proportion of different organisms in a joint media. As a small highlight there was homemade ice made with liquid nitrogen during the break.
After the lunch break we met iGEM teams: Bielefeld-CeBiTec and Würzburg. We talked about our projects' cornerstones and were able to exchange experiences. It was exciting to see how different the respective approaches were.
In the afternoon we listened to various lectures held at multiple presentation hubs. All in all, the Analytica was a great experience which gave us a great insight into the world outside of the lab.

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile2#Results#Gibson_-_-_TEXT.html," which where true positives from false positive.
We used pSB4K5-J04450 and selected a portion of mRFP1 which would measure 100bp plus the 40bp from the overlaps. The part being in the middle of the mRFP1, that way if assemble is succesful, then you'll obtain the wild type mRFP1 making the colony visibly red.
We situated the small amplicon in such a way that if by any chance there was recircularization of the backbone, the resulting juncture would provide a helpful in-frame TAA stop codon to finish translation and evidence a false positive.
The experiment was done for 6 different concentrations of T5 exonuclease, in squareroot of 10 magnitude changes of the original T5 concentration. The concentrations were: 0X, 1/10X, 1/sqrt(10)X, 1X, sqrt(10)X and 10X T5 exonuclease.
Methods for the preparation of the experiment can be found in the protocols section.
Total count of colonies
We obtained varying amount of number of colonies, with a clear tendency to increase towards the reaction with 1X concentration of T5 exonuclease in the Master Mix.
Efficiency of reaction
When calculating the efficiency of the reaction (in terms of true positive rate) we also see an increase of true positive rate towards the reaction with 1X concentration of T5 exonuclease in the Master Mix.
Conclusion
According to the results we obtained in this experiment we conclude that according to our DNA concentration conditions (0.00125 pmoles/uL) and ratio of insert to backbone (5:1), the Gibson Assembly reaction is already optimized for small parts of 140bp.

Although METU has been participating in iGEM for 6 years now, iGEM never caught the attention it deserved, mainly because of the technical roots of our school and the fascinating engineering clubs and their projects.
 
It was time for this trend to change.

National Jamboree of turkish iGEM Teams in METU
 
We are the first turkish team to participate in iGEM. From 2007, every year we set up a team for iGEM, so we felt obliged to share our experiences with other teams from Turkey. We arranged a meeting and called all the turkish iGEM teams together ;Baskent_Meds,ITU_MOBGAM_Turkey and ATOMS Turkiye. We discussed our projects not only with the other teams but also instructors with different backgrounds to increase our horizons. In our meeting, our instructor Assoc. Prof. Dr. Mesut MUYAN evaluated all projects wetlab perspectives while Assist. Prof. Dr. Yeşim AYDIN SON evaluated the modelling aspects. With their precious contributions, we had the opportunity to improve our projects. In this meeting we also decided to repeat this event and to meet again in Istanbul as guests of ITU after our revisions were done.
 
ITU_MOBGAM_TURKEY stayed a day extra in Ankara and we decided to make that day count. We prepared a crash-course for the wet-lab sessions and made the less experienced members of their team do the work. I hope it was fun and educational for them for it was pretty fun for us.
 
 
National Jamboree of turkish iGEM Teams in ITU.
 
After nearly 2 months passed, we gathered up in İstanbul to present our projects. First we met the instructor of ITU, also an alumni of METU. After a heavy question bombardement and lots of suggestions to improve ourselves, we, METU, ITU and Başkent (sadly the ATOMS team couldn’t join us) had"

Microbe Slam at the VAAM annual conference
One of our team members had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Annual Conference 2018 of the Association for General and Applied Microbiology ( VAAM ). The VAAM consists of approximately 3500 microbiology-oriented scientists and aims to improve the exchange of information and research.
Janek presents his Microbe Slam to the VAAM community.
It was a very nice chance for our team member Janek to be part of such a big convention for the first time in his life (right picture). He got insights into how well-organized projects are constructed from the beginning to the end and was able to talk to scientists from all over the country to discuss our project and plan a successful outcome. As a lot of companies were also present on the conference, we were also able to establish supporting connections with Eppendorf and Biozym . The products provided by them will benefit us big time as our project improves further and further.

We began our weekly meetings in late February to start brainstorming ideas for out iGEM project. To accommodate all our team members in different Universities across NYC, we set up video conferencing between Weill Cornell Medical College and Yeshiva University.
Team members began pouring over the literature on everything to do with Deinococcus Radiodurans, our model organism for radioactive resistance. Through consultation with our faculty mentors and D. rad experts, we recognized that Deinococcus has three unique pathways for protecting itself against radiation: (1) regulation of cellular Mn/Fe rations, (2) oxidative damage shielding, and (3) special mechanisms of DNA repair. We chose to attack all three. By isolating the genes relevant to each one and cloning them into E. coli, we planned on conferring D. rad's extreme resistance mechanisms to E. coli.
The push to Biobrick radioresistance in the Cornell lab space began at the end of May when Jake, David, and Yossi finished up their semesters.
Attributions or the Breakdown of Labor:
David Sweet and Jake Friedman did all of the biobricking and cloning work. Jake wrote the Food Traditions article. David and Yossi went to Camp Simcha.

Braunschweig,2013,Team:Braunschweig#Project#Appoach_-_-_TEXT.html,"ometry the idea of the first cloning strategy was to include different fluorescence markers. However, with the equipment available we were not able detect three different fluorescence markers at the same time due to their excitation and emmission spectra. Hence, we modified our strategy to use chromoproteins designed by the iGEM Uppsala team 2011 instead, since most of these colors fluoresce and are all visible to the naked eye. The respective cloning strategy is shown below. We were not able to analyse single cells via flow cytometry as cells expressing the chromoproteins built clusters. However, by plating the cultures and counting colonies we were still able to analyse the composition.
Having severe trouble with the cloning of the Lux-system for a long time we were forced to change our system to two strains depending on the Las and Rhl system.
All experiments with the final gene constructs are carried out with only these two strains. In order to verify the function of each operational unit of our constructed devices we run tests on promotor induction and leakyness, synthesis of autoinducer molecules using reporter strains and dependency of the strains in batch as well as in continuous culture.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

After all the hard work of reading documents, we searched out the following anaerobic promoters that might be better than Promoter nir B: Nark, fdeF, J6 oxygen promoter, puc promoter, VHb promoter, mNark, phTERT, and pfdhF.  We hope to identify through experiments whether the property of these promoters is better than Promoter nir B when pressing the target gene we need as we expected.
Meanwhile, we found some anaerobic promoters that we think could be capable of our requirements from the iGEM official website: K239005, K239011, K376006, J61043, K283025, K376003(A), K227007, K258005, K239006, K404106, K387009, K387003, K376003(C), and K376004.  We hope we could testify all these promoters after we received the plat from iGEM.

Recently we failed to knock out the relevant genes of VNP20009 The final of concentration of arabinose we used was from 10mMol to 100mMol and the inducible time was from 1 to 4 hours. However we didn't get the mutants in salmonella.
Recently we read an article ""Use of the lambda Red recombinase system to produce recombinant prophages carrying antibiotic resistance genes"", in this article the writer used several ways to improve efficacy of recombinant,
First we should check the helper plasmid pKD46 in the first step of the method. Secondly LB agar plates containing kn were used as selective media. Initially we used 50g/ml kn. however this paper recommend that we use lower  antibiotic  concentrations  in  the  selective media. Once plated, 24 hours of incubation were enough to visualize colonies. The colonies were then transferred to new LB agar plates with higher antibiotic concentrations (kn:50 μg/ml).
7.18(B)
After several days of consideration, we began to draw out our experiment plan.
Considering that the plat from iGEM and the bacteria strains and enzymes we need are not in readiness, we decided to start with the basic experiments of PCR, extraction of plasmids and recycle of plasm"
ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#essay#adaptation_-_-_TEXT.html," points of view about complexity. It was highly interesting to explore in details different conceptions of complexity in scientific and non-scientific fields.
An interesting interview is not self-evident. It is advisable to practice the dialogue before the real interview so as to make full use of the meeting with the interviewee. Recording the interviews could provide raw material of interest.
Outreach
We managed to have diverse outreach projects targeting several population groups, from high school students to elder people.
If outreach is an interesting task in itself, it could be advisable to stick to a more strictly defined theme or topic to be more consistent. For instance, focusing on activities for a certain age group or on media outreach through television, audio and newsletter could give a coherent whole and give rise to multiple interpretations.
Literature Work
Defining a question to answer is a difficult starting point. One has to screen literature hoping to find interesting, promising hints. Being mentored in the first part could avoid a team to go into a dead end.
As many iGEM teams we were extremely busy with our project. Reading of scientific literature on the topic of human practice is probably one of the first things to be missed out. Doing a weekly journal club on human practice could broaden the horizon of all team members and allow them to discover interesting new points of view.

Safety
The concept of clean as you go was enforced in both Labs that experiments by Owligo team was conducted. A clean lab is a safe lab.
I.  Safe Project Design
This year, the Birkbeck iGEM team did not handle any organism above Risk Group1. 2 strains of E. coli were used (DH5α & 10β).  All transformantions (and subsequent transformants) were handled in a Cat 2 laminar flow hood as a precaution. None of the biobricks formed were of risk.
For conducting experiments, standard operating procedure (SOPs) were drafted. Each SOP had to be approved by supervisors/advisors. After approval, a Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) assessment was carried out. Every member of the team had to fully understandand and signed by each student which enters the lab.
Chemical Bacterial Transformation COSHH Form
Growth Curve & Culture Maintenance COSHH Form
DNA Purification COSHH Form
PCR & Molecular Biology COSHH Form
II. Avoiding Environmental Contamination
In Lab 307 (Birkbeck Main Campus, Mallet Street), liquid cultures in glassware were autoclaved & washed. Cultures in plastic disposable tubes were decanted into glass tubes and autoclaved. The plastic were autoclaved & disposed of. Pipette tips used for transferring live cultures were bleached (10% vol/vol) prior to autoclaving.
In Lab G09, glassware was soaked in virkon (30-60 minutes) prior to cleaning. In the case of disposable culture tubes, virkon was added for 30-60 minutes. Plastic tubes were rinsed & autoclaved.
III.  Extended Measures to Ensure Safety
In each of the labs, a safety induction was carried out along with the distribution of the health & safety documentation for each of the labs. Prior to access being granted, all students MUST attend each induction (insert the documents).

In biological world, when information flows through gene-regulatory networks, it may cause noise. Through the information theory, we use modeling computation and wet lab work to realize biological significance of recurring parallel designs in nature. Therefore, we combined the research theory of biology and automation. We are composed of 2 students from department of biology and 11 students from department of automation. Different from the other teams, because most of us are from department of automation, our project has a lot to do with information theory. We use the knowledge of probability theory, information theory, cybernetics, and so on to predict and verify the experiment. Not only most of our experiments verified the theory, but the predict is almost the same with our experiment result. Compared to other teams who use biological experiments to finish the actual operation and practical application, we focus on realizing the knowledge about life world, which is more like theory research. Both application and theory research are the two important keys in biological research. Our work is divided into experiment, modeling computation, human practice, web page, etc. Following is our members and works:

IIT_Delhi,2016,Team:IIT Delhi#Oscillator_-_-_TEXT.html," is to modify the Danino Oscillator so that we can tune the frequency of os- cillations. Further, we wish to use optogenetics to control this tuning. Oscillators  can be used as clock references, and thus, controlling the frequency of oscillation  would offer certain advantages. For instance, increasing the frequency might allow  faster execution of a process and vice versa. In this regard, one possible medicalapplication could be time-controlled drug delivery. If a drug is known to function  optimally if delivered at distinct regular intervals, an oscillator handling the de- livery of the drug would be an attractive option. Further, if under circumstances  quie stark from the ordinary, the rate delivery needs to be increased (decreased),  our approach could be a viable option.
We require two additions to an oscillator to realize HOTFM. A mechanism to  modulate the frequency of oscillation and an optogenetic module to act as a switch  for this mechanism.
Frequency Modulation
The Danino oscillator has a latency period where both the activator (LuxI) and  the repressor (AiiA) grow in concentration. One possible way to reduce the time  period of oscillations would be to reduce this latency period. For the Danino os- cillator, it is known that the time period and amplitude have a linear relationship  [4]; thus, we could, in principle, reduce the amplitude to reduce the latency pe- riod and increase the frequency of oscillation. We propose to do this by adding  negative autoregulation on AiiA. This transforms the amplified negative feedback  oscillator into a smolen oscillator [8]. There are additional benefits of adding  negative autoregulaation on AiiA; this makes the oscillator robust to parameter  variability [8]. If there is a sudden variation in AiiA’s concentration the negative  auto-regulation would automatically bring the concentration back down. Thus, we  expect HOTFM to have lesser peak to peak variability compared to the original  Danino oscillator. In-silico simulations confirm our intuition about HOTFM (refer  to the modelling section for a detailed analysis).
Optogenetic Module
In order to have a tunable frequency modulator, we need to have a switch that  controls the negative auto-regulaation (self-repression) on AiiA. To achieve this  end, we use optogentics as a flexible and easy mechanism. The Self-repression pathway is put under the control of lambda repressor; and this lambda repressor  controlled by the"

Human Practices
Human Practice is an important part of iGEM since it’s about visually bringing the projects outside the lab and thereby putting them in context with society and real world problems. Integration between science and the public is key for any development.
Since our team holds a special interest in ethics, we chose that as a core of our Human Practice work. We started by doing a market analysis to see the potential of our project in this area. Next, an ethics package was constructed by discussing ethical issues of our project with experts, talking to the iGEM community in webinars and by reaching out to the general public in a panel discussion and by having lectures. Out of these parts we compiled ethical guidelines for iGEM teams. Other than this our team has participated in different events to reach out to a lot of people with different backgrounds and talk about our project. These events are: OpenHack in Uppsala, Nordic iGEM Conference in Copenhagen and Global Community Bio Summit in Boston. Our team also had the chance to engage with exchange students from universities in China.
MARKET ANALYSIS
We wanted to produce compounds on the crocin pathway, but then what? Before going through with our project we wanted to make sure that we were actually doing something worthwhile, so we started off by doing a market analysis to confirm that there is a market for crocin.
With the market analysis we concluded that the compounds in the crocin pathway are very expensive, since today the only way to get them is to extract them from saffron. Saffron itself is harvested in a very labour-intensive process and Iran holds 95 % of the saffron production. This means that being able to produce the compounds synthetically could reduce the costs drastically. It’s hard to calculate exactly by how much the cost could be reduced since crocin is still very unexplored, but when comparing our project to a study done on cellulase enzymes we can estimate that a reduction of the price by 30 % might be possible and furthermore a reduction of 85 % might be possible on the industrial scale. These numbers definitely encouraged us to go ahead"
Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html,", two different fluorescent RNA constructs will be applied: The first construct is a fusion of an ATP aptamer
Sassanfar1993
and Spinach2
Strack2013
(Fig. 1B), which we will call Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system . To improve the binding of the ATP aptamer to ATP we apply our own implemented JAWS software. Using our software, nucleotides which form the stem region of the ATP aptamer can be predicted, which will improve binding properties of this RNA to ATP. The fusion of this aptamer to the Spinach2 enables us a fluorescent read out in real-time. Thus, in presence of this small molecule, the ATP aptamer will form a tight stem loop, which results in a new structural conformation of the Spinach aptamer. Finally after binding of the ATP, the Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer is able to interact with the DFHBI. Hereby fluorescence can be measured at 500 nm if the Spinach was excited at 460 nm. We will generate using our JAWS software different Spinach2-ATP-Aptamers. To validate the software as well as to identify the best Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system, we will analyze them concerning their fluorescent turn-on effect in presence of ATP.
Fig. 2. Small molecule sensing in real time (Real time SMS).
General overview of our real time SMS tool-box, which allows the monitoring of the ATP consumption during in vitro transcription reaction. For this purpose we designed a DNA template containing a promoter (T7) according to the applied RNA polymerase, RNA of interest (ROI), Hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) and Malachite Green Aptamer (MGA). If the Malachite Green Aptamer is transcribed, an increase in fluorescence can be monitored. The second part of the toolbox is a fusion of Spinach2 to an ATP-binding Aptamer, predicted by our JAWS software. In presence of ATP, the ATP Aptamer forms a stem, enabling the DFHBI dye to bind to the Spinach Aptamer thereby triggering fluorescence emission.
The second important part of the toolbox is a DNA template containing a promoter according to the applied RNA polymerase and a Malachite Green Aptamer (Fig. 1C), which is excited at 630 nm and emits at 652 nm in presents of malachite green dye. If the Malachite Green Aptamer is transcribed, an increase in fluorescence can be monitored. The second part of the toolbox allows a direct analysis"

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," A six-well transfection slide was produced containing:
The cells were then left for a day before they were imaged with a fluorescence microscope in order to observe expression of eCFP.
Figure 20. Transfection of MCF7 cells with images taken via a Zeiss CCD2 inverted microscope to detect CFP expression. Images in the left two columns are controls and have not been transfected, images in the right two columns have been transfected with M-B + CFP DNA; SNAP is a nitric oxide donor, therefore addition of SNAP was used to try and induce promoter activity.
The figure appears to show fluorescence in the mammalian cells that had been transfected with M-B + CFP compared with the cells that had not been transfected. The figure also appears to show stronger fluorescence in the cells that had been transfected with M-B + CFP and had been grown with the nitric oxide donor SNAP compared to the cells that had been transfected with M-B + CFP and grown without SNAP.
Figure 21. Transfection of MCF7 cells with images taken via a Zeiss CCD2 inverted microscope to detect CFP expression. Image shows mammalian cells transfected with M-B + CFP DNA however no SNAP (a nitric oxide donor) has been administered.
Close up image of what appears to be eCFP fluorescence from a transfected MCF7 cell.
The figure appears to show low levels of fluorescence in the cells as there are small blue circles appearing in the cells indicative of CFP expression. MCF7 cells do endogenously express endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase (ecNOS), which can produce low levels of NO. Perhaps it is endogenous NO production which is inducing the M-B promoter to express low levels of eCFP.
Figure 22 Transfection of MCF7 cells with images taken via a Zeiss CCD2 inverted microscope to detect CFP expression. Image shows mammalian cells transfected with M-B + CFP DNA where SNAP (a nitric oxide donor) has been administered.
The figure suggests that expression of CFP has occurred due to the large blue shape appearing in the centre of the image following the use of a filter to view fluorescent cyan more easily.
Future experiments are needed to confirm these results and also to provide more information.
Discussion
Through the experiments detailed above a lot of information has been collated regarding the hybrid promoters and their activity when induced with potassium nitrate. Through all figures from the fluorometer, flow cytometry and qualitative results showing fluorescence as a result of potassium nitrate induction we can conclude that the hybrid promoter"

SENTETİK BİYOLOJİ
Sentetik biyoloji terimi ilk defa 1974 yılında Polonyalı genetikçi Waclaw Szybalski tarafından kullanılmıştır. Sentetik biyoloji, mühendislik ile biyolojiyi birleştiren yeni bir teknoloji ve araştırma alanıdır. Bu alanda çalışan bilim adamları mevcut biyolojik yaşam sistemlerini inceleyerek yeni biyolojik sistemler tasarlayıp oluştururlar. Bunu yaparken de örnek alınan canlının ilgili DNA parçası tekrar tasarlanıp sekanslanır ve gelişen teknolojiyle sentezlenen bu partlar yeni canlıya aktarılır.
Sentetik biyologlar daha iyi bir üretim yapabilmek için modifiye edilecek sistemin çalışmasını ve verimini önceden tahmin edebilecek bilgisayar hesapları yaparlar.
KULLANIM ALANLARI
Sentetik biyoloji gelişme süreci içerisinde yeni biyomühendislik sistemleri oluşturarak nihai olarak gıda üretimi, enerji üretimi gibi çok önemli ihtiyaçları karşılar ve bununla beraber insan sağlığını, çevrenin güvenliğini ve korunmasını amaçlar.
EMNİYET VE ETİK
Sentetik biyolojinin kötüye kullanılmasından endişe duyan Friends of the Earth , the International Center for Technology Assessment ,the ETC Group gibi sivil örgütler bu konuda örgütlenmiştir ve bu konudaki itirazlarını bildirmiş ve mücadele etmişlerdir"

Erin Brockovich Showing
Erin Brockovich is a movie that dramatizes the true story of a woman who took on a legal battle against PG&E, accusing the power company of contaminating a community with hexavalent chromium. This movie is accessible to non-scientists and explains the importance of the problem our project targets. Showing it to an audience of Rice students provided a fantastic opportunity to engage in discussion of the status of Cr(VI) in Houston and our project.
We promoted the event with a water fountain posters campaign. The posters both advertised the movie showing and also directed people to our wiki where they could learn more about the problem of Cr(VI) contamination in Houston.
Bioethical Debate
Introduction
On June 6, 2017, the Rice iGEM team collaborated with the Rice University Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering (IBB) to host a Bioethics Debate for the participants of the Girls’ BioScience STEM Initiative. The prompt of the debate was, “Are existing scientific regulatory bodies and procedures sufficient for the regulation of synthetic biology?” The girls received various introductory reading materials about the topic before launching into the debate and were split into two teams to defend the affirmative and negative positions. From the girls’ enthusiasm and engagement in the debate, it seems that there may be some future synthetic biologists and lawyers in the bunch!
Objectives
To critically examine the ethical, moral and legal landscapes of synthetic biology.
To reflect on the benefits, potential harm, and “acceptable risks” of synthetic biology.
To assess various attitudes towards the controversies surrounding synbio applications designed to improve people's lives.
Participants
Economically disadvantaged girls attending high school in an underserved part of Houston come to Rice University each summer"

DESIGN NOTE
Drosophila Melanogaster Workshop
Drosophila melanogaster has been used for a genetic study as model organism for a long time and brought us much discovery. And we are sure  that the benefit continues from now on.
Therefore we KIT-Kyoto team aim at the production of the disease model Drosophila which expresses the responsible gene of MALT lymphoma that is one of leukemia that we were not able to achieve in a meeting of the last year. It is thought that we can contribute to elucidation of the mechanism of this disease and the development of the therapeutic drug by promoting this project.
In addition, we think about what we can do in order to continue researches using Drosophila melanogaster in the world. The structure and behavior of the gene cluster are often found by pushing forward the study about genes systematically and cooperatively.
So, this year we aim at the design of the parts with which a study that we use the Drosophila can expand in iGEM in future.
If these projects are realized, the study using D. melanogaster will step forward to the new one step again.

I am a person most comfortable when working with numbers both large and small. Computational chemistry combines the small scale atomic phenomena with the large chucks of data that are often produced. Mostly due to my background, I was the person responsible for the modeling aspects of our project and acquired access to CSC's supercomputers among other things. I presented in various presentations and taught mathematical modeling to the International Biology Olympiad team. I also participated actively in the ideation part of our project as well as went through a lot of literature regarding the fundamental building blocks of our idea, namely dermcidin, cellulose-based materials and hydrogels. I was also responsible for InterLab with Meo. More on the lab side of things, I did cellulose binding tests with nanocellulose (CNF), viscocity and preservative testing of our hydrogel along with Michał and sterilized peach pits for the final product. As part of the project, I also did a lot of background research on implants, coatings, immobilization of peptides and preservatives. I chose the preservative for our products prototype.

This is an initial indication that HGT of DNA from a cell that has undergone lysis using production of lysozyme   can in principle happen. More repeats of the experiment will be undertaken.  The overnight cultures of KO BL21 (DE3), KillerRed BL21 (DE3) and pSB1C3 RFP DH5α were used to make 4.5ml  samples at a dilution factor of 10-3,10-4 and 10-5. One set of fifteen samples   was exposed to light in the light box. A duplicate set of samples was kept   in the dark outside the light box. The temperature inside the light box was also taken. It was observed that the  temperature in the box was around 37℃, and outside was not. Repeats of the experiment will include   the dark samples being covered in foil and placed in the box with the exposed samples.  Fluorescence and OD will be taken of all dilutions before and after exposure from now on. All samples were spread plated.

SUMBAWAGEN PROJECT OVERVIEW
Background
Before taking you to the main description of our project for iGEM 2014, let us give you an introduction of our campus. Biotechnology Faculty, Sumbawa University of Technology is a new university established on May 2013 in Sumbawa Regency of West Nusa Tenggara Province of Indonesia. Located in the island of Sumbawa, the university stands as the only one university that provide Biotechnology education for eastern part of Indonesia. As the impact of the geographical position, Sumbawa receives limited access to the economic and education sector compare with the other neighboring islands especially Java.
However, the island is famous for its honey production. Therefore, taking the opportunity of participating iGEM this year, we’d like to do a project in which we can apply synthetic biology which can contribute a positive impact to Sumbawa society not only in education sectors but also in other sectors like economic and politic. That’s how we came up with the idea of ECONEY.

ECONEY is engineered E. coli that capable to measure different level of glucose concentration in honey. BBa_J04450 has a lac promoter and mRFP gene, thus E. coli harboring this plasmid will give red color when the bacteria were grown with lactose or IPTG. Oppositely, the expression of mR"

Troubleshooting
We let the gel harden too long
Our ladder is just bad

Description :
Cellulose can be synthesized by many organisms, ranging from prokaryote to animal. In prokaryotic organisms, bacterial cellulose is synthesized mainly by Gluconacetobacter, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Escherichia, Enterobacter and salmonella. In nature, only bacteria can synthesize cellulose pellicle with water-holding texture, among which the most studied bacteria are the genus Gluconacetobacter. Several common strains in the genus Gluconacetobacter can be distinguished by different representations. Bacteria that can synthesize bacterial cellulose are mainly G. Europaeus, G. intermedius, G. Oboediens, G. Nataicola, G. Sacchari and G.xylinus. Researchers have been studying the biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose in recent decades. This G.xylinus has long been recognized as a model strain. Many classical cellulose synthesis pathways and regulatory models were obtained in G.xylinus. Therefore,we choose G.xylinus as the research object in this experiment.
The biosynthesis pathway of bacterial cellulose in G.xylinus is complicated including the synthesis of cellulose precursor, polymerization of glucan monomers and assembly of glucan chains.
The biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose begins with the conversion of substrates to cellulose precursors, which are usually carbon sources, such as the conversion of glucose to uridine diphosphate glucose (udp-glucose). Uridine diphosphate glucose is the substrate of cellulose synthase, and it is catalyzed by cellulose synthase to form β-1 and 4 glucoside bonds between glucose monomers. There are specific sites on the outer membranes of the bacterial cells, which are coupled with the cellulose synthase complexes and is the spot where the polymerization is conducted [9]. When the polymerization reaction is over, the newly generated cellulose is secreted to the extracellular"

Bilkent-UNAMBG,2018,Team:Bilkent-UNAMBG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"  We listened to a talk** of Prof. Dr. İdil Arslan Alaton at Bilim Akademisi regarding the issue of wastewater treatment methods. From the talk, we were enlightened that the current treatments applied to wastewater were not 100% efficient and left some pollutants behind which in the end have the pottential to promote superbug development. Superbugs are multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains that are extremely powerful compared to wild type bacteria and can be lethal when they enter host organisms and cause infections. It is almost impossible to cure those infections caused by superbugs due to resistance via regular antibiotic treatments; which poses a very important threat even now and will give rise to bigger problems in future. Antibiotic resistance is considered to be one of the most crucial problems of our era by WHO (World Health Organization). The reason for this concern is the possibility of experiencing a chaotic scenario in which people could die because of minor infections once again just like in the pre antibiotic era. Also, as mentioned in the talk, different types of antibiotics were examined with various methods and some of these chemical treatments still left antibiotic remains in purified waste water.  Moreover, to get the best possible results from the current methods, it is required to spend lots of money, energy and time. Therefore, it was important for us to handle this issue with a different perspective that will have the potential to be more advantageous than the current methods. After determining what we aim, we decided to design a project through which we can take a step to overcome this problem.

** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgKP2FRyb6I
 
 
In order to have a general idea about the awareness level of our society on this matter, we conducted a public survey* where we ask people some questions related to their general knowledge about antibiotic use and their opinions on the concept of water contaminated with antimicrobial drugs. We shared our survey online and got around 250 answers. We have concluded from the results that the presence of antibiotics in wastewater is not known by people. However, although they do not know the exact concept of antibiotic resistance, it is thought that it will cause problems in the future. Also, we have interviewed with people about rational drug use and how conscious they are about antibiotic consumption and disposal. Here is the interview:
 
 
 
After we have consulted the society about the problem, we have focused our interest in experts and authorities in order to obtain expert opinions about the issue. Firstly"

Lesnik Scoring System
Scoring System 3 is based on the model created by Elena A Lesnik. The score is totally energy based，which includes the free energy change to form stemloop and the energy change to form RNA-DNA duplex. Here the energy of the two parts are both based on Nearest Neighborhood Rules. The minimization of the free energy change of stemloop formation will also give the secondary structure of the stemloop. Compared to d’Aubenton Carafa’s model , the model here considered the free energy of the duplex within the Transcription Elongation Complex[4]. The poly T tail is divided into three parts, including proximal part, distal part and extra part. If there are spacer, it will also be taken into account. [4]
1.Calculation of the Minimum Free Energy Change of Stemloop Formation
The calculation is the same as Scoring System2.
2.Calculation of the Energy Change to Form RNA-DNA duplex
i. Nearest Neighborhood Rules
The energy change of base pair formation is related to its neighborhood. So when calculating energy , the neighborhood should be taken into account.
ii.RNA/DNA Duplex
According to the model created by E.A Lesnik, we divide T tail into three regions, proximal region（5 nt）, distal region（4 nt） and extra region（3 nt）. If the length of T tail ( n ) is less than 12, we will just consider n nucleotides.
We will calculate the free energy change of RNA:DNA hybrid formation of the spacer (if it exists; 0 to 2 nt ) and proximal T region. We also take distal T region and extra T region into account.[4]

A man who desire to be more than a student in his 20s, who shoots commercials, does modeling before camera, and acting in TVs.                     A man who dares do all that may become a man, who dares more is none.

How does Research help to spread Synthetic Biology?
Trapped inside a labyrinth! How to get out from it?
We wanted to motivate teenagers to get into Biology and in particular into Synthetic Biology. In order to do so, we have first to teach them about this new exciting area. Our problem here was: how to reach teenagers? We could visit schools or organize activities for them, like other iGEM teams have done. But we thought that the quantity of teenagers that is possible to reach by these means is small. This motivates us to search new methods of reaching them. One was the organization of the School diffusion through teachers: the other one was the generation of this game.
Nowadays a computer in a house is a must, and children, in general, spend a lot of time using and playing with them. So, the idea of a game was ideal: teenagers like to play games way more than learning. What if we could tell them about SynBio while they are playing?
A game has the advantage of being available for a wide spectrum of people through the Internet. It can spread easily with a link, it can be posted on the forums of RPG maker games, and people that like our game can help us promote it among their friends. This way, instead of reaching a small amount of teenagers, we could reach more people, even from out of our native country, Chile. With this objective in mind, we created the game both in Spanish as in English: Spanish was necessary for our own and other Latin American countries, and English was in order to be able to be played by anyone in the world who speaks it, independently of their own native language.
Fly around the MIT!
Spreading Research
In order to make our game famous, we put the Spanish version in the Internet on our own website www.igemuc.cl. We also create an English version that was uploaded on our iGEM webpage and on disemination english webpage . Since RPG maker is a game that only works on Windows OS, we investigated and were able to create a version compatible with Mac OS in both languages.
After this we start spreading the game: we wrote about it on our facebook and twitter,"

In this column we are going to present the description,experiment and result of our project
Description & Design
Description about Esophageal Cancer
Esophageal cancer is cancer arising from the esophagus. It is the eighth most common cancer and sixth leading cause of cancer mortality in the world. Especially, nearly 90% of esophageal cancer patient are found in china. Chinese patients account for more than a half of all deaths caused by esophageal cancer worldwide. Genetic factors and bad eating habits (e.g. addiction to alcohol, addiction to tobacco, eating too fast and drinking hot liquids) can be the cause of esophageal cancer.
5-year survival rate of esophageal cancer declines sharply as stage of cancer increases. In Stage I, during which cancer cells haven’t transferred, the 5-year survival rate can reach 70%. When it comes to Stage II, this number dramatically drops under 50%. And for Stage III and IV, it is 20% and 10% respectively. Thus early diagnosis plays an important role in the treatment of esophageal cancer.
However, since the early symptoms are not significant and the methods for clinical diagnosis of esophageal cancer are expensive and inconvenient, which makes the early diagnosis become difficult. Prominent symptoms usually appear only when a patient is already in the advanced stage. Early symptoms like swallowing difficulty, pain when swallowing, reduced appetite and loss of weight are often considered a minor illness and easily ignored. The diagnosing method used in hospitals mainly depends on radiology and endoscopic biopsy, which seems to be invasive and uncomfortable. To help solve this dilemma our team aim to build a convenient and harmless method for early diagnosis of esophageal cancer.
miRNA as Potential Biomarkers
Studies have confirmed that miRNA expression is highly concordant cross individuals. And aberrant expression of miRNA may relate to diseases. Some studies have reported that specific miRNAs in tissue and plasma can be discriminatory bio-makers for detecting cancers. However, getting access to tissue of plasma means physical harm to the human body. So we turn to the easily accessible saliva. Since saliva is considered to be a terminal product of blood circulation, components like proteins and RNAs which are present in plasma are also present in saliva. In fact, both"

Plasmid with Cyp79-B1 BBa_K527002:
The plasmid with CYP79-B1 BBa_K527002 could in spite of repeated attempts not be assembled with the Standard Assembly of BioBricks. As mentioned, it was possible to assemble the plasmid with CYP79-B1 BBa_K527002 with the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard. The plasmid was proven to work by comparison with a control. The Copenhagen team managed to extract the cytochrome membrane protein, verify it by western blotting and finally show that the cytochromes could produce oximes in accordance with expected. Our assembly standard therefore prove to work excellent in bacteria.
CYP79-A2 BBa_K527001 was assembled with the Standard Assembly of BioBricks, but unfortunately the CYP79-A2 BBa_K527001 was never proven to work in accordance with the control. The lack of function could have been caused by the point mutations that were introduced in order to remove the illegal restriction sites.

BIT-China,2013,Team:BIT-China#modeling.html_-_-_TEXT.html," properties of the gene regulatory networks.
Assumption:
In this project, the simulation was performed in only a single cell.
Bacteria communicate with each other using chemical signaling molecules. The process of producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to the signaling molecules in bacteria is referred to as quorum sensing. Quorum sensing enables bacteria to obtain information from their environment and alter their behavior in a population size that is scaled in response to changes the number of bacteria present in their community. Thus, this method of intercellular communication allows populations of bacteria to work together, in contrast to the traditional unicellular view of prokaryotes.
In general, quorum-sensing bacteria produce and release signaling molecules into their environments which are called auto-inducers. The concentrations of auto-inducers increase in the bacteria environment as the bacteria population density grows. The bacteria detect the accumulation of a minimal threshold concentration of the auto-inducer and regulate their gene expression in a population-wide scale in response. As a result, using these signaling systems, all the bacteria in a community alter their behavior at the same time in response to an external signal, and therefore function similar to a multicellular organism.(indexed from Wikipedia)
Many different quorum-sensing systems have been discovered. Some of them are extremely specific for a particular species and some of them are common in all bacteria. In this work, we sought to establish a synthetic auto-inducer (AHL) signaling system.
It is assumed that AHL was produced and degraded at a certain rate to maintain a certain concentration in a single cell. That is to say the number of AHL molecules within a single cell is constant. Therefore, there is a linear relationship between the AHL molecule concentration and cell concentration. The regulating engine was started when the number of AHL molecules reaches a certain threshold, or when the number of cells reaches a certain threshold.
Fig.9 the GRN of the quorum sensing device. The right table shows the chemical reactions of the GRN.
Fig.10 stochastic simulation of the GRN in a single cell
As we could see from the simulation result in fig.10. AHL was produced and degraded at a certain rate to maintain a certain concentration in a single cell. A AHL*LuxR complex was formed once LuxR was produced. Thus the concentration of LuxR was low.
The oscillator is a synthetic biology construct composed of three genes which mutually repress each other in sequence according to a ring structure.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of an element won’t be possible when it was extracted of its natural environment to live in a synthetic environment, or an element which was reproduced in a synthetic environment, but already naturally being.
Here, it is a polemical subject because in synthetic biology, we are making “organic inventions”. So, there is a question: “Is it acceptable to be a living being’s owner?” “What about an interior component of it?” In this last case, who does the element belong to, the organism or at that one who modified it?
The relation to living and its simplification
With the emergence of synthetic biology, the definition of living may be modified. Indeed, in this field, researchers can generate or modify the genome of an existing organism, insert a whole artificial genome in an existing organism or create a new artificial organism. We can wonder if these modifications made by humans will not have an impact on the nature of the organism. Can we consider that an organism is living if it has been totally or partially created artificially? Synthetic biology regards the “objects” which are created as living beings because they are built from the cell, the basic unit of life. They have the property of self-organization and identical or similar self-replication to those of natural living beings.  So we can considerate that they are “alive”?
With these ""new"" organisms, a living being may be considered as simple and easy to create. Once decoding the DNA of a organism is understood, synthetic biology is able to do everything with a bacteria, a yeast or animals bigger, thinking that are like ""machines"". But is it ethical to consider life as a tool, which we do in the iGEM competition? What is the limit between an ethical scientific project and an unethical scientific project.
Ethical considerations about our project
All of these ethical considerations made us think about our project Cur'd Vine.
First, it is important to us that our project was related with transparency, so that uninitiated people can apprehend our scientific approach. Our Wiki, in free access on the WEB, allows us to clearly and concisely expose all the thinking steps which governed our Cur’dVine project. It also allows us to share our knowledge and results to as many people as possible. New iGEM teams or other researchers could use our results to continue our project. Furthermore, our implication in annex projects such as Cap Sciences, making street interviews about GMO's or high school presentations about synthetic biology, is a sign that we have constantly tried to democratize synthetic biology to the general public and helped us to consider the profits and risks.

b. China's biological development status and prospects
After the “11th Five-Year Plan” and “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” policies and support, China's industrial biotechnology entered a period of rapid development. The central government has invested and guided the local and enterprise funding, providing financial support for industrial biotechnology research and development and industrialization.
During the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” period, the Ministry of Science and Technology passed the precise deployment of the national “863” program, and arranged 15 projects in key areas such as advanced bio-manufacturing of major chemical products, microbial genome breeding, and industrial enzyme molecular transformation. 650 million yuan, self-raised funds of more than 2.2 billion yuan, the total funding of more than 2.8 billion yuan. The project undertakers cover a wide range of innovative entities such as enterprises, research institutes and universities, among which 62% are led by enterprises. In addition to the key breakthroughs in the implementation of core technologies in the above key areas, significant progress has been made in key technologies such as industrial biocatalysis technology, biorefinery technology, modern fermentation engineering technology, and green bioprocessing technology. At the same time, 30 major products have been developed in the field and industrialized (including 4 to 5 biological materials, 7 to 9 C 2 to C 4 chemical materials, 14 to 15 fine chemicals, 2 to 3 species). Energy products and 4 to 5 green biotechnology). The main representative results include the biochemical production of fumaric acid and its derivatives, the chemical-enzymatic method for the preparation of chiral pyrethroids in all organic solvents, the biotransformation of phytosterols to produce androstenediones, the bioasymmetric synthesis of chiral alcohols, and the genome. Rational design promotes the upgrading of the amino acid industry, the biosynthesis of biopolymer materials and the efficient biosynthesis of succinic acid.
Through a large number of national key laboratories, engineering technology research centers, industrial technology innovation strategic alliances and industrial bases, the industry, research and research resources of the industrial biotechnology industry have been optimized and integrated, significantly improving the industry's independent innovation capability and international competitiveness.
For example, Tianjin Industrial Biotechnology Research Institute is the first in the world to realize the full bio-production of L-alanine and industrialization. The production cost and energy consumption are"

Nitroreductase activity assay: Overnight liquid cultures of nitroreductase strains were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 mins to pellet the cells. The cells were then resuspended in 250 ul PBS and 1 ul DTT to ensure that cellular proteins are not oxidized. The solution was sonicated 6* (10 s sonication+20 s rest). The supernatant was separated from the pellet by centrifugation and used for the NADH-dependent nitroreductase activity assay.
To assess background activity NADH (5 ul) and bacterial supernatant (5 ul) were added to 0.8 ml PBS and mixed. OD340 was measured for 1 minute. DNBA(5 ul) was added to the same cuvette to start the reaction and change in OD340 was monitored for 1 minute. DMSO(5 ul) was used a control (DNBA is dissolved in DMSO)

The Cu promoter was replaced by the BAD promoter.
wednesday 13th of July
Minipreparations of the 17 biobricks were performed according to the protocol of the kit (promega miniprep kit) (FIG.1) .
thursday 14th of July
New cultures for minipreparations were prepared since the DNA con- centrations of the previous miniprep were too low to go on with restric- tion. A new transformation of the competent cells was performed: luxI BBa C0261 (this will be our new luxI instead of Bba C0061 which we transformed more early).
friday 15th of July
6ml cultures were miniprepped and after DNA gel electrophoresis the concentration of the different biobricks was estimated. The DNA con- centrations were higher than the first miniprep and suffcient to proceed with restriction. (FIG.2)
monday 18th of July
A restriction digest of the miniprepped biobricks was performed. 500ng of DNA was used for most biobricks, except for those which still had low concentration (a maximum volume of 15µl DNA in a total volume of 20µl was used here). Biobricks A, B, G, H1 (XbaI and PstI), H2 (EcoRI and SpeI), 31 (XbaI and PstI) and 32 (EcoRI and SpeI) were succesfully cut by the restriction enzymes (FIG.3) and gel purified.  Transformation of a constitutive promoter (Bba J23119) was performed.
tuesday 19th of July
DNA gel electrophoresis of the purified DNA fragments was performed and showed there was no DNA left at all. This means we have to do the restriction digest again.
Since one of the biobricks (CI repressor BBa R0051) miniprepped be- fore has never shown any measurable concentrations, we decided to do this transformation again.
wednesday 20th of July
A new restriction digest was performed (FIG.4) . Restriction purification of the DNA fragments didn't result in measurable DNA concentrations.

Our Events
MEET UP in Wageningen
At the end of June, our team was on the road to Wageningen. The aim of this meeting was first to have a good time together but also to meet other iGEM teams from Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. It was a great opportunity to share about science with other students coming from abroad. We had the pleasure to present BactaSun in front of those iGEM groups. Indeed, what would be science without sharing it? At the end of the day we came back to Belgium with a lot of interesting ideas about our project and much more energy to do it properly.
""Café conférence""
We noticed that synthetic biology is not yet a common topic among students.  In order to explain our project in front of a large audience and at the same time present what synthetic biology actually consists in, we decided to schedule a conference. We collaborated with ""Café Numérique"". The concept was to follow the presentation and then participate in a debate about artificial nature with a good Belgian beer in your hands. We started the conference with the presentation of our iGEM project and then we had the pleasure to discuss with Gauthier Chapelle. He is a scientist who worked as scientist officer for the International Polar Foundation, he promoted Biomimicry in Europe and is now a co-founder of a sustainability consultancy firm. Moreover, we were pleased to host Dr. Philippe Gabant, a specialist in molecular biology and founder of a biotech company in synthetic biology called Syngulon.
""Printemps des Sciences 2018""
Printemps des Sciences 2018 (Literal translation « Science Springtime »). This event is co-organized by all the universities of Wallonia, the UCL among them. It is a public meeting for all the science fans! It will be a good opportunity for us to explain what synthetic biology consists in as well as introducing the iGEM competition.  We will share our experiences in the lab and at the Jamboree in Boston. In this way, it could drawing the"
