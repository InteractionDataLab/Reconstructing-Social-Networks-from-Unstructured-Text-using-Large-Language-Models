Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic"

For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute any escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, whether the escape happened accidentally or intentionally. We used two environment factors to monitor the bacteria’s situation: temperature and population density, thet are both high and tunable in the fermenter, so our device will initiate when temperature and density are both low. We used thermal sensitive regulator (NUS iGEM2017)(Piraner et al.) and quorum sensing regulator (MIT iGEM2004) (Canton et al.)as our sensor, with sRNA(Storz et al.) and tetR family repressor PhlF(Glasgow iGEM2015)(Stanton et al.) as the signal inverter. We added an integrase (Peking iGEM2017) controlled by the thermal sensitive regulator which will enable the promoter of a lethal gene to potentially express when temperature rise in the fermenter so that bacteria can survive at the very beginning. Also, we built a model to stimulate the minimum autoinducer required at the beginning of the fermentation, same as the purpose of integrase. This model is for keeping bacteria alive at the very beginning of fermentation. Together they form a NOR gate that will lead to cell death through genome degradation when both temperature and density decrease.
For Therapy
The second device we build is for therapeutic bacteria. The device can carry out noninvasive tracing through ultrasound imaging of the gas vesicle(Shapiro et al.), release the drug (from SHSBNU 2017) controlled by a thermosensitive regulator at nidus by ultrasound tissue heating, and heat to a higher temperature to release nuclease and kill the bacteria after it finishes its mission.
For Metabolic Stress
We applied capacity monitor (Ceroni et al.) to quantify the expression burden of all our systems, and to reduce the metabolic stress, we designed another device for fermentation which used a LuxR repressive promoter (Peking iGEM2011) and cold-regulated 5’UTR region (Ionis Paris 2017). This device only involves one transcriptional regulator, which will be less energy consuming.
DIY bio and Biosafey
Back to the growing and glowing synthetic biology community, despite the current majority doing it on campus, more and more people are starting it at home, and they call themselves Genehacker or DIY biologists. The lack of sufficient training and efficient surveillance will be a time bomb for which we do know that monstrous harmful bioproducts will be made someday in the future,"

The diesel hydrotreater at Chevron Burnaby treats 18000 barrels of diesel fuel every day, removing 99.5% of the sulfur and taking it from around 500 ppm to less than 15 ppm sulfur at a cost of about $2 per barrel.
Sulfur content in fuel is regulated by governments because sulfur-containing fuels lead to acid rain. As time has gone on, the permitted sulfur content has decreased. The kinetics of conventional hydrotreatment cause the cost of treating 100 ppm sulfur fuel down to 15 ppm to require more extreme process conditions and thus be substantially more expensive than treating 500 ppm sulfur fuel to 100 ppm.
From our correspondence with AITF-OSLI, we learned:
In Alberta, upgrading and refining processes aim to reduce viscosity and desulfurize crude oil to facilitate transport by pipeline.
Presently, the industry does not possess infrastructure for the utilization of biological systems such as bioreactors or emulsifiers. However, this is an area of interest for them and could be implemented in a time span of approximately 5 years. There is also an interest in screening tailings ponds for new organisms or genes encoding parts capable of refining crude oil.
Our AITF and OSLI collaborators are currently looking into the economic and environmental costs of refining oil, as well as our project's potential impact on industry and applications other than desulfurization. They will get in touch with us within a few weeks once they have this information.
Biocatalytic desulfurization of dibenzothiophene: Hypothetical Bioreactor Design After talking with our industrial collaborators we had a good idea about what the industry was looking for in terms of bio-desulfurization. The next step was to devise a hypothetical design for a small scale bio-desulfurization plant. The general schematic of this plant can be found below (Diagram 1):

PRESENTATION
WHO
Before packing for Boston, we presented our project four times to members of the scientific community and the general public. During these occasions, we were excited to discuss what we were doing, what synthetic biology was really about, and even answered an hour and a half of questions at one such event!
HACKUARIUM
Hackuarium is a DIY biology lab, open to the community, in Renens, VD, Switzerland. Hackuarium’s stated mission is to “bring biology (and biologists) to the world, and the real world back to biology.” Central to Hackuarium’s philosophy are reducing the cost of biological research, spreading public understanding of biology in the modern age, and having an open discussion about the ethics and feasibility of research.                             You can learn more about them here
On Wednesday nights, they are open to the public, and people with all sorts of science projects can present their work.
Dialogues
Below are some of the most interesting questions that we had after our talk, although we answered an hour and a half of them!
""Biological systems are not binary, so why not did you choose to use a system that makes logical switches using Boolean (or binary) logic?""
Although biology is not binary, transcriptional states are! Of course, there are complexities to this system. We have three different chromatin states (active, repressed, and poised), and splicing mechanisms increase the number of outputs that an actively transcribed gene can have. When it comes to whether or not a given region of DNA is being transcribed, and what the effect of this transcription will be on the next part of the circuit, we consider that there are only two states: either the output is high enough to induce a change in the next part of the circuit, or it is not.
""How fast is this system? Are we talking microseconds, seconds""
Not so quick! These systems will work over hours to days. Speed here is limited by the speed of transcription and translation in these systems, which will be limited by many factors, including how healthy the cells are, whether the codons are optimized for the system, and the actual size of the desired transcripts and proteins.
""What are the ethical challenges regarding iGEM projects?""
In iGEM we are encouraged to explore the ethical challenges that surround our topics, and model our project around these challenges. In addition, we have to fill out various safety forms to ensure that we are not working with material that could"
Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," but we didn't think we were safe quite yet. We used steam distillation (and conventional distillation too) to isolate terpenes from pine tree resin, and analyzed the distillate using GC/MS. We also performed experiments to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of the distillate (which was essentially home-made turpentine), as well as other terpenes. We carried out both solid and liquid media inhibition studies and can confidently claim that our bacteria, E. coli, would be able to survive terpene-heavy conditions.
Distillation
The terpenes in pine tree resin have high boiling points (150C - 200C), and simply distilling them would cause decomposition of the terpenes into other compounds. This is problematic because we'd be left with the following question: are we testing the inhibition of pine tree resin terpenes, or the products of terpene decomposition?
Although we DID use conventional distillation and obtained a terpenic extract, we also applied a ""softer"" distillation method to avoid potential decomposition. Terpenes are insoluble in water, and a mixture of the two (with far more water than terpenes) will boil at a temperature slightly lower than 100C. This can be rationalized using Dalton's law of partial pressures, but we will simply provide a crude explanation and say ""the gaseous water molecules are pulling out with them gaseous molecules of terpenes as well"". After collecting the distillate from this procedure (which is actually a mixture of clear water with a thin film of terpenic extract floating on top), the organic layer is extracted out and used for analysis!

Ashlee picked 12 colonies from the dCas9-Plasmid 1 ligation for overnight.
Designed new Reverse inverse PCR primer and put it into the cart to order.
Sunday, July 13, 2014
Ashlee plasmid prepped the 12 dCas9-Plasmid 1 colonies and digested them with AclI and EcoRI-HF. These two restriction sites are only present in the dCas9 system, and so only successful ligations will result in two bands on a gel. Any self-ligations should result with only one band on a gel.

Ashlee ran the dCas9-Plasmid 1 digestions on a gel to confirm that dCas9 was inserted. We were expecting bands around 8 kb and 1 kb, but instead all 12 colonies showed bands around 8 kb and 3 kb. This is very odd, and we are hoping that there is some other restriction site that is not reflected on our plasmid map or the backbone is larger than we originally thought, as plasmid maps are often inaccurate. We talked with Dr. Salis and he advised us to proceed and digest the plasmid with the restriction enzymes we will use to excise the cassette containing dCas9, run an analytical gel to determine whether our cassette is the right size, and then attempt homologous recombination in P. putida. We digested the plasmid with AvrII and PacI. We will send 7 colonies for sequencing tomorrow. Ashlee and Emily edited the presentation for Center for Science and the Schools.
Investigated method of using PCR assembly to create a strand of ds DNA containing the dRBS. This method requires a long top strand and a primer, which would be used in PCR to create the ds DNA. Problem is that the top strand is longer than 50 bp and very expensive. Designs are completed, but tentative decision reached to stick with the annealed oligos method unless it proves to be difficult.

Expression Burden
In synthetic biology, a common issue in integrating exogenous sequences into host cells is that heterologous gene expression can cause significant metabolic burden. Typically, this gene expression burden is implied by a declining growth rate of bacteria, which is unfavorable for fermentation industry because it lowers yields and profits. According to Ceroni et al. (2015), a fluorescence-based method allows to measure gene expression capacity of cells, by inserting a “capacity monitor”.
Capacity Monitor
The “Capacity Monitor” consists of a superfold GFP with a strong constitutive promoter, which is constantly expressed in the bacterial genome. Thus, any alternation in fluorescence intensity can reflect in overall resource availability in the cell. Particularly, with expression of synthesized genes, the expression of GFP will decrease, thus reporting a reallocation of cellular resources.
VioABDE
After applying capacity monitor, we compared the fluorescence of E. coli with an empty vector and E. coli with VioABDE inserted and expressed. Both strains were incubated for 24 hours with fluorescence and OD constantly monitored. However, the OD of bacteria with VioABDE increased faster than the bacteria without Vio expression, which contradicts our initial expectation.
We co transformed the TlpA39-VioABDE into the capcatiy monitor component cell which was made by beyotime component cell kit.
Then the Capacity Monitor and Capacity Monitor-Vio were incubicated in microshaker in 39 degree Celsius, then they were added to the 96 well plates.
""
Alternative Device
Since we target to modify bacteria used in fermentation industry, which primarily are used for material synthesis and production, our sequence inserts should occupy as limited resources in bacteria as possible to avoid significant expression burden. In order to reduce this expression stress, we designed another device for fermentation which used a LuxR repressive promoter (Peking-S, 2011) and the “Cold Box” in 5’UTR region of CspA (Ionis Paris, 2017). With only one transcriptional regulator, less energy will be consumed, which is beneficial for fermentation industry.

The NEB Iq E. coli cell line transformed with the sigma 70-BTE generator produced 125uM free fatty acid compared to the negative control sigma 70-red fluorescent protein (50uM) and the media only control (40uM). Bay Laurel Thioesterase transformed into NEB 10 β cells showed a positive increase of 115uM of fatty acids compared to negative controls of 40uM and 70uM. Based on this data we can produce up to 2.5 fold more free fatty acids with cell lines producing the Bay Laurel Thioesterase then without.
Preliminary tests for fatty acid length showed C-12 in the Bay Laurel Thioesterase transformed cells, but more chromatography test need to be done in order to confirm the production of C-12 and C-14 medium chained fatty acids.
Production of Ethanol as a Biofuel
Pyruvate Decarboxylase and Alcohol Dehydrogenase Cloning Strategy In order to produce ethanol efficiently in E. coli, is was necessary to transform E. coli with both the pyruvate decarboxylase gene to produce an acetaldehyde intermediate, and an alcohol dehydrogenase gene that will take acetaldehyde and convert it to ethanol. The Nevada team designed and synthesized an operon without a promoter (intermediate part k558000) containing pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase coding regions along with a standard E. coli ribosome binding site and double terminator (BBa_B0014). The pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) coding region sequences were based on the Zymomonas mobilis sequences (Ingram et. al. 1987) and work conducted by UNIPV-Pavia (iGEM 2009 Part K173016; K173017) and Utah State (iGEM 2009 M11041; M11042). The goal was to express this pdc/adh operon under the control of the constitutive promoter sigma70 (iGEM part J23101), or a glucose insensitive inducible promoter, trc (see details below) and test for expression of functional genes.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge.
On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.
In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
Stemming from research from the University of Virginia and EMBO, the J. Craig Venter Policy Center Team has concluded that the United States lack an agency that specifically focuses on enforcing laws regarding GMMs. Instead, there is legislation such as the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology and the President's Commission for studying Bio-ethical issues, which was established by Barack Obama. As of now, the regulatory agency with the most regulatory control on issues regarding synthetic biology is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
In accordance with Foods and Drugs Act, Health Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada are the administrative branches responsible for the regulation of products derived from biotechnology. Health Canada’s role is to enforce standards for safety and nutritional quality of all foods sold in Canada. It works under the Foods and Drugs Act. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) role is to minimize diseases and other public health hazards that could potentially be caused by the food supply system. Fisheries and Oceans Canada role is to regulate Canadian fisheries, oceans and freshwater resources. This joint effort helps ensure that informed decisions regarding GMMs by pooling the expertise and considerations of each agency together.
European Commission is the institution responsible for proposing and implementing legislations applying to all member countries. Member countries may additionally restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMMs in their territory. This possibility, however, is regulated by Directive (EU) 2015/412 adopted by the EU.
In Australia, the use of GMMs is regulated under a nationwide legislative framework consisting of two main branches: the Gene Technology Regulator and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Individual states and territories also have their own legislation in accordance with this framework.

Though, current approaches to this end rely on genetic knockouts and as such are difficult to precisely control from the perspective of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  Our intention is to create a more dynamic system to vary antenna size that is dependent on incidental light intensity and that can be readily optimized using synthetic biology principles.  This system should result in the bacteria at the exterior of the bioreactor expressing fewer light harvesting antenna proteins than the cells at the interior, reducing NPQ while maintaining a high absorbance of incidental photons.
We will focus on altering the quantity of the Light Harvesting Complex 2 (LH2) by regulating the pucB/A genes that code for the two subunits of the complex.  LH2 absorbs photons maximally at the wavelength of 842 nm and funnels its energy to LH1 and the reaction center.  The ratio of LH2 complexes to LH1 naturally ranges from 3.0 to 6.7 under varying light conditions (Scheuring et al., 2005).  We propose that if this ratio of LH2 to LH1 is altered to range from 0-7 or more in response to incidental light intensity, then the photosynthetic efficiency and productivity for a culture of R. sphaeroides may be maximized.

For that a plasmid, which expresses the modular sRNA anti-minC, with a complementary sequence to the mRNA of minC, was constructed based on BBa_K1137009.  NEB Turbo cells were successfully transformed with the sRNA plasmid( BBa_K1650011 ). Upon binding of the sRNA to the mRNA, the mRNA couldn’t be processed by ribosomes anymore, thus, leading to a knock down in MinC. Without MinC cell division is not located at midcell anymore and minicells are formed. The formation of minicells was confirmed by flow cytometry, where we used non-transformed cells grown to mid-log phase as a negative control (Fig.10)

Outlook
As the chemical synthesis of many compounds is still a problem due to inefficient reactions, the need of chemicals produced by microorganisms has been aimed for over the last decade. Especially, the production of pharmaceuticals is an important aspect. Microorganisms might also produce dietary supplements in the near future.
We want to deliver the minicells in form of a pill, which is resistant to stomach acid and dissolves as soon as it gets into the duodenum. There, the minicells will produce the micronutrients and excrete them into the intestines. We think that this is a better method for a successful supply of micronutrients in comparison to an increase of the concentration in food as the absorption of for example dietary β-carotene out of food is not very efficient. This is caused by strong binding to many different biomolecules due to the inflexibility of its conjugated structure.
To ensure biosafety for both, the consumer and the environment, purification of the minicells has to be conducted. This prevents settlement of engineered bacteria in the human gut and their propagation after excretion. We mainly use different filters for the purification to get rid of ordinary cells on the one hand and to increase the concentration of the minicells on the other.
We want to make minicells suitable for everyone as they have the potential to act as a chassis with a lower risk compared to ordinary bacteria. Thus, they fit for multiple applications. Our idea is a sRNA encoding plasmid which silences MinC. With this plasmid, every strain could be brought to the production of minicells by a simple transformation.

They also hope that the new method can have less side effects and lower recurrence rate, thereby reducing their pain. In addition, rheumatoid arthritis can also increase the burden on the national economy. The United States has once carried out an epidemiological survey, showing that annual cost on rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid-related treatment is more than 1% of its GDP. Though there is no such exact data in China, it is estimated that the financial loss caused by this disease is not less than the United States. As the aging problem becomes increasingly prominent, this national economic burden will become more and more heavy. If a new treatment can be designed to cure this disease radically, it will be of great significance in promoting public health and people’s health conditions.

Finding new treatments
CAR-T, short for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Immunotherapy, is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy. This is a new cytotherapy that has existed for many years but hasn’t been used clinically until some recent improvement. Similar to other immunotherapies, its basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to specifically remove cancer cells. As shown in Figure 6, T cells are differentiated and enriched by in vivo injection of cytokines, and then the target cells are separated by cell surface markers. Next, the cells are engineered in vitro with CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor), and are amplified by cell culture to a certain number before returned to the patient's body. In this way, the engineered T cells can kill the target cells specifically in vivo.
Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cytotherapy
We discussed how to design a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis during our group meeting (Figure 7) and with our advisor in depth. Eventually, based on traditional CAR-T, we chose Treg cells as engineering targets in the purpose of curing rheumatoid arthritis, and we innovatively introduced a Syn-Notch system to enhance the stability of the engineered Treg cells in vivo. We came to form a new Syn-Notch CAR-Treg system (the overall idea shown in Figure 8) after some optimization on our design.

Summary
We aimed to map the how well customer needs are met, key players and stakeholders and market size, is it expanding or contracting? As discussed, the need is not fully met as current mucus treatments aren't efficient enough. Key players are companies as Vertex, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Novartis, Merck and more. Key stakeholders are doctors and patients. The market for cystic fibrosis is growing due to increasing prevalence with a size of $ 3.56 billion. For COPD and asthma, the market is expanding, with asthma having the largest market size of $ 20.7 billion and COPD, $ 11.3 billion. North America is the largest market for all three diseases but Asia Pacific is expected to become the fastest regional market in the future.
Word list
Prevalence: The amount of a population who have/had a specific characteristic in a given time period
R&D: Research & Development
Reimbursement: To pay back money to someone who has spent it for you or lost it because of you
Value: A measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent
Revenue share: The distribution of profits and losses between stakeholders
Market capitalization: The total market value of all of a company's outstanding shares
Doing the market analysis, we took help from the book Biodesign, The Process of Innovating Medical Technologies by addressing following questions (in italic) to analyze the market of our target diseases.
We were able to clarify these questions by addressing the market with a quantitative and qualitative research, by both looking at existing data and also doing surveys and interviews with current stakeholders.
How well are customer needs generally addressed by existing solutions and how closely aligned are available solutions with the need the innovators are seeking to address?
There are no solutions today that target the specific area of breaking down the mucus directly. As read under existing solutions for cystic fibrosis, there are so-called mucus thinners, but they do not degrade the mucus directly and serve more to make it thinner by adding salt or using DNase.  Especially in cystic fibrosis and COPD, mucus is a major problem, which current treatments do not satisfy completely. For asthma, on the other hand, mucus is more of an indirect issue, and tightness of airways is the major problem, breaking down mucus"

Troubleshooting
An variant to the 3A assembly process will be performed with only one insert where the entire pSB1C3-T7-Nuc plasmid will be PCR amplified with an BamHI overhang primer, and used as a linearized backbone in the ligation. This way, the T7-Nuc sequence will already be fused with the backbone. The linker-tag (LT) sequence will then be the only insert to be ligated, hopefully increasing the probability if a successful ligation.
Assembly: Second to Tenth Attempt [❌]
The assembly method with Phusion overhang PCR amplified pSB1C3-T7-Nuc plasmid discussed in the troubleshooting prior to these attempts was further discussed and modified to only involve on ligation step of both ends (BamHI and PstI). The first step in the modified assembly method was to PCR amplify the whole pSB1C3-T7-Nuc plasmid with the SuffixF and NucR overhang primer (with BamHI sequence). This linearized sequence were then to be digested at the ends (BamHI and PstI) and PCR purified prior to ligation with the tag sequence digested with at the same restriction sites, resulting in a 1 to 1 fusion (one backbone and one insert). The amplification of the pSB1C3-T7-Nuc construct were performed with a Phusion polymerase and the corresponding protocol. However, the original protocol (from NEB) was very general and a majority of the parameters had to be adjusted according to the specific experiment. This turned out to be very difficult and complicated. Adjustments of the reaction buffer, annealing temperature, extension time, and concentration of DMSO were found to be the major factors affecting the outcome of the PCR. These were set in different combinations where the annealing temperature and the extension time was increased if there were many small sized contaminations (relative the expected size of 2672 bp), and lowered with added DMSO if the results showed no bands. These attempts were unsuccessful since none of the PCR program setups resulted in a product of the correct size.
Troubleshooting
According to the result in the last attempt (see figure) there are no contamination. However, the one visible band is not of the expected size, it is smaller. No contaminations indicate a specific binding of the primers, hence a suitable annealing temperature was set. Parameters that could be adjusted further is then the extension time but also the"

Recently, we sent to sequence the alginate lyase gene cloned in this work to confirm and compare its sequence with other orthologous genes. Our data with nisin assays indicate that this bacteriocin has little or no inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa at concentration used in this work. We need to test higher concentrations (higher than 25 U) of this antimicrobial peptide alone or in combination with alginate lyase against P. aeruginosa. If we did not have satisfactory results, it would be necessary to substitute nisin in the second module of our biosensor that uses L. lactis as chassis,  by other bacteriocin whose effectiveness against P. aeruginosa has been already confirmed previously, e.g. microcin S.

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," remove excess fluoride from drinking water. To see the questions and answers of the interview, continue reading below.
In your study, you mentioned that “water sources are decentralized and all residents rely on community hand-dug open wells, or borehole drilled hand-pump wells”. I understand that the borehole drilled hand pump wells are the community’s preferred source of getting drinking water because groundwater from handpump wells contains less sediment, is less prone to microbial contamination, and the water is easier to collect. However, they also have “the highest average fluoride concentrations (3.4–4.5 mg F− L−1 )” and you predict that there will be many more cases of severe dental and skeletal fluorosis in the coming years (because these systems were installed between 2008 and 2013). Why do these borehole drilled hand-pump wells have so much less contamination in terms of sediment and bacteria yet they have higher fluoride concentrations than the hand-dug open wells? Can you describe how people collect and allocate the water they need for cooking, cleaning, bathing etc. within this community?
A: The borehole drilled hand-pump wells are DEEP - which means that water and rain (microbial contamination) seep deep down into the ground - and through that journey, a natural filtration process occurs which filters out the sediment and other nasty microbes. The bad thing about these borehole drilled hand-pump wells is that they are more prone to high levels of fluoride which comes from erosion of the rock. On the other hand, the hand-dug open wells are more susceptible to microbial contamination because they are much shallower and closer to the surface. The good thing about these shallower wells is that they may not be tapped into by the fluoride rock and may even be diluted by the rain water.
Since the water system is decentralized, there is no water treatment plant like in most western countries. Most of the people in the community Ms. Craig was staying with were farmers, meaning they don’t live clustered together but instead live around their land. The lucky people in this community live close to a well and can easily get their water. Others have to walk at least 400 meters. For those who have to walk, they often will come with a cart pulled by a donkey and multiple huge jugs which they spend their mornings filling with water. This takes them a very long time; at most, even half of the day!
Q: Initially, to check the fluoride concentrations in samples of water taken from the wells, you used an Orion 4-star meter and fluoride ion selective electrode, with 1 ml TIS"

The following are a set of questions that should indicate how the synthetic biology community thinks about life, what values they give to it, what it means to them, and to what extend it can be explained (reduced) in terms of physics. To a certain extend, these questions should make the reader aware that they are working with living systems with a certain worth but and make them think about how research may effect the value or perception of life. The ultimate way of applying the reductionist approach could well explain life, consequently have certain implications. Whether this point will ever be reached is doubtful. What is the scientific opinion?

Colony PCR on Overnight Cultures of LuxPQ in AK plasmid
Purpose: to verify the presence of LuxPQ in the psB1AK3 plasmid after the AC to AK plasmid switch. Eight colonies were picked (4 from colony 6 and 4 from colony 7) for a pTaq colony PCR with BBK CP F/R primers. The following conditions were used: 94ºC for 3 minutes; 36X (94ºC for 30 seconds; 55ºC for 45 seconds; 72ºC for 4 minutes); 72ºC for 10 minutes; held at 4ºC. The products were then run on a 0.8% agarose gel (see below). We can see from this gel that colony 1 and 2 (from colony 6) were the only colonies that revealed the desired size of band at around 3.8kb.
Sequencing results came back today, revealing several mutations in LuxPQ Colony 6, revealing that C6-1 and C6-2, although they are of the desired size, cannot be proceeded with. No mutations were seen in the sequence of LuxPQ in Colony 7; however, the BBK restriction site, PstI, was not present. Therefore, a pl"

Abstract
Performing synthetic biology research requires the use of expensive equipment, which is problematic for underfunded laboratories in developing nations, new research facilities, and high school programs. There is a demand for low-cost, easily accessible laboratory equipment for manual centrifuging and plate reading. In order to address this need, an imaging device and an analyzing software app were designed to quantify the HSV color space from genetically recombined E.coli cells containing inducible chromoprotein constructs. The engineered chamber, Chrome-Q, captures controlled data by eliminating external light, which allows the Android compatible mobile app to calculate the HSV color space from predetermined RGB values. To inexpensively and efficiently pellet transformed cells, an existing 3-D-fuge design was optimized for integration with protocols developed for the Chrome-Q system. Proof of concept was achieved by the creation of an induction curve using three different chromoproteins from ATUM’s Protein Paintbox and the assembled genetic circuits: Promoter-R0040, Ribosomal Binding Site B0034, and Scrooge Orange/Virginia Violet/Tinsel Purple (TsPurple)-BBa_K1033906, using the Chrome-Q system. This project provides economically feasible devices and methods for underfunded research labs working with chromoprotein color expression.
Description
Purpose
When researching synthetic biology, underfunded labs often lack the monetary means to purchase expensive laboratory equipment; basic machinery, such as centrifuges, or more complex materials for analyzing data, such as plate readers, are commodities for many laboratories. The 2017 Lambert iGEM team decided to focus upon these issues, and, therefore, strives to make expensive equipment, like plate readers and centrifuges, more viable resources for underfunded labs.
Method
The approach Lambert iGEM used was multifaceted:
Design a chamber to optimize and standardize conditions for detecting color
Write a software application that can be used by anyone to quantify the color values using HSV
Test and improve on a low-cost centrifuge
Assemble and test these devices with chromoproteins under varying levels of IPTG induction
Using engineering design principles, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team aimed to develop an imaging device called the Chrome-Q to cost-effectively standardize conditions for quantifying chromoprotein"

Hi! I'm Dustin. I was born and raised in Lethbridge and I am a third year biochem student. This is my first year in iGEM and it has been a fascinating experience thus far. The U of L iGEM team is a great group to work with and I'm happy to be a part of it. Outside of school my favorite activities are snowboarding, golfing or hanging out with friends.

My name is pronounced identically to Peterson; the first syllable is not pronounced the same as in peddle, or pedestrian. Get it wrong and you will force me to get you a cask of Amontillado or possibly an orangutan. I have always been correctly known as a science guy among my friends, just as Prospero was known to throw killer parties, and so when iGEM came tapping at my door I graciously jumped on that beating floor board. Since then, everything seems to be going well, my house has not collapsed and all of my four cats still have both their eyes. I am a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, and, as such, I have placed nine references to different works of Poe in this paragraph. This is my first year in iGEM and I am going into my fourth year of neuroscience.

I am from Edmonton though grew up in the small town of Vermilion. There I never would have thought this would be the path I would eventually end up on, but one thing lead to another and here I am. I am taking my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience, and find it a very exciting field, with a great cross application to Synthetic biology. I enjoy camping and hiking in the mountains, I love skiing both downhill and cross country, and have coached youth cross country ski in past years. I had heard about iGEM prior to arriving at the U of L, and was very eager to get involved. It has been an extreamly interesting year and I have learned so much.

Background and significance:
1、 Professor Akihiko Kondo from Kobe University introduced his large-scale multi-segment gene                         assembly                         system based                         on OGAB (Ordered Gene Assembly in B. subtilis). Originally, we had also thought up the idea of                         employing the OGAB                         method for genomic splicing. However, since we did not have the experience of molecular cloning                         experiments of                         Bacillus subtilis, we finally chose to synthesize the genome thorugh conventional methods.
2、 Dr. Xue Xiaoli from Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences,                         shared                         her amazing                         research achievement. She had successfully assembled the 16 chromosomes of Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae                         into a complete                         circular chromosome, which marks the artificially created new form of life of Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae.                         Dr. Xue's                         research provides us with a positive example that inspires us to challenge the impossible of                         life                         and strive to                         create new life.
Project design and execution:
Researcher Wang Manli from Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, shared her                         de                         novo                         synthesis                         using pGF of a plant virus genome of approximately 145 kbp in length (plasmid of Genome Fast)                         as                         well                         as the                         creation of a controllable plant virus with normal function for biocontrol of pests. R. Wang                         also                         sets                         up a                         positive                         example for us. Afterwards, we reviewed the literature and thoroughly studied the principle and                         operation of pGF                         for                         genome synthesis, which had laid a solid foundation for us to ultimately achieve complete                         genome                         synthesis. The                         final genetic synthesis protocol we utilized bears a remarkable resemblance to hers.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of the gastrointestinal tract, PAL easily maintains its enzymatic activity (see results ).
Following PAL activity results, we considered additional ways to make the system even more efficient. We found phenylalanine-specific permease gene pheP (hyperlink), normally found in Escherichia coli, which main function is phenylalanine uptake in the cell, and cloned it into our cells with PAL enzyme. Significantly bigger absorbtion of phenylalanine into the cell results in the substantial increase of its break down, which is the goal of our project. You can read more about system efficiency modulation on our result page) and system activity under real life conditions on our demonstration page.
Polyphe proteins
Our second approach is based on the central dogma of molecular biology. It is outstandingly straightforward, yet reasonably compelling. The idea is simple: at the usual conditions in the bacterial cell, most of phenylalanine molecules are either degraded or used for protein synthesis. Consequently, in order to increase the number of used phenylalanine molecules, we need to utilize more of it by incorporating them to the protein.
Therefore, we created synthetic genes, which sequence is constructed from as many phenylalanine codons, as possible, starting from 5 per cent and rising up to as much as 21 per cent of all the amino acids in the protein (see how we chose proteins and did the design ). Phenylalanine molecules, which approach the probiotic bacterial cell in the human intestine, will be combined into the hydrophobic protein. High expression rates of these 'polyphe proteins' (i.e. proteins, exceptionally rich in the latter amino acid) results in greater uptake of phenylalanine molecules from the cell cytosol than in regular conditions (see our results ).
Polyphe protein approach is completely novel and unconventional, and, in addition, it has a huge advantage over every possible treatment for PKU done before. Biobrick device with polyphe protein and strong promoter would result in high expression levels of our proteins in the cell. PAL (or other enzymes in that matter) are much more sensitive to cell environment, and even small changes in pH, temperature or other factors can cause a significant change in enzyme activity. Polyphe proteins, on the other hand, will be synthesized by any means.
As we proceeded with our idea, we realized that one of the limiting factors of the system might be the inefficient amount of tRNAs, bearing phenylalanine in the cell (tRNA-Phe). On that account, we created tRNA-Phe biob"

The bands of all samples look fine. The insert BBa_K568004 is 3069 bp long, the pSB1C3 vector is 2070 bp long. All samples show these bands. We chose sample 8 for shipping, because it looked ""cleanest"" on the gel.
The product of the ""normally"" incubated restriction digest (1 h at 37 °C) was also loaded onto an analytical 0.8 % agarose gel. The subsequent electrophoresis resulted in the following picture:
Again, the bands are at the expected positions.
Miniprep of pSB6A1
All six overnight cultures of pSB6A1 in DH5alpha were miniprepped according to metabion's protocol. The cell pellets were pink, indicating that the cells contained the desired plasmid, which carries an RFP-coding sequence as a standard insert. Due to a mistake, the pellet of one sample was lost.
The concentrations were measured using Nanodrop:
Sample 1: c = 93.0 ng/µl
Sample 2: c = 79.0 ng/µl
Sample 3: c = 77.5 ng/µl
Sample 4: c = 86.5 ng/µl
Sample 5: c = 102 ng/µl
Other Work
We prepared the miniprepped pSB1C3 with K568004 for shipping. For used amount see the table found in labbook on 18-09-2011.
Preparations for testing of red light sensor tomorrow:
1 clone was picked from each of the following plates (all plates from transformations performed on 17-09-2011):

200 µl of the overnight culture of BL21 (DE3) with I746907 (T7 promotor with GFP) in pSB1A2 were inoculated into 5 ml of fresh LB Amp and incubated for 1.5 hours at 37 °C. Before the samples for measurement in the plate reader were prepared, we made a change of medium to M63, because LB shows slight fluorescence itself.

I Introduction
As stated in the orthogonality test in experiment part, we failed to find the orthometric gene circuit of two warriors. We could only find an orthometric gene circuit for one warrior. That is, we can put LuxI, RhlR and Prhl inside the warrior II, and let warrior I secrete C4HSL. From the experiment results, we know that warrior II just response to C4HSL secreted by warrior 1, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by himself.
 
Discripton1
However, it is hard to determine which receptor and promoter should be put into warrior I. Since from the experiment results, we can see once the receptor-promoter combination response to 3OC6HSL, it will also response to C4HSL. [Fig. 2]
Discripton2
Therefore, what could we do to construct an orthometric gene circuit?
II Design of orthometric gene circuit
The problem now becomes how to block warrior II's response to C4HSL secreted by himself. An intuitive answer to this question is that we could let C4HSL inside warrior I specifically stimulate the expression of an inhibitor, and then the inhibitor can inhibit the promoter of LacI.
Considering this design principle, we design the gene circuit of warrior I and warrior II as follows. [Fig. 3]
Discripton3
Combining with the experiment data [Fig. 2], we can find C4HSL can specifically bind to RhlR and then the complex bind to Prhl so that"

Elderly opinion
Tea with the elderly on Saturday 16th July. Chichi was able to attend the tea session where she was able to ask some of the elderly what they thought about our idea and synthetic biology.
Talk to Dementia patients- Weinberg-Rauhes Haus
Since the age of 14 I have been regularly exposed to the beautiful and perilous aspects of growing old and taking care of the elderly. I started out by occasionally helping out in a dementia home in Hamburg with a family friend who works with therapy dogs for the elderly. Then right after graduating high school I worked in Alzheimer’s research at Roche for 9 months and through that I got to meet a lot of people very passionate about this, whilst also getting a good insight into the pharma side of things.
It has been two years since my work at Roche and I’ve spent my other summers either working in an office or now on iGEM. Although our project is about ageing, I haven’t been thrown into the deep end of dementia research and care for a while. Precisely until I was back at the dementia home in Hamburg this past week, this time with the purpose of getting the opinions of the elderly about our project and their life in general. I got to speak to a few people individually and then also two groups of people, everyone with varying forms of dementia: from very light Alzheimer’s, which you wouldn't be able to tell, to the late stages, which are almost incomprehensible. Overall these experiences were enlightening, inspiring and motivating to do more research and help but simultaneously the potential realities of the future are distressing.
Over the next few weeks we will be publishing the stories of the people I got to speak to and the impressions and experiences I gained from the group sessions.
Synthetic biology showcase: Friday 16th July
Amandeep, Michelle and Abbie presented at the Annual Synthetic Biology Showcase at UCL. This was a unique opportunity to share our project with leading synthetic biology researchers, shape our newer ideas as well as to discuss the ethics of our project."
Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," We used the SUMO protein expression system designed by TU Delft 2014 (for example, see http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1022101 ). This system essentially consists of a N-terminal HIS-tag followed by the SUMO protein (also known as UlpI).
The strategy of expressing toxic AMPs using SUMO has been successfully reported in the literature (Bommarius et al., 2010). We surmise that the SUMO protein could inhibit the antimicrobial activity of single, linear peptides, and that it may also inhibit the activity of our star antimicrobial peptide.
SUMO as a fusion protein also has the benefit of leaving no residues at the C-terminal end of the cleavage site. This means that upon cleavage with the SUMO protease, the native protein can be recovered. In our case, this means that one of the arms of the star can be designed without the need to take into account the addition of any amino acid residues left behind by the protease.
We used the SUMO peptide sequence reported by TU Delft. However, our construct contained the following unique features:
Standardisation of the biobrick by substituting the T7 promoter and RBS (the origins of which are both not specified in the Delft documentation) with the standard T7 promoter and RBS BioBrick BBa_K525998 . In addition to supporting the principle of standardization, using the well-characterized promoter BioBrick should help assure expression levels.
Biobrick BBa_K1022101 lacks a terminator sequence (this was presumably because the part was meant to be integrated into a larger genetic construct with a terminator). A terminator from the registry of standard parts was added (specifically, the wild type terminator from T7 bacteriophage,  BBa_K731721 ).
The original biobrick BBa_K1022101 codes for three amino acid residues before the HIS-tag (ASM), which appeared to be redundant. Correspondence with the 2013 TU Delft team suggested that these residues were unnecessary and appear to be cleaved within the cell as part of the cells post-translational modifications. However, their presence complicates the addition of additional tags at the N-terminus of the protein (e.g. periplasmic export tags), and therefore were not included.
The SUMO sequence was codon optimised for E. coli during synthesis. As the Delft documentation did not specify whether the gene was codon optimal, codon optomisation was undertaken to potentially improve expression levels"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project Software_-_-_TEXT.html," the standard Gibthon interface to get an overview over the suggested primers. Similar to Gibthon the NRPSDesigner is tightly linked with the registry of standard biological parts. The user can add his parts of choice, using the automated parts registy import tool. However, some additional restrictions have been placed in order to ensure the integrity of the designed NRPS sequence: The user cannot enter a new fragment/part in between one of the NRPS domains; instead he can only place it after the Thioesterase and before the initiation adenylation domain.
In silico Design of the Optimal NRPS Sequence
The quickly growing number of known NRPS pathways increases the pool of modules and domains catalysing the incorporation of a specific peptide monomer. Especially on the domain level there is often more than one NRPS protein specific for the same substrate or catalytic reaction. To be able to determine the optimal selection we assume that a combination of domains exists which will provide the best possible performance when combined to a NRPS, and that this performance can be objectively quantified relative to other domain combinations. To find the optimal domain combination the shortest path from a start to an end point on a graph-based representation of the problem needs to be determined. The NRPSDesigner constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing all possible domain combinations capable of synthesizing the desired peptide (see Fig. 4 ). The DAG is organized in layers, corresponding to positions in the final NRPS. Every layer comprises a discrete number of nodes representing NRPS domains and every node of a layer is connected to every node of the next layer. However, no edges within a layer or to previous layers exist. The first and last nodes, being the start and end points of the shortest path problem, are dummy nodes without an associated domain, edges pointing to or from them having a weight of zero.
Figure 4: Dijkstra Algorithm illustration as applied in the NRPSDesigner. In this trivial example, Adenylation domains are connected with thiolation domain and the minimal evolutionary distance is returned when both domains come from the same species (Photorhabdus luminescens ).
So far, very little is known about the potential functionality of synthetic NRPS including possible assembly rules for modules and domains. Therefore we assume a simple scoring function for the edge weights between the user-selected domains, where combinations of domains from closely related organisms have a higher probability to form a functional NRPS than domain combinations involving organisms which are far apart on the taxonomic tree. The taxonomic distance is currently determined from lineage information available in the NCBI taxonomy database [17], but"

Collaborations
Nothing prepares a team better for a jamboree than hand-shoe-football! A large part of the iGEM competition’s ideal is to help other teams; teams this year and in years to come. The point of the Biobrick system is through means of cooperation to make biological engineering simple, and to emphasize the importance of collaboration. One of the gold medal requirements is to help another team, either by modelling or through lab work.
As part of our project, we helped the Edinburgh Team with a computer modulation, made a video to help the team from the University of Copenhagen start a new iGEM educational system, and hosted a Jamboree preparing meetup for the danish iGEM teams.
Modelling for Edinburgh
Basically, there are two ways to optimize a system of microbacterial organisms. At SDU, we optimized the internal pathways, ensuring better production from each cell. Alternatively, optimization of the cells’ external environment (with the intention to maximize the number of cells) will increase production speed. This is the solution that Edinburgh’s team worked on.
Our collaboration has been mutually beneficial: We have"

Photosynthesis and Mars
Photosynthesis on Earth represents an effective way of converting solar to chemical energy on a large scale. The theoretical maximum yield of photosynthesis is approximately 11% of solar energy, with a practical efficiency of 3-6%. A Added to the fact that this mechanism is robust (like all biological systems, photosynthetic organisms are self-replicating and self-repairing), photosynthesis would appear to be key for any energy generation purposes in an isolated, low-resource setting such as a Martian settlement.
Photosynthetic output depends on variables such as atmospheric composition and amount of accessible sunlight. In this section we introduce environmental conditions on Mars that need to be factored when assessing the usefulness of photosynthesis on Mars.
Atmosphere
The Martian atmosphere is strikingly similar to our own atmosphere on Earth; we share the top four components in atmospheric composition (N2, O2, Ar, and CO2), albeit in varying amounts. 1 , 2

This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production in an E. coli host - or especially with co-expression of E. coli Hfq BBa_K1963000 . The system is based on the BBa_K1963002 template and has the proD strong promoter, followed by a short antisense sequence targeting the 5' end of the fliC transcript, followed by the E. coli micC hairpin, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. The anti fliC sRNA is placed betweeen C-193 and T-194. The system should impair motility of E. coli.

The E. coli OsmY protein is secreted from the cell. Serratia Hfq is an RNA binding protein. This translational fusion between the two may allow Hfq to be secreted from an E. coli chassis organism, together with any specific sRNA that may be attached. Pairing Serratia Hfq and Serratia sRNA sequences may afford some specificity to the system."
Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"7_FimH_225_sfGFP, it appears to specifically bind the gold particles as shown. The images suggest successful expression and export of these modified FimH proteins and specific binding. On the image on the right, the gold particles appear to align with the pili on the cell surface.
We were unable to detect fluorescence in cells that had the FimH fusion protein under control of the rhamnose inducible promoter despite experimenting with the induction protocol over a range of growth temperatures and rhamnose concentrations . Given the relatively low proportion of cells in the overall culture of the T7_FimH_225_sfGFP that showed significant fluorescence, it is perhaps unsurprising that a weaker and less well characterised promoter(than T7) should not give strong results. Our consequent decision was to attempt to test the rhamnose inducible promoter by other means. We used a fusion of 6xhistine tag and FimH as an alternative reporter mechanism with the aim of establishing whether modified FimH constructs could be expressed with P_Rha.
FimH_1_His expression
We therefore looked to express FimH with a HisTag at the first amino acid position under control of P_Rha.
Harvard iGEM 2015 also introduced modifications at position 1 of the mature FimH protein without characterising the resultant part. This part produces a FimH protein with a 6xHistidine tag inserted at the first amino acid position, that is the residue that remains at the N-terminus after the signal peptide has been cleaved during the membrane export process. This position is intended to improve the steric properties of the protein so as to ease the cell surface membrane export and to prevent interference with any native protein domains in the FimH which are involved in pilus biogenesis. The coding sequence is under the control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter (BBa_K902065), with the BBa_B0034 RBS and BBa_B0015 terminator. The part, when induced, produces a metal binding FimH protein that should involve itself in pilus biosynthesis when co-transformed with a plasmid containing the fim operon As well as being utilised as a metal binding protein, this part also acts as a reporter. It gives clear and unambiguous evidence of protein expression. Once transformed into a number of E. coli strains (BL21(DE3), Top10, ΔFimB, and ΔFimH), the fusion protein can be expressed by inducing the culture at"

From this questionnaire, we can easily draw  the conclusion that synthetic biology has been developed to some extent in  universities in contemporary China,  but not very well. The great majority of people do not know synthetic biology  or IGEM at all, according to our data. To our relief, most people already have  some comprehension to synthetic biology. Although faced with safety issues,  many people showed a supportive attitude to the development of synthetic  biology. A large percent of people hold the belief that they should possess the  power to monitor it. Frankly speaking, there’s a long way to go before  realizing people’s demand. There being a vast part of people have the desire to  join IGEM, we hope that synthetic biology could be understood by more people,  we hope people with such dreams could be able to achieve their goals one day,  we hope those worries that people have about synthetic biology could be solved  earlier, we hope that more robust management system could be established as  soon as possible. As great fans of synthetic biology, as students with great  dreams of Tianjin   University, we will  spread knowledge of synthetic biology heart and soul. We believe synthetic  biology will have a better future tomorrow!
③Interaction Activities
（1） Visit to TIB,CAS
On July 31, 2014, our team visited Tianjin  Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy  of Sciences, sharing some perspectives of our project and discussing the  direction of further application.
After providing them with our preliminary  plan, we consulted professors there on our weakness and difficulties,  concentrating on the potential applications of our project. In addition to the  detection of the concentration of certain micro-molecules or macro-molecules,  we were inspired that we may also measure the expression level of different  promoters by using our platforms.
Though  we know our team may be faced with a lot of difficulties from our visit, we  also enjoyed the special tour. New ideas can be inspired through good  communication. It provided us with a great opportunity to know deeper about our  projects and synthetic biology.
 
（2） Communication with BIT

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#riboregulator#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," dimerize. The dimerize form of AraC-arabinose can   activate the PBAD promoter (Schleif, 2010).
PBAD promoter BBa_I0500 in Part Registry
There are several PBAD promoters in the Part Registry. The promoter that we were interested in was BBa_I0500 because of  two reasons. First, BBa_I0500 , along with PBAD, has araC gene is regulated by the Pc promoter. Without the AraC, the  repression and induction of PBAD can only work on strains that are AraC+. By coupling the araC gene with the PBAD promoter, we can be free from such restraints.  Second, BBa_I0500 needed debugging. BBa_I0500 , although it is useful, it is not  requestable because of inconsistency in sequencing. Also, in the experience page, two teams, Groningen 2011 and Cambridge 2011 had some discrepancy on how the promoter responded  to the arabinose induction. In brief, Groningen results show that the induction of the promoter by arabinose was gradual while Cambridge results show that it was an “on-or-off”   response. We wanted to analyze these problems so that the part could be more reliable for other users. Cambridge cited a paper that mentioned that variation in response could have   resulted from cell strain variation. (Khelbnikov, 2001)
Results
All-or-none response was observed for individual cells.
Flow cytometry can measure the fluorescence of individual cells. The individual measurement of cell    fluorescence can be plotted in a forward scatter (FSC) intensity value versus fluorescence graph. An arbitrary vertical line divided the region of the graph with low    fluorescence (Q3) and high fluorescence (Q4).
For the negative control, DH10B transformed with pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 , we see cells distributed in Q3 while absent in Q4.  The reverse was true for the positive control, DH10B transformed with pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 (GFP generator regulated by BBa_J23101 ).  We see most cells distributed in Q4. For our experimental sample,  (pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 ) similar trend could observed for three strains.  At no arabinose induction, we see most of the cells in Q3. The distribution of cells shifted to Q4 when arabinose was added to the medium. We also see that the cells remained in Q3"

Design
When initially designing our project, we decided it was best to stick as closely to the current methods for testing bTB as possible. We decided this due to the fact that the stakeholders involved are reluctant to change and have been using their current systems for many years. However as the project went along, and after speaking to the stakeholders involved, it became clear that they would be receptive to change. This allowed us to design and construct both a new test and testing method. These have been heavily influenced throughout the project by the stakeholders and are discussed below.
Prototype
Design 1 - the Eppendorf
We first assumed that our testing could take place in a 1.5ml eppendorf tube. Our cell free system currently takes up a volume of 50μl, leaving ample space for a few drops of blood to be added. If RNA in this blood sample is associated with bTB, it would trigger our toehold switch, therefore causing a reporter to be expressed (eg, a colour change). An eppendorf tube is lightweight, durable, and can be sealed to prevent outside contamination. This seal is an important design feature, as the environment in which the test is performed can be unclean and full of possible contaminants. This was also chosen as we thought we could extract blood from a cow using a skin prick test, giving just a few drops of blood. However on consultation with Phil Leighton, he told us this would not be possible due to a cow's thick hide. This led on to our second design, which allows for a standard blood test to be used.
Design 2 - the grip tube
Following a meeting with Phil Leighton, a vet who conducts bTB tests in South West England, we realised our prototype needed some major changes. We learned that blood tests in cattle take place behind the tail, as opposed to the current skin test which takes place in the neck. According"

While conserving the functionality of their linear counterpart, circular proteins can be superior in terms of thermostability, resistance against chemical denaturation and protection from exopeptidases. Moreover, a circular backbone can improve in vivo stability of therapeutical proteins and peptides.
Assembly Construct. BBa_K1362100 and BBa_K1362101
These parts represent an easy way to build fusion constructs of intein parts with any protein or peptide of interest (POI). In a single step you can fuse your protein to a split intein part. Desired extein residues, RFC [i] standard overhangs and BsaI sites generating these overhangs have to be added to the coding sequence of the POI by PCR. Facilitating the highly efficient GoldenGate assembly reaction, the mRFP selection marker can be replaced with the POI insert.
The resulting parts can be concatenated using standard BioBrick cloning into an expression backbone to coexpress the POIs fused to a N- and a C-intein.
In an auto catalytic in vivo reaction, the inteins will cleave themselves out and ligate the exteins - here your POIs - together. For example we used this mechanism to reconstitute the fluorescence of split sfGFP . To read more about the trans-splicing reaction visit our Intein Background page. The whole process becomes significant more interesting with conditional protein trans splicing .
If performing experiments with split inteins make sure you always have a non-splicing negative control. Check out our non splicing assembly constructs (with part names ending with 2 or 3) for example: BBa_K1362102 and BBa_K1362103

Inteins are the basic unity of our toolbox. They are integrated as extraneous polypeptide sequences into habitual proteins and do not follow the original protein function. Inteins perform an autocatalytic splicing reaction, where they excite themselves out of the host protein while reconnecting the remaining chains on both end, so called N and C exteins, via a new peptide bond. Read more about it in our project background !
To characterize the different types and groups of split-inteins and inteins we collect many details about them to develop a intein library. It gives you a great and clear overview about the most important facts.

8/2/13
Today we set up an experiment which we will do on 8/7/13. We re-picked the plaques from the plate of mutagenized phage. The plate was full of variations in plaque sizes. We took the biggest plaques and put them in a mL of LB broth in an eppendorf. We also started to take a closer look at our EMs from Wednesday. We are slowly learning how to use the program image to our best use.
8/5/13
Today we spent class working with ImageJ to measure the phage from the various categories in the cesium chloride gradient.
8/7/13
Today we picked from small plaques and diluted them in 1 mL of LB.  We didn't have grown bacteria so we just put the tubes in the fridge.
We also drafted our project description as a class and posted it to our web site.
8/9/13
We also discussed the need to separate the phage from the CsCl gradient into fractions so we don't risk contaminating the large phage fraction with normal phage from the large, central band.
Results from 8/7/13 plaque test:
8/12/13
Today we gave the phage purification group another round of mutagenized phage to run through a CsCl gradient.  They will separate each band into fractions.

The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

Sry target
The Sry gene
Sry is a gene located on the Y chromosome.  It codes for sex-determining region Y (SRY) protein which is also known as Testis-determining factor (TDF) (Kashimada and Koopman, 2010).  SRY protein is transcription factor that is responsible for male sex determination in mammals.
A target located on the Y chromosome was chosen to test our SeeDNA method because it would allow us to test both the sensitivity and specificity of the system in detecting a target sequence from genomic DNA.  The ability to detect and quantify target sequences from a genomic DNA sample would provide evidence that SeeDNA technology could be used for genetic testing of either inherited diseases for example.  By choosing a target located on the Y chromosome, it will be possible to test the detector with genomic DNA from a male and to use genomic DNA from a female as a negative control.  This would be a very good test of the sensitivity and specificity of the detection system.
Results
1. Identification of an Sry target sequence
We identify a target sequence within a conserved region of the mouse Sry gene.  This 62bp region corresponds to a fragment that is generated upon digestion with the 4-cutter enzyme HaeIII.
2. Choosing a Restriction Enzyme
Our target was chosen as it was flanked by restriction sites of HaeIII. A number of restriction sites could have been chosen, however our choice was limited by factors such as the iGEM restriction sites located on the biobrick prefix and suffix.  A target had to lack these sites to create a biobrick part that could be used by other teams.
The HaeIII restriction enzyme bluntly cuts at two GGCC recognition sites and is not affected by"

iGEM reaching the high school
     On August 28th,2014, a total of 239 high school students (from 14 to 17 years old) of  Mafra city (located in Santa Catarina State, Brazil) had the opportunity to hear about   Synthetic Biology for the first time in their lives. Guilherme Kundlatsch (member of   Brasil-SP Team) presented 4 lectures, each lasting 90 minutes. To succeed in his talk,   Guilherme first taught about the flow of genetic information (from DNA to proteins),   history of molecular biology, recombinant DNA techniques (and concepts such as   restriction enzyme, ligation enzyme, and bacterial plasmid transformation were also   discussed). Great job! Students were ready to begin a journey through Synthetic   Biology. Guilherme started talking about some of the past iGEM projects such as: 1 -   The Food Warden (Groningen Team, 2012), a system which allows the costumer to   detect meat spoilage easily; 2 - E. chromi (Cambridge Team, 2009), a set of parts that   allows generation of a rainbow of color pigments in E. coli which permits the use of a   engineered bacterium for coloring the poop as biosensor for the human gastro-intestinal   tract; 3 - Detecthol (USP Team, 2013), a bioengineered sensor, which is able to detect   levels of methanol above 2% in common alcoholic drinks. Finally, he explained the   Brasil-SP project, the “Kidney Sensing”. The excitement of the students was   remarkable, and it was observed especially at the time they asked questions about   ethical concepts, more details about some techniques and predictions for the future.   Curiously, at the beginning of each lecture Guilherme always asked students to raise   their hands up who knew anything about the subject... and no one did it. We are   convinced that at the end of each lecture, everyone understood at least the basics of   Synthetic Biology. Several of them were inspired to pursue a career in,"

Ideas
Immediately after meeting for the first time, we were tasked with finding a project that we would be working on over the summer. At first, the idea seemed daunting but before we knew it, amazing (sometimes outrageous) ideas were being suggested.
Almost a month later, after numerous presentations, we narrowed down our potential projects to five:
Exploiting the PET-degrading qualities of Ideonella sakaiensisto tackle the plastic crisis
Creating a biosensor to detect harmful substances in water bottles
using Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (and its enzymes) to attack and kill harmful/unwanted bacteria in food processes
using mRNA interference to silence Streptococcus mutanstoxins
using mRNA interference to silence Clostridium difficiletoxins
Ideonella sakaiensis
Ideonella sakaiensisis a bacterium that can degrade plastic (PET) using two enzymes. It was discovered outside a plastic recycling facility in Japan and subsequently isolated by research teams at Kyoto Institute of Technology and Keio University(Yoshida et al., 2016). The idea of being able to tackle the plastic crisis affecting the oceans and marine life was a particularly appealing one. However, we quickly realised that we didn’t know how to transform the organism and the time-scale for how long it would take. Also, our project was very similar to other research being conducted and so it would be difficult to come up with a novel way to address the crisis.
Water bottle biosensor
According to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee, in their first report of the season (2017-19), in the UK alone we use ‘13 billion plastic bottles every year’ and ‘only 7.5 billion are recycled’. This prompted the team to suggest a biosensor that detects harmful substance in plastic bottles. As a result, the average consumer would buy fewer plastic bottles and reuse their bottle. However, many solutions immediately were proposed that counteracted the"

Summary BU/Wellesley Synthetic Biology Bootcamp
Members of the BU/Wellesley iGEM come together and work on their ""Hello World!"" application in Clotho.
5/31-6/1: Team introductions; we learned the basics of CAD and basics of molecular biology and genetics.
6/2: We started learning the basics of Clotho, as well as more basic biology, focusing on the structure of a transcriptional unit.  We split into teams and started exploring the format of Clotho.
6/3: Time to get into more details: How is TB involved in our research? Suma gave a brief powerpoint presentation on the global effects of TB, and an overview on the transcriptional regulation of TB.  Also Traci talked to us more about the basics, such as the definition of a Biobrick, and objectives of the iGEM competition.  Also, she gave an overview outline on wetlab protocol for this summer."

Model 2: The protein secretion model
Introduction
To be surface displayed, proteins should be secreted after translation and then anchored to the cell wall, which is really a long journey. In our project, we used the signal peptide SPusp45 to direct protein secretion and the cA domain to make proteins surface displayed. In this section, we try to simulate the secretion process in bacteria, and predict the amount of protein can be surface displayed at a given time.
Modeling
A recursion equation was used to calculate the amount of protein that on the cell wall. The value of
was determined by reference (Lin et al., 2016), the definition of symbols are listed in Table 3.
Table 3 Definition of symbols used in the recursion equation
Analysis and Results
Using the secretion model, we found that 89.46% of the expressed protein will be secreted and anchored to the cell, when the expression of protein is stable as shown in Figure 2. The result is similar to several reported protein secretion ratio with the signal peptide SPusp45 (87%(Lin et al., 2016), 89%(Borrero et al., 2011) ).

Reflecting on our experience, we were able to see the benefits of treating the issue of drug abuse as a social problem, rather than an individual one. Drug consumption rooms provide a much needed service to addicts in a unique stage in recovery - viz. it allows those who are still dependent to minimise the associated risks and stay alive long enough to get the help they require.

Important: As soon as you receive the samples, keep them covered in foil. Exposure to light affects the fluorescence measurement.
You have been given 5 samples: 3 different mutants (A, B, C), a wild type (WT) and a sample of suspension buffer (MS).  Each tube contains 1mL of the sample; triplicate readings of each sample should be taken. Therefore, 1mL should be enough to run each sample 3 times.
*Make sure to vortex tubes before beginning experiment
Plate Reader Instructions:
Using sample “C” determine the linear range for your measurement device.
We recorded the highest fluorescence from sample “C,” so if this is found to be in the linear range, then all the other samples will be as well.
Our device required a 200µL sample, and directly dispensing 200µL from the 1mL sample was within the linear range. No dilution was necessary.
Our measurement device is a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (96 well) and we use the Gen5 software.
Excitation wavelength (nm): 590/20
Emission wavelength (nm): 645/40
Scaled* to High Wells
Set point Temperature: 25 OC
*Your measurement device and protocol may vary from ours and other teams, so please update our form with your specific parameters.

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," perform RT-PCR in order to check up-regulation of flowering factors.
We used leaf cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, insted of cells of a shoot apex. This is because shoot apex' cells are too small to observe. FT protein upregulates FUL and SEP3 genes in leaf cells, too. GFP is suitable for control experiments because  GFP's molecular weight(27kDa) is relatively similar to that of FT(20kDa.)
Fig.4-2 injecting FT protein into plant leaves in order to verify the function of FT protein.
Fig.4-2 6 His tag fusion FT protein was purified with Ni-NTA agarose column.
30mg  of leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana before bolting were used for one sample. FT or GFP protein and R9 peptide were diluted in PBS (pH7.4), 50ug/L and 500ug/uL each. Leaves were soaked into FT-R9 or GFP-R9 solution for 5min. and incubated for 16hr. in PBS(pH7.4.) After incubation, leaves were freezed with liquid nitrogen and glinded immediately.
Total RNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform extraction.  cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription and used as templates of RT-PCR.  TUBULIN was used for internal control of mRNA expression.

Lane2: TUBULIN (FT-R9 treated)
Lane3: FUL (GFP-R9 treated) amplicon 132bp
Lane4: FUL (FT-R9 treated)

As shown above, we got no correct ampicon band, even from tubulin, which is a high expressed gene we used as internal control. One possible reason of this failure was the poor quality of extracted RNA in this experiment. To check this, we compared the total RNA by electrophoresis, shown in fig.4-3.

Please see the Registry Contribution help page for help on documenting a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT come from your team's 2016 range of part numbers.
We began piloting the Protein Cages project during the 2015 season and were largely unsuccessful. This year, we were able to improve upon several previously submitted biobricks, namely BBa_K1763421 , which coded for a mutant of the PC Quad protein cage (insertion of a thrombin cleavage site) that was unable to be expressed and purified. This year, we were able to modify the part and select a new insertion site for the recognition sequence from thrombin protease, thus producing BBa_K2068001 . This part is highly functional and has been extremely well characterized; we were able to express and purify this mutant cage as well as experimentally validate that it fulfills its intended purpose.
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
We have substantial evidence that our project works as we intend it to! We have successfully expressed mutant protein cages that can be cleaved by thrombin protease, and have demonstrated this through Dynamic Light Scattering and SDS-PAGE. To see our Proof of Concept, please visit this page ."

Accomplishments
Participating in the iGEM competition was an initiative that emerged in our initially small group of friends and colleagues at the School for Chemical Engineering, NTUA. Unfortunately, we do not have a synthetic biology course in our school's curriculum but we had heard about iGEM in online courses (""Industrial Biotechnology"", University of Manchester, on Coursera, ""The Principles of Synthetic Biology"", MIT, on edX, “Genes and the Human Condition”, University of Maryland, on Coursera, materials freely available). We managed to find more students from different schools that shared the same passion for synthetic biology and finally started brainstorming around the beginning of December 2017. The first week of February we had decided on our project, the development of a method for Point-of-Care MERS-CoV diagnosis, and proceeded on reading tons of literature to specify the details. The laboratory training and experiments began at the end of May.
Throughout the last few months, we have achieved formulating a solid Proof of Concept, supported by dry lab experiments and validated by wet lab experiments. We are also in a position to propose a complete kit design based on the current needs for MERS-CoV POC diagnosis. Lastly, through our Human Practices efforts, we have introduced synthetic biology in several high school classrooms for the first time in Greece, and we have offered the opportunity of a short hands-on synbio project design experience to a group of undergraduate students.
None of the above would be possible without the assistance and support of our professors, supervisors, instructors, experts, and sponsors. We offer our sincerest thanks for their contribution.

Safety issue was the most important one. Therefore we integrated a cell lysis system in our design. It is easy to activate the lysis in the cell and kill it.

Interview
To improve our work, we talked to scientists and professionals that gave us a real input on our project. All of the interviews were very informative, and most importantly gave us an opportunity to explore further in detail our work, thanks to the advice of external people, giving us a new eye on the project.
Alain Le Méhauté
Alain Le Mehaute is a french Physicist, Engineer and Mathematicians who was the first person to file a patent for stereolithography, the cousin of 3D printing. Unfortunately, the company he worked for didn’t believe in the potential of the invention and withdrew the patent without his assent. Far from being resentful, Alain explained us over a Skype interview that this was just another example of the inefficacy of French hierarchy which often prioritize short-sighted and individualistic career goals over long term innovative vision. Alain also explains that, although he was conscious of the commercial potential of his invention, he wanted to develop it at the time to bring proof to his theories on fractal geometries. This interview gave us a glimpse of the potential of our control system. Given where 3D printing stands today, Medusa will probably find applications we cannot yet predict.
Andrew Pelling
Andrew Pelling is a canadian scientist from the university of Ottawa, and the director of the Pelling Lab. He is focusing on augmented biology, his dream being redefining the limits of biology. He’s currently working on making human ears using apple. We talked to him about our project, and more specifically about our biomaterials. As we are working with non polluting, biocompatible materials, the fact that we could do anything with them drew his attention. He’s really interested in DIY bio products and what we could do with them. And gave us great advice for potential applications, as well as design of the printer itself.

Figure 2: General Overview of the North American Oil and Gas market and the Global Waste Water Monitoring markets.
Each of these monitoring sites is required to take multiple samples in the surrounding areas on a quarterly or annual basis. The overall number of sites for air, water, and ecosystem quality taken from the Canada-Alberta Oil Sands Environmental Monitoring Information Portal. Information from the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan is found below:
Figure 3: Number of sampling stations in the Alberta Oil Sands area broken down by water (blue), ecosystem (green), and air (orange) monitoring.
Monitoring is broken down into air, water, and ecosystem quality. Our technology can be applied to over 50% of the total number of monitoring sites. The largest portion of interest is dedicated to water monitoring in tailing ponds and various acid-sensitive lakes found in the oil sands and surrounding areas. We have evaluated that our technology however, fits not only into most of the water monitoring regulation but also a vast majority of the ecosystem monitoring requirements.  The number and type of monitoring sites that our technology could be utilized with is identified below:
Figure 4: Sampling stations for water quality (grey) and air/ecosystem (green) showing the percentage of monitoring sites our technology could be applied to.
In total, more than 500 current water and ecosystem quality sites are prime opportunities for our technology to transform current monitoring regimes. Our general toxin sensor technology has vast applications which can meet growing needs for on-site monitoring at these sites. As these needs are expected to grow substantially by the year 2015, this makes the development of our technology in-line with the expectations for market growth dictated by the government.
Figure 5: Monitoring sites dictated by the Canada Alberta Implementation Plan from the years 2011 and the expected increase in sites by 2015.  Orange dots represent air quality monitoring which our technology cannot presently be applied to.
Figure 6: Regulatory sampling sites required to be monitored by the oil and gas industry in the year 2011.
It is important to note, that while there are currently approximately 500 sampling stations which are mandated, each site performs sampling in multiple locations more than once per year. As an example, the Athabasca tributary monitoring program (a part of the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program - RAMP) may have approximately ten or more distinct sampling locations surrounding a site which are monitored as often as once per month. Other sampling locations such as acid-sensitive lakes, may only be monitored a few times per year.

Results
In the following section, you will find the results concerning our streptavidin cell surface display work.
Our first experimental steps were to perform Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) in order to isolate the different streptavidins.
Cloning
Gel A: 0.8% Gel electrophoresis to verify PCR of Streptavidin Alive coding sequence. Expected fragment size is 384bp and nothing in the reagent negative control.
Gel B: 0.8% Gel electrophoresis to verify PCR of Streptavidin Dead coding sequence. Expected fragment size is 387bp and nothing in the reagent negative control
Gel C: 0.8% Gel electrophoresis to verify PCR of Streptavidin iGEM coding sequence. Expected fragment size is 387bp and nothing in the reagent negative control
The previous Gels show that our PCR reactions (68°C annealing temp, primers in registry) to amplify the streptavidin coding sequences went fine. The DNA fragments migrated at the expected sizes written under each images. The PCR to amplify our backbone (see primers in the registry) from the BBa_K523013 biobrick and to add overhangs complementary to the edges of the streptavidin sequences also worked.
With the PCR products we did a Gibson Assembly to obtained our desired constructs. The Gibson Assembly reaction worked as expected, we obtained a product around the expected size 4171bp.
Then another way to verify that our Gibson assembly reaction had worked was to transform cells with the Gibson products. The transformed DH5α competent cells should be able to grow on an antibiotic medium because of the resistance provided in the plasmid. The only problem with this second verification is that the Gibson product could still contain parental plasmid, whose insertion in cells can also lead to cells resistance and survival. So to verify if there is a carry over of the initial plasmids, we made negative controls.
You can see bellow plates containing cells from the glycerol stocks we made of our gibson products .
