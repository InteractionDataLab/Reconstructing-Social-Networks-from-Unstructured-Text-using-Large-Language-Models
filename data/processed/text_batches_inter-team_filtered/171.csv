6.12 Mutagen Concentration Test - Second Protocol
I) Purpose
To test the perfected protocol for applying 5-bromodeoxyuridine and inducing mutation.
II) Expected Outcome
- A decrease in phage viability with increasing mutagen concentration.
- A few random mutations that produces smaller phage and consequently larger plaques during selection with x8 agar.
III) Reagents Used
5-bromodeoxyuridine stock in freezer labeled T7 (10mg/mL); 40mL of M9+ prepared by the large phage group; BL21 overnight; 5.3 phage stock; x8 top agar; uracil solution (2.5mg/mL); adenine solution (5mg/mL).
IV) Procedure
1) Applying the mutagen (6.12)
- From 5.13 Determining E coli concentration with spectrophotometer, we know that the concentration of E coli BL21 in a liquid overnight culture is about 3.12E8 cell/mL. But we need to resuspend it in M9+ medium.
- To make the M9+ suspension medium supplemented with the appropriate amount of uracil and adenine, 160uL of adenine solution and 320uL of uracil was add 40mL of M9+.
- Label 4 centrifuge tubes (15mL) 0, 100, 200, and 500. To each of these test tubes, add 10 mL of E coli overnight. Cells were then pelleted via centrifuge at 4000rpm for"

OVERVIEW 
This year, we are developing A Detector I which utilizes three orthogonal connection systems to detect enzyme-catalyzed reaction products qualitatively and quantitatively. To make the enzyme complex and our detection device (which is an interdigital electrode) connected, we choose the curli system of E. coli to create a functional nanofiber network to serve as a mediator.
Introduction
It has been proved that enzymes can be used in purified form. The biocatalysis is a highly efficient and environmentally friendly manner which has great potential in industry. However, its production efficiency is limited by low mass transport stemming from hindered diffusion of the substrate or product across the cell membrane. Thus we do need an approach that optimally combines the criteria of high surface area, enhanced enzyme stability, rapid mass transport, and modularity. It had been elusive until the researchers from Harvard University developed a protein immobilization platform that modifies curli nanofibers, the amyloid fiber component of E. coli biofilms, with a peptide domain that can covalently capture proteins. [1]
According to the article published in 2015, [1] the process of the biofilm functionalization with enzymes through the covalent modification of curli fibers is showed in Figure 1. First, E. coli expresses CsgA fused to the 13 amino acid SpyTag (CsgA-ST), which self-assembles into curli fibers on the surface of the bacterium. Then it is covalently modified with an enzyme fused to SpyCatcher. Finally, substrate to product catalysis occurs on the high surface-area catalytic fibers.
Fig.1 How enzymes are linked to curli fibers [1]
In our approach, we transformed PHL628-△csgA cells with pBbE1a plasmids with CsgA-SpyTag to express curli as the base. Curli from different strains will connect adjacent bacteria to form biofilm. Since there’re three orthogonal systems — SpyTag/SpyCatcher, SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher and SdyTag/Sdy"

Microarray
Microarray
We have proposed a microarray chip processing process here because the microarray chip is very suitable for throughput detection. In addition, we shared two optimized microfluidic chip liquid drive methods. We found that the current production process and specific parameters of the chip are rarely mentioned in literatures, which are the key points to determine whether the chip can be used, so we also share the production steps.
Overview PMMA Based Processing Platform SU-8 Based Processing Platf Results Additional Work
Coupling
In the biological part, we use aptamers to complete the detection of various disease markers. Because the joint detection of disease markers is very important for the correct rate and reliability of disease diagnosis. For example, h-FABP joint detection cTnI, Mb and CK-Mb has important clinical value in early diagnosis of childrenren with HFMD myocarditis, improvement of the diagnostic rate and lessening of the misdiagnosis rate, et al. [1]br>                             Therefore, in the hardware part, we chose the microarray chip as the detection platform to complete the flux detection of the sample after the reaction. We have proposed two different materials - PMMA based and negative photoresist SU-8 based microarray chip processing. They have their own advantages and can adapt to different testing needs. At the same time, in order to verify that they can achieve basic functions, we have made chips of different sizes and tested them with our device.
So what is a microarray chip? The essence of microarrays is the parallel analysis of biological signals, which concentrates a large amount of biological information on a small solid-phase matrix, so that some traditional biological analysis methods can minimize the consumption of reagents and try to minimize the amount of reagents in the smallest possible space. Fast speed is completed. Fluorescence-based microarray chips provide us with a portable, fast, and high-throughput assay that effectively complements the clinical diagnostic process. As shown in the figure (Fig. 1), a chip that realizes flux detection based on the aperture shape. 【2】

PMMA Based Processing Platform
The PMMA flux detection chip can achieve detection requirements for <10 samples. PMMA material, namely polymethyl methacrylate, commonly known as plexiglass, is the highest quality and price-appropriate variety of synthetic transparent materials. Its light transmittance is as high as 93%, which is friendly to fluorescence detection.

For the identification of novel mutations in the gltT transporter, the wild type strain was grown on 40 mM glyphosate. Emerging mutations were further analysed by isolation of the complete DNA and amplification of the transporter via PCR. The genomic DNA was isolated with the Kit “peqGOLD Bacterial DNA Kit” from peqlab. The resulting sequences were then screened for novel mutations.

As a giant network of saturated hydrocarbons, polyethylene (PE) is a storehouse of a huge amount of chemical potential energy. While most microorganisms are unable to draw from this vast store as they cannot metabolise polyethylene or smaller alkanes, review of literature suggested that some microbes are capable of metabolising saturated hydrocarbons as their sole carbon source. There are however, limitations to the length of the carbon chains these microorganisms can metabolise [1]. 
With regards to our goal – to design a metabolism pathway for polyethylene, it was therefore a priority to fragment PE before it could be fed to the microbes. Further study on several research articles revealed that Rhodococcus ruber was among the few microorganisms that could utilize polyethylene as its main carbon source. Laccase was identified among several secreted metalloenzymes when the bacterium was grown on a PE film ([2], [6]) and so was suspected to be responsible  for the cleavage effect on PE. Further analysis provided conclusive evidence that it was in fact Laccase cleaving the polyethylene backbone. 
 
Figure 1. Protein structure and enzymatically active sites of laccase [7].
 
Laccase belongs to a family of enzymes known as multicopper oxidases which oxidize a variety of substrates while reducing dioxygen to water in the process. As shown in Figure 1, The enzymatically active part of laccase involves a cluster of 4 copper ions at different oxidation states [4]. The catalytic mechanism begins with the transfer of electron from substrate to the T1 copper site as a result of its higher redox potential; the electron obtained from the reduced T1 copper is then passed through the intermediate electron acceptor, T3 copper site and eventually ends up at the T2 copper site [4]. The T3 copper serves as an electron acceptor in the aerobic oxidation process while the presence of the T2 copper site is necessary as a terminal oxygen reducing site. Laccases were long reported to be present in some lignin- bio-degrading fungi, where they catalyse"

You can see that the C.crescentus goes around and get attached.
Light Control
You can toggle the Light on, and the cells' growth curve will be greatly affected by light. When the light is on, the cell's movement will be inhabited temporarily.
Bonus: Celllab
Celllab is a bio-computing framework under team member Zhen Zhang's developing, enlightened by NetLogo. It is a web-based, flexible framework which is special in the fellowing aspects:
Viewer can customize the arguments, options etc.
Running instantly in web browser
Heavy computing burden can be leveled to server-side.

NetLogo -- Visualization
This is a dynamic visualization of the C.crescentus behaviors. The white to red region is solid surface, which provides necessary nutrition for cells to reproduce. The cells will consume the nutrition as well, but the nutrition is sustainable in this case.
You may want to notice how crescents is attached to the region.
NetLogo -- Light Control
The above picture is the change of cell population with time. When the light is on, the population will decay; When light is off, the population will grow. So we can get a conclusion that through light induced  of cell movement, we can control the growing rate of the whole population. The light will inhabit cell's free moving, which prevent the cells from contacting the surface. And in fact, you can also observe the slight delay, which is a reasonable result the massive amount of cells.

Green Teams
The accomplishment of environmental problems and climate change in particular is a global challenge. We cannot cope with this task alone, but everyone can be part of the solution. iGEM goes green encourages all iGEM teams in 2017 to take part in our campaign for more sustainability in scientific research. This green collaboration is organized in a bidirectional way. We offer information and guidance and try to set a good example for green lab work, while motivating other iGEM teams to get involved and spread the word. With our GoGreenGuide and the monthly newsletters we provided all the necessary input to get started and the newest updates on our own progress.
Already a lot of iGEM teams from all over the world have joined the movement so far! (Hover over the map above to see all participating teams)
Green connections
To collaborate with iGEM goes green teams should fulfill the following requirements:
Reading our GoGreenGuide
Implementing of as many tips as possible in the daily working routine (Checklist in the Guide)
Creating a subpage on the team wiki presenting the efforts towards a sustainable participation in iGEM
Suggestions for iGEM goes green from the GoGreenGuide
Greener Lab work
In our GoGreenGuide we offer several possibilities to save energy or consumables during experimental work. iGEM teams willing to participate are admonished to read the guideline, implement some of the advices and also to help extend the content of the current guide. We received input for the guideline from the CCA’s High School iGEM team from San Diego and iGEM Lund from Sweden. Furthermore, we also received input from experts like Kerstin-Helmuth Kleinschmidt from Niub in Freiburg for our GoGreenGuide.
We further asked all involved iGEM Teams dedicate a small section on their website to show their implementations of the guideline. This will probably spread the idea of a greener bench work to more and more teams. Click on the map and visit the other teams' go green pages to see all the aspects of green lab work"

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), the links between the population, environment, and natural resources are mediated by multiple factors. The immediate environmental impact of urban settlements derives from a change in land purpose5, reducing the size of crops that can be pollinated by bees, generating an effect similar to that of habitat loss and with this, nutritional complications in bees, conferring susceptibility to diseases. This is one of the points suggested by the engineer Alejandro Bianchi during our meeting on June 15, 2018.
However, there are actions that seek to provide a healthy life for bees and their existence. There is a concern for the negative impact on anthophiles by irresponsible human activities; it is vital to prevent and attack the causes of bee reduction or loss at their roots. As we learned thanks to MEXMUN 2018, the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity should be used. These objectives are:
Conservation of biodiversity.
Sustainable use of the components of biological diversity.
Appropriate transference of technologies.
Currently, the importance of carrying out a risk analysis is integrated in our legal plan, as per the Enviromental Risk Assesment Guide. In addition to the aspects mentioned in the assessment of the quality control within the legal plan, the following steps are involved, such as the guidelines for animal health risk analysis according to the Regulation of the Federal Animal Health Law, which are the following:
The resolution of whether the risks are acceptable or not, as a whole, as well as the strategies for the management of possible risks.
Identification of the possible risks.
Assessment of the chances that these risks arise.
Evaluation of the consequences.
Estimation of the possible global risk.
Dr. Ernesto Tanus Sánchez mentioned the importance of avoiding the burning of hives, due to the limited accessibility to the wood with which they are made. Cedar, specifically red cedar (Cedrela odorata), is considered the best type of wood to make a hive. However, this species is subject to special protection according to NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010, which means factors that negatively affect its viability may threaten it. Obtaining permission to perform the practice of incinerating hives becomes an arduous and even deficient process. Due to the virulence of Paenibacillus larvae, American Foulbrood sweeps entire hives before there is an answer by the authorities.
In other Latin American countries, the action plan presents variations. Ph.D. David De Jong explained us how in Brazil, it is not permissible for someone to incinerate a beehive if it"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component"
Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," the models, FBA and kinetic model were most suitable for our project. The modelling subgroup deemed that flux balance analysis will help us find an optimal pathway for maximizing production of PHB in E. coli BL21. Furthermore, kinetic modelling will help us find loopholes in the pathway suggested by FBA. Hence, FBA and kinetic modelling will work together to improve the synthesis of PHB in E. coli (BL21). We contacted faculty members at the University of Calgary, who worked on mathematical modelling to discuss our plan for the summer.
Week 4: June 5 - June 16
The modelling group met with Dr. MacCullum to discuss the possible mathematical modelling methods. The group was advised that flux balance analysis and kinetic model would be the best to pursue given our project's scope as it will inform our experiments and is feasible in the given time. OpenCobra toolbox for MATLAB was installed because it has functions for carrying out flux-balance analysis and visualizing the results.
Week 5: June 19 - June 23
This week we met with a group of postdocs working in Dr. Ian Lewis’s lab. We discussed how flux balance analysis could be helpful for our project. We also discussed flux variability analysis (FVA) in comparison to flux balance analysis. We decided that after finding optimal solutions using FBA, we can look into FVA. We were given some suggestions on some objectives we could look for in our model such as optimizing bacterial growth, optimizing PHB production using glycolysis only, and optimizing PHB production using beta-oxidation pathway only. This could be done by changing the parameters of the command optimizeCbModel(‘parameter’).
Week 6 & 7: June 26 - July 7
The modeling team had a meeting to discuss the milestones for flux balance analysis and kinetic model. We decided on the different models we plan to optimize using the flux balance analysis and kinetic modelling. We plan to study a number of models. One of the models will contain pathways for beta-oxidation and PhaCJ genes that can help produce PHB from medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids. The other model will contain CBA genes and PhaCJ, which can help produce PHB from glucose, short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain fatty acids. The kinetic model will look into reactions that are rate-limiting in these pathways. Thus, FBA and kinetic model will work together to help optimize the production of PHB in E. coli (BL21) and modify substrate concentrations involved in the rate-limiting steps.

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. Among many we can find severe health issues and resistance development in the most commonly occurring family of strongyles. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these parasites. By reprogramming a smart bacteria to detect and report the presence of the parasites, we aim to develop a simple diagnostic method. This will provide the tools necessary to help farmers both to make decisions on whether to treat their animals and prevent infection.

Small Strongyles
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 9].
Statistics Box:
In a study of 461 horses in Sweden, 53,7 % of all horses were discovered to be infected [1].                          From July to September the prevalence was estimated to 78,4% in the horse population, indicating a seasonal trend for infection rate [1].                          Similar trends are seen in Europe and North America showing reported cases with 100% of horses showing small strongyle infection [2].
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach number up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts,  millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [6]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [10].
By providing a better diagnostic tool, farmers will be able to know when to treat the horse in the purpose of avoiding mass rupture and severe consequences.

Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Colon Cancer Detection Mechanism Proposals for Continued Research
The idea is to detect various inputs and create unique reporters or levels of reporters according to inputs. To detect colon cancer we would focus on two or more of the following:
Unique metabolic products (Fermentation - lactic acids)
Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
Heat Detection (Riboswitch)
Collagen cutting enzymes (detect the byproducts)
Unique parts will include: ROS sensor (fine-tune those existing in nature), Riboswitch sensitive to specific temperature, and multi-input switch (creating our own).

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where"

Here we have integrated the equations using the Euler approximation method. Even if the details may change, the results obtained show a similar behavior to the previous graphics.
We are using this new method to show a different integration method than the used before. Here it is easier to show how the repression acts as a modifier of the Michaelis constant of transcription process.
The algorithm used evaluates each species and its change in every step of the algorithm. So the algorithm is:

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," had used in the website for the general public. Having a navigation bar on the side seemed like a fun idea at first but we gave it up to keep things aesthetically pleasing and to make it possible to browse the wiki on all platforms. Scrolling through the content felt like a great choice, so instead of countless different subcategories, we only have eight categories and you can just scroll through them. Sorting the categories felt very difficult, too, but in the end it feels like everything found their own place.
The first thing we did for the wiki was an upload tool: iGEM Wiki Quickifier . With it we could upload content to our team wiki without using the cumbersome wiki interface. We could write our pages directly as HTML files and the script would add the needed template tags as it uploaded the pages to the wiki. Uploading content to other wikis than ours is not implemented (yet), but if you know Python, modifying the script should be an easy task.
We used GitHub to keep our texts synchronized, have backups easily available and make editing the same file simultaneusly feasible. Every change was recorded, so you can browse the complete process from our commit history. Here's the GitHub page of our wiki . You can, of course, also browse the code that's here on the final version of the wiki.
We made the wiki from scratch: it doesn't use any templates. We designed and constructed the wiki completely by ourselves. We utilized Bootstrap and JQuery libraries to ease the mission a bit but the layout and the code is all our work.
The punch card for wiki changes. The only bad time for making the wiki is 7 am. The bigger the circle, the more commits (changes) were made on the wiki code at a time.
The timeline of wiki changes. We did start early, but there still might've been a bit work left to do on the final week.
Social Media
Creating a successful outreach without capturing social media is rather difficult these days. This is why we dedicated ourselves to making a rumble in the internet. And we believe we succeeded well. Our team profile has over 300 likes on Facebook , 160 followers on Twitter and our videos on Youtube have been watched altogether almost thousand times by the date of Wiki freeze. All this out of nothing. This proves that people in Finland indeed find synthetic biology as an interesting field of science; although we have a lot of international followers, too. Facebook and Twitter actually acted as excellent platforms to contact other iGEM teams and the headquarters.
On our website we published a blog so that people could see the life in synthetic biology more"
UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile2#Bactomithril#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," for second time we obtained a weird result: (B2+ & B3+) and (B2+ & B3-) present the same amount of fluorescence.
In conclusion, we know that sfGFP expresses in our e. coli. But we don’t know if it is attached to the external side of the membrane, or if the HIV-1 protease works as expected. As this secretion system seems to be failing, we chose to try other alternatives.
June 25 – July 1, 2012
The Gibson Assemblies of our iGEM team had been failing in the last weeks. This week new enzimes arrived. We hope that this will solve our problem.
Also, this week we tried to redesign our project. Our first task is to continue with our attempts to make a biobrick with the spider silk monomer ADF-3. We ordered the primers that we need to do that.
Now we are exploring the possibility of improve the product of the secretion system developed by Christopher Voig in his paper “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers”. One idea is to attach a growth factor (e.g. recombinant human BMP-2) to the molecule of ADF-3.
But the problem with the secretion system developed by Christopher Voig is that it works on salmonella, and we cannot work with such an infectious bacteria.
July 2 – 8, 2012
This was a week of exams. Therefore, no major advances were accomplished during this week.
July 9 – 15, 2012
This week we made important advances in our wiki. We will start with the template of the iGEM team Johns Hopkins 2011 as a base.
Furthermore, we studied carefully the paper “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers” and its supplementary information. We realized that each protein secreted with this system comes with a 3x FLAG (DYKDDDDK)3. It is a priority for us to find if someone can share us a little of the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Cat# F3165). That way, if we use this secretion system we will be able to quantify the production of our protein of interest. But, if we want to use Voigt´s system, we need attenuated salmonellas with their pathogenicity island 1 intact.
Something similar to Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. After some research we found a professor of our University that works with salmonella (Dr. Susan Bueno). But she"

Early relapse detection
Summary: achievements and issues
Vaccine monitoring
Overview
We were inspired by the work done by Li et al., 2018 where they demonstrated that they could detect with high specificity single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) sites,                           by coupling Cas12a/crRNA system with PCR amplification, regardless of the presence of the T-rich PAM sequence that is necessary for Cas12a recognition.
More precisely, we wanted to show that we could apply this technology for the purposes of our project: for this part, this means detecting our targeted neoantigens sequences. We also wanted to bring this technology a step further by detecting these fragments directly in the blood plasma, without the need of any isolation step.
For experimental purposes, we chose to work with a particular point-mutated fragment that has been highly correlated with melanomagenesis ( Ascierto et al., 2012 ), i.e.                       the BRAF V600E mutation that constitute 90% of all the BRAF V600 mutations in melanoma patients, as well as the original coding sequence for the BRAF protein (Figure 1).
We want to target two regions on each of our DNA templates: the first one harbors a point mutation that we introduced on purpose on the BRAF mutated gene, in order to test for the introduction of the PAM sequence on the Cas12a efficacy.                       The other one contains the BRAF V600E mutation which is already flanked by such motif.
Each of the two regions present in both DNA templates used for this experiment (containing the BRAF V600E or synthetic mutation) is targeted by two potential crRNAs with different guide sequences: the first is fully complementary while                       the second presents a single point mismatch corresponding to the respective wild type or mutated sequence.
During these different experiments, we introduced one or the other (or both) DNA fragments (Figure 1)"

Currently, the scientific community manages synthetic biology, but some applications, provided to generate significant revenues, might be developed despite the nuisance they cause. Therefore, as stated by Lluis Mir, ""it remains the vision of science and society, and not markets."" It is also important that involved researchers retain their critical thinking and continue to communicate the progress of their knowledge even if they work in an industrial or commercial context.

Intellectual properties
Thinking about the intellectual property of our project. We wanted that our treatment could be available at the lowest price. In this context, we asked about the open source development or patenting at least a part? The first option would allow any company to develop and improve it, but a private company could then patent a more rounded version of it, and impose prices that benefit the most. Furthermore, Willy Rozenbaum confirmed us that the clinical development would be very difficult to finance, ""if you can convince a manufacturer to begin the preclinical tests, you will already have protected your model because otherwise you will not find manufacturers to develop it. "" This last point would be less problematic with the second option as the funds generated by a patent would help persuading manufacturers, but access to data would be much more limited.

Bioterrorists drifts
The loss of control of living systems syntheticaly created could be intentional. The synthetic biology and the diffusion of knowledge that it puts at disposal of a large public of genomes, notably pathogenes can be modified at low cost. In the case of our DVS project,some changes could transform our vector in biologic weapon like mentionned François le Fèvre: « we can imagine that instead of target a cancer, we target neurons to send drogues that permit to weaken someone ». From 2003, a CIA report mentionned risks linked to live science development and the difficulty to limit the bioterrorism developement. It is necessary to limit access to data at the risk of slowing down progress of the knowledge in synthetic biology.

Problematics related to the DVS project
One of the objective of this meeting was to discuss some issues related to our project DVS. The general points have been mentioned above, since these point apply to the whole synthetic biology. Specifically, we examined relative risks underlying the introduction of potentially pathogenic agents in the organism.
Let’s begin with the importance of this risk. Mycobacterium avium is sometimes responsible for serious infections in humans. But, as"

Fuel from food waste
-Microbes in food waste like heterotrophs, cyanobacteria, microalgae and purple bacteria produce biohydrogen. Hydrogen has more potential energy than petrol. Hence, food waste can be turned into valuable energy. Fermentative bacteria use carbohydrates like sugar to produce hydrogen and acids. Purple bacteria, use light to produce energy (photosynthesis) and make hydrogen to help them break down molecules such as acids. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080716204805.htm
-Hydrogen is produced by feeding waste products from a chocolate factory to Escherichia coli bacteria. E coli ferments the sugars in the chocolate waste, which generated organic acids so toxic to the bacteria that they began converting formic acid to hydrogen. http://environment.about.com/od/renewableenergy/a/chocolatefuel.htm
-Cellulose waste can be converted to energy by using enzyme cellulase. The gene that codes for cellulase has been isolated and grown in large quantities by E. coli. A number of photosynthetic bacteria, nonphotosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, and green,"

Aalto-Helsinki 2014's Team Seeker can be accessed directly from the Hub.
The ability to customize the Hub according to the need of iGEM teams could be taken further by letting anyone design plugins, such as Helsinki’s seekers, to be integrated. As the whole system is open source, the whole system could be offered for users to modify completely and set up their own Hub for example to test new plugins or functions. These could later on be integrated in the main Hub.
Another idea that was discussed was a more readily available overview not only over all teams, but also with a short summary of what each team is aiming for. This would both make it easier to gain insight of other projects and also simplify the process of finding potential collaboration partners.
Some other people's opinion
We assumed that the communication problems weren’t only issues in Stockholm and Aalto-Helsinki, but to get more information about the communication platforms and collaborating practices within iGEM teams, Aalto-Helsinki launched a team questionnaire.
The questionnaire consisted of multiple choice questions and aimed to gather information about the different platforms teams used to communicate with other  teams and also how teams find each other to start collaborations. By August 5th 23 teams had replied to the questionnaire. Of these only one team felt there was no need for a better collaboration platform. This team used Facebook and email to stay in touch with their collaborating partners. 7 other teams also said they use Facebook and email (and Facebook and email only) to collaborate, but hoped for a better platform. This led us to believe that the wish for a new platform was not only due to the clutter of different platforms. Nearly half (11) of the respondents used more than two platforms, and we thought that they might be having some trouble juggling between the platforms. 17 of our respondents used social media to find the collaborating teams and 19 teams use social media as their collaboration platform (the only or among others).
We predict that this will make collaborating with e.g. Chinese teams very difficult, since they do not have access to Facebook, and instead use their own social media platforms. Facebook is also less common all around Asia than in Western countries. This disrupts the whole point of collaborating, as it is difficult to find teams around the world. From the survey respondees 6 teams did not collaborate, but 5 of these had looked for collaborators. All of these teams also replied that they"

Bacterial DNA ligases
Bacterial DNA ligases are important enzymes for DNA repair and replication. The big difference between bacterial and eukaryotic DNA ligases is their specifity for cofactors. While eukaryotic DNA ligases use ATP as a source for building a phosphodiester bond in the DNA`s phosphate backbone the bacterial ones display a NAD+-dependent biochemical catalysis. These enzymes are totally essential for bacterial survival and are therefore in focus for designing highly specific antiinfectives ( Gajiwala & Pinko, 2004 ). All bacterial DNA ligases possess highly conserved functional domains. Generally, they can be devided into four functionally distinguishable domains, each with characteristic motifs:
Domain 1: Ia, Ib
Domain 2: Oligomer-binding (OB) beta-barrel
Domain 3: Zinc-finger, helix-hairpin-helix motif (HhH)
Domain 4: BRCT domain
All bacterial DNA ligases share three fundamental steps during reaction mechanism:
Adenylation of DNA ligase by transferring hydrolysed AMP from NAD+ to the active site lysine and release of NMN
Tranfer of the AMP from DNA ligase to the 5'-phosphate group of nicked DNA
Formation of a phosphodiester bond by attack of the nick 3'-OH on the 5'-phosphoanhydride linkage and release of free AMP
Figure 7: During the adenylation reaction cycle of NAD+-dependent DNA ligases the linker between the two subdomains Ia (gray) and Ib (yellow) undergoes conformational change to form open and closed state. A: Open state of Ia domain exposing the adenylation site to solvent. B: Closed state of Ia domain is achieved by NAD+ binding. C: AMP-bound form providing adenylated site exposed to solvent and an open form accessible to incoming DNA. D: Deadenylated"

Team Germany Aachen
A successful collaboration was established based on the fact that both our teams are aiming to employ yeast in order to design a biosensor. Our project is focussed on an effective methane sensor development through synthetic biology and metabolic modelling. Team Aachen had some queries regarding the significance of their project in terms of biosafety. The team was also concerned regarding the significance of melatonin in the study of the stability of DNA in neurodegenerative disorders. They enquired whether their facilitated measuring method of melatonin was helpful in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. We helped answer their questions with the help of Dr. Puneet Gandhi who was a part of the biosafety meeting that we had arranged on our campus.
Team Aachen also shared their project description with us, which revealed their use of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) technique to develop a melatonin sensor which would sense the presence of melatonin from saliva samples. This helped us understand as to how a biosensor development is to be done.
The information we received from their team significantly helped us begin the process of model building. Mr. Jan suggested the use of SimBiology tools for model building to build a gene regulation model for a chassis organism using MATLAB. This turned out to be of great help for us as our metabolic modelling part of the project was initiated with help of team Aachen.  We helped spread the word about their project on the “iGEM Day” that we organized in our institute and the same was done by Team Aachen on their side. Video calls were held with their team to discuss both our projects’ applications and the possibility of marketization of our biosensing technology.
Team Bioilluminati IIT Kanpur
Our team had interactive sessions with the iGEM team from IIT Kanpur. Both our projects are in environmental track and thus we actively discussed and exchanged project ideas and their plausible effects. During these sessions, we discussed our methodology, upcoming strategies and helped troubleshoot each other's issues. Both of our teams worked together in human practices and outreach programs.

• Consist of 2 or more cyclobutane rings
• Highly strained structure
• Can be isolated from ammonia oxidising bacteria living in sea
• Process of synthesis not clear
• Anaerobic ammonium oxidising bacteria have cell membranes consisting of concatenated cyclobutane moieties (ladderane lipids). This structure is a result of the process of converting ammonia to nitrogen gas in the absence of oxygen.
• One possible pathway: Gene clusters of K. stuttgartiensis -> anaerobic synthesis of PUFA -> ladderane lipids.
• Possible application as building blocks in optoelectronic
Anammoxosome contains the enzymes of the redox reactions, prevents the poison intermediates (hydrazine and hydroxylamine ) from killing the bacteria.
Reaction process:-
- Reduction of nitrite by nitrite reductase
- Production of hydrazine by hydrazine hydrolase
- Oxidation of hydrazine into nitrogen gas by oxidizing enzyme
- Production of ATP (proton motive force)
Enzyme sulfite reductase (ferredoxin):-
ammonium + oxidized ferredoxin + H2O = nitrite + reduced ferredoxin + H+
ferredoxin acts as an electron transfer of this reaction
may this reaction bi-pass the production of hydrazine ?
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH)
Problem: PAHs are a class of organic compounds that are toxic and carcinogenic. PAHs are released into the environment through processes like the combustion of fossil fuels, plastic, coke production and vehicle exhaust. PAHs can be found in air (cigarette smoke) and accumulate in soil. It can also be found in water due to industrial effluents and oil spills. The poor water solubility of PAH causes it to be deposited in sediments and aquatic organisms, affecting fish farms, etc.
Solution: Factories release PAHs into water or ponds which affect survival of fishes in fish farm. Bacillus subtilis can break up the PAHs and eliminate this pollutant. In addition, the Bacillus also contains gene which codes for the production of vitamin which is beneficial to the growth of the fish. To exploit this benefit, we need to find a way for Zooplankton (found in aquatic environment) to incorporate the Bacillus and its vitamin-producing gene. The fish feeding on the zooplankton will then receive a good source of vitamin for its growth."

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Results-content_-_-_TEXT.html," capsulatus and E. cowli non-encapsulated and encapsulated either in NMS medium or rumen fluid
M. capsulatus grows optimally in atmospheres containing 45 % methane according to [3] or 20 % according to [4]. The methane concentration in the rumen is about 27 % [5]. However, as the explosivity margin of methane is 5 % we decided to stick to a methane concentration of 2 % due to safety considerations. We took this discrepancy into consideration in our modeling approach.
This problem could be circumvented by including alternative activity assays into further investigations which do not rely on methane but instead make use of the broad substrate range of sMMO [6]. A convenient possibility would be the use of naphthalene [7]. A well-established naphthalene assay is based on a colour reaction which is easy to detect either by the naked eye or photometrically for quantitative analysis. Enzyme activity could also be detected indirectly by measuring a decrease in oxygen concentration.  For quantification, of expressed enzymes antibodies directed against the different sMMO subunits could be developed. This would be a valuable contribution to the iGEM Registry as well as facilitate future research on the sMMO. Better quantification of the enzyme would also enable the determination of degradation rates.
To confirm the results obtained with the methane sensor other measurements such as gas chromatography could be performed in the future to examine the activity of the sMMO. Nevertheless, the results suggest functionality of our final construct and the encoded enzyme complex.

UChicago,2014,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," one will work this time :/ Promoter+TyrR sequencing came back negative today, so 12 overnight cultures were made (since colony PCR doesn’t work well for this construct). Rikki found a random IPTG+GFP+MutD plate in the cold room that looked promising (a lot of colonies, some visibly green, some white). Colony PCR was run on four green colonies and four white colonies.
Thursday
Miniprepped Promoter+TyrR overnights. Rikki meshed together a new protocol using invitrogen buffers but following a lot of Promega’s timing and the yield’s are great--like 500ng/uL). The promoter+TyrR was digested with XbaI and PstI and run on a gel alongside digested promoter:
ladder, promoter, samples 1-5, sample 12
ladder, promoter, samples 6-11
It looks like some of the samples have TyrR!!! (1541 bp) Sample 10 probably didn’t cut right. Submitting samples 1, 3, 12, 7 for sequencing tomorrow morning. Looks promising!!
Colony PCRed MutD:
IPTG+GFP was in the first lane, but must not have been added correctly.We compared the bp size to our IPTG+GFP plasmid and it lookes like 5-8 are just IPTG+GFP (they were picked from green colonies). Samples 1-4 (picked white colonies) appear to have MutD, so they will be miniprepped and sent in for sequencing. Plated EmrR overnight cultures on rif plates and dilutions on control plates (following the rif protocol) and made overnights of EmrR and Dam for the next batch of rif assays. Miniprepped more IPTG+GFP for future ligations.
Friday
Submitted promising Promoter+TyrR and IPTG+GFP+MutD for sequencing. These results should be good!!! Three of the four mutators that were Quikchanged have colonies on the plates! It actually looks like Turbo doesn’t work as well as Q5 of Phusion, which is probably why our results for Quikchange have been pretty bad so far. Overnight cultures were made of these colonies. The ligations of IPTG+GFP+ DinB, MutD, MutL, UmuC don’t appear to have worked, and we’re probably going to scrap anything we don’t get soon.

SWOT Analysis
Developing our Technology
We are pioneering a live-cell Field-Ready Electrochemical Detection system for toxins present in our environment. Initially, we are focusing on detecting general toxins in oil sands environments, however the immense flexibility our system provides significant opportunities to expand into sensors for almost any compound of interest. With a quick and robust output, our technology offers many advantages over existing biosensor technologies.
Overview
In response to the need for rapid and more on-site technologies to monitor toxins in the oil and gas sector, FREDsense is pioneering a novel biosensor technology. Our first generation product is designed to detect a variety of oil and gas related contaminants in water samples. The system will be more rapid and more portable than current analytical technologies.
Our Product
Our first generation product is a biosensor for general toxicity in a water sample. It senses a variety of toxic chemicals that the bacteria responds to. These include examples such as naphthenic acids (highly corrosive), sulphur-containing compounds (such as those that cause acid rain) and nitrogen-containing compounds. Our sensor reports the overall toxicity and whether or not it reaches a critical threshold. Our major goal is to make it easier and faster to inform people and companies as to the toxicity of their water.
Future Generation Products
Future generation products will include measurement sensors for specific toxic compounds such as n"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," needs to be filled to the end with the current output. If not, the system introduces a latency in droplet. Depending on how far off the output is from the end of the tube, sample volume inaccuracies are introduced that propagate throughout the run. To reduce this error, TERRA currently requires the user to start the system once the TERRA Adapter chip has stabilized. TERRA then calculates the time necessary for the output nozzle to be filled by the output based on the given flow rate.
Plate Security
If the plate support is close to the Y-axis, the plate may jostle, resulting in sample volumes not entering selected well. Close proximity between the plate support and the Y-axis coupled with sudden movement at the start of homing creates a slight ramming effect, jostling the plate. To fix issues relating to plate security, TERRA automatically sends the plate support to the upper left corner at the end of the run to distance it away from the Y-axis. In addition to fixing plate jostling, moving the plate reader to the upper left corner acts as a loading location so that the user can easily access their well plate."

We optimized diagnostic genomic PCR reactions for verification of putative integration of the kanamycin fragment in/near the lacZ locus (figure 10). When designing and optimizing these genomic PCR reactions, we favoured PCR reactions that always result in amplicons, regardless of integration. Such anticipating primer design helps evaluating the results and judging whether genomic PCR on a picked colony worked in the first place, and then evaluate whether targeted integration took place. When integration occurs, the amplicon size increases. The control used for these genomic PCRs was purified isolated gDNA of the BL21DE3 parent strain. Alternatively, we were planning on whole genome sequencing of individual colonies, in the case of encountering blue or white colonies, to verify where and how many times the donor DNA would have been integrated, and whether this activity was indeed concentrated near the original target sequence.

3.5 In Vitro Functionality of the Fusion Protein
Aim: Identify the in vitro conditions for the functionality of the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein.
Approach: We performed the functionality test in three main parts:
Loading of sgRNA and the desired target DNA to the individual dxCas9 was confirmed by trypsin resistance assay ( Jiang et al, 2015 ) and electrophoretic mobility shift (binding) assay (EMSA) ( Sternberg et al, 2015 ).
The ability of the Tn5 dimer to load the adapter DNA was demonstrated by EMSA ( Whitfield et al, 2008 ).
The ability of the fusion protein to load its components was demonstrated by EMSA, which closely followed by the integration assay ( Whitfield et al, 2008 ).

A First Introduction - Dr. Ding's One Summer
Do you want to enjoy more sunshine rather than fail and fail again in lab?
Do you want to design a biological system with computers rather than by thinking day and night?
Do you want to have more reasonable plans rather than an uncertain one for your experiments?
Follow Dr. Ding , our ABCD will try to make your dreams come true.
Wait!It would be much more efficient to get some general ideas about our ABCD firstly: Mathematical Model , Design Level , Design Type .
Now, tell ABCD what you want. There are different ways for you to Input your desired dynamics to ABCD.
Are there any restrictions on this biological network that happen to meet your needs? Good news! Dr. Ding will tell you how to complete this in ABCD.
Our ABCD engine starts working. The state of art algorithms we implement in ABCD will make design process automatically and different feasible solutions will be generated.
How can you find real components to construct the system. Thanks to BioBricks . Our database makes it possible to retrieve them while some new standards should be proposed.
Also, if our memory serves right, there are quite a few brilliant software packages specified at BioBrick organizing and related management, for example, Clotho from Berkeley's dry team, 2008. If combined with these softwares, the construction will be even more applicable.
Now, you may feel happy to realize a function such as oscillation , perfect adaptation or bistability following our solutions. But we still hold earnest expectations. Is it possible to complete the fabrication automatically in the future ?

Step 2
Developing our Paper-Based Assay
Throughout the process of building our paper-based assay, we consulted professionals who helped us change our assay to better fit the needs of healthcare professionals and patients everywhere.
Who we talked to:
Dr. Linnes
Dr. Linnes is an assistant professor in Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University who specializes in developing paper-based assays. She helped our team greatly by providing examples of paper-based assays, identifying important variables in assay design, and allowing our assay designer to use materials and equipment in her lab. Because of her large contribution, it is difficult to narrow down discrete changes she provoked in our design; that being said, we directly implemented her suggestion to have a 3-step maximum on our assay.
Step 3
Learn how to Relay our research to the public
Communicating our research and transporting or assay to the public is important when making our assay more globally accessible.
Who we talked to:
Dr. Cooky
Dr. Cooky is an associate professor of American Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Purdue University. During our project she helped us in focusing in on how we can help the general public understand our research. She also brought to light that yeast infections are “a relatively minor medical issue that creates a disproportionate impact on women’s lives.”

How the youth is getting educated on sexual health and what their programs entail
Whether or not sexual health education programs are teach about infections like vulvovaginal candidiasis
Different misconceptions that surround women’s health and the implications of what going to get treatment for infections like vulvovaginal candidiasis entail
How different cultures view women’s health and the challenges women face in obtaining a test and getting treatment

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Parts#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," cultures were vigorously shaken before experiment. At regular time interval, a 100ul samples was  taken approximately 0.5cm from the surface and transferred into a microplate maintained on ice. Every 10 minutes 100ul samples was taken with same method. At the end of the experiment, OD600 were measured using microplate reader. at last the plot was drawn by OD600 with time.
Result：
We induced the expression of antigen 43 by adding IPTG. After 4 hours we put the tube on the table to see the auto-aggregation phenomenon. After 20 minutes there is significant aggregation which can be easily observed by eyes. We then took photograph to show this phenomenon as figure 4.
Figure 4: Autoaggregation caused by antigen 43. The  right one is strain expressing antigen 43, which shows significant autoaggregation.
Then the result of the auto-aggregation assay is shown in figure 5. The strain that did not add IPTG also shows significant drop in OD600. We propose this is because the leakage expression of T7 polymerase in BL21 strains and due to the amplifier the expression of antigen 43 is in great amount.
FIgure 5: The OD of the supernatant to time. There is a significant drop of OD after nearly 20 minutes in those strains that expressing antigen 43, and those do not express antigen 43 show constant OD of the supernatant.

'Design Notes
Since the original antigen 43's RBS is regulated by intracellular factors such as the oxidative particles, and in our bioabsorbant kit we need to express some proteins such as DsbA which can affect the oxidative condition in the cell, it is unconvenient for us to use antigen 43. We therefore replace the RBS by a standard RBS B0034 which is not regulated by so many factors in the cell. By this design, we are able to express antigen 43 without considering the condition"

Week 6
Day 26, July 22
No Lab Today!
Day 27, July 23
We ran into budget problems today as the primers cost more than the amount of donation we have. We also researched more to change pH in plate media through buffer. Lastly, we worked more on human practices by researching Dr. Zoloth's area of expertise.
Day 28, July 24
We redid the transformation once again. We have controls to make sure that both the plasmids and the cells are good. In addition, we developed a rough draft of a powerpoint for human practices and looked up how to do PCR. We also ordered primers.
Day 29, July 25
The primers arrived today, and we will PCR tomorrow. We also inoculated a colony today. We looked at how to make M9 (minimal media), but we were missing ammonium chloride. This will be postponed until Monday. The transformations worked well, proving again that our cells are competent. Two plasmids from the kit failed, but both plasmids obtained from our Dr. Leonard's lab worked well.
Day 30, July 26
Today we started PCR! We suspended the primers in nuclease free water. We only performed PCR on ASR-RSB. We performed the assay under the guidance of our TA. In the afternoon, we tried PCR purification with last year's kit (our kits will arrive soon!), but the yields were low.
Week 7
Day 31, July 29
Since our yields were very low, we decided to perform another PCR. This time, we went ahead and used all of the primers we ordered. Afterwards, we purified the DNA with our new kits from Epoch, and the yields were acceptable. Today, we also tried to digest the PCR products from Friday, but due to faint bands, gel purification was aborted. We also transformed cells!
Day 32, July 30
Today, we minipreped pSC101 and ended with acceptable yield. We also prepared digestion on all of the PCR products from yesterday. Lastly, we inoculated the transformed cells in preparation of the miniprep today.
Day 33, July 31
We finished digestion that we started yesterday and started ligation. We have two protocols for ligation (one short and one long), so we will prepare for the longer ligation today. In addition, we minipreped pSB4A5 and got  surprisingly high concentration of"

In this week, we also learn more about how to express our protein, how to test our construct, how to measure the construct activities and did SDS-PAGE analysis.
Week 4
We focused to make a simple trial for our method to test the protein band of cutinase, and conversion methode, and discuss about our construct characterization especially for OmpA-LcCutinase construct (PET degradation module) as our main construct. We also discuss for synthetic gene cloning method. In this week we also focused on finishing our construct in PSB1C3 backbone and ready for shipment. Brainstoarming also become our routine activities because we found some failure in this week and feel not ready yet facing the parts submision deadline. We also try to elaborate how to make a modeling for our system and discuss with the expert.
September
Week 1
We have to prepare our parts submission form and check all of positive construct to make sure the condition of the construct is still good. In this week, synthetic gene, the thing that we waiting for one and half month finnaly arrived in our campuss. We try to make optimal reaction for our limited stock of synthetic gene. We try to clone our synthetic gene into some backbone including some of commercial clone vector and PSB1C3 of course. No collonies observed, so desperate and we discuss and evaluate our method and take a note of some mistake that we did in this method. Fortunatelly we have primer for our synthetic gene so we could do amplification using PCR for our synthetic gene. We also make new competent cell and trying electhrophoration transformation method instead of common heat shock methode. Still, no colonies observed.
Week 2
We try to clone our synthetic again. We must be succes in this week to step forward finishing our main construct. We try several method and try to use overnight ligation method. Finnaly, we got the positive colony, so happy. We also checked our plasmid again and found that some of our construct disappear but the other is still in good condition. We also make a optimization for PCR using touchdown and temperature gradient method to check the good temperature condition for the primer.
Week 3
We did PCR for construct confirmation for the collonies through crude PCR method using the optimal annealing temperature. We also did plasmid isolation for the positive colonies. We also make the method plan for PET degradation characterization using our construct and compared to UC"

The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," time scales and responses. We believe that the modularity of our membrane sensor and the complexity of intracellular cell signaling allows for a wide range of responses. To enable the sensors to act upon a wide range of time scales we consider multiple intracellular signaling components. These components all respond to a decrease in mutual distance of the membrane proteins as a result of ligand binding.
Fast Signaling Components - Exploiting Bioluminiscence
Two well-known principles to translate a close proximity into a measurable signal are Resonance Energy Transfer and the use of split luciferases. Even though these principles are very different, both response elements emit light, yielding a measurable signal. After ligand binding, these signaling components yield a virtually immediate response.
Figure 10: A) Resonance Energy Transfer and B) split luciferases both translate close proximity into a measurable signal in the form of light.
Resonance Energy Transfer is a physical process which can take place between fluorophores light emission when they are in close proximity (1-10nm) [15] . An electron which has been transferred to its ‘excited state’ falls back to its ‘ground state’. The energy which is released by the electron falling back to its ground state is normally released in the form of light. In the case of Resonance Energy Transfer, however, the energy of the electron falling back to its ground state is coupled to a transition of an electron in the RET Acceptor from its ground state to the excited state (see Figure 11).
Figure 11: Simplified energy-level diagram of RET. A) Normally, an excited electron falls back to its ground state under the emission of light (a radiative transition). B) In the case of Resonance Electron Transfer, an excited electron in the donor falls back to its ground state. This transition is coupled to the excitation of an electron in the acceptor. This excited electron falls back normally under the emission of light.
The efficiency of Resonance Energy Transfer is known to be dependent on a few factors, most importantly the relative orientation of the chromophores as well as the mutual distance of the chromophores [15] . A decreased mutual distance between the donor and acceptor increases the efficiency very significantly. This feature of Resonance Energy Transfer is exploited in the design of our membrane sensor. As a result of the reduced distance between the donor and acceptor, Resonance Energy Transfer is thus more efficient. Relatively more light will be emitted by the acceptor when the ligand is bound. The resulting signal is thus, per definition, ratiometric"

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," detachment of plastic in apparel in washing machines. Degradation of plastics on the beaches results due to surface embrittlement and micro cracking, yielding micro particles that are carried into water by wind or tidal action. Comparing to macro particles like plastic bottles, which can easily be removed by mechanical procedures, micro particles are very small (<5mm) so that they cannot be seen by the human eye. Their extraction is hard to handle and appropriate filtering would be very expensive. In some marine test areas micro particles of PET already exceed the concentration of oceanic plankton. Combined with it´s property to bind toxins, these micro particles become a hazard for nature and it´s biological variability.  Animals with gills and filter feeder integrate this particles in their organism and earlier estimations assume that 44% (Rios (2007)) of sea bird feed their offsprings with this not nutrient mass. The offsprings starve with filled stomachs (Andrady (2011)). It has been shown that PET enrichs in the global food chain and therefore also threatens the health of terrestrial beings. A threat wich rises every day new microparticles emerge and no arrangements are made to reduce the concentration of these particles. If this trend continues and it looks like it does, areas where the amount of plastic particles exceed the amount of plancton will no longer be exeptional, it will become normal. Consequences of this trend should not be underestimated. Stupidly it is not only rubbish wich is careless thrown away indeed PET is a feedstock obtain from crude oil. A rational consequence would be to extract this feedstock from where it causes massive damage and reuses it again. Until now there exist no efficient an economic procedures for extraction of PET from the oceans.  This year an interdisciplinary and self-organized team of students from the Technical University of Darmstadt is forcing this challenge at the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM). Their goal is to create a new bacterium which can transfer PET, normally not useable for organisms into components that can be metabolized. With assistance of techniques form synthetic biology they are building a biological machine, creating an organism from scratch. The new organisms should be used to convert the components of PET to endproduct which can be used for chemical or pharmaceutical industries. For this challange new mechanisms are integrated in the bacterium which will be descibed in detail in chapter two. A predictable kind of biology should be used to avoid the increase of PET in food chain, reuse feedstock and in the same step clean nature from human rubbish. The goal is intelligible but are"

Two PIs
Dr. Keli Tian
Being the first PI, I spent this whole summer vacation with these high school students who are interested deeply in Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I enjoyed meeting and working alongside so many driven young individuals, who worked tirelessly to bring their ideas to life. I’m so proud of these young girls and boys. I am a quiet person, but I love to stay with these young people, because they can influence me with their energy and vitality. Besides the work, I love to travel, do yoga and spend time with my friends and family!

And I found I was interested in Synthetic Biology and iGEM gradually. I really enjoyed seeing that my students were doing experiments in the lab. iGEM offers them an amazing opportunity to make their idea to reality. This is the first iGEM team in Shandong province. I hope these students can continue this activity, which let more and more students to participate in iGEM

Perhaps the ITT doesn't yield a functional TetR, or we didn't have the optimal concentration of binding DNA (too much nonspecific interactions?). We'll definitely continue the MITOMI practise to find out.
Tuesday, June 28 2011
In order to avoid putting the lysis cassette and the LacI-TetR construct all on the same plasmid, the assembly designers chose to use a two-plasmid strategy. To get things started, we took the P23019 plasmid and the J61002 plasmid from the iGEM registry. The p23019 plasmid comes with chloramphenicol resistance, while the J61002 plasmid comes with ampicillin resistance and an RFP (red fluorescent protein) gene.
Henrike and Irina designed primers for both plasmids, with the goal of amplifying the following four parts:
1) a pTet-RFP segment (820 bp)
Primer 1: J61002-Ptet-RFP-r
Primer 2: J61002-RFP-f
DNA template: Plate 1, 18 C
2) a J61002 plasmid backbone with a terminator (2334 bp)
Primer 1: J61002-f
Primer 2: J61002-term-r
DNA template: Plate 1, 18 C
3) a constitutive promoter for TetR (725 bp)
Primer 1: Pconst-tetR-f
Primer 2: TetR-r
DNA template: TetR Repressilator plasmid
4) P23019 plasmid (2242 bp)
Primer 1: P23019-r
Primer 2: P23019-f
DNA template: Plate 4, 14E
With a first PCR, we were able to amplify the pTet-RFP segment and the promoter for TetR, but neither of the backbones was amplified. The iProof PCR was done using 40 seconds of elongation time at 55 C.
Wednesday, 29 June 2011
The mixed success of the previous day's PCR required a change in tactics. First, it was decided that the elongation time should be increased from 40 seconds to 1 minute. Second, it was deemed important to take melting temperature into consideration. The IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies) toolbox allows you to compute melting temperatures for sequences. Inserting the primer sequences yielded the following heats:

BioBrick-A-Bot: Sharing and Collaboration in Automated BioBrick Assembly
(New Approach to Human Practice in Synthetic Biology)
Ways to Facilitate Collaboration
BioBrick-A-Bot  is a prototype of a automated BioBrick DNA assembling robot (hereafter called ‘bot’). We have demonstrated with a proof-of-principle that it works. This is only the first step. Once this is done, other iGEM teams can build and customize their own, inexpensive bots. Collaboration is made extremely easy because of the 3 design philosophies below:  replicability, interchangeability and extensibility.
Replicability
The cost of building your own bots is about US $700. The Lego Parts are easily accessible. We will provide hardware construction instructions in a document form, so that iGEM teams can follow and build ALPHA and PHI modules. We will provide RobotC source codes to iGEM teams too.  So, It is easy to replicate BioBrick-A-Bot Model C that we show in the Proof-of-Principle Demo.
Interchangeability
Interchangeability is the next logical step to collaboration and sharing. We have shown a proof-of-principle that it is possible to build two different physical implementations of ALPHA module, with different geometric configuration and physical dimensions, and still run the same software. Hence various other iGEM teams are encourage to customize their own variants of the ALPHA modules. These ALPHA modules should work seamlessly with the software provided. iGEM teams are also encourage to check in new ALPHA implementation in the registry, so as to facilitate sharing and collaborations.
Extensibility
The next phase in collaboration is actually extensibility. This would mean adding new functionalities to BioBrick-A-Bot"

Overview
Genetic doping has been on the list of prohibited substances since 2003 and its use has been suspected for almost as long. However, until today no method for gene doping detection has been implemented by the World Anti-doping Agency. By developing and demonstrating a proof-of-principle of our method, ADOPE, we can be the first to this niche market. Our analysis and market research lead us to a distinct value proposition canvas revealing the needs of our main stakeholders, the anti-doping agencies.
We also identified applications beyond our current scope. The method is highly valuable  to the Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association , who would like to see our method implemented in horse racing doping tests. In addition, the Dutch National Bloodbank Sanquin would like to apply the method for less invasive prenatal screening, and the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research (RIKILT) for food safety applications.
We have taken significant steps to ensure the future implementation of our idea. By writing a grant application to the Partnership for Clean Competition and a collaboration proposal with Oxford Nanopore Technologies , we are in the starting blocks to demonstrate the applicability of ADOPE in the field. A second grant application is in preparation by the Brouns lab (TU Delft) , our supervising lab, involving the Delft Sports Engineering Institute . The institute would further support the development of our ideas financially  and connect with an extensive network in the world of professional sports. Oxford Nanopore Technologies indicated that our proposal is of interest to them and it would fit well within their plans.
Based on our network consisting of companies and institutions, we see an ideal basis to achieve a demonstration of our technology.  We aim to become the first and best gene doping detection method to be implemented in doping detection laboratories worldwide.
Market analysis
To the best of our knowledge, no method for gene doping detection is currently implemented by the world anti-doping agency for testing on real athlete samples. This does not mean the problem is new: the World anti-doping agency (WADA) banned gene doping already in 2003, and rumors, accusations and initial tests have been dotting the gene doping timeline (figure 1) since then.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid"

Shift of switch point and maxima of dose response curve was observed in dyad-sequence mutants, which shows that the binding affinity between TF and its operator site greatly influence bacterial sensitivity to mercury.

Modelling and Simulation
Our model involves both activation and repression systems. Activation of asr promoter in acidic medium results in production of GFP and tetR proteins. Increasing tetR in the system results in repression of tet promoter and hence reduction in the production of RFP.
Rates of formation of the above mentioned proteins can directly be related to the respective respressor/activator by using Hill’s function.
Rate of production of protein Y = f(X*), where f is an input Hill function, and X* is the active form of activator/repressor X.
The Hill parameters are β, K and n.
β: Maximal rate of expression of protein.
K (Activation coefficient): Concentration of X* that is needed to significantly activate expression of Y.
n (Cooperativity coefficient): Determined by the binding cooperativity of active for of repressor/activator to the binding site on promoter.
For our model we simulated the acid inducible part by creating and simulating the following equations using MATLAB:
The input concentration of H+ and concentration of tetR are directly considered in the above equations.
An assumption has been made here that all of the amount of activator/repressor is present in the active form.
The parameters for simulating the above equations were taken from team ETH Zurich , iGEM 2011's work. Some of the parameters have been assumed due to their non-availability.
SIMULATION RESULTS:
GFP vs pH
RFP vs pH

Fig 1.6: PHA plastic beads in culture
We then use brilliant blue G250 to dye the both the experiment group and the control group. We allow 5 minute before washing off the extra dye with water for several time.
Fig 1.7: Photos of the beginning and the end of the experiment.
There is a visual difference [Fig 1.7] between the control and the experiment group, whit the experiment slightly more blue that the control group.
Though having a naked-eye distinguishable difference group between the experiment and control group, the difference was limited. In other words, it means our biofilm’s ability to stick to untreated PHA plastic beads is limited. To stick our biofilm on those beads, we need certain modifications like carving drills on PHA plastic beads.
III. Period 2 - CotA - SpyCatcher
Gene CotA from B. subtilis could translate as laccase in E. coli cells [Fig 2.1]. The gene was cloned on to pET28a plasmid, promoted by T7 promoter and could be induced by IPTG.
Fig 2.1: CotA promoted by T7 promoter.
We then added the SpyCatcher sequence ahead of CotA gene [Fig 2.2] so that we can produce laccase with spycatcher.
Fig 2.2: CotA-SpyCatcher promoted by T7 promoter.
We also figured a way to secret our CotA protein out of the host cell [Fig 2.3]. Signal peptides are capable to lead the  behind it out of the cell. A signal peptide sequence was also added ahead of cotA sequence. Three signal peptides was tested: Pelb, PhoA, OmpA.
Fig 2.3: Signal peptides-CotA
We first tried to visualize the oxidation function of the laccase. So we made several solid LB media with Azo dyes mix in them and try to let bacteria decompose the pigment [Fig 2.4]. However, our laccase activity doesn’t seem to be better than the negative control group. Therefore, we need to find a quantitative method to measure laccase activity.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," we decided to clone the erythromycin resistance gene (EmR) by ourselves. We searched the vector carrying EmR and found an iGEM team HKUST in 2010 working with it. We got the pMG36e vector from the team and cloned the EmR gene out onto pSB1C3 (EmR/pSB1C3, BBa_K2230001). We also made RBS-EmR/pSB1C3 (BBa_K2230002) and RBS-EmR-TT/pSB1C3 (BBa_K2230003) by assembling RBS (B0034) and double terminator (B0015) parts, respectively. These will provide iGEM team this resistance gene as selection marker in the future.

Type: Composite part (device)
Cloning:
RBS-EmR which was cut and gel-eluted from RBS-EmR/pSB1C3 (BBa_K2230002) was assembled with CP29-RBS-aeBlue/pLBA169 (BBa_K2230000)
Function:
A vector can be used to transform Lactobacillus acidophilus by chromosomal homologous recombination at the downstream location of slpA, which encodes a surface layer protein A. EmR (erythromycin resistance gene), which is driven by the high constitutive promoter of slpA, acts as a selection marker. And aeBlue gene, which is driven by the wide host range and high constitutive promoter CP29, acts as a reporter. The transformed L. acidophilus will be erythromycin resistant and express blue color proteins.

As negative controls, 0 L ssDNAp 1 was added. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
The d-AuNPs aggregated when salt was added from a final concentration of 1M*⅓=333 mM to 2M*⅓=666 mM NaCl. When ssDNAp (1 uM) were added, the concentrations at which the d-AuNPs aggregated increased. However, at 2 M NaCl, the d-AuNPs still aggregated although the aggregation was less intense compared to the salt aggregation without ssDNAp’s.
From the data, the spectrum of the mixtures with 0 mM, 1000 mM and 2000 mM NaCl were plotted from both samples: with and without ssDNAp. Additionally, the from all the samples either with or without ssDNAp addition, the ratio 620/520 was calculated and plotted over the salt concentration.

I finished editing it in the morning and it consisted of a very general overview of the scripting involved with what I have been doing in the virtual lab. I did not go into a lot of detail to prevent my video from going over ten minutes. I showed a little bit of the restriction digest and bacterial transformation activities for what I have so far.

1. Plasmid Isolation
I have isolated the Pqrr4+B0034 plasmids from yesterday's overnight cultures, and the purity and concentration of them were measured using nanodrop. They were pure enough to move on with.
2. Restriction digest
The isolated Pqrr4+B0034 plasmid was then cut with XbaI and PstI and ran on a 2% gel at 90V in order to verify the presence of the circuit. The following is an image of the gel:
The lower bands of the colonies 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10 seem to be above the positive control bands, which is what was expected. Thus it is now ready for sequencing.

Evry,2015,Team:Evry#Project#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," intracellular pathogen has the ability to enter DCs and to activate MHC I Pathway. Once inside the phagosome, it releases a lysosomal enzyme that is active at acidic pH to degrade the phagolysosome, the Listeriolysine O (LLO). This therapy performed well in Phase I clinical trial against invasive carcinoma of the cervix (12). However, Listeria has to be genetically modified to suppress genes that could cause virulence reversion and raises again safety concerns. In addition, Listeria immunotherapy is not as adapted as E. coli for metabolic engineering to overproduce antigens and co-stimulatory molecules within DCs for a strong immune response.
E. coli has therefore been proposed to inject the tumor antigen in DCs with the heterologous LLO from Listeria. Immunization of mice by direct injection of E. coli LLO/OVA provided a potent anti-tumor response, resulting in complete protection in 75% of mice (13). The drawback is LLO toxicity for the cell, with the absence of regulation by E. coli on the contrary of Listeria. In addition, even if E. coli is less pathogenic than Listeria, a live vector that replicates inside a patient raises safety issues. (13). 
To address both safety and efficiency, we selected S. cerevisiae for the following advantages:
A. S. cerevisiae is non pathogenic : phase I clinical trial with subcutaneous injection of heat-killed yeasts S. cerevisiae against hepatitis C showed no dose-related toxicity (14), demonstrating the safety of this vector for future human applications in cancer immunotherapy.
B. S. cerevisiae has a strong adjuvant effect, explaining why zymosan, an extract of S. cerevisiae cell wall, has been used to stimulate inflammation for 50 years (15). In particular, the mannose stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines production in monocytes and dendritic cells, making the vector appropriate for APC targeting (16,17). 
C. S. cerevisiae already proved its anti-tumor capacity : the first demonstration of recombinant yeast to induce adaptative immunity was shown in 2001 by Stubbs et al against ovalbumin tumor cells (18). Yeast expressing the mutated RAS protein inside their cytosol induced reduction of lung tumors in mice and a quarter of the tumors were eradicated (19). Tumor antigen MART-1 was also expressed in yeast cytosol and induced both CD4+ and CD8+ in mice."

She supports our new birth control method, especially because she’s only familiar with post-impregnation birth controls (like abortions) rather than preventive measures. We believe that if our method is approved by the Brazilian government for distribution, we could not only reduce the rate of dangerous at-home abortions, but potentially lower the rate of associated health complications and death in fertile women.
China
Zhi, Former Chinese Citizen
We spoke with a former Chinese Citizen named Zhi. When Zhi lived in China, they witnessed first-hand the one-child-per-couple policy where women were often felt forced to have abortions or be sterilized; babies were often abandoned or given up for adoption, especially if the child was female [1] . Read More >> The regime change in 2016 allowed women to have up to two children; however, the number of children a woman can have is still determined by the government rather than by the parents, and with the government’s desire to increase the Chinese population, birth control is becoming more difficult to access. According to Zhi, many people in China are unfamiliar with contraceptives and Chinese officials are working to increase information using social media. We hope that our brochure can help the Chinese officials’ efforts to provide better knowledge and understanding of modern contraception methods.
Colombia
Yeraldin, Colombian Citizen
Yeraldin, a Colombian-born citizen, believes that our birth control method research is a meaningful pursuit. According to Yeraldin, “there are many unwanted pregnancies in Colombia, but it is a problem because there is no money to buy [contraceptives]”. Yeraldin believes that an easy, affordable birth control option could minimize the large amount of unplanned pregnancies currently in Colombia. She does not know of any specific rumors on birth control in Colombia because birth control is rarely discussed. We hope to prompt the discussion of birth control by contacting Colombian officials in charge of regulating contraception and ask them if/how they plan to combat the lack of discussion around birth control.

She helped us gain insight on birth control in Colombia.

Molecular machinery at work
Motivation
Biosensor and cell-free are not mutually exclusive. Cell-free biosensors have been described in the literature ( Pellinen et al. 2004 ) and it was demonstrated that they have quite many advantages ( see background page ) compared to cell-based approaches. The output of a biosensor is commonly realised via proteins. For easy evaluation, the output should be in a form that can be adressed directly, for example color or fluorescence. The challenge for us who were eager to stay cell-free therefore was to build functional proteins without the help of whole cells. Fortunately, the components needed to faciliate in vitro protein production from a DNA template are well defined. All components together can be summarized to the term molecular machinery. Parts of this machinery are for example RNA polymerase, ribosomes, amino acids... for a detailed summary please be referred to our background page .
With the molecular machinery, the socalled Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) is possible. It is astonishing that CFPS rarely appeared in iGEM in the recent years despite its advantages. We set out to establish CFPS protocols and setups that can easily be performed by us and future iGEM teams. Still, our main goal was the in vitro production of a reporter protein as necessary condition to create a cell-free biosensor"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ide evaluating enzyme performances, we also wanted to specifically detect and quantify
3HPA
in our cells.   We planned to do that via HPLC and mass spectrometry. Establishing a HPLC/Mass spectrometry protocol is also essential for calibrating our biosensors.   The identification of malonyl-CoA as intermediate of our pathway is not so challenging because the CoA appendix lends it a larger mass of 853.12g/mol, which is specific for malonyl-CoA.   For
3HPA
the specific identification is more difficult because V. natriegens is able to fermentatively produce lactate, a structural isomer of
3HPA
.   To distinguish between
3HPA
and lactate we chose to use a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.   In such a device two quadrupole mass analyzers are toggled in a row and separated by a third quadrupole, responsible for the collision-induced dissociation of ions.   Our strategy was to cultivate cells, performing the
3HPA
pathway or at least one of its reaction steps and then lysate the cells and measure lactate- as well as
3HPA
-concentrations in the cell extract and also in the medium, because there are no hints if
3HPA
stays in the cell or is released into the medium.
Directed Evolution and Outlook
Directed evolution
Metabolic Engineering offers many possibilities to create suitable pathways but it consists of more than just building them. Pathway optimization is also crucial for efficient productivity.   In our workflow for metabolic engineering we want to implement directed evolution to drive metabolic fluxes towards
3HPA
production.   We elaborated two strategies to do that. Our first strategy was to implement genes for the conversion of
3HPA
into succinate.   In that way, we lead our product back into the central metabolism.   By deleting all other genes responsible for succinate production, the cells are forced to use the
3HPA
bypass to get succinate, which is needed in the TCA cycle.   The big advantage of using V. natriegens for that purpose is that its short doubling time increases the number of cell divisions per time and thereby increases the number of mutations in a given time frame. Our second strategy is to use
MAGE
together with our biosensors and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (
FACS
), to cause various genome modifications and rapidly select for cells with increased
3HPA

All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective primary prevention for NSCLC [6] , as smoking is responsible for 90% of cases. [7] In the UK, the government has implemented numerous policies to reduce rates of smoking. These include heavily taxing tobacco, banning TV advertising and requiring cigarette packets to have “smoking kills” branding.
Rates of smoking are declining [8] , although they are still sufficiently high for lung cancer to remain as prevalent it is. Primary prevention to secondhand smoke has also been implemented as far as impossible - with smoking banned in enclosed workplaces, public buildings and on public transport. [9] However, no further measures can be taken to avoid exposure by going outside.
The other risk factors for cancer are less well known - as there are a myriad of carcinogens in the world we live in - the food standards agency works to minimize carcinogens in food, drugs and cosmetics, [10] while NICE ensures that medical radiation exposure is minimized.
The screening test should be simple, safe, precise and validated
As we are using a cell free system, our test is safe. Our test would comprise a blood test, followed by miRNA purification and fluorescence measurements which are all relatively simple. These steps do not require the expertise of radiologists that are needed for CT scans. However, for our test to be shown to be precise and validated, further characterisation is required with the miRNA biomarkers and validation with a large data set of patients.
There should be evidence that intervention at a pre-symptomatic stage leads to better outcomes
NSCLC is far easier to treat in its earlier stages. The same is true for almost all cancers, as once a cancer has metastasized it can only be treated palliatively. Early stage tumors can be surgically excised and treated adjuvantly with curative intent.
The test should be acceptable to the target population
From a patient’s perspective, our sensor would just be a blood test. As such there should not be any issues with it. We are using a cell free systems which is sterile and abiotic - there are no bacteria involved which could potentially give rise to objections.
There should be a policy on further diagnostic investigation of those with a positive test result.
There should be agreed policies covering which individuals should be offered interventions and what the the appropriate intervention offered is assurance standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE"
