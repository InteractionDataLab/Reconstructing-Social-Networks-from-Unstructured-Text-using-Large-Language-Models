(1) 電気泳動では、いずれのインサートも濃いバンドとして確認できたので、確かにゲル中には各DNAはあったはずであるが、
吸光度をみると、全ての試料でDNAはほぼ存在しないというかたちになってしまった
原因は、ゲルを切り出す箇所を間違えてしまったことであるように思う
後で電気泳動したゲルの写真を確認すると、RNAと思われる箇所を切り出してしまっていた
DNAをそもそも切り出していなかったので、吸光度が低くなってしまったようである

Ant operon amplified from genomic prep of Pseudomonas LD2 at the expected size of 3000 bp.
Lanes 2,4,5, and 11 contain CarAd genes amplified from colony PCR (using biobrick primers) of the PCR product that had been ligated into PSB1C3 and transformed into competent E.Coli.
Lane 9 contains CarAa genes amplified from colony PCR (using biobrick primers) of the PCR product that had been ligated into PSB1C3 and transformed into competent E.Coli. Although larger than expected, the positive control RFP generator in lane 10 is also larger than its expected size (~1200 bp including biobrick bookends) indicating that the gel may have a slant in it.
Catechol Degradation
The sequencing results for the part J33204 matched the part so a construction was started.  The construction was a 3-way ligation putting the tetR promoter (R0040) and XylE (J33204) into a pSB1C3 vector.  The ligation product was transformed into competent cells and a colony PCR was done on the transformants using both bio brick and R0040 primers.   The primers for XylT, which is a ferredoxin that allows for XylE to be activated after a reaction with catechol, arrived and a colony PCR on four different strains of Pseudomonas putida was done.  None of the strains seemed to contain the TOL plasmid, which is where XylT is found in certain strains of P. putida, because no bands showed up in the gel.  The catechol assay was continued this week.  Six overnight cultures were made, 3 using M9-MM and 3 using LB.  They were spun down and the supernatant was brought to a catechol concentration of 0.1M, 0.2 M and 0.5 M using a 1M stock solution.  The solutions turned light yellow initially, but after a few hours they turned brown.    The assay was repeated with the same procedure as above but a control, a colony that did not contain the part K118021, was added.  After the catechol was added to the supernatants there was a colour change from clear to yellow in all of the tubes, even the control.  For a negative control catech"

Major Results
This page contains highlights of our major results and simulations. It is by no means complete. However, more results will be presented at the jamboree.
Genome Digestion Assay
The wet lab has also investigated the effects of restriction enzymes on cell population.
In this assay, we performed a restriction digestion on Dam negative and Dam positive strains, using restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI, to investigate their effects on the two strains.
Positive results were achieved.
From the gels above, we notice that there are 'smears'in the gels for the Dam negative strains. These 'smears'are created when the Dam negative strains are fully cleaved at all different concentrations of restriction enzyme.
From these results, we have shown that restriction enzymes can cleave Dam negative strains, hence killing Dam negative cells. This also proves Dam positive strains are protected again genomic deletion.
  About the results.
Cell population model
Furthermore, the dry lab has provided a model on cell population under the production of restriction enzymes.
We have shown that an increase in restriction enzyme concentration will cause a decrease total cell population, under the absence of Dam protection.
  About the results.
Finding the Best Secondary Media for BBa_K200018
Growth experiments on a secondary media were performed on the CRP promoter. From this experiment, we are able to choose the best secondary media for the optimal growth of cells.
From the graph on the right, we can see that the corrected fluorescence of glucose is almost negligible. Therefore, we have proved the theory that glucose represses the PcstA promoter strongly.
To determine the best secondary media, we note that 10% Casamino Acids in M9 media shows the highest corrected fluorescence as well as a high corrected OD600. This indicates good cell growth. No other media is comparable. Therefore, this is our secondary media of choice.
  About the results.
Diauxic Growth Models

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," biosensor for detecting contaminants, such as hormones and medicines in surface water, a less specific concentration might be sufficient.
A method using quantitative measurement is preferred. This technique does not require the emitted light to be visible for the eye.
Our method seems to be preferable above other methods, because in the future we might also be able to locate the source of the contamination.

Onno Epema, Rijkswaterstaat
31/07/18 About Onno Epema
Onno Epema is Head of Laboratory of Inorganic analysis at Rijkswaterstaat. One of the tasks of Rijkswaterstaat is the control of surface water quality. Its multiple measuring stations use both chemical, as well as biological systems to examine water quality.
Insights
The presence of pharmaceutical waste products in water is a relevant issue.
Toxicity of compounds in water is currently measured using bioassays. These assays include daphnia, fish or bacteria.
Additional chemical analysis to bioassay analysis is required to specifically identify, and quantify the presence of the toxic compound.
Direct identification of compound class (e.g. functional groups, medicinal group, hormones etc.) would be a leap forward in identification efficiency in chemical analysis. Information obtained during chemical analysis is often complex, as there are tens of thousands of potential toxic compounds in the water.
Applied
DeTaXion could potentially replace the microtox assay, providing a method which can both detect the presence, and concentration of toxic pharmaceutical waste products.
Confirmation of the importance of our biosensors to detect multiple concentrations.
The end product should be able to detect compounds classes instead of one specific compound. This is possible with the expression of multiple modified Tar receptors, each with a specific ligand, such as hormones.

Our philosophy when it comes to collaboration is that “collaboration leads to development of the innovation and its full acceptance and use”. Based on this, we did not only collaborate with other iGEM teams, but also with students from the Design Academy Eindhoven. The students from the DAE helped us gain insight into how people perceive our project and synthetic biology in general, while the collaboration with iGEM teams helped us move forward in a scientific way. We collaborated with two other iGEM teams: TU_Delft and Groningen. During this process, we also learned about their projects and helped each other out with some ideas. We even got some valuable input from both teams. Here’s what we have achieved in collaboration with them.

Both students of engineering majors and life science major enjoyed the science lecture, with some students commenting on synthetic biology--it was ""so cool""! Several of freshmen also sincerely thanked us for the science lecture, and said that they were eager to be iGEMers next year. Overall, we held a science lecture related to synthetic biology and our project, which received a great response and sparked students' curiosity towards synthetic biology.
social practice report,
The end of September, the yearly social practice report will be held in Student Activity Center of Tianjin University. Yige and Xuemei who are in charge of human practice will report and display some of human practice activities which are related to society and education. In some degree, we will show our activities in front of the whole school and lead them into the fascinating world of synthetic biology.
Recycling & Reusing PET
Is waste PET Really That Big A Deal?
In 2007, there were more than four (4) billion pounds of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottles that were burned or ended up in landfills, roadsides, streams and oceans. With the rapid increase in production of PET, there is more and more waste PET discharged into the nature.  Although PET is versatile due to its high inertness, nontoxic nature and moldability into various useful products, it is non-biodegradable. The products of PET can become a huge waste after their useful life is over. It will occupy quantity of space and the landfill or incineration can be harmful to the environment, so the recycling and reuse of the waste PET has become one of the major subjects of environmental protection.

Recycling And Reusing Of PET In Western Countries
At present, PET recycling method can be divided into physical recycling method and chemical recycling method [1] In foreign countries, PET is mainly recycled by chemical recycling method, that is, depolymerizing PET into terephthalic acid (TPA), dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), ethylene glycol (EG) and so on, then take advantage of intermediate raw materials (BHET) or monomer (TPA, DMT, EG, etc.) ["

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," DH5ɑ transformed with an empty pSB1C3 backbone was used as a control. Then, after overnight incubation at 37°C, PHB was extracted with bleach. Supernatant fermented at 23°C yielded significantly more PHB than supernatant fermented at 37°C. See greater details about the results here .
Week 18 (August 28 - September 1, 2017)
Overnights and master plates of the second set of pET29B-SP1-SP2 colonies from last week did not show any signs of growth. Since two sets of pET29B-SP1-SP2 colonies and two sets of pET29B-SP2 colonies were unable to grow in overnights or on master plates it was deduced that our SP2 is somehow harmful to the E.coli and it would be very difficult to transform this part into our bacteria. We decided to move past cloning our SP2 part in and instead focus on carrying out assays with the pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag (cloned in Week 10)  and pET29B-SP1 (cloned in Week 12).
Week 19 (September 5 - September 8, 2017)
Jacob repeated the experiment from Week 17 with 3-day fermented synthetic feces supernatant. Again, results were similar, and supernatant fermented at 23°C yielded a much higher amount of PHB than supernatant fermented at 37°C. See the results here .
Week 20 (September 11 - September 15, 2017)
In order to carry out assays of PHB secretion, E.coli BL21(DE3) must first be double transformed with a plasmid containing PHB-producing genes, as well a plasmid containing our secretion genes. So, this week Kaitlin worked on double transforming cells with iGEM registry pSB1C3-PhaCAB from Imperial College and pET29B-SP1 (cloned in Week 12). Since synthesis has not yet completed ligating their PhaCBA genes together, we decided to use the part from Imperial College, which we know can successfully produce PHB. Although we carried out two double transformation attempts, neither showed any colony growth, indicating that the double transformations had failed.
Kaitlin also digested both pSB1A3-RFP and pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag with EcoRI-HF and SpeI, then ligated the products together in order to produce"

In any case, the data that we had before the European jamboree remains our most useful. Attempts to insert the fluoride riboswitch into ratiometrica have also failed, possibly due to the tiny size of the riboswitch insert.
Luciferase development
We have, however, managed to get some data regarding our luciferase construct from DNA2.0. Matthew Hawkeye from the nanophotonics department of the University has kindly helped Tom to determine the emission spectrum of the construct, both induced and uninduced. Alas No. 2, we were unable to replicate the results of the original paper which demonstrated a spectral shift upon the addition of mOrange. Toxicity appears to have increased in the presence of IPTG, which could be stretched to a positive finding (it would appear to indicate that we are producing considerably greater quantities of the LUXA - mOrange fusion than under normal conditions, which puts the metabolism of the cell under considerable strain). We would be hard pressed to consider this an optimal result, however.
Konrad Seigfried Interview
Interestingly, Konrad Seigfried got back in touch with us. He was hoping to form a collaborative effort in producing an EU project proposal involving the use of biosensors in general - and with our fluoride biosensor prototype in particular! Unfortunately, we were unable help in any but the most superficial way - we sent him our data concerning the various characterization experiments that we had performed. Alas No. 3, there simply wasn't the time (or the lab based resources) to collaborate any further.

To overcome this bottleneck     we have developed a new strategy, where we have only used the construct     combinations of the biobricks distributed within the plates. Moreover,     according to information gathered from the subparts of the constructs     distrubuted, we also collected the subpart assembly order, such as 1st:     promoter, 2nd:rbs, 3rd:coding seq, any internal parts and the Last:     terminator. Each specific Biobrick type has been assigned a number as     a unique image ID from 1 to 19. Gathering the information on subparts     was not a direct forward process. ImageID assembly orders for each construct     has been used to extract the type information for each subpart with     that construct. This innovative approach helped us to reveal 400 possible     brick combinations present within the 3x384 well plates distributed     by iGEM in Spring 2010.

Future Plan
The application we have developed can be used by all iGEM members.     As the iGEMs database expands and the recognition of the field of Synthetic     Biology increases, data resources from other biological databases such     as NCBI might be needed to be integrated to the application. In such     a situation, extendibility of the application is vital. New data resources     and new functions should be added easily.
Before planning ahead, feedback from other teams and iGEM headquarters     about the BioGuide 1.0 will be collected. That will help us to fill     in the missing features of the application and check the theories which     are basis of our algorithms.
As our application is not geared towards any commercial use and will     stay as an academic application, keeping track of the weekly developmental     process on the wiki notebook environment was satisfactory. If the need     for a commercial application emerges, we should be utilizing professional     software development approaches to determine the exact requirements     and to facilitate the use of a common language between interdici"

In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.
As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMOs?  The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labeling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada, unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.  In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labeling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labelling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.
What are the most important documents related to GMMs? The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.  When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard. US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.  For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products"

The remaining clades (12, 13, 14, and 15) are all from class IId bacteriocins, and through review of literature, was determined to have a similar mode of action that lyse target cells via the formation of pores in the membrane [5][6]. This is possible because these bacteriocins are high in amphiphilic amino acids—this structural conservation also explains their close evolutionary relationship—that allows the peptides to dock on the membrane. In the below tree, the four clades have been expanded back to individual bacteriocins; the last clade, clade 17, was the colicin outgroup and was not accounted for.
In the above figure, the names on the right are the arbitrary names for the four clades, and relative divergence times are shown on the branches. Lacticin Z, our starting bacteriocin, is highlighted in green. Notably, the majority of these bacteriocins are derivatives of aureocin within different genus and species. The bacteriocins highlighted in grey are aureocins within the genus Bacillus. Since there were more other aureocins more closely related to lacticin Z, the Bacillus genus was ruled out. As mentioned earlier, because lacticin Q has already been hybridized with lacticin Z, it was also ruled out. Epidermicin NI01 (highlighted yellow) is one of the most evolutionary similar bacteriocins to lacticin Z, and as a result was chosen for hybridization (divergence time 0.04). Out of the remaining three aureocin A53 bacteriocins, although aureocin A53 from Staphylococcus aureus had a higher divergence time at 1.25, it was difficult to obtain the other two strains of aureocin, and so the aureocin A53 from Staphylococcus aureus(highlighted yellow) was chosen as the second bacteriocin for hybridization with lacticin Z.
Methods: Sequence Selection
We chose to analyze mainly class II bacteriocins as potential hybrids, because all bacteriocins in this class are largely unmodified [7]. Because these bacteriocins do not undergo significant post-translational modification, we hypothesize that hybridization will be easier to achieve with two class II bacteriocins, rather than the hybridization of two different classes. Furthermore, class II bacteriocins are all small, membrane-active peptides, and are grouped into subclasses based on common structural features and shared homologies [8]—a feature that"

Centrifuge 4 (10% glycerol): Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C. Carefully decant the supernatant and use a Pasteur pipette attached to a vacuum line to remove any remaining drops of buffer.
Resuspend in GYT: Resuspend in 1 ml ice cold GYT. This is best done by gently swirling rather pipetting or vortexing.
Test for arcing: Transfer 40 µl of the suspension to an ice-cold electroporation cuvette and test whether arcing occurs when an electrical discharge is applied. Place the cuvette in the holder attached to the machine. Go to option 4, Pre-set protocols; choose bacterial; choose the correct choice for your size cuvette, probably the first option for a .1 cm cuvette. If arcing occurs, wash the remainder of the cell suspension once more with ice-cold GYT medium to ensure that the conductivity of the bacterial suspension is sufficiently low (<5 mEq). (or check the pulse time, if the pulse time < 4, redo the wash, if the pulse time > 4, it's ok)
Storage: Store cells at -80°C until they are required for use. For storage, dispense 40 µl aliquots of the cell suspension into sterile, ice-cold .5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, drop into a bath of liquid nitrogen and transfer to a -80°C freezer. To remove the tubes from the liquid nitrogen bath, bring out into the hall along with a storage box, and pour the tubes and liquid nitrogen into the box. Once all the tubes are out, close the box most of the way and let the liquid run out into the hallway. Try not to do this in the very center of the walkway!
To use frozen cells: Remove an appropriate number of aliquots of cells from the -80°C freezer. Thaw the tubes on ice.

Procedure
To carry out this collaboration, we followed the protocol provided by iGEM McMasterU . The purpose of this experiment was to act as a proof of concept that the DNAzyme will cleave specifically in the presence of E. coli and will not cleave in the presence of other bacteria.
Materials:
60mm plates
M9 plating media
M9 liquid media
E. coli DH5α
Bacillus subtilis WB800
8 μM DNAzyme
100 mL of M9 liquid media for overnight inoculations were prepared in 87.79 mL of autoclaved ddH2O by combing 10 mL of autoclaved 2 x M9 salts, 200 μL of 1 M MgSO4, and 10 μL of 1 M of CaCl2. These solutions were autoclaved separately before being added to the ddH2O. 2 mL of filter-sterilized 20% glucose was also added to the mixture. Two overnights of E. coli DH5α and two of B. subtilis WB800 were made using 3 mL of the liquid media. The culture tubes were shaken for 24 hours at 37°C. After the incubation period, the cell density of the overnights as measured using a wavelength of 600 nm.
As preparation for making the M9 plating media, 2.988 g of agar powder was dissolved in 100 mL of ddH2O and autoclaved. 100 mL of the M9 plating media was then made by combining 49.8 mL of the agar solution, 49.8 mL of 2 x M9 salt, 99.5 μL of 1 M MgSO4, and 9.95 μL of 1 M CaCl2. 398 μL of filter-sterilized 20% glucose was also added. The M9, MgSO4, and CaCl2 salts were previously autoclaved and the plating media was made using aseptic technique. 2.5 mL of the media was pipetted into four 60 mm plates. Eight 60 mm plates were also made using higher amounts of the media (~5 mL).
Quadrants were drawn on the plates containing M9 media. On one set of plates, one quadrant was labelled DH5α for E. coli, another DNAzyme, and the two remaining sections were named negative controls. A second set of plates were also labelled. The first quadrant was named B"

Michael Milevskiy:
Studying: Bachelor of BioMedical Science, Specialising in Genetics and Developmental Biology
About me: I love basketball, which is why i am in Boston I will definitely be going to see a Celtics game. I find genetics and the development and differentiation of embryos to be the most interesting aspects of biology. After iGEM is done for the year i plan on undergoing a research project and maybe do something closely related to one of our projects.
Richard Schlegel:
Studying: Bachelor of Biomedical Science, Specialising in Physiology, Pharmacology, and Neuroscience
About me: I love to travel & have been to places around the world such as Japan, Bali, the Philippines, and Hawaii.  I've been to USA before, & would love to go again.  After iGEM, I am interested in pursuing other research projects, possibly involving cardiac physiology.  I love 'lazy days at home', and 'cooking up a storm' in the kitchen in my spare time.
Katelin Haynes:
Studying: Bachelor of Science, Majoring in Biomedical Science
About me: I'm looking forward to summer break, to complete my other research project. I wish I had more spare time, and I love it when I can laze around at home and devour novels (while eating chocolate, of course!).
Florencia Camus:
Studying: Bachelor of Science (Majors in Genetics and Evolutionary Biology)
About me: Originally from Chile, Flo has lived in Canada, Chile and Australia (not in that order). She knew that science was her calling after working all her senior year at Santiago College on Drosophila melanogaster on the inheritance of sex-linked traits. Graduated with honours in the subject of biology she moved to the University of Queensland for her Bachelors degree where she has spent the last three years. During her first two years she was a Vacation Scholar for Prof. Istvan Toth where she searched for Beta-lactam antibiotic carriers, in order to make them orally available. Currently she is in Dr. Daniel Ortiz-Barrientos lab testing sexual selection in angiosperms and the rapid evolution of reproductive proteins

Students
After the Jamboree we will organize a meeting for Life Science & Technology students in order to inform them about the iGEM competitions and about our achievements. By this we aim to gain their interest for participating TU Delft iGEM 2010 team. We want to organize this meeting in cooperation with LIFE, the student union of Life Science & Technology. This meeting will be organized between end of November and start of December. This is a good strategy to start promoting iGEM competition and recruiting students for the next TU Delft iGEM team.
Since the iGEM competition is a multi disciplinary competition it would be useful to inform also other students from the Faculty of Applied Sciences. Therefore we will contact also other Student Unions at the Faculty of Applied Sciences, these are shown in table 4.

Introduction

Modelling Anti-Repressors
RNA Polymerase
RNA polymerase (RNA-p) is an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of RNA in the 5' -> 3' direction using a complementary and antiparallel DNA strand as a template. RNA-p is multimeric enzyme, the core enzyme consists of the four subunits β, β', α, ω. The haloenzyme consists of the core enzyme and the σ factor. It is the sigma factor that is responsible for directing the RNA polymerase to the appropriate start site for RNA synthesis. This means that the σ factor is responsible for recognizing promoters, each specific σ factor interacting with a specific promoter sequence. The σ factor disassociates from the enzyme shortly after the transcription initiation.
Control of Transcription
Transcription is the most common step at which gene expression can be controlled. The proteins responsible for this are DNA interacting proteins, which bind to specific sites on the DNA and can influence the regulation of transcription. These regulatory proteins fall into two catagories:
Repressors
Activators
Repressors
Repressors are DNA binding proteins that are responsible for the negative control of transcription. This control is achieved by the binding of the active repressor to an operator site, which results in the RNA-p being unable to instigate RNA transcription.
Activators
Activators are DNA binding proteins that are responsible for the positive control of transcription. The sequence of nucleotide of promoters under positive control typically interact poorly with RNA-p and the activators help the RNA-p recognize the promoter and begin transcription. The activator-binding site can either be found close to the promoter or a distance from it. The activator changes the conformation of the DNA bringing about the additional contacts necessary for RNA-p to initiate transcription.
Transcription Termination
Termination is the process by which the elongation of an RNA molecule is ceased.
Termination can fall into one of two categories:
Intrinsic Termination

Figure.6 The VioC could catalyze PVA into Deoxychromoviridans at 42℃,and meanwhile the tetR would repress the Ptet contained circuit as well as the LacI repress the Plac.
We also have the second option which directs the pathway towards the production of Protoviolaceinic acid. This goal can be achieved by simply raise the temperature to 37℃. At this moment, circuit B is translated because of the RNA thermometer  ( BBa_K115002 ) and produces VioD and TetR ( BBa_C0040 ). Therefore, VioD will then catalyze PVA into Protoviolaceinic acid, meanwhile, TetR will inhibit the expression of circuit A. Moreover, the constitutively produced CI inhibitor  ( BBa_K098995 ) would repress the production of VioC (Figure 7). At this stage, our E.coli will produce dark green pigment. Moreover, we can continue the pathway to obtain another product.
Figure.7 The VioD could catalyze PVA into Protoviolaceinic acid at 37℃ ,at the same time the Ptet contained circuit would be repressed and the PCI contained circuit as well.
We can continue this pathway by raising the temperature even higher till it reaches 42℃. At this stage, circuit C will be initiated. This circuit will be turned on by CI repressed promoter, which will start the expression only when the temperature reaches 42℃ or higher ( BBa_K098995 ) ,and the following

is expressed. At this point, VioC will catalyze the accumulated Protoviolaceinic acid into Violacein(Figure 8). Simultaneously, our E.coli will produce the enzyme to switch the color into dark purple.
Figure.8 The VioC could catalyze the Protoviolaceinic acid into the Violacein at 42℃ after accumulating it at 37℃, meanwhile, the tetR would repress the Ptet contained circuit as well as the LacI repress the Plac.

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," that assists in translating research knowledge to information that is comprehensible to a member that is not from the field of synthetic biology. An individual that has attained perceptions, knowledge and experiences from the scientific, business and social field is best suited to convey the importance of the Staphiscope to the stakeholders that have been listed above.
Partnerships between Synthetic Biology institutions and hospitals or other community based facilities.
Synthetic biologists must consider the importance of implementing an approach to help relieve the prospective stigmas that could potentially impact the relative success of their technology. The general public plays an influential role in the innovation capabilities of these synthetic biology technologies. Thus it is critical that these synthetic biology institutions involve the public and create awareness of their technologies at all stages of the research and development stage. Integrating a strategy that incorporates the exchange of knowledge  is a fundamental leverage that would help create an aura of public acceptance and support all dimensions of the synthetic biology roadmap.
Human Practices Commercialization Toolkit
Following the Regional Jamboree, the Human Practices team began to develop the tools, templates and models that would assist a synthetic biology community and its associate stakeholders to understand the commercialization process. More importantly, our aim is to develop informational material that would achieve the integration of a knowledge transfer strategy in the field of synthetic biology. By streamlining the knowledge transfer strategy throughout each stage of the commercialization process, we are able to achieve a paralleled level of communication between the scientific and non-scientific community. Below is a sample of the toolkit our team has developed.
The Commercialization Road Map
The University of Waterloo Human Practices Team has devised a commercialization road map specific to the field of synthetic biology. The purpose of this road map is to outline the different stages of the technology development process. More importantly, it indicates what initiatives must be completed at each stage, who needs to be involved, and the strategies that can be utilized to attain the intended end-goal; A Scientific Milestone. To view the road map please click the link below.

The Knowledge Transfer Strategy Action Plan
The University of Waterloo Human Practices Team has devised a knowledge transfer strategy to help parallel the level of communication between the scientific and non-scientific community. This document outlines the strategies that are currently being used or proposed at the University of Waterloo but can be easily used on a wider scale by the entire iGEM community.

This event held at Queens college Cambridge, allowed the team to present our project in a number of different ways. As well as doing a talk and presentation, we also used our poster. Their feedback on the poster was extremely helpful in telling us what we need to change before the Jamboree. Overall, the whole experience was extremely beneficial in preparing us for the Giant Jamboree which was only a month away. We had the opportunity to present our work in a similar way to what we expect to do in Boston; a dress rehearsal if you like. We were lucky enough to meet some leading academics and discuss our project as well as win the prize for Best Scientific communication.
Furthermore, all of the students at the young scientist journal were at similar stage in their education to us and were interested in STEM so we hope that the young students enjoyed our talk and felt inspired by the IGEM competition and would consider joining a university team. As a team we are very keen to lead the way for other British schools to follow in the future. Being one of the first British state schools to enter the competition, we are particularly keen that other schools such as us follow in our footsteps.

Every pixel in the LCD is considered as a single point light source. According to the formula below: \frac{1}{f_{len}}=\frac{1}{D_{len-LCDs}}+\frac{1}{d_{len-adapter}}
to estimate position of the lens. Lens helps us to shrink the projector's image to microscope(Fig. 5). Finally, we can control every pixel of image on specimen from computer controlled projector.

To control the ouput of light source, a software is required. However, a very easy method is using a slide( Demo Slide ), such as LibreOffice (Test on 5.4.2.2.0+ in Arch Linux) or Microsoft Office. The image and time pattern  is configured in slide, including color, intensity and pulse time etc.
We also develop a more powerful and hackable open source software suite called ColorMapping to track and activate multiple C. elegans or cell independently in one view. User can modify multi color, intensity, time and locations of light alternately in GUI. Everyone is welcome to join us to develop ColorMapping in GitHub , which still is developing. ColorMapping, contains camera part, projector part, user&calculation part. It is coded by Python 2 Language, and third-party packages, PyGraph, PyQt5 and Lima(Library for Image Acquisition) . ColorMapping tests on Arch Linux.

Terry Westgate - Canterbury City Councillor
Profile
Terry Westgate has been involved in politics and the Conservative party since 2006, and was elected as Canterbury City councillor for St. Stephens Ward in 2011. His many achievements include being Vice Chairman and Treasurer of the St Michaels’s Road Area, as well as being Chairman of the Friends of Westgate Parks and a member of the Student Community Working Group.
Questions
Raneem: My name is Raneem AlJaghoub and I just wanted to talk to you about synthetic biology, what our product is and about renewable energy and projects going on around the UK. First of all, I just wanted to ask you what projects you are involved in, as part of your work?
Terry: I’m a Canterbury city Councillor, and I represent St. Stephens ward in Canterbury, which is very close to the university, at the bottom of the Eliot footpath, do you know that area at all?
Raneem: Yeah, I think so
Terry: So, natural involvement in this type of project, or renewable energy or anything like that, I’m not very involved in that. I mainly deal with problems in my constituent, you know, deal with issues – what people have. But I ‘m very keen to be involved in things. For instance, there was a part I was reading, what you put in your letter, and you talk about introducing parts where people can charge their electronic equipment. I am involved with something with ‘Friends of Westgate’ parks, where I am chairman of Friends of Westgate parks, and sort of involved with parks and open spaces, which gets used very well by the public. So I can see the connection.
Raneem: That’s really good
Terry: As I said, I read a little bit, but I haven’t had much time to do much research on it.
Raneem: That’s ok. I’m an electronics engineer, so I wasn’t very familiar"

Team members Barrett Davis, Paige Rudin, and Suraj Mohan attended the Regional Clean Energy Innovation Forum held at Ross-Ade Stadium. Leading scientists from across the country gathered to discuss topics like energy storage, biomass and synthetic biology applications (a conversation that piqued the students’ interest), materials manufacturing, and more. The theme the team took away from the day is best summarized with the words of Purdue President Mitch Daniels during his opening remarks: “It’s only an innovation when it’s useful to someone.” How can new technology of nanowires and microbial fuel cells be integrated efficiently into established systems? Is it a cost-effective solution? Only time will tell, but the team is excited to find out.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

Incorporating a Novel Communication Paradigm for iGEM Teams
As a new team, we looked to past teams who had engaged in stakeholder interactions and Integrated Human Practices to guide our own intuition. Our team quickly realized that often times, other teams simply spoke to other domain experts or end users without having a fully thought-out approach that would allow for integration of advice into project design and deployment. It was also important to realize that a lot of the narratives that teams put forward were extremely linear: the interactions did not invite the team to consider the impact of their decisions or help them optimize their overall design.
In our day-to-day operations, we also experienced the struggles of cross-team discussion. It was quite difficult for people in the wetlab to keep track of what the drylab team was doing, or to keep track of what the entrepreneurship group was trying to deploy. It was also sometimes difficult to ascertain the broad-scale impact of our interactions with certain experts or stakeholders. We were also sure that our team was not the only one to experience such difficulties. To resolve these issues, our team came up with a novel paradigm that we believe will help streamline project issues for future teams.
Similar to the design-build-test cycle that Imperial College introduced in 2006, our team believes that although there is a continuous flow of information and need for integration into the project, we can create three phases for the project with the following methodology.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Further_-_-_TEXT.html," natural mechanism, in an attempt to control R6K plasmid replication.
Pi-protein controls the initiation of DNA replication in gamma origin of R6K plasmid. By varying the amount of Pi-protein being produced through an inducible promoter (ptet*), the change in plasmid copy number can be observed using real-time PCR. This method is being studied because it could potentially offer a linear change of gene expression.
Also, this method provides an alternative means to control gene expression, other than controlling gene expression through the use of promoters and ribosomal binding sites (RBS); thus expanding the degree of control over gene expression.
Results
Characterization of plasmid controlling system. (A) Pir gene and gamma ORI co-exist on the same plasmid. (B) Pir gene and gamma ORI exist on different plasmids.
From the above figure, no significant change in copy number of plasmid (per genome) was observed upon induction by aTc when the gamma ORI and pir gene are located on different plasmids.
We speculate that this might be due to the high sensitivity of R6K ORI to pi protein. As reported by previous study, the overexpression of pir gene facilitates the formation of dimeric pi protein that conversely suppress the copy number of plasmid with gamma origin (Abhyankar, 2003). This can be simply understood as neither too high nor too low the concentration of pi protein will the plasmid copy number be increased. It is conjectured that there only exists a very narrow range of [aTc], which would affect the copy number; and that the range is hidden in one of the 10-fold interval of [aTc], regardless, our experimental setups might have shown the lowest possible copy number of p(R6K)-BBa_J04450.
Abhyankar, M. M. (2003). Biochemical Investigations of Control of Replication Initiation of Plasmid R6K. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 279(8), 6711–6719.
As for p(R6K)-TPP-BBa_J04450, the result showed that there was a significant increase in plasmid copy number when the cells were induced with 10-3 μM aTc. However, a step-wise increment was not observed. Therefore, more measurement point on that particular range of [aTc], which is from 10-2 μM to 10-4 μM aTc, has to be set up in order"

One of the main drawbacks of PDMS chips is its hydrophobicity. Consequently, introducing aqueous solutions into the channels is difficult and hydrophobic analytes can be absorbed onto the PDMS surface. Fortunately, there are PDMS surface modification methods such as gas phase processing and wet chemical methods (or combination of both) to avoid hydrophobicity. After the fabrication, the microfluidics chips made of polydimethylsiloxane were treated with oxygen plasma for hydrophilic property. After this procedure, polydimethylsiloxane could bond to glass tightly, and channels in chips would be hydrophilic enough for medium to pass thorough. Immediately adding media also slows recovery to hydrophobicity of surface.
We programmed syringe pump to provide precise control over the total flow rate and thus flow rate of each channels. Therefore, shear force of any strength and duration can be applied to cells expressing MS channels. In our experiment, the flow will be maintained for about 2 min. Only after the cells have recovered from the last experiment (indicated by reverting to normal fluorescence intensity), would we start the next round of shear force stimulation.
During the experiment, the cells must be tightly adhered to the bottom of the channels. We coat the channels in the chip with gelatin, so that cell could adhere to the glass surface on the bottom of the channels.
Cells expressing MS channels and R-GECO are injected to the chip inlet, and settled down. Once the cells adhere to the glass bottom of the channels, the microfluidics chip is clamped onto the live cell fluorescent imaging systems, so that the observation window is aligned with the optical field. With continuing observation of the R-GECO fluorescence (calcium signals), the syringe pump was set to different flow rates and durations to apply three given shear forces to cells in three channels. As calcium signals might not be synchronized among the cells in the same channel, we load the time-lapse fluorescent images load into customerized MATLAB script. We manually identify each cells. The fluorescent intensities for each cell are calculated over time. The increases in fluorescence intensities normalized over the control conditions are defined as the representation of calcium responses to shear forces for each cells (the detailed calculation is in the modeling session ). To assess the sustained response to shear force, cell integrated with NFAT promoter driven GFP is used to detect signal downstream of Calcium-Calmodulin-Calcineurin, typically 20 hours after the onset of mechanical stimulation.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#rMFC#ElectronTransfer_-_-_TEXT.html,"oprF under anaerobic conditions . We used M9 minimal medium with 50 mM glucose. Among growth characteristic we focused on metabolite analysis. Under anaerobic conditions E. coli cells use different alternative electron acceptors instead of oxygen. In part the bacteria use fumarate respiration, whereby fumarate is reduced into succinate. There are also other potential pathways for bacteria to release their electrons, for example anorganic compounds like nitrate (NO3-) or sulfate (SO42-).( Gottschalk et al., 1986 ) We analyzed succinate concentration and glucose concentration in the culture supernatant via HPLC.
We expect succinate production of the E. coli KRX wildtype, but E. coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF should not release succinate into the media because the C4 carboxylate transporter DcuB is knocked out. As a positive control we use E. coli ΔdcuB749::kan , an E. coli strain with a reviewed knockout in dcuB gene. This strain also should not show any succinate transport into the medium.
Figure 4: Results of the anaerobic cultivation of Escherichia coli KRX wildtype in M9 minimal medium with 50 mM glucose. Glucose and succinate concentration were measured in duplicates with HPLC.
Figure 5: Results of the anaerobic cultivation of Escherichia coli ΔdcuB749::kan in M9 minimal medium with 50 mM glucose. Glucose and succinate concentration were measured in duplicates with HPLC.

Figure 7: Results of the anaerobic cultivation of Escherichia coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF in M9 minimal medium with 50 mM glucose as compared to Escherichia coli KRX wildtype. Glucose and succinate concentration were measured in duplicates with HPLC.
Figure 4 shows the production of succinate by the Escherichia coli KRX wildtype under anaerobic condition as expected. Succinate is released into the medium via the C4 carboxylate transporter DcuB. Our constructed E. coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF strain shows no succinate export under anaerobic conditions displayed in figure 6. This demonstrates a successful knockout of the dcu"

NAIT_Edmonton,2015,Team:NAIT Edmonton#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," discussing our bio brick design because for all iGEMer’s this is an extremely important aspect of our projects. But do not forget that this is only one part of the overall experiments we have to do to see success. So when the curve balls come at you, don’t panic. Readjust your grip on the bat, calculate the trajectory of the ball, exhale and swing for the fences!!!
Future Work
“Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.” – Henry Ford
We have done the interviews, documented the data and written the guide and now a question we all ask ourselves, What do we do next? Our vision for this guide, is for it to not only be used as a reference by future teams, but to eventually transform into a forum where teams can openly collaborate with each other on brainstorming solutions for problems that occur during the research process. We were inspired by the 2015 Paris Bettencourt team’s iGEM Rhizi website, a tool created for iGEM collaborations, and we reached out to them for advice on how they approached its creation, and they responded!
One statement that particularly stood out and resonated with us was “It is still the beginning of the iGEM Rhizi but for the moment it is a great experience”.  For many ideas introduced at iGEM they are only just beginning and our iGEM guide is one of them, stay tuned for future developments.
Conclusion
“What we learn becomes a part of who we are” – Unknown
We were asked by one of the members of our institution, “What will you do when you land back in Edmonton after iGEM?” Go to class, obviously. But beyond that, we will look around us and realize how truly lucky we are to have experienced something like the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition. Yes, it was a long, arduous road. Yes, sometimes we felt like quitting but… we didn’t. You didn’t.
So although there may be trials and tribulations, tears and frustration, anger and fear, there is one thing that you must remember - you did it. Whether you get the results you desire or not you have already won. Although they may not be the results that you expected or wanted, you learned something from them. You fostered new friendships and met great mentors. You polished your lab techniques and skills. Most importantly, you received something many students do not get – an authentic learning experience.
We were lucky to have our mentor, Dr. Marcelo Marcet, constantly remind us that iGEM is not about"

Health effects
Even though nickel is essential for mammals and a part of human nutrition, it may cause dermatitis as well as itching of fingers, hands and forearms by some people, who had long term skin contact. The main source of nickel exposure is food or water, but most people have contact to nickel trough everyday products as jewelry or stainless steel dishware or trough smoking tobacco(US; EPA et al., 2013). In Germany most drinking water pollutions by nickel happen in the last meters of the plumbing system. Wrong tapware is the main source of nickel contamination in drinking water.
Detection
The two most commonly used analytical methods for nickel in water are atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy is used for the determination of nickel detection limit of about 10 μg/L (ISO, 1996). Flame atomic absorption spectrometry is suitable in the range of 0.5–100 μg/L (ISO, 1986). A limit of detection of 0.1 μg/L can be achieved using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Alternatively, electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry can be used. (cavillona 2005)
Our nickel biosensor
For our nickel sensor system we used the rcn-operon from E. coli which encodes  a nickel- and cobalt-efflux system with a high sensitivity to nickel. In the absence of Nickel the respressor RcnR regonizes the operator site and blocks transcription of the operon, while in the presence of nickel it is abadoned due to a conformational change. Our sensor system combines rcnR under the control of a constitutive promoter and the prcnA promoter for the nickel depending expression of sfGFP.  If Ni2+-ions bind to the repressor RcnR, it cannot attach to DNA and rcnA the nickel responsive promoter is activated. In the absence of nickel or cobalt, RcnR is bound to rcnR operator and blocks rcnA transcription. (EPA et al., 2013; Blaha et al., 2011; Iwig et al., 2006) Our output signal works through fluorescence.

Tiffany had also tested in the lab if the 3D models would hold the initially calculated volume of media.
Results: The pockets exactly held 0.5 mL of liquid, while the content area held exactly 10 mL. Therefore, the 3D model is a good representation of our patch system in terms of holding capacity.

Modelling:
Dr. Nygren said Noshin is on the right track. He will email her to clarify some details.
Prototyping:
Dr. Nygren suggested talking to Dr. Jenne about the prototype and alter it to better suit the mice.
Ask Dr. Mayi to buy the heat gun on our own
Assays:
Try to make a connection between the assays and math models. Answer the question of why we do the assay, why we have the models, what the connections are. Cohesion is key.

Presentation day! What we basically did for today was preparing for our presentation and did run throughs.
After the presentation: dead. There were challenging questions thrown at us. This means we still have things to be solidified before we can say we’re done.
We also asked our mentors for comments with regards to our presentation. They are as follows:
Instead of having a slide with all equations on them, why not just use words that tells our audience what the terms represent.

Our goal was to create a considerable scientific background in various age groups by conducting engaging, enjoyable, and motivating activities, to make a significant change in how people around us perceive Synthetic Biology. We really wanted to present a perspective to all of these impressionable minds around us that fills them with a passion for this field, alongside presenting it as a lucrative career option for them in a monetary sense.
We really feel encouraged and validated for our efforts by the response we got from school-going students, especially D.A.V. Public School Gurugram, where the response truly exceeded all our expectations.
We will surely continue our efforts in this direction so that we can become a small yet significant part of the revolution in the field of technology.
School Workshops (2017, July-October):
iGEM IIT Delhi conducted seminars and lab workshops on synthetic biology in various high schools of Delhi. These workshops were aimed at informally introducing the students to this field. ‘Just like you join together Lego blocks to create structures, you can join together genes to create new biological systems’ was the main theme behind most of our workshops.
The session began with the basics of synthetic biology, iGEM, our projects. This was followed by a compendious presentation on ‘Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology’, which involved discussion on Ethical issues like Bioterrorism, Patenting and Creation of Monopolies, Uncontrolled release, Creating Artificial Life etc.
In order to give students a flavor of lab work, we conducted an experimental workshop in their lab. The experimental workshop consisted of simple illustrations and some hands-on experience for them such as Plasmid isolation, Gel electrophoresis, Inoculation, streaking, etc"

As expected, E. coli BL21 also exhibited a similar behavior using these new parts.

Even though the expression profile in P. agglomerans was not as high as in E.coli BL21, it is still possible to conclude that our chassis can recognize our two plasmids and exhibit an IPTG dependent toehold-switch behavior!

Iron and Lactate Biosensors
Another way to sense diseases is through the detection of metabolites that are qualitatively or quantitatively altered in the specific condition. As a way of detecting  Plasmodium-contaminated blood in the mosquito gut, we designed the concept of a Fe2+ and Lactate presence AND gate.
Our approach was inspired by two previous iGEM projects:
Iron Coli from 2013 Evry Team
MicroBeacon from 2015 ETH_Zurich Team
The team from Evry developed an interesting iron biosensor based on E. coli fur regulator, a protein that represses its cognate operator in the presence of iron. Our chassis (P. agglomernas presents motifs for recognition of fur protein, which can be explained by it's genetic the similarity to E. coli. In order to avoid cross-talk between endogenous gene regulation and the signal from our biosensor, we developed a new system for Fe2+ detection based on dtxR regulator from Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
ETH_Zurich's 2015 team developed a lactate biosensor based on the LldR protein, wich we applied to our project.

Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#calendar_-_-_TEXT.html," with L-forms yesterday,using bright field and fluorescence microscopy. When viewing an L-form washed seedling using fluorescence microscopy we noticed clearly defined green circles in several different areas of the plant. These were of the correct size (about 0.5um) to correspond to our GFP labelled L-forms. No such green circles were found in our control that had been washed in mannitol solution instead of L-form solution. These results are encouraging as they indicate we may have successfully inoculated plants with L-forms, although more evidence is needed. We also decided that when we next grow L-forms in plants, we should wash some seedlings in a solution of bacteria with cell walls to see if these can be taken up by plants.

L-form Growth Curve
Aim:
To establish a growth curve for L-forms.
Methods:
We started doing the L-form growth curve. Initially we took OD reading of the  L-form we grew over the weekend with a spectrophotometer.
Results:
The OD obtained was 0.246. We then diluted the solution down to get an OD of 0.05. That solution was then used to create the L-form growth curve. The initial readings of the two L-form samples were 0.05 and 0.046.
Planting Chinese Cabbage Seeds
Aim:
To plant seeds in order to wash them with L-forms and visualize them by confocal microscopy.
Methods:
We washed and planted chinese cabbage seeds in preparation for the introduction of L-forms into seedlings following the Production of L-form containing Plants protocol up to and including step four. The seeds were planted in Murishage and Skoog containing petri dishes and placed in a dark cuboard to germinate. The washing part of the protocol will be done on August 13th .

Integrated Human Practice
S-Din is a product born for solving synthetic biological problems and serving the biologists and ordinary people who are interested in synthetic biology. In our ""Integrated Human Practices"" page, we'll show essential human practices work we have done around S-Din, including user needs analysis, function improvement for user feedback, product assessment, and public promotion.
User needs analysis
Study the needs of other iGEM teams & ordinary bio-lovers
In the discussion with SYSU-CHINA iGEM team and SCAU-China iGEM team, we reached an agreement that fragmented data makes it time-consuming and laborious to collect and reuse data. ( Silver page )
Nowadays data or information online is abundant but scattered. Many people spend much time on integrating them by themselves. instead of spending more time on their ideas for their core work.
Figure 13: How a man may assign his time in a project when getting integrated data by himself
In fact, this trouble is possible to be solved ---- by a dedicated software. If we could establish an integrated database, consisting of a unified standard of data composition and data format, we should find out the relationships among the data more easily. Besides, a data format standard makes it more convenient and engineering to store, reuse and combine the data. And engineering work is what computers are good at.
So our team desired to change the workflow into the figure below:
Figure 14: How a man may assign his time in a project when getting integrated data with a dedicated software.
Study the needs of ordinary bio-lovers
At the same time, we chatted with some students who are interested in biology work. They told us:
""We'll like the software if it shows details of each bio-project, in a way easy to understand.""
""It would be better if the software can provide a basic analysis of the work.""
""Could you develop a software which can recommend interesting projects of my own?""
...
We found that the needs above are the most popular. To achieve these goals, an enough huge and integrated database is critical. Of course, mathematical algorithms should be equipped with our software.
Studying the needs of biology labs
During the summer, we visited several biology laboratories of Sun Yat-sen University. Researchers warmly greeted us. Thanks to Prof. Lu Yongjun's help, we finished our interlab task and wet-lab validation in his laboratory. Meanwhile, we chatted with the researchers and conducted a small survey of their project"

The sample was allowed to return to room temperature before it was ligated by mixing 1µL 10µM annealed oligos and 50ng/µL of digested construct with T4 DNA ligase (#M0202). Reaction was setup according to the manufacture's protocol. 1µL ligation mix was transformed into chemical competent NEB DH5α E. coli cells (#C2987) according to the manufacture's protocol. Transformants were selected overnight on LB agar plates containing 6µg/mL chloramphenicol.
Transformants with the cycloviolacin Y1 or tyrocidine split-intein casette were selected and grown overnight in 3mL LB media containing 6µg/mL chloramphenicol. Plasmids were purified using Qiaprep spin columns (#27104). The expression casette was combined with promoter BBa_J23101  from Anderson's promoter library. BBa_J23101 was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and the split-intein expression cassette was digested with EcoRI and XbaI for 15 minutes and subsequently heat-inactivated at 65ºC for 5 minutes. The digested expression cassette and BBa_J23101 were mixed with T4 DNA ligase in 1:3 and 1µL ligation product was transformed into chemical competent NEB DH5α E. coli cells, as previously described. Transformants were selected overnight on LB agar plates containing 6µg/mL chloramphenicol.
Detection of cyclic peptides by UHPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS and SDS-PAGE
The presence of cyclic peptides was determined by UHPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS. Peptides were extracted using methanol extraction. A detailed protocol for detection can be found here .
Expression of inteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Novex NuPAGE. Samples were boiled with 1x SDS in presence of a reducing agent. The protein gel was stained using Coomassie Blue and samples were run according to the manufacture’s protocol.

Finally, our integrated human practices strategy helped us to think a step further about our design, regarding, for example, the costs involved in our device and what it should actually look like; what kind of ‘kit’ will it be and what will it contain? We also looked at the feasibility of our device in the context of whether or not farmers would actually be allowed to use such a device and what needs to be done considering legislation to make this possible.
Only veterinarians can prescribe or change antibiotic treatments.
Engeline van Duijkeren (veterinarian)
Stakeholder interactions shaped our final design and made it feasible to transform our detection method into an application, resulting in a toolbox with which the farmers can perform the resistance test themselves on-site, instead of being dependent on slow lab processes. Simple, cheap and safe methods - for example the hand-powered centrifuge and boiling method during sample preparation, together with an optimized readout - make our device applicable for rapid frontline diagnostics. We developed our toolbox to detect the most relevant multiple antibiotic resistance genes, expanding the impact of our product to achieve better animal and human treatment strategies, see our applied design page for more info!

Cloning methods represent one of the core elements of synthetic biology and it is crucial for each iGEM team to know as much as possible about the broad varity of cloning techniques. This need has been recognized by the iGEM Eindhoven which searched for collaborators using different cloning approaches to share their experiences in the latest cloning guide. The iGEM Team Stockholm could therefore contribute with their experience in overlap-extension PCR (OE-PCR) cloning. This technique is a completely restriction enzyme free approach to integrate elongated fragments into a target vector.

Figure 2: Structure determination of Arc1p-C . (A) Crystals of Arc1p-C were obtained after 2 to 4 days in a wide range of crystallization conditions. (B) Crystal structure of Arc1p shown as ribbon (left) – and electrostatic surface representation (right). Dashed lines indicate the putative tRNA binding site.  This fact is underlined by the presence of a glycerol from the cryosolution because glycerol likely mimics ribose sugar of a RNA.
Molecular modelling the Arc1p interaction with tRNA
To understand the binding mode of tRNA to Arc1p-C we used the DUCK-BP server employing the FTdock  algorithm (Gabb et al., 1997) to calculate possible binding modes (Figure 2).  Taking functional aspects into account only the highest scoring docking model seems to represent the real binding mode since all the others lead to a blockade of the tRNA  acceptor stem. Furthermore, solution 1 perfectly matches with the presence of a glycerol potentially mimicking a RNA backbone ribose position (see also Figure 2B).
Figure 3: Calculated docking modes of tRNA to Arc1p-C . Only the first one seems sensible from a functional point of view because all other solutions  hide the 3’ end of the tRNA to which canonical aaRSs transfer amino acids.
Structure-based design of Arc1p-PheA catalysts
In order to create that correct distance between those two domains we wanted to use computational methods to simulate the protein with different linker lengths between  the two domains. As a linker we used repeated GSSG units. With the crystal structure of PheA known we still needed to solve the crystal structure of Arc1p-C and find the  binding mode of the tRNA to Arc1p-C in order to build a precise molecular model of rationally design  suitable linker lengths that balance between on the one hand enough  flexibility for favourable positioning of tRNA and activated amino acid and a sufficient increase in local reactant concentration for efficient catalysis to occur on the  other hand. The results of the simulation of 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 GSSG units suggested that the best distance that should lead to the highest catalyst activity is reached with  two GSSG units (Figure 4). For the testing of our prediction, we synthesized the fusion protein with these five different linker lengths.

As the digestions of the transcriptional unit (TU) of EaDAcT were incorrect, we repeated the process from the ligation step.
We transformed the same TU in a E. coli competent strain (DH5α). Then, the transformants were cultured in LB media and Spm and stored at 37°C overnight.
Finally, in order to obtain the FAO1 gene, we want to extract the Candida tropicalis genome, so we have picked a colony of C. tropicalis. To check the extraction protocol, we used a yeast previously tested, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have cultured C. tropicalis in YPD media and S. cerevisiae in YPDA media at 28 °C (5 mL).

Candida genome extraction
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used as a control in order to see if we followed the protocol correctly. We aren't really sure if this protocol is going to work in Candida.
Cultures measured at 600 nm:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 1.07
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.39
S. cerevisiae is recultured with new media (1:2) because the previous media was saturated. 2.25 mL of YPD media were mixed with 2.25 mL of S. cerevisiae culture. The mix has to grow at 28 °C until the exponential phase is reached.
The absorbance was measured again:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 0.52
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.40
Buffers needed for the genome extraction were prepared freshly.The genome of both strains of yeast were extracted following the protocol:
Grow yeast in 2 or 5 mL YPD to exponential phase.
Collect cells in 1.5 mL eppendorf-cup (centrifugation 20 s, 6000 rpm).

8.14 Mutagen Concentration Test - Seventh Protocol
I) Purpose
To mutate T7 phage for different capsid sizes.
II) Expected Outcome
A decrease in phage viability with increasing mutagen concentration.
A few random mutations that produce smaller and larger phage that can be isolated.
III) Reagents Used
5-bromodeoxyuridine stock in freezer labeled T7 (10mg/mL)
Uracil solution (2.5mg/mL)
Adenine solution (5mg/mL)
7.19 phage stock
x2 top agar
LB
IV) Procedure
1) Overnight (The day before) (8.13)
Add 5mL of LB into a test tube and add 1 colony of E. Coli B into the tube using a wooden stick.
2) Applying the mutagen (8.14)
Label 3 test tubes 0, 200, 500. Add 9.8mL of LB and 40ul of adenine solution into each test tube. Then add 200ul of E coli B overnight into each test tube. Incubate on the shaker at 37 Celsius.
Remove all the test tubes off the shaker after 2 hours. Add 40ul of adenine and 80ul of uracil to each test tube. Also add the corresponding amount in ul of 5-bromodeoxyuridine, a mutagen, to each test tube. (Ex: Add 200ul of mutagen to tube labeled 200)

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Lab Book#Chromate Detector_-_-_TEXT.html,"4 - 16/07: Set up overnight cultures of colonies chosen after colony-PCR for subsequent purification and sequence confirmation.
Aim of experiment: Set up overnight cultures of ChrBopt colonies 2, 4, 9, and 12 for sequencing.
Protocols Used: Overnight cultures
Results: N/A
Next Steps: Purification of recombinant plasmids.
Day 5 - 17/07: Purified and sequenced chosen ChrBopt-colonies.
Aim of experiment: To purify recombinant plasmids for sequence confirmation.
Protocols Used: Miniprep, Sequencing
Results: ChrBopt showed HindIII restriction sites and was hence cleaved into partial inserts.
Next Steps: Use alternative cloning protocol for ChrB and ChrBopt.
Week Beginning 20/07
Summary
During this week an alternative cloning strategy for ChrB and ChrBopt was employed. Furthermore, the pSB1C3-pChr-GFP construct was cloned in a stepwise fashion.
Day 1 - 20/07: Went back to the original plate of pSB1C3-pChr-GFP for visualising colonies that do or do not express GFP.
Aim of experiment:To compare colonies on the patch plate of pSB1C3-pChr-GFP by differentially visualising colonies that do or do not express GFP under UV light. The background of this experiment was that if there is one colony that has both inserts in the correct orientation with respect to each other, then there is perhaps one that also has them with the correct orientation with respect to the plasmid. Colonies identified as expressing GFP were patch plated and grown in liquid cultures over night in order to confirm the sequence of the insert.
Protocols Used: Patch-plating, overnight cultures
Results: Figure 15 pSB1C3-pChr-GFP in E. coli JM110.
Next Steps: Sequence confirmation of newly selected colonies.
Day 2 - 21/07: Purified plasmids from new colonies and confirmed sequence. Restriction digest of pUniprom with BamHI and PstI.
Aim of experiment:Purification of newly selected colonies, 1, 5, 6, and 7, containing pSB1C3-pChr-GFP for subsequent sequence confirmation. Restriction digest of pUniprom with BamHI and PstI to employ an alternative cloning strategy of ChrB and ChrBopt.

Beta-pinene was later re-done with the yeast vial preparation method for the in vitro assay.
The protein samples were run on an SDS PAGE 10% gel. The gels were ran as:
Pre-induction alpha-pinene
Post-induction alpha-pinene
Alpha-pinene purified protein
Pre-induction beta-pinene
Post-induction beta-pinene
Beta-pinene purifed protein
The gels were run properly and there were some results but somewhat unclear. Two Bohlmann Lab members (thanks for letting Daisy bother you guys!!) helped Daisy troubleshoot the gel and try to interpret the results. It turns out that because the protein was expressed in bacteria and the cell lysate was run though a gravity filtered nickel column (his tag), there are some other bacterial proteins that also bind to the column. When we ran the protein on the gel, we saw several bands in the purified protein lane.
The two Bohlmann lab members also suggested doing a western with anti-his antibodies but we do not have any anti-his antibodies and neither do they.
Derek helped Daisy take a picture of the protein gels and also suggested a western.
We also tried the yeast expression protocols again without the evaporation and there were no results.

Joanne and Jacob went to aGEM, a pre-jamboree iGEM meetup based in Alberta. Jacob had the opportunity to give UBC's presentation to a group of judges and the students from the Alberta teams. He received some great feedback about the project and presentation, saw  the fantastic presentations from the Alberta teams, and had the opportunity to chat with the judges about the future of synthetic biology. It was an amazing experience!

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

During this time, in cooperation with members from HKU, we came to Chengdu No.7 JiaXiang senior high school, which is the best high school in Chengdu, for a lecture about the iGEM and synthetic biology. Students from high school showed great enthusiasm and interests about our work, for instance, they asked a lot of questions, including ‘can we design little games on the phone and push it to the markets’, ‘can we high school students participate in the iGEM competition’ and so on. I believe in the near future, they will become a member of iGEM, just like us, and will do better than us.

Today we did a summary after reading a large number of academic papers related to MCCAP and had a comprehensive knowledge of the iGEM requirements. We focused on the structure setting and the principal of running, both the software and the game named Find Father for iOS. Beyond that, we enriched our game, including background which contains the culture of ancient China, enjoyment and interaction as well.

Outside of practice, this product as a commercialized object is a point of discussion. This therapeutic approach is devised as a pill form that is taken outside of a hospital. Therefore, the cost falls on the patients, not on the government’s health coverage, OHIP (in the province of Ontario, Canada).11 As a result, this potential therapy may be inaccessible to patients with little finances. Regulations or subsidies on behalf of the government could elevate this issue.
Regulations:
Health Canada, the governing body that regulates probiotic use in Canada, has permitted the use of lactobacilli strains, including Lactobacillus brevis, in many products.12
Probiotics used for therapeutic purpose are classified as either natural health products (NHP) sold over the counter under the Natural Health Products Regulations, or as prescription drug under the Food and Drugs Act.13,14 Depending on the intended use, delivery and composition of the product, different regulations apply15.
Health Canada, specifically the Health Products and Food Branch, is also responsible for the regulation of products derived from living sources including cytokines through the Biologics Program. Depending on the type of the biopharmaceutical, different centres carry part of the responsibilities of the Biologics Program. Specifically for cytokines, the Centre for Evaluation of Radiopharmaceuticals and Biotherapeutics reviews and evaluates the products and documents to assure safety and quality, and performs further testing for research.16 The Centre establishes  regulations and standard operating procedures of such products, and ensures that the clinical trials conducted were properly designed and had no serious adverse reactions. They also conduct pre-market review of the products and their labels, authorizing for sale in Canada. Even after the products have been released into the market, Health Canada assesses complaints, adverse events, and perform Health Risk Assessments, as part of the Lot Release Program.17 They provide correct information about the product to health care practitioners, consumers, and the general public. Furthermore, they visit product manufacturing facilities for evaluations. Lastly, they conduct further research on the methods and the science of the products through academic collaboration nationally and internationally.18
Security:
In itself, Lactobacilli is considered to be non-pathogenic.5 Furthermore, because of the acidity of the stomach and enzymes present, it is likely that multiple dose is required for any effect to be seen. Therefore, the potential for this product to be an effective weapon"

Biosafety measures are completely necessary to ensure Printeria  introduction in non-scientific environments.
We realized it was necessary to improve our safety measurements. Mojica advised us the use of UV light filters as bacterial-killer, which were positively integrated into Printeria final design.
He advised us to be aware about the vocabulary used to divulgue science, as it needs to be technically correct but close and safe enough for the lay public to listen to you.
This, along with the bioartist expert feedback, gave us the idea to use a non-usual approach to divulgue SynBio into the lay-public. As a consequence, Printeria promotion among society was carried out by including the BioArt as the main attraction to get to the public.

Yturralde has a bachelor's degree and a PhD in fine arts awarded by the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV). Furthermore he has been researcher in the MIT among other great things. Between 1968 and 1973 he developed his work ""Impossible figures"" . These figures are really interesting because they show us how our space perception works, they seem coherent at first glance but when you observe them in more detail you see there are inconsistent details.
Images 4-5. Yturraldes's masterpiece and our final Microbial Art version under UV light.
To prove Printeria's power in bioart we decided to do one of those figures which you can see above and an interview to get some expert feedback from him. Here you can see the full interview we did:
Interview: Yturralde
Interview conclusions were:
The way we have to bring Printeria to the market
Yturralde said that there is something really important in art and it is the creative process. He recommended us not to show the product (draws in petri plates) but show the creative process. This way we will catch the artist attention. In this line, we consider to do several promotional videos with the process to show them in future art gallery expositions like Hangar Gallery in Barcelona or EL planetari de Castelló where we will go after the jamboree to present our project.
Furthermore, he told us that we had to sell the idea of an art that evolves with time because Printeria is not only makes art, it makes life, science and evolution.
Where will Printeria have a great impact?
Yturralde recommends the US to launch such innovative projects. The fact is that it is not without"
