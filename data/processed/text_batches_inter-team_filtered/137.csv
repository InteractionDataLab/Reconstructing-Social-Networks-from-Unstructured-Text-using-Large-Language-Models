Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Results#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," glycosidase assay using isolated oligosaccharides as detailed above. By normalizing the activity to the amount of bound protein and comparison with the enzyme in solution we can investigate whether immobilization has any impact on enzyme activity.
Do our immobilized enzymes also efficiently convert erythrocytes to type O (enzyme on solid phase, substrate on solid phase)?
Again we cannot transfer the results obtained from the soluble substrate analogues to the red blood cells. There are two effects which might reduce the activity of our enzymes acting on the red blood cells. First, protein which has not bound to the surface but diffused into the beads will not be available for the reaction as the mesh of the beads is too small to allow the erythrocytes to enter the bead. Furthermore both components, enzyme and substrate, are now bound to a solid phase reducing their degrees of freedom. The efficiency of red blood cell conversion can be monitored as described above. This is the final test our system has to pass!

Note that the relative emission of each spectrum is normalised to one.
Difficulties were foreseen in making the various light producing proteins bright enough to activate their corresponding sensors, as well as in providing the substrates necessary for the bacteria to constantly emit light. However, once we received word that this year's Cambridge team was working to alleviate these problems, we decided to focus our efforts on the process of creating and characterising the various light producing and light sensing proteins.
During the course of the project, we collaborated closely with the UNAM-Genomics team from Mexico, since it was apparent from an early stage that we were pursuing very closely related ideas.
Problems
The overall design was very ambitious, and we were thus unable to assemble the light controlled repressilator within the allocated time period, especially given the problems we experienced with the individual light based components. However we believe that our work makes progress towards it as well as other applications in which light signalling can be useful, such as communication between bacteria and computers.
BioBricks (Proposed)
The BioBricks that would have been used in the proposed repressilator system would have been as follows:
BBa_B0034 : ribosome binding site based on the Elowitz repressilator.
BBa_R0010 : the LacI-sensitive inhibitory promoter region.
BBa_R0040 : the TetR-sensitive inhibitory promoter region.
BBa_R0051 : the lambda-CI-sensitive inhibitory promoter region.
BBa_C0012 : the coding region for the LacI protein.
BBa_C0040 : the coding region for the TetR protein.
BBa_C0051 : the coding region for the lambda-CI protein.
BBa_B0011 : transcriptional terminator.
In addition to the above, we would also have integrated the light sensing and light producing BioBrick parts described elsewhere in this section.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Calculation_-_-_TEXT.html,"While it can be used by individuals working on straightforward decisions, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is most useful where teams of people are working on complex problems, especially those with high stakes, involving human perceptions and judgments, whose reso-lutions have long-term repercussions. It has unique advantages when important elements of the decision are difficult to quantify or compare, or where communication among team members is impeded by their different specializations, terminologies, or perspectives.
Decision situations to which the AHP can be applied include:
Choice - The selection of one alternative from a given set of alternatives, usually where there are multiple decision criteria involved.
Ranking - Putting a set of alternatives in order from most to least desirable
Prioritization - Determining the relative merit of members of a set of alternatives, as opposed to selecting a single one or merely ranking them
Resource allocation - Apportioning resources among a set of alternatives
Benchmarking - Comparing the processes in one's own organization with those of other best-of-breed organizations
Quality management - Dealing with the multidimensional aspects of quality and quality improvement
Conflict resolution - Settling disputes between parties with apparently incompatible goals or positions
The AHP procedure
Users of the AHP first decompose their decision problem into a hierarchy of more easily comprehended sub-problems, each of which can be analyzed independently. The elements of the hierarchy can relate to any aspect of the decision problem—tangible or intangible, carefully measured or roughly estimated, well- or poorly-understood—anything at all that applies to the decision at hand.
Once the hierarchy is built, the decision makers systematically evaluate its various elements by comparing them to one another two at a time, with respect to their impact on an element above them in the hierarchy. In making the comparisons, the decision makers can use concrete data about the elements, but they typically use their judgments about the elements' relative meaning and importance. It is the essence of the AHP that human judgments, and not just the underlying information, can be used in performing the evaluations.
The AHP converts these evaluations to numerical values that can be processed and compared over the entire range of the problem. A numerical weight or priority is derived for each element of the hierarchy, allowing diverse and often incommensurable elements to be compared to one another in a rational and consistent way. This capability distinguishes the AHP from other decision making techniques.
In the final step of the process, numerical priorities are calculated for each of the decision alternatives. These numbers represent the alternatives' relative ability to achieve the decision goal, so they allow a straightforward"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," can now explore the parameter space to find parameter sets which describe the wanted behavior and regulation of the toxin-antitoxin system. As there was no experimental data available in literature to score the combined system, we used conservative constraints which are known from literature 5, 6 to construct our model for the MazE and MazF kinetics.
The objective is to find sets of parameters which give a response within the conservative constraints and thus show us where in parameter space to search in further analysis to describe the toxin-antitoxin system. As the Biobrick BBa_K081007 is not only used in pDawn, but also in the quorum sensing system , we wanted to have a tool to decide whether we can also use the less sensitiveBased on data from Ohlendorf et al. (2012), pDusk shows a smaller change in RFPp ratio than pDawn. For the kill switch this translates into a smaller change in antitoxin over toxin (A/T) ratio and thus a smaller likelihood to kill the cell effectively. , but theoretically feasible pDusk system in the kill switch design.
System Design
To build the kill switch we first studied the mazEF system and its functionality. The mazEF module is an toxin-antitoxin (TA) system native in E. coli. For the purpose of building a mathematical model, we describe the relevant aspects of the system here. For more background on the mazEF system, please go to wet-lab part .
In the TA system, mazE represents the antitoxin which forms a dimer and binds two dimers of mazF to built an inactive complex under non-lethal conditions 5 . The functionality of the system in nature is given by a fast degrading antitoxin and a slower degrading toxin. Once expression of the TA module is terminated, mazE will degrade faster and mazF will start cleaving mRNAs which ultimately leads to cell death. For the kill switch, we will consider either “under”-production of mazE in pDusk or overproduction of mazF in pDawn both under light inducing conditions as shown in Figure 14.

A diffusion experiment was also performed with these membranes. The dye is able to diffuse through it in less than 1 minute. This means that this material is fully suitable for our project since the 0.1 µm porosity allows peptides diffusion but prevents bacterial transfer. Its permeability towards microorganisms doesn’t need to be tested as they are already used with success in the industry for this purpose. Moreover, it is permeable to water since the start-up company Sunwaterlife uses it for this application. This will allow the perfect rehydratation of the freeze-dried microorganisms. As a results, we will create a sachet containing the freeze-dried microorganisms using this membrane.
→ (1) and (2) are fulfilled.
However, even if we feel confident about the containment properties of the Sunwaterlife membrane, the non-rigid aspect and thinness of the sachet could repel the users. In collaboration with Sunwaterlife, we have designed a solid container for the sachet. It is a cylinder with Sunwaterlife membrane technology as sections. A seal and an external part to be screwed against the membrane will allow its fixing.
Device containing the sachet with Sunwaterlife membrane technology as sections (Solidworks modeling)
The sachet is therefore placed into the cylinder which is then screwed. The whole device can be soaked into the water to be treated. This device ensures a high level of security regarding GMM containment in our system. This gives credibility to our system and it will be easier to get it accepted by clients.
The material initially chosen for the cylinder is ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) which is a common thermoplastic polymer. It is a light but rigid material, sustainable, water resistant, cheap and shock-resistant. Indeed, it is used to make motorcycle helmets because of its affordability and robustness. Moreover, it can easily be molded, which gave us the opportunity to print it in 3D.

Finally, ABS is a cheap material: around 1,000€/ton6. It can be used for food applications. Unlike polycarbonate that may contain bisphenol A, a hormone disruptor, ABS is known to be safer and more stable. Therefore, this material can be put in contact with water that will be used by the clients without danger.

Proof of Concept
We were able to successfully build a system utilizing a camera for measuring color and a Raspberry Pi for processing the color value. It is also able to add inducer chemicals in response to these measurements and computations.
In order to test our image processing and response system, we are using color dyes. This allows us to optimize and characterize our system with easily-controlled color inputs and outputs, without noise or anomalies caused by an actual cell culture. In the future, this will also help us build a standard repertoire of recognizable color values used in machine learning, allowing our system to better regulate chemical inputs.
Once we characterize the violacein pathway, we expect to be able to use color data to implement our system with other chromogenic genetic pathways, making it more versatile and generalizable for applications in research labs and industry settings.

To exclude the possibility of a bias towards specific amino acids within the library, clones of the transformation efficiency plates were picked randomly for sequencing. The nucleotide and corresponding amino acid sequence are represented in Figure 14A. No clones were picked twice and only two deletions/frameshifts were identified. On the basis of these data the sequencing alignment was done. Figure 14B supports the good quality of the generated library showing the DNA sequence and amino acid diversity. The sequence alignment also reflects the well-targeted mutations as conserved nucleotides are resembled according to their letter size. As shown in Figure 12D, the used mutation primers incorporated NNK at desired positions, whereby N stands for any possible nucleotide and K for guanine or thymine. All introduced nucleotides ‘N’ show at least three diverse nucleotides, whereas all introduced nucleotides ‘K’ showed the expected pattern. The diversity of the nucleotides is reflected in the translated amino acid sequence.
To sum up, our J23100_TAR_QC library is unbiased, well targeted and of good quality.
Chapter III: Reading the Library
Fig. 15: Animation of the combined results of the three focus groups
Based on the knowledge of the well characterized J23100_TAR_QC library, we assumed to have constructed novel chemoreceptors. Due to the modification of the binding site these should be capable of recognizing new chemical substances. Therefore, we performed library selection assays using seven different chemicals. We expected E. coli to perform chemotaxis towards these chemicals as illustrated in Figure 15.
Figure 16: Novel chemoreceptors recognize different tested chemicals. The designed Tar_QC library was transformed into BL21 cells and then tested on swimming agar plates with seven different interesting chemicals. After three rounds of selection of the fastest swimming E. colis towards these, three clones per chemical were picked. Sequencing results identified two novel chemoreceptors that were found for different chemicals: the novel receptor with amino acid sequence LTAQPD…SSAVP (red boxes) was identified for swimming towards D-aspartate, 2-ethyl-hexanol and sodium cyclamate and the novel receptor with amino acid residues PPAQPP…PSAVT (orange boxes) was identified for swimming towards L-aspartate and caffeine.

Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.

March to April 2018
After members communicated with their families in winter holiday, we also visited SCAU and had a close look at their integrated project. What we saw and the advice from Prof.Yuan inspired a new idea that street interviews could serve as an appropriate approach for us to understand the general situation of the gap in Chinese society. Therefore, we designed the questionnaire and did the interview in Shenzhen.
June 2018
In June, the data of the interview was brought to the discussion with Prof.Yuan. He believed interviewing various population would benefit the final result. To fit the theme of our project and the competition, we decided to condense the questionnaire into three big directions of the gap, cutting down the cancer-related content. The whole team took part in the survey in Taiwan and Shanghai in August. Plus, Prof.Yuan encouraged us to extend the HP project to the research on autism children, planning to have an art exhibition presenting these kids’ painting.
Late September 2018
Prof.Yuan communicated with us about the result of the interview in the end of September, directing the processing of data and the logic throughout the project. He also reminded us to collect contrast data from professors working in biology-related fields.
Early in October 2018
In early October, our team planned the altruism study and the following art convention with the help from Prof.Yuan as well as a charity group in our university. The results will be shown after the Giant Jamboree.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," the system's failure. That is, if and when a ""fail-safe"" system ""fails"", it is ""safe"" or at least no less safe than when it was operating correctly. Because our system can operate in batch and continuous modes, it is possible to retain the matter inside different storage tanks throughout the process, thus allowing for longer retention while a specific component of the system is getting fixed.
We have also analysed our system and checked whether or not it follows the inherent safety guidelines well. Since the whole system was developed with the goal of minimizing and replacing the hazardous materials (Eg. chloroform) use and minimising the energy consumption, we found the process to be cohesive with most of the inherent safety guidelines.
We decided to adopt the NASA biosafety hazard levels to check whether or not using our process in Mars is possible. NASA is adapting the same biosafety hazard levels as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA. The biohazard level 1 and 2 materials are allowed on the ISS, while levels 3 and 4 are generally prohibited. Since our E. coli possesses a minimal risk to humans and would not survive outside of the system it falls under biohazard level 1 and hence would be allowed in Martian expeditions.
finally we worked on identifying the potential points of system failure and have considered different arrangements of equipment in space to allow easy accessibility to the failure points by the astronauts. The points of failure are: filter after the centrifugal separator (clogging potential), bioreactor containment with dead cells, self-cleaning filter (clogging potential).
Week 23: October 2-6
This week, we have spent a lot of time in the lab preparing the syn poop supernatant for the synthesis group to run their experiments on. We have made two batches of syn poop, left it to ferment with non-PHB producing bacteria for 3 days and then centrifuged and filtered the supernatant.
We have continued to work on creating diagrams and writing up the Applied design page and the journal.
Week 24: October 9-13
This week the team was busy with writing up the missed sections from the journal and the wiki pages. We have made significant progress on uploading the first half of the journal onto our wiki, as well as in writing up the Applied design, Solid Liquid separation, and Products pages.

Future Application
What we have shown in our project is only the tip of the iceberg. More possible applications of halorhodopin could benefit not only synthetic biology but also the human society. The following are some more advanced applications of halorhodopsin .
Halorhodopsin could facilitate light detection and light-coupled intercellular signal transduction. Light signal could be converted to intracellular chloride level signal, which can subsequently induce Pgad downstream genes. The target genes could be constructed to accelerate the synthesis pathway of quorum sensing signals, such as N-acyl homoserine lactones(AHL)1. As a result, one clone of bacteria could be designed as a light detector, amplifying and converting light signal to quorum signal which can cooperate with other clones of bacteria.
Moreover, halorhodopsin is not the only channel that couples light to ion transportation. There are other ion channels from retinylidene protein family sharing similar sequences and structures but pump other ions using light. An example is bacteriorhodopsin, which pumps protons out of the cells2 and channelrhodopsin non-specifically pumps cations into the cells3. Combining pH sensitive promoter4 with bacteriorhodopsin, osmolality sensitive promoters (OmpF, developed by iGEM08_NYMU-Taipei in 2008) and channelrhodopsin, the light coupled expression platform can be extended to a more accurate and more complex regulation system, making bacteria more programmable by computer.
Together with channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin can enable seawater desalination with the help of solar energy. Seawater desalination has long been an attractive yet difficult task to implement efficiently. E. coli expressing halorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin could be one promising way to solve this problem. It is possible to drive E. coli to capture various ions (mainly sodium ion, potassium ion and chloride ion) in seawater and move the se ions away by controlling the movement of E. coli"

iGEM - Peshawar
Guidance
At the beginning we contacted Peshawar iGEM group because we discovered that both projects deal with detection.            When we realized that the Peshawar group is the first team to represent Pakistan in iGEM we decided to share with            them the knowledge that was accumulated from past Technion iGEM teams.  The first step was to open a joint Facebook            group, so each team member from every group would be able to find his colleague on the opposite team.            Later, we had Skype sessions regarding mathematical modeling, Human practices and Cloning.
Mathematical modeling
We modeled Peshawar iGEM group's system using differential equations and logic gates. The aim of the work was           to predict the expression of the reporter protein when the concentration of the inducer is given. צריך לבקש מנופר שתעבור על זה
Human prctices
We shared with Peshawar iGEM group the layout of our educational program.            In addition, we gave the team advices regarding an appeal to the government with a            request to promote the education in the field of Synthetic Biology.
Cloning
Peshawar had issues with the transformation of plasmids into competent cells.            They elaborated on the exact steps they did in the lab and we tried to debug their procedure.
We also shared with team Peshawar our protocol for chemical transformation(3) and the protocol for producing competent cells(4).

Aachen
During the German wide Meetup we discovered that our new immobilization matrix, the Peptidosomes, would fit perfectly to the goal the iGEMers from Team Aachen want to reach. They are modifying the baker yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the aim that it can uptake salts, mainly NaCl. With this skill the yeast could help to e.g. purify industrial process water before it is released into the environment.
As discussed in our safety section it is not easy to get a permission to use genetically modified organisms (GMOs) outside of S1 laboratories. Our Peptidosome could be a further step towards the permission for placing them on the market or a deliberate release. Working as a safety tool, additionally to the membrane system Team Aachen developed, the Peptidosomes could prevent the escape of the GMOs into the environment.  To prove that encapsulation of yeast is possible, we performed a growth experiment and demonstrated with a plate reader assay that yeast was encapsulated in our Peptidosomes.
Figure 1: The results of the well-scan measurements for the detection of fluorescence are shown. If no signal is detected, the field of the matrix is green, otherwise red.
As it can be seen in Figure 1, the well scan of a Peptidosome with encapsulated yeast is positive. With the well-scan mode, we detected the fluorescent signal of S.cerevisae expressing the red fluorescent protein (RFP).   Thereby, we proved that the encapsulation of yeast in Peptidosomes is indeed possible.
iGEM goes green
Our iGEM Goes Green initiative aims at motivating other iGEM teams to make lab work during their project more sustainable and to think about the ecological consequences of their research. By providing the teams with knowledge and resources, we gave the first impulse and received a lot of input from teams all around the globe.
We took the great opportunity at the German-wide Meetup to share our vision about green labwork.

The Formaldehyde sensitive promoter expression is normally repressed by FrmR however, when Formaldehyde is present, the bond is broken triggering transcription of the GFP coding sequence and subsequently the triggering a colour output.

Design Stage
In order to implement the Formaldehyde biosensor variant to the Sensynova platform, a design was created by replacing the IPTG sensing system in the original detector module with the construct detailed above, creating part BBa_K2205030 . We chose to redesign the Formaldehyde biosensor detailed above to mirror the design used when producing the Psicose detector variant. The system detailed in the image below is made up of the constitutive promoter present within the platform triggering transcription of the FrmR repressing the PfrmR and subsequently the connector 1 of the Sensynova platform. We have also replaced the colour output present in the TMU-Tokyo design, we have added our part BBa_K2205008 , which produces our first connector in order to trigger a response from following modules of the Sensynova platform in the presence of Formaldehyde.

Figure 4: Formaldehyde Biosensor as the Detector Unit
Part BBa_K2205030 detailed above was designed using Benchling and virtual digestions and ligations were simulated resulting in the plasmid map detailed below.
Figure 5: BBa_K2205030 in PSB1C3
This part was created as a design only. The part BBa_K2205030 was not ordered for synthesis through IDT and subsequently not submitted to the registry.
Conclusions and Future Work
Due to time constraints, we lacked the time to synthesise, implement and characterise this part into the Sensynova platform within the lab. Future work on this part would include characterisation in vivo guided by the modelling of the framework when customised as a formaldehyde biosensor and testing against the Sarcosine Oxidase adaptor module currently present in the framework.

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," implication of the discovery of the blue energy principle serves as an illustration that research is the key to innovation and sustainable development. Research in synthetic biology has a long history in the Netherlands, and once regulations on the application of synthetic biology are changed, more application is possible. People are allowed to use genetically modified organisms just like they are allowed to use medicine or chemicals for cleaning. As long as the product is safe for use and kept out of the reach of children, people accept that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Every day, new applications appear on the market that contain or are made possible by GMOs. Examples of this are food wardens, which tell you if your food is still edible, or paint that changes colour over time as the bacteria grow. Progress is also made on a larger scale; bacteria are found that efficiently capture excess CO2 in the atmosphere are constructed and solar cells that use phototrophs are seen to be very efficient and are therefore applied on a large scale. Blue energy setups are well distributed over countries bordering the sea. As the GMO revolution started with the genetically modified biofilm of Bacillus subtilis, this is in retrospect seen as a turning point in history. Up to 7% of the world’s energy can be provided by blue energy, and in addition to that, more electricity is generated from solar and wind power than ever before. The conversion of biomass to medicine, plastics and other organics is made possible by the catalytic mechanisms of modified bacteria.
Social change
A shift is observed in the acceptance of GMOs in society. At first people were rather doubtful towards genetic modification, due to stories about extreme cases with negative consequences for the environment and biodiversity. From 2030 on, however, acceptance of GMOs is increased by the success of blue bio energy and the involvement of  the public in creative thinking on applications and the design of new products. Additionally, people accept that a complete shift towards renewable resources might only be possible when applying these new techniques. Interest in research increases, a larger public starts to show more interest for scientific DIY magazines and feel that they are more closely involved in science. New options become available, which translates into the possibility for consumers to decide on where their electricity comes from. More energy is available from renewable resources, as blue energy provides energy for 200,000 households in the Netherlands alone. This combined with solar and wind energy is enough to replace a significant number of coal power plant, resulting in a reduction of  CO2 emissions. This is development that causes a positive atmosphere. People are proud of Dutch research, industry and the new set of regulations in the EU"

TU-Delft,2012,Team:TU-Delft#part1_-_-_TEXT.html," downstream pathway is activated and the cells should go in growth arrest. If cells are dividing the percentage of DNA is higher then for cells that are in growth arrest. By staining the DNA of the cells with a fluorescent dye we could look at the DNA content and thus if the cells enter to growth arrest. This is done with a flow cytometer.
Outcome Niacin receptor
Flow cytometry results of +NR1 and reference cells induced with the niacin ligand. Cells were DNA stained and measured after 4.40 hours.
As controls we used a reference strain induced with niacin, and a +NR1 receptor strain without niacin induction. On the right there is our +NR1 receptor strain induced with niacin. The graphs show on the x-axis the measured intensity and on the y-axis we see the cell count.
We see that the controls show a peak in the same region, this peak indicates that the cells are distributed over all cell cycle phases.  We can see that the peak of the induced receptor strain is shifted to a lower fluorescent intensity. This might be an indication that the cells have a lower DNA content, and that they stopped growing.  Despite we didn’t see a response on the methyl nicotinate molecule we were very exited to have promising results on the binding of the niacin ligand! This is also in agreement with the results of the molecular dynamics modeling .
Outcome Banana receptor 1 and Banana receptor 2
When looking at the stained +BR1 and +BR2 strains with flow cytometry the data showed unclear and strangely shifted peaks. To get an idea of the behavior of the cell under influence of ligand and DNA staining, the cells were viewed with fluorescence microscopy. There was an effect of isoamylacetate on the location of the DNA stain. For all the strains this resulted in an evenly distributed glow over the whole cell after induction of isoamylacetate. Below microscopy pictures for the +BR1 strain are shown as an example. This observations could explain the unclear flow cytometry results. Another reason for that could be that the oily isoamyl acetate that drove on the medium disturbed the measurements.
Figure 7: OR1G1 transformed cells with isoamylacetate as inducing agent at an estimated concentration of 200mM.
Conclusions
All the olfactory receptors were successfully expressed in the yeast strains. For some of the receptors we observed a halo structure with FLAG-tag localization, this points to localization of the receptor into the membrane.
When inducing the niacin receptor strain with niacin we observed that the flow cytometry peak of the induced receptor"
St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#diary_-_-_TEXT.html," a gel of the ligate and discovered that it had not worked due to the fact that we didn’t digest the DNA for sticky ends! We noted our mistake and decided to repeat the ligation. The modelling team ran simulations to find the best ranges for transcription rates/translation rates/degradation.  Charlie and Anne decided that for the Drug Delivery Proof, the ""drug"" would be his-tagged GFP.  The GFP would be big enough that it wouldn't be naturally exported from the cell, and the his-tag would allow us to quantify the amount present in the extracellular matrix post cell death.  L-arabinose arrived in the mail.
Day 6:
Charlie transformed the GFP biobrick (I20260), the terminator (B0015), and the backbone (J04450).
Day 7:
Charlie transformed the backbone J04450 again because it failed, and made overnights for the arabinose test to be re-done tomorrow, but this time with L-Arabinose.
Week 8 - 29/08/11
Day 1:
The modelling team were rerunning and narrowing/rewriting the parameters to create a more efficient model. The drug proof experiment began. Ogaga made a miniprep, while Sam did a PCR on our GFP-HIS tag plasmid and terminator for the drug delivery proof experiment. PCR also carried out on the Backbone (iGem Biobrick backbone).
Day 2:
The modelling team ran through a variety of variables to see which would be the best set to utilise in our system and  have narrowed down translation and degradation for PG-1. Chris talked about to Lorna Sibbett about the statistics involved in our review who then suggested a couple of ideas and even loaned us a textbook. We attempted another Arabinose but an error occurred so we have agreed to carry it out again
Day 3:
The modelling decided upon a translation rate and degradation rate that is suitable for our system. They will, however, continue to alter ranges to find optimum value. We finally carried out a proper arabinose experiment today. The findings were analysed and graphed in excel. The discussions affecting the results included the fact that the cell would use the arabinose addition as food to consume as well as being used in the activation of the promoter. We also discussed a possible equilibrium with ribulose.
Day 4:
We received some PSB1C3 backbone from Glasgow, as our supplies were running low and PCRing some more was becoming problematic. Charlie carried out another run of the Kill Switch Proof experiment after the previous one"
BostonU,2013,Team:BostonU#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," industry interests, the synthetic biology community needs a standardized and well-characterized library of MoClo parts for Escherichia coli to enable protocol automation and informed device designing. The 2013 Boston University iGEM Team seeks to bridge this gap in the product development chain by building a standard library and characterizing the parts via flow cytometry. To further efforts to develop foundational advancements for synthetic biology, we are taking a multi-faceted approach and working at several aspects and levels of design automation by:
expanding a library of basic Level 0 MoClo parts by cloning from BioBrick parts and making new parts
building a library of composite Level 1 and 2 devices to characterize promoter-5' Untranslated Region combinations and demonstrate the library's usefulness
providing feedback on Clotho 2.0 software tools including the EugeneCAD language to a team of developers in the CIDAR Lab
working with the Wellesley Desyne team to develop an easy-to-use visualized programming language to wrap around Eugene
continuing the Datasheet project from the 2012 BostonU team by finalizing a format for sharing information with Purdue Biomaker's iGEM Team and programming a web app to generate the standardized datasheets
This year's work on these projects bring us closer to a more complete MoClo/Clotho platform for designing devices with software, constructing more complex devices in the wet laboratory by hand or with a liquid-handling robot, and sharing characterization data.

UCL,2013,Team:UCL#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," raise interest in the engineering faculty and also the iGEM competition. After this was complete, joined the rest of the group in research. Also performed wiki coding for the team page and notebook page.
The group continued what was started yesterday: Rectifying the proposals, with both sent off at the end of the day once they were complete. A group meeting was held at the end of the day to gauge interest and vote for the most popular idea, followed by a social gathering.
21st June
Tom - Continued wiki design, coding and content uploads. Alex - Continued to redraft the proposal for Alzheimer's StJohn - Continued to redraft the proposal for Cancer
KC - Researched into other iGEM teams to colloborate with and initiated correspondence via email
The team then discusses which project was favoured. It was fairly even but Alzheimer's was slightly more popular.
24th June
Tom continued wiki design whilst the rest of the group performed research.
Once this was complete, the group had a meeting with Yanika Borg and Philipp Boeing concerning the two project ideas. Philipp favoured the Alzheimer's project whilst Yanika was somewhat undecided.
A vote was taken with Alzheimer's being the prefered project by the group as a whole once more, although consensus was not fully reached. The group agreed to decide on the project on Wednesday proceeding a meeting with Prof. Lazaros Lukas.
25th June
The group continued with general research, and also went to the Wellcome trust to seek any extra information, although this was unfruitful.
27th June
The group voted 29 -11 in favour of Alzheimer's after a meeting with Prof. Lazaro Lukas, who was helpful and seemed excited about the project. The group also met advisor Yanika Borg and she agreed with the choice. The group also scheduled lab safety training for next thursday.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," treatment is required. [35] MiRNAs miR-122 and 192 were shown to be a more sensitive measure of DILI than levels of ALT, the enzyme currently used. Elevated ALT levels may be due to other factors (such as muscle inflammation or myopathies), whereas elevated levels of miRNAs are specific to acetaminophen overdose induced liver injury. [33] Therefore miRNAs again show great promise as future biomarkers to aid in diagnosis of DILI.
MiRNAs as biomarkers are also applicable to other conditions from myocardial infarction [36] to pregnancy [37] and associated complications like pre-eclampsia. [38]
The specificity of miRNAs is key - their restricted expression profiles gives them great potential to be used as biomarkers for specific tissue or stage specific diseases. [13] However, it is important to note further studies with larger patient cohorts are needed for clinical tests to be developed for the examples mentioned here.
Our method of quantifying miRNAs cheaply and effectively has the potential to diagnose and screen for a myriad of diseases. Our sensor could save millions of lives through the early detection of cancer and helping diagnose other diseases.
Applications in developing countries
Professor Sam Janes, Professor of Respiratory Medicine at UCL, said that for less economically developed countries, our test could be the ‘the biggest life saving intervention on the field.’ Dr Daniel Pregibon also emphasized this could be one of the main applications of our project.
Aapproximately 58% of lung cancer cases in 2012 occurred in less developed countries. [39] Solid household fuels for cooking and heating are prevalent in one third of South African households and a significant proportion of (8.7% to 34.6%) males in Benin, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone and Swaziland are moderate smokers.

The low cost of our sensor, combined with its relative simplicity (specialists are not required to interpret the results) means it could complement emerging healthcare systems in these less developed countries. Cervical cancer screening programs have been beneficial in developed countries. The World Health Organization, state the main reasons why screening tests aren’t implemented in less developed countries are (the same reasons would be true for NSCLC): [41]
The various competing health needs such as HIV/Aids in Sub-Saharan Africa, communicable diseases and maternal or perinatal complications
A lack of developed infrastructure for traditional diagnosis after screening such as high-quality cytology labs, transportation of samples"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Computational Analysis of PtNTT2
Zhang et al. used an N-terminal truncated version of PtNTT2, lacking the first 65 amino acids, since they observed some kind of toxicity resulting from the native N-terminal sequence (Zhang et al., 2017). For our project, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of PtNTT2 using the prediction software Phobius (Käll et al., 2007). Using Phobius, we analyzed the signal peptide and the transmembrane topology of PtNTT2. The analysis revealed that the native signal peptide is formed by amino acids 1 30, which means that Zhang et al. removed more than the native signal peptide for their experiment. The results of the prediction are shown in figure (1). Analysis of the transmembrane topology of the transporter, which is integrated into the plastid membrane in its native algal cell, shows iterative non-cytoplasmatic, transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. The topology might indicate, that the transporter will be integrated into the"

SynBio Day
The synbio community is growing fast in Germany. As we are delighted by this development we wanted to support it. Therefore, we organised a Synbio-Meet up in Duessedorf to inform people about synthetic biology and to spread our iGEM spirit.
To provide a direct insight in this interesting field of research and to make it as accessible as possible for all audiencences, we invited different researchers who are working in the field of synthetic biology.
The event was held in the Haus der Universität in Duesseldorf and we were proud that seven researchers and three iGEM teams presented their projects . Our PI Prof. Dr. Matias Zurbriggen introduced the event with a talk about: What is Synthetic Biology? Having this information in mind the audience was prepared for the following talks which focused on very diverse topics including optogenetics, technology and artificial photosynthesis. Of course we also informed people about the iGEM competition.
Furthermore we invited various iGEM teams from Germany to attend our event and were glad that iGEM Aachen, Bielefeld and Stuttgart showed up and gave a talk about their projects. All the talks dealt with so many different questions but contained one big message – synthetic biology is the future!
Finally we organized an ethical debate where the whole audience was included. One main question was how scientists can inform the public about their research and how we can reduce the fear many people have regarding synthetic biology and genetic engineering.
The Synbio Meetup was very successful with many attendees and a lot of scientific exchange. We were really excited that so many people are interested in synthetic biology and we hope everyone got a take home message.

PROJECT
overview
There are a population of 884 million still drink water without the previous purification all over the world. There are about 3 billion to 4 billion families lack of drinkable water. Each year about 3.5 million people's deaths are associated with insufficient water supply and sanitation condition, which occurs mainly in developing countries.
According to all above, the matter of water quality is a great matter of human beings’ life quality. It has always been crucial to many researchers engaging in improving and making breakthroughs on the approaches towards water quality detection. Currently chemical detection methods are more complex and time consuming; besides ,on the way of bringing the samples to the laboratory, some of the indicators may probably be changed. Another thing we may acknowledge is that chemical detection apparatus cost too much money.
Based on the matters above, this year we intended to look for a new way using biotechnology. Here come the ideas, through two kinds of approaches we may achieve rapid water quality detection. One of the approaches is so called comprehensive detection, here we mainly rely on LuxAB ,which encodes a kind of luciferase. Because anything toxic within the water may have a negative impact on the activity of luciferase, the luminescence is likely to be decreased. The other is specific detection, because only in this way can we successfully quantify specific metal ions like Hg(II). One sequence of MerR operon occupies a significant position along with quorum sensing system. In addition, we use gfp as reporter.
Besides the two biosensors we built, the joint uses of microfluidic chips, automatic detection devices, photoelectric detection technology and micro total analysis systems will extremely promote biological detection method. This device can also be linked to the computer and has the ability of offline CNC screen operation, which improves the detection efficiency. What’s more, little device is convenient to carry and free from  limitation of experimental conditions.
Biological method not only has the priority of concise operations and less consumption, but also has the advantages of high accuracy, specificity, and security.
Further Application
When it comes to the further application about the project, we can also explore the deeper meaning of the biological methods and the combination with micfluidics. Mostly, biotechnology applied in our project is supposed to be engineered. We have tried severe approaches to conduct recombinant plasmids to achieve specific goals, for instance, a sequence specialized to"
WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," to a collaboration session, we watched a seminar focused on constructing the wiki from which we gained advice on making the provided iGEM template unique to our team. During the collaboration session, we presented our project and listened to presentations from other teams. An important question posed to our team was regarding how we planned to dispose of our polystyrene discs. As a result of the question, we decided to reach out to other teams working with polystyrene degradation to propose a solution to the waste and contact professionals who work with non degradable waste. One project that made us reconsider our project design was focused on different methods of modelling. It helped us define our roadmap for kinetic modelling and design the direction of our experiment from our modelling efforts. We decided to expand beyond traditional kinetic models to include spore travel and expand the scope of our project data.
iGEM Midwest Meet Up with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
On August 17th, some of our team members attended the iGEM Midwest Meet Up at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The University of Illinois's iGEM team gave us a tour of their campus, buildings, and lab facilities. Their PI presented about his research in synthetic biology, and we each gave our presentations as well. After our presentations, we recognized that our teams were using very similar plasmids for work in S. cerevisiae. At the time, our team was having issues with our PCR primer design for our plasmid (pRS424), which the University of Illinois's team helped us to fix. We compared protocols and tips, particularly for competent cell transformations, and our team recommended several opportunities for fundraising and discounted supplies. Their team also tried to help us acquire the S. cerevisiae EBY100 strain, but because of material transfer issues and issues growing the strain, was ultimately not able to provide it to us (however, we greatly appreciate the effort!)."

Perfect Body
""PERFECT BODY"" is a product that goes just one or two steps further than our every day life now referring to social tendencies concerning the obsession of beauty and the availability of body (and woman).  I guess – if ""PERFECT BODY"" as a product comes up on the market a lot of people (especially girls in their puberty) would buy and use it. As they than loose their own body it would change their personal life – and with this a whole generation, influencing the society itself.  If we can buy body parts (things) that adhere in a minute on my own body, that become my own body - where is than the boarder between subject and object?  How will this change subjectivity and the meaning of individualism?
Mila Burghardt
AphrodiTec
Its the old story of controlling love – the own feelings and the feelings of the others. Fall in love and be loved – without any doubts! It is the deliverance of the freedom and a relieve of uncertainness and pain. But for which price? AphrodiTec points on the actual discussion and central question of the contemporary individual: the right measure of self-determination and heteronomy.
Mila Burghardt
Balcony Menu
What is 'bio'? A lot of people prefer products that are labeled with 'bio' – without asking themselves how 'bio' it really is. Is the 'bio' tomato that grew 800 kilometers away really 'better' than the 'normal' tomato that grew in the next village?  Balcony Menu takes this paradox to extremes. Food that I nurture on my balcony has to be 100 % 'bio', it makes a good conscious and a feeling of safety – but which process has the plant gone through until it was in this state to sustain various fruits and vegetables?  And still – wouldn't it be great to have that product at home? This product doesn't aim a judgement but wants to stimulate the awareness of what we eat and our perception of 'bio'.

The digestion, ligation, and cloning of the capsid gene have been conducted by students, partially also supported by instructors/advisors.
Cell Culture
Taught by instructors/advisors and conducted completely and independently by students themselves.
Virus selection
Virus clones which are selective for hepatocytes have been selected under close supervision of instructors in a safety level 2 laboratory. The picking of the evolved clone itself has been done by a student.
Mouse study
The infection of a mouse to test a potential virus clone on its selectivity for hepatocytes has been done by an instructor for legal reasons in the presence of a student who had had already experience with mice and therefore could have done it herself.
Human Practice
The philosophical reflection, the psychological survey, and the dance performance have been done solely by students.
Documentation
The complete documentation has been done by students except the introduction, conclusion and attribution, which have been written together with an advisor. The complete documentation has been proofread and criticized by advisors.
Logo, wiki, poster, and presentation design
The team logo, the poster and the presentation have been designed by students. Advice has been given by Lange+Pflanz, a marketing agency and sponsor of our team. The layout of the wiki has been done solely by students.
Funding
A research proposal to apply for funding has been written by students after discussions involving the complete team.

iGEM Eurasian MeetUp
From July 24, 2018 to July 26, 2018, the 2018 SZU-China team went to Shenzhen Yantian High School. During the three-day conference, we got feedback from other teams, including our need to pay attention to safety issues and experiments. Ethical issues. We learned a lot from the projects of other teams and the talks organized by the organizers, including how to make a good poster, do a good presentation, and do a good job in the team. More importantly, we make many new friends in this exchange, and we all hope that we can meet again in Boston for three days."

Safety
Please visit the main Safety page to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.
On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can go beyond the questions on the safety forms, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an ""induced lethality"" or ""kill-switch"" device
Safe Lab Work
What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!
Safe Shipment
Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?"
Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#calendar_-_-_TEXT.html," allows us to quickly deploy across multiple platforms should we wish to do so. With the project set up, we have started to create assets such as textures and fonts to be loaded in and used within the game.
HBsu BioBrick Cloning Strategy
We plan to clone it into pSB1C3 then PCR the insert before integrating it into the amyE integration plasmid (pSBBs1C). We discovered that the Kanamycin resistance is an E.coli version and wouldn't work in the B. subtilis. Different antibiotic markers that would work in B.subtilis are trying to be found.

GUS Cloning Strategy
We continued work on the cloning strategies as well as starting modelling the gus reporter system using BioNetGen. We produced a preliminary model of the gus reporter system. However, this model needs to be modified by adding parameters. We have also looked through some papers to find parameters required for the model.
Figure 1: The framework of the GUS model. The red line indicates the blue product in the GUS reporter system. The blue line represents substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl glucuronide (X-Gluc). The green line represents the beta B-glucuronidase.
BioGame
The Asset class has been created and all currently designed assets loaded into the game. A very simple (and temporary) cartoon bacteria has been loaded in and displayed on the screen along with the team logo. The pre-loading screen itself has not yet been developed but all constructs to create it are now in place. The percentage of loading done is simply outputted to the Java console for debugging purposes..
HBsu BioBrick Cloning Strategy
Designed Primers to be used in the Golden Braid assembly, and checked the melting temperature and self-annealing to make sure they work perfectly. Uses RFP (BBa_E1010) and GFP (BBa_E0040) to conjugate it to the HBsu protein in order to observe the recombination.

Introduction
We facilitated a Building with Biology event at the Children’s Museum of Houston. Through hands-on activities like extracting DNA from wheat germ and helping kids to design their own superorganisms, we had the opportunity to introduce young children to the exciting field of synthetic biology and to clear up a few of their parents’ misconceptions.
Background
The Building with Biology project  is dedicated to spreading STEM learning and discussion about the technological and societal implications of synthetic biology through public and scientist dialogue. Successful applicants receive a physical kit with all of the supplies necessary to host an event with six hands-on activities.
Bio Bistro: Decide what current and future synthetic biology-based food products you would, would not, or might eat.
Kit of Parts: Solve challenges by building a model cell with standardized genetic parts (like BioBricks).
See DNA: Extract visible DNA from wheat germ and create necklaces to display your own sample of wheat germ DNA.
Super Organisms: Design a superhero to rescue a person falling from a tall building and then use that same creative engineering process to design a single-celled organism to clean up an oil spill.
Tech Tokens: Consider the potential advantages and disadvantages of various areas of synthetic biology research, before investing in them with ""tech tokens.""
VirEx Delivery: Explore the potential for engineered viruses to deliver beneficial, targeted genetic information to sites throughout the body.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"

Extraction of B. Subtilis Genomic DNA
Protocols   DNA extraction
In the meantime, Helina (in our team), was able to obtain B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa strains for us to test whether we could retrieve azo dye degrading enzymes from their genomes, specifically, the azo-reductase gene (AzoR). This would be the first step for our first azoreductase BioBrick.
We extracted the genomic DNA from B. subtilis strain using a Promega Wizard Genomic DNA extraction kit so that we could subsequently amplify the azoreducatase gene (AzoR1) and create our first azoreductase BioBrick. After completing the genomic DNA extracton we ran a gel to show that we had successfully extracted the B. subtil"

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," blebbing ( Link toward Details). Indeed physically it appears that Brownian motion model on a non-plane surface doesn’t predict a non uniform concentration of particles. They will aggregate themselves in the highly concave areas of membranes. This prediction is in agreement with some observation about Tol/Pal Reference and some experiments were done which confirm a phenomena in Reference which is the accumulation of proteins in the septa region during E.coli division but not explained efficiently by simple biology mechanism.
Brownian Diffusion predict disparition of the borders of vesicles in creation phases.
The direct area caught inside the border of the blebbing is highly and negatively curved , so we can predict a migration of Tol-Pal complexes and Pal proteins toward this area : the Tol/Pal complexes are zippering back the membrane to the peptidoglycan but not efficiently enough to ensure the whole contrition of the blebbing: two different areas are separated.

Interdisciplinary work
In order to elaborate our scientific product into different fields we have worked with external members who has provided us with a unique perspective of our project and made interdisciplinary work possible.
Lea Gregers studies Philosophy and has written a discussion about the concerns regarding use of genetically modified organisms and the problems that might be associated with an open source system. Read more.
Charlotte Varslev-Pedersen and Caroline Sofie Have from Design & Innovation and Creative Communication respectively, have worked on a product based perspective of our project. They have come up with some interesting ideas for the use of our bioluminescent bacteria as a light source. Read more.
Thomas Holst-Hansen studies Physics and has made mathematical models of the light production that would be expected from our bacteria. Read more.
Collaboration with other iGEM teams:
During our project we have collaborated with the iGEM Valencia 2012 and iGEM UC Chile 2012. This has mainly been Skype meetings to discuss our problems, progress and ideas.  We have also participated in the “Scandinavian meet-up” where several Scandinavian teams got together for a weekend in Uppsala to exchange experiences.
Outreach:
In order to confront prejudges about work in the scientific world we have made a movie to put modern science in a more realistic light. This will be featured at our wiki page and help future students to see science as a more social and accessible field of study.  To inform students and other in the field about the iGEM competition, we have written an article for a magazine at the Faculty of Science and furthermore we have been interviewed at the Faculty of Life Sciences. As such we have made the iGEM competition more known at the University of Copenhagen and hope to gather a new iGEM Copenhagen team 2013.
iGEM Scandinavia’s song
As previously mentioned we went for a Scandinavian meet-up in Uppsala and together we decided to write a song using some of our thoughts concerning iGEM. Enjoy!

Prof. Pun To, Douglas YUNG
Dr. Douglas Yung is an Assistant Professor in the CUHK Biomedical Engineering Program. He has been intrigued by biosensing and electronic interfacing of living cells since graduate school. On the biosensing side, his research group is developing technologies for rapid viability assessment of superbugs using a combination of electrochemical, optical techniques and MEMS devices. His team is also developing methods to interface living microbes with electronics at a micro- and nano-scale. As for this year’s iGEM, he primarily provides support on the device and engineering side.
Prof. Kong Siu-Kai
Prof. KONG's laboratory studies the process of apoptosis. In particular, he is interested in elucidating how mitochondria regulate the apoptosis in 'normal' and drug-resistant cancer cells. He wonders how the resistance of mitochondria to MMP can explain the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis induction, and he hopes to develop strategies for overcoming chemotherapy resistance by targeting tumor mitochondria. He believes that pharmacological interventions on mitochondria are good strategies to promote cell death in tumor cells. This research topic on apoptosis is therefore relevant to disease treatment with socioeconomic impacts.

The structure was subsequently energy minimized using GROMACS 5.0.3 in TIP3P water and after equilibration simulated over 50 ns resulting in 5001 conformations. We applied similar conditions to the wildtype protein.
The RMSD (root mean square deviation) over all frames in regard to the initial conformation was computed for both structures (figure 10).
Figure 10: RMSD of subtilisin E wildtype (red) and the mutation variant (blue) in regard to the initial conformation.
The conformation with the smallest RMSD towards the consensus structure was chosen to represent the overall conformation (figure 11).
Figure 11: Overlay of subtilisin E wildtype (red) and mutant variant (yellow). The mutated amino acid sidechain is displayed as blocks in PyMOL.
It is evident that there is no relevant difference between the wildtype structure and the mutant variant. Therefore we can conclude that the incorporation of ONBY at tyrosine 77 is not sufficient to alter the structure. This can be traced to the fact that ONBY is introduced at a surface position.
The counterpart of this collaboration can be seen on iGEM TU Darmstadt's wiki .

- KK Today we set out some long-term priorities for what we should do from here on out. Our priorities: 1. Determine is the QS circuit working? We aren’t getting RFP right now … what’s wrong? a. We need to determine what primers were used to amplify the HapR and Qrr4 out of cholera b. What is the difference between pIG78 A and pIG78 B? There are two plasmids that are the same? We hope to KNOW the answers to these questions by Thursday 2. Clone CI behind Qrr4 promoter; determine where in plasmid and order primers order primers 3. Clone CRO behind HapR promoter DONE by Mid-May 4. Modify tails of phage (after C1 and CRO steps complete) DONE by summer 5. If possible, use selectable marker on phage to purify many E. Coli that have prophage incorporated into the genome. So these are the steps we set out, we need to discuss with Dr. Grose where we should be the C1 and CRO genes, because the plasmid is already very full. Personally, I need to understand the plasmid we’re using, the Lambda repression circuit, and the Lambda tail proteins better.

iGEM as Educational Model for Responsible Innovation
The organisational tension that exists between self-governance and governmental oversight stems, according to Cohen (1997), partly from a prevailing linear understanding of the scientific attitude or ethic. Reducing uncertainty is said to become achievable by increasing knowledge so that scientists can subsequently capitalise on the public esteem they gain from having solved an uncertain issue, and hence continue to build on this strategy. From the eco-modernist point of view, this corresponds with the way in which industrial performance can remain competitive and economic growth can be accomplished (Cohen 1997). Recently, this rationale has been approached critically, as Cohen argues:
“It now appears that the correspondence between a society’s scientific attitude and its scientific knowledge may conform to an inverted U-shape. In other words, societal support for science increases with scientific knowledge only to a certain point, after which further understanding contributes to a decline in the favourability of public appreciation for science” (Cohen 1997: 114).
One of the reasons that the author gives is that the lay public has had the opportunity to become familiar with alternative knowledge systems which gained considerable legitimacy themselves. This occurred as increasing general welfare in the developed world brought new ways of knowledge transfer that became available to a wider and wealthier public (Cohen 1997). In the process of regaining trust among the public, forms  of ‘public engagement’ and ‘upstream engagement' are being set up by scientists as a response in order to contribute to the variety in science education (Edwards and Kelle 2012). Hence, the motivation behind the iGEM competition also lies in the fostering of an educational method that seeks to enhance professionalization in order to adapt it to a system where external accountability can be rendered governable. When the team discussed iGEM as an innovative educational setting, they manifestly agreed that this opportunity has allowed them to learn more effectively and with greater relevance. This was the only topic that sparked the most enthusiasm and support for the iGEM organisation. They also wanted to highlight how this exemplified the ineffectiveness of traditional learning methods at university.
[Tanel] “Yeah, we try to make noise in the competition because, you know, it is not primarily based on the lab work. It’s more than just that. So the human practice, public engagement and everything else, we try to make it a grand project”.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html,") what clinicians think of them. Many seems to criticize them because RDT can’t quantify infections which might be important in determining the most effective type of treatment. The cultural mind set also plays a role. Microscopy slides come back positive, so malaria is diagnosed. A lot of RDTs come back negative and clinicians do not trust it. However, RDTs were only created to target malaria, so a multidiagnostic test might solve the problem in terms of mistrust because the big question asked when malaria tests come back negative is “If it is not malaria, then what is it?” Dr. Allen felt that an important aspect of success of the project would be to analyze the limitations that are presented in the developing world setting.  We need to consider mind for our design include storage space (no freezers), shelf life, price (ideally the device needs to be under $1; microscopy only costs about 34), diagnosis time. Overnight tests were classified as an option that is not ideal as many patients have to work several hours to arrive at the hospital, and to commute again the next day would be discouraging for use of such testing.  Dr. Allen recommended that we check the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and other organizations that are working on similar ideas for hopes of potential collaboration.  We also discussed the potential for quantification of infection, and will look into this option however the PCR of DNA might affect this aspect.
We have also introduced weekly policy and practice meetings to further discuss this subject with the Policy and Practices team.  This week we are also planning on contacting Kirsten Jacobsen of Public Health Canada that was interested in this years iGEM team doing a video conference with a committee dedicated to looking at emerging technologies through Public Health Agency of Canada.  This relationship could be a valuable resource to learning and impacting policy through our project and our policy and practices team.  Additionally we are looking into contacting additional perspectives from experts in the field of malaria misdiagnosis to gather a broad view of perspectives from various individuals, occupations and respective regions of work.  The team also broke up the weekly tasks into contacting additional experts and research on diseases in different regions as well as policy in Canada and developing countries.

The early experiments on CFPS relayed on RNase- and protease-deficient strains (Zubay, 1973 ; Pratt, 1984 ). Since then, many different strains were tested and genetically improved to support the system.
Especially, strains that have less RNase- and protease activity, produce rare tRNAs, and carry mutations that counteract the depletion of amino acids during reaction build the best basis for an efficient in vitro protein synthesis. You can find detailed overviews in following publications:
Jewett and Swartz, 2004 ; Calhoun and Swartz, 2006 ; Spirin and Swartz, 2008 ; Airen, 2011 ; Hong et al., 2015
pH value
For efficient protein synthesis, a pH value above 6.5 is indispensable ( Kim et al., 2008 ; Jewett and Swartz, 2004 ). This is the main reason for the use of pH-adjusted washing buffers and phosphate buffer in the media, when E. coli extracts are prepared in-house. The optimal pH  for the reaction itself varies depending on the protein to be produced. To prevent precipitation of the protein, the pH should generally be between 6.5 and 8.5 ( Tokmakov et al., 2014 ).
Different approaches for stabilizing the pH value have been proposed, ranging from the use of buffers  ( Airen, 2011 ) to the use of engineered enzymes ( Kim et al., 2015 ).
Energy
Life depends upon ATP as it is the main energy source in cellular organisms. To provide ATP throughout the CFPS-reaction, ATP has to be permanently regenerated. The translation machinery also needs two GTP for every amino acid that is incorporated into the growing peptide chain ( Mavelli et al., 2015 ). Therefore, molecules with high energy content are needed that fuel phosphorylation of ADP (for example via creatin phosphate, abbreviated CP) or that fuel glycolysis (for"

Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

BioBrick Tutorial
For the sixth time we had the honor of hosting the annual DTU Biobrick Tutorial. As a means of meeting and discussing ideas with other Nordic teams, and creating possible collaborations, we were joined by the teams from the University of Copenhagen, Lund, Uppsala, Linköbing, Oslo, Chalmers and Stockholm for a weekend full of learning and fun.
All the teams were excited to participate and when the time came, we were a total of  89 iGEM participants ready to spend the weekend at our university.
David, Lina, and Tenna, with help from the rest of the team, worked full hours the weeks up to the happening to make sure everything would work smoothly. Hotels had to be booked, food had to be planned and ordered, materials and protocols for experiments had to be prepared and a general schedule full of talks and activities had to be planned. Thankfully, we had great help from the iGEM DTU team from 2017, who helped with the experimental part of the weekend.
The Serious Part
We had the great honor of having many accomplished people come and educate us in not only iGEM and the creation of Biobricks, but also in general team- and project work; alumni from earlier DTU Biobuilders teams held a panel session regarding life after iGEM and what skills gained from the competition they continue to use.

Ways of self-killing:
1) toxic protein
2) sgRNA targeting genome of strains with no NHEJ repair system
3) sgRNA targeting essential genes
PART DESIGN
At the first stage, we need to verify the function of two toxin proteins and make sure the bacteria can be killed after the expression of toxin proteins. To control the expression of killer gene, instead of J23119, arabinose inducible regulatory promoter/repressor unit is employed in our circuit.
Fig.8 Circuits for toxin gene function testing through induction by arabinose.
After measuring the growth curve, we observed the obvious difference between the testing group and control group. [see results page for killer]
To facilitate the measurement of plasmid threshold, we combined the inhibitor circuit with the killer circuit and replace the RFP for killer gene. [see design for threshold]
Fig.9 Circuits for testing for killing capacity under different concentration of arabinose, which can be regard as under different plasmid concentrations.
For the toxic protein, MazF and HokD were chosen as candidates. [see more about the killing mechanisms]
Upgraded P-SLACKiller
Why do we need to optimize our project?
It's possible to produce generation of plasmid-free cells, even if all plasmids were losen. Thus, we decided to integrate the killer device into genome to solve this problem. [see reombination]
To control the plasmid number above different thresholds, we need to adjust the initial threshold through replacement of RBS as well as in-promoter mutation. [see mutation]
Recombination
Recombineering ( recombination-mediated genetic engineering) is an efficient molecular                             engineering technique used for gene replacement, deletion and insertion.
Ways: a linear plus circular reaction
A：Employment of traditional λ-Red recombination
PART DESIGN
The basic circuit of upgraded P-SLACKiller is shown in Fig.10.
Fig.10 The basic circuit of upgraded P-SLACKiller.
Compared with the original one, two homologous arms (50bp) are added. With the help of lambda Red recombination system, the killer part can be integrated into genome, preventing the whole system from being invalid. The final gene circuit is shown in Fig.11.

Genome modification of E. coli using recombineering and CRISPR/Cas9
Introduction
This protocol is adapted from Jiang et al., 2015. It assumes a version of pTargetTet targeting the correct locus of the E. coli genome has already been created, as well as a donor DNA that include overlap regions and the gene to be inserted. For information on the design and creation of the sgRNA-producing pTarget, see Selection of the sgRNA and modification of pTarget.
Materials
E. coli strain containing the pCas plasmid.
pTargetTet targeting the locus to be modified.
Donor DNA: gene of interest flanked by two 500-bp overlaps, or an ssDNA for deletion.
LB, Kanamycin, Tetracyclin.
Arabinose 10%.
Chilled sterile ddH2O.
Sterile PEP tube.
IPTG 0,1 M.
Procedure
pCas has a thermo-sensitive origin of replication. All steps until pCas curing should be incubated at 30°C.
Day 1
Start a 5 ml pre-culture of TOP10 pCas in LB-Kanamycin. Incubate it overnight at 30°C without shaking.
Day 2
Competent cells
Start a culture for transformation by inoculating 40 ml of LB-Kan with 400 µl of pre-culture. Incubate in a 250"
LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Project#Bakillus_-_-_TEXT.html," supernatant, and presumably, the higher the amount of subtilin in there, the bigger the zones of inhibition. For the largest volume (128 µl), a two-sided T-test could determine the p-value below 0.1 (p=0,007762603) and by this prove the functionality of this BioBrick. This is a major step for this project, as the immunity is the base for any strain which produces antimicrobial peptides. Now further steps can be taken and the remaining BioBricks can be evaluated.

Lysostaphin
A first sequencing, prior to the PCR-Amplification revealed an error in the DNA-sequence provided by the Registry. The actual sequence of the lysostaphin of the BioBrick BBa_K802000 is codon-optimized for B. subtilis. The correct sequence was posted as a user review in the experience section of the Registry. After cloning the lysostaphin into pBS1C with the promoter Pxyl, the construct was verified by sequencing and transformed into B. subtilis.
A culture in DSM was incubated at 37°C and 220 rpm and 5µl of this culture where spotted on a sterile filter paper and sent to the iGEM-team Groningen.
Dispersin
The sample of the BioBrick K802001, which was originally sent by the Registry contained a wrong gene. Fortunately, the sample sent by the iGEM-Team Insa_Lyon, was the matching plasmid to the given sequence. Thank you very much for providing us with this part! The mutated gene was cloned into the pCRII-topo-vector and transformed into E. coli DH5α.
Suicide Switch
Thanks to the numerous killing strategies listed above, BaKillus has specifically dispatched the targeted pathogens, thus its job is almost done. However, to ensure the temporary mode of action and to avoid uncontrollable spread, we implemented the so called “suicide switch“ leading to time-delayed cell death of BaKillus.
During stationary phase of a Bacillus subtilis culture it has been observed that some cells start producing a toxin which causes cell lysis of sister cells whereas the toxin-producer cells stay unaffected. [1 ] This social and heterogenous behavior is called cannibalism and seems to be an even more promising basis for constructing the BaKillus “suicide switch“ since it has been shown that the toxin also kills a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA-strains."
