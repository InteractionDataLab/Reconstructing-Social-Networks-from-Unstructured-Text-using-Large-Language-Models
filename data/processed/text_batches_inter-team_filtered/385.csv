Collaborations
A great and important part of the iGEM competition is the so-called iGEM spirit. For this, we are encouraged to work together with other iGEM teams worldwide to build up an international network of well educated and highly motivated young scientists. It was really great to get in contact with all the iGEMers we met this year. Every one of you helped us a lot with our project and some things wouldn't even be possible without the support of other teams. Some of the initial work-based relationships even grew to friendships that we don't want to miss anymore.
Even if there is no separate text about your team, be safe that it was a pleasure for us to share this iGEM year with you.
Collaboration with iGEM Stockholm
In September, five of our team members visited iGEM Stockholm in efforts to motivate and inspire new students to apply for the iGEM team Stockholm next year during their recruitment event. Thereafter, iGEM Stockholm and our team presented our projects, and exchanged constructive feedback to further enhance. To this event we also invited a class from Johanna-Geissmar-Gymnasium (high school) from Mannheim, Germany. The most essential advice iGEM Stockholm suggested was moving the linked fluorophores in closer proximity to the proteases in order for the detection system to work correctly. We also asked iGEM Stockholm for their insight on how to restructure our team and recruitment process to further increase the quality of our program.

Collaboration with iGEM Dresden
iGEM goes green is a project with the goal to not just make lab work more green, but also to motivate iGEM participants to think more sustainable in their daily life.
When we heard about the initiative created by TU Dresden, we were immediately interested in the concept and wanted to take part in it. So, with their iGEM goes green guide in mind, we started to make subtle changes in our lab. From implementing reusable inoculating loops to acquiring an electricity meter for measuring our power consumption, we learned that even small things can make a difference. Even when we were not actively searching for these changes, the thought of iGEM goes"

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog2_-_-_TEXT.html," of synthetic biology, that means that the genetic code and biological parts that went into making a new system must be released to the synthetic biology community.
Free redistribution
Meaning, you cannot restrict any person or party from selling or giving away the software as a component of a larger aggregate software distribution.
In the context of synthetic biology, this means that if you make a new system or genetic circuit, you cannot prohibit other researchers from using this system in their projects.
The ability to derive works without penalty
Meaning, a person or party must be allowed to modify and derive new software from the original software
In the context of synthetic biology, this would mean that if you develop a genetic circuit, other researchers would be able to modify and rederive new circuits or applications from your work.
There are other, less significant criteria that go into making something open source and could drag this blog post out forever (and we’re trying to get to the cat videos when we’re done), but the big take away point is that, for an invention to be open source, the components that went into making the invention should be released to the public, be modifiable by the public, and the invention itself must be free for other people to incorporate into their own projects. Again, open source need not refer to just software, although today the most prominent open source movement is in the realm of software. This same idea applies to open source hardware, dubbed Open Hardware, and synthetic biology is also beginning to adopt this idea in the form of a synthetic biology commons. In a synthetic biology commons, patented genes and genetic parts (a.k.a. “source code”) are licensed such that they can be used exclusively in the public domain, and are usable and modifiable by the greater scientific community.
One great example of a synthetic biology commons can be found in the BioBrick Foundation, which aims to create a standardized registry of well documented biological parts. This is the equivalent of having a registry of software tools and their source code, free for other developers to use. In the software world developers aimed to have a open source commons where all new code is shared, modified and redistributed; in the biology world some researchers are aiming to have a commons where all new genetic parts or systems are shared, and these creations can be used by other researchers worldwide to facilitate new research and innovation.  However, we still have a long way to go.

The McpS initiate a motor control response and a feedback circuit that updates the methylation record to achieve sensory adaptation and cessation of the motor response. A fifth MCP-like protein, Aer, mediates methylation-independent aeroTCAtic responses by monitoring redox changes in the electron transport chain. The five MCP-family receptors in E. coli utilize a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to control flagellar rotation and sensory adaptation (Fig. 2).  CheW and CheA generate receptor signals; CheY and CheZ modulate rotation of the flagellar motor and thus change cell behavior and movement; CheR and CheB regulate MCP methylation state to make feedback to CheW and CheA.
Fig. 2 Signaling components and circuit logic. E.coli receptors employ a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals; CheY transmits those signals to the flagellar motors, CheZ controls their lifetime; CheR (methyltransferase) and CheB (methylesterase) regulate MCP methylation state.

But the original chemoreceptors of E.coli do not respond to the root exudates, while the McpS of the Pseudomonas putida , McfQ and McfR do (Parales, et al.) . McfQ responds to citrate and fumarate, and McfR detects succinate, malate and fumarate. To compare with the work what 2011_Imperial_College_London had done, we chose McfR which also responds to malate. The mechanisms of prokaryote chemoreceptors are similar, so we designed a plasmid to express chemoreceptor. McfR in the E.coli makes the bacteria have the ability of chemotaxis towards TCA intermediates. As our experimental condition is limited, we just did experiments on chemotaxis towards succinate and malate. What"

Next, we added dCas9 system via an overnight ligation. Using the restriction sites ClaI and XhoI, we can digest the dCas9 PCR product. The Plasmid 1 backbone was digested with ClaI and SalI-HF restriction enzymes. A SalI site is already present in the dCas9 system, but XhoI and SalI sites are compatible. This plasmid was termed ""Plasmid 1.1"" for ease of understanding, shown in the figure below.
The final step was to insert the Lambda Red Recombinase system using ClaI and XbaI restriction digest sites. This plasmid was termed ""Plasmid 1.2"" shown below.
Future Plans
We will continue trying to insert the Plasmid 1.2 into the P. putida genome using homologous recombination. Before Ashlee graduates, she hopes to construct the second plasmid, containing the HMF pathway and the RFP reporter gene, and insert that into the genome as well. She will use a CRISPR RNA targetting RFP to validate that the dCas9 system can knock out genes. Emily will continue this project after Ashlee graduates in December. She hopes to identify the essential genes of the pathway and engineer it to function in E. coli!
More Detailed Information
Why is this important?
If we can determine the genes essential to the function of the pathway responsible for catabolizing furfural and HMF toxins, we can in principle engineer any bacterium to have these genes. Engineering E. coli to have the HMF pathway will allow this well-studied, easily manipulated and fast-growing bacterium to live in the presence of toxins released during biomass pretreatment, and even use furfural and HMF toxins as fuel!
Therefore, industry and academic researchers can subject biomass to more intense pretreatment processes – which release more toxins. Engineered bacteria will be able to live in the presence of these toxins and more sugars will be available for hydrolysis and fermentation, increasing biofuel yields from the same initial amount of biomass.
Background
Greenhouse gas emissions and dwindling fossil fuel reserves have pushed developed countries like the United States to explore renewable fuel sources. “Biofuels” are an attractive sustainable energy technology because they can be produced from plant biomass, which includes wood, grasses, and agricultural waste. Bioethanol and biodiesel can be blended or used as automobile fuel, among other uses. One way to produce biofuels from"

We started to simulate diffusion experiments on a Comsol model. We consider cells will lay on agar for the moment.
We will have a chip with these four different channels 1 to 4 mm long. The model still has to be refined because at the moment it doesn't take into account internal/external concentrations of AHL.
Our first mold didn't enable us to peal the PDMS correctly. We have to make it less deep.

But, there’s no correspondence between sugar intake and changes on weight found on children. That may be owing to the children’s ignorance on the advice for diet we gave. Nonetheless, if we just focus on their consumption of sugary beverages, there’s some relation be found. Their habit of having sugary beverages significantly influences their weight, leading to obesity. The research discovered that the obesity rate of children who took in the most sugary beverage exceeded those took in the fewest by 50%.
   
However, in Taiwan, the prevailing of handmade drinks has made it easy for us to find shops selling them everywhere. It is relatively hard for people to resist the temptation of sugar. If we are to solve the problem of obesity, the most direct approach is to avoid our intestine from absorbing sugar. With such aspiration, 2017 Mingdao IGEM team has designed a kind of bacteria which boost a higher efficiency of sugar absorbing. It can survive in the intestine and absorb excessive sugar before the villus have done it. This is how we take biological means to tackle the detriments sugar may cause. The bacteria is designed with a suicide system, which it will be brought to death if the concentration of sugar is lower than a standard amount we regulate. It will be discharged from our body with excretes. 
   If the product is successfully commercialized, do you agree with the way we solve the problem? Or is there an alternative? And, in your opinion, what impact may be brought to the world?
The bellows are viewpoints from the students in The Mingdao Voice. 
Jenny Yeh :
I don't approve of the way to solve the problem of sugar. I think it cures the symptoms, not the disease. Although it seems that this way can fast deal with the threat which sugar poses to health, the problem of high sugar foods flooding is still unsolved.Perhaps this can receive the result in a short time ,but this can't be a longterm solution. Those who use this product may think it's okay to increase the intake of sugar, so they won't control their own desire or resist the temptation of sugar. Instead, the uncontrolled intake of sugar attributes to the serious sugar flooding. As for the influence on health condition, I think users may reduce the consumption of nutrition and ignore the balanced diet because of the more intake of sugar foods. What's more, the harmful substances in high sugar foods are not only sugar but also much chemical addition or a large amount of oil. As a result, the product can merely solve the"

Loreta Cimbalistienė – clinical supervisor (clinical geneticist) in the Department Of Genetic Counseling, Center for Medical Genetics. We spoke about PKU treatment in Lithuania and the research of new treatment options such as injectable pegylated phenylalanine ammonia-lyase therapy (PEG-PAL). We were given information that strict low phenylalanine diet remains the most important factor in ameliorating clinical symptoms of PKU. Moreover, due to various reasons, every other patient in Lithuania does not follow the diet, meaning that new treatment options would be very beneficial.

Overview
Polyketide is a large family of structurally diverse compounds[1]. It exhibits a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities, particularly the antimicrobials. As far as we know, many antibiotics are derived from polyketide such as methymycin, erythromycin, amphotericin and so on. Nowadays, reaserchers about polyketide synthesis are focusing on the whole gene cluster of original polyketide or combinatorial biology[2]. However, we can’t use the each domain flexibly by combinatorial biological methods. The study of the whole gene cluster limits the exploring of the modularity of polyketide synthase. All these researches didn’t make good use of the modularity of polyketide synthase.
Programmed Polykitide Synthesis (PPS)
This summer, our team developed a novel approach for creating customized polyketides that overcomes the above mentioned limitations by engineering synthetic Polyketide Synthetases (PKSs). PKS is “called” the assemble line of polyketide. PKSs are very complicated that contain several kinds of domains in one module. Each module catalyst is to extend, modify or terminate the polyketides chain. By standardzing the domains of different functions, we can design and synthesize structurally various polyketide what we need just like programming.
Triketide Lactone Synthesis (TKLS)
First of all, we attempted to synthesize triketide lactone by engineering Polyketide Synthetase—DEBS1+TE. Based on fact that single domain have independent function[3], we assembled domains in some order to create new module of PKSs that can"

Survey"
Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," to improve our mathematical modelling, we completed a phage assay. We used a 96 well plate and filled various wells with a specific amounts of bacteria. Then introducing various concentrations of phage to specific wells, and using a plate reader we measured the absorbance during 23 hours.
Figure 6 - Table showing the number of bacteria cells in each well. Each well had a certain number of phage added so that the concentration of phage was 2.5x10^-9 PFU. The wells labeled LB are the blanks for background, and the wells labelled T4 are only T4 phage and contain no bacteria in order to observe the absorbance of only the phage over time.
Figure 7 - Graph demonstrating the bacterial growth over time when the same number of phage was introduced to varying concentrations of bacteria. In the graph we can see that the highest concentration of bacteria grew relatively slowly in comparison to the other concentrations, and this is likely because the phage had an abundance of bacteria to infect and more bacteria were dying.
Figure 8 - Graph showing the bacterial growth curve when varying concentrations of phage were introduced.The bacteria concentrations that were introduced to the most phage grew slightly slower than the other samples. This shows that the phage may be successfully infecting the bacteria.
The results demonstrate the growth curve of the bacteria, and while the bacteria are still growing, they grow at a slower rate than they would be without the phage present. In addition, the maximum amount of bacteria decreases when phage are present. The starting OD is higher in the graph than in the legend, and this is due to the bacteria reproducing during the time period between when the original dilutions were measured and when the sample was measured after the phage were added. Our phage assay demonstrates that it is likely the phage are infecting the bacteria, as a higher concentration of phage resulted in decreased bacterial growth. Furthermore, increased numbers in bacteria result in decreased growth, and it can be interpreted that this is as a result of the phage having an abundance of bacteria to infect. This increases the rate at which the bacteria are infected and results in a less extreme growth curve."

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the risk of cancer in the future [12] .
As a result, there is still a need for away to accurately screen high risk population groups  for NSCLC and minimize unnecessary procedures. We believe that our system could be that solution.
Late presentation of symptoms
Our system can be used in screening by setting cut-offs appropriately. Abnormal miRNA levels can show cancers in their early stages [13] . Our test could rule out cancer in an individual, and refer those with positive results for further testing.
Equivocal test results
The results are easy to interpret as miRNA levels can be several times higher or lower in patients with cancer - through adjusting the cut off values, and using multiple miRNAs in tandem, cancer can be ruled out in many patients. This has the potential to be more efficient than radiologists interpreting a CT scan.
Furthermore, our test is highly specific but would have lower sensitivity (see gold HP) whereas CT scans are highly sensitive but have lower specificity. By using the results of both in combination, rates of false positives could be massively reduced.
Ease of use
Blood sample can be taken by someone with minimal training without a highly trained radiologist required. The processing of the miRNA would be easiest and most efficient in a specialist lab. However, there are kits for miRNA extraction [14] that could be used in rural areas, and combined with our cheap £4 fluorometer , it could allow screening for cancer in developing countries.
Cost
Our system is cheap, less than £17/test ($23). Most doctors said that liquid biopsies could be more cost-effective. See our cost analysis on our modeling page for an exact breakdown.
Invasiveness
Our system for NSCLC simply involves taking a blood sample, making it minimally-invasive. However, miRNAs found in other body fluids (e.g. urine, saliva) could allow for completely non-invasive diagnosis. For example using miRNAs in urine to diagnose prostate cancer (see below )
Timeframe
Results from our system are available within hours. The processing of blood to purify miRNA would take ~2 hours according to expert Dr Dan Pregibon currently. However, there is scope for this to be automated. After adding the purified miRNA to our sensor, and quantifying fluorescence, different miRNA levels could be distinguished within hours (peak fluorescence occurs within 10 hours). See our results page for more details.
Dr Desai, a consultant radiologist, said that the results of a blood test using our sensor could help to relieve a patient’s anxiety far sooner than is currently possible."

7. Steps 4-6 were repeated until a sufficient amount of data was collected about the protein expression level. This was typically done 3-4 times which results in a total time of 24-36 hours for this experiment.

Growth and Analysis of Auxotroph System in E. coli
The W3 and Y3 strains (tryptophan ad tyrosine auxotrophs) that we obtained from the Lin Lab at the University of Michigan had already been studied in a paper published earlier this year. A Programmable Escherichia coli Consortium via Tunable Symbiosis . They showed some experimental analysis which were the first steps at showing that these strains could be induced at varying levels to get a range of ratios between the two strains.
Based on comments made in the discussion section of the Kerner paper, we believed that it was necessary to determine whether the population of the two strains could be determined based on an equation relating the total OD of the two strains and the YFP reading from one of the strains (Y3). For this reason we created a standard curve of YFP fluorescence versus cell density.
We were able to create our own version of the model presented in the Kerner 2012 paper, using parameters we found in the literature and obtained through our own data collection.
Based on this model, it seems that a wide variety of ratios of the two strains could be obtained.
So, we performed experiments to determine the ratios of the two strains that could be collected in a variety of inducer conditions. However, based on our results from the YFP standard curve (above) we realized that the data would only be accurate in a small range of cell concentrations. The details of our experimental setup can be found on our Project Protocols page: Co-culturing of Auxotroph Strains .
A 3D surface of that graph was obtained and a slice of the graph are shown below:

Marburg,2016,Team:Marburg#Modeling#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," probability of the linear cascade to be destroyed through one of these mutations increases as well.
Longer incubation times lead to higher escape probabilities: This is due to more possible attempts for mutations to destroy the kills switch.
Figure 5. Evolutionary stability of BNU China 2014 kill switch. The escape probabilities for different mutation                 rates \(\eta\) are shown. Longer incubation times and                 mutation rates lead to larger escape probabilities.
(b) Time scaling by mutation rate
Scaling the incubation time with the mutation rate lets the escape probability curves collapse onto one master curve. This can be explained: Hitting a                 certain threshold takes more incubation time when a low mutation rate is applied but it takes less incubation generations when working with a high mutation                 rate. The master curve for the BNU China 2014 kill switch can be found in figure 6.
Figure 6. Evolutionary stability master curve of BNU China 2014 kill switch. The mutation rate scales the incubation                 time axis so that the curves collapse onto a                 master curve for a unified time scale.
Therefore, the mutation rate is arbitrary for quantifying the evolutionary stability of a kill switch design. Computations have been performed for                 \(\eta\in\{0.4081875 \cdot 10^{-3}, 0.816375 \cdot 10^{-3}, 1.63275 \cdot 10^{-3}\}\) but only \(\eta=1.63275 \cdot 10^{-3}\) is shown in the following.                 Other mutation rates are equivalent and the results show the same behavior.
(c) Design guidelines for a kill switch
We are providing design guidelines for a kill switch that is robust against evolutionary stability and show quantitative evidence for our suggestion.                 A kill switch design can be understood as a network with the toxin being a node that is controlled through regulation pathways.
The BNU China 2014 kill switch design uses a single regulation pathway to control its toxin MazF. From intuition it is clear that a kill switch with                 multiple parallel regulation pathways for its toxin – with only one required to control the toxin expression – should be less prone to being destroyed                 by mutations. Let a mutation destroy one of the parallel regulation pathways: There are still other pathways that back up the destroyed one and ensure                 a working kill switch.
We utilize three comparable kill switches that differ in their network topology. Figure 7 shows the escape probabilities for the Parallel (OR), Serial and Parallel (AND) designs. Parallel (OR) – implementing a topology that allows destroyed branches to be backed up –"

Judging Criteria
Through five months hard work, we have witnessed great development of our project, and we have prepared for the criteria for the Giant Jamboree. We successfully submitted 12 newly designed iGEM Registry Standard part while using existing iGEM parts as well. We have also investigated the algal bloom in Taihu Lake. Moreover, we have helped several teams including BIT, BNU, and OUC-China, and we have received assistance from the ZJU-China and OUC-China. We also popularized iGEM to undergraduates in Peking University campus. In conclusion, we have met all the requirements for an iGEM team, so we believe that we deserve Gold Medal.

Why?
Some pesticides are very stable in their chemical structures and take years to  decompose to less toxic forms. In areas where these substances are  poured insecticide concentrations are increasing and although time has  passed since the last pesticide application will present permeating  everything.
In many cases they are also difficult to remove  biologically. When some organisms are being eaten by  other pesticide accumulates in greater proportions in the final stages  of the food chain. In this way a pesticide that is found in very low  concentrations, nothing dangerous, in a forest or a lake, turning out  to be in concentrations tens or hundreds of times higher even in some cases reaching us as  part of the food chain.
Pesticides in humans can cause death and in some cases long-term cancers,  the project plans to develop is a bacterium that is capable of  decomposing these pesticides, mineralizing these, for absorption  without further consequences.
 
 
How?
Different gene parts are being assembled, in order to construct a device          that is able to mineralize and biodegrade recalcitrant pesticides. The          device will be tested against different concentrations of different recalcitrant          pesticides. Specific chassis will be assembled with gene parts from different          metabolic pathways in order to finally reach mineralization of the pesticide.          Different parameters, such as DNA concentration, ATP concetration, fluorescence          of reporters, growth of bacterial device, and reduction of pesticide concentration,          will be used to assess the efficacy of the device. Computational modeling          will be used in order to complement the laboratory work.

HIT-Harbin,2014,Team:HIT-Harbin#Humanpractic_-_-_TEXT.html," and took an active part in it. We have been sharing knowledge, ideas and passion throughout the project. And we would all feel proud and glad to see their project in the iGEM competition next year. Furthermore, there is even one person from NEAU coming with us to the competition this year. So we could wait for the first-hand information about our corporation during the trip later in Hong Kong.
When it comes to the fall semester, representatives of the HIT team went to NEAU to deliver a speech, spreading the idea of iGEM. The lecture lasted for about 2 hours and about 100 students and teachers came to it. It was such a success that many people came to ask for details or later communication afterwards. The university also decided to augment their support of this project.
Communications as a source of inspiration
In summer vacation this year, members of our team went to summer schools and conferences in Peking University and Tongji University in China as well as King Mongkut's Institute of Technology in Thailand. They exchanged their ideas with iGEMers across China and also to people working on synthetic biology around the world. A broader vision would be a precondition for a better work, and we prove it during the project this year.
Postcards as a symbol for friendship
For enjoying our trip to Hong Kong and share our pleasure during iGEM competition, we have designed a series of lovely postcards about iGEM and Escherichia coli for other iGEMers around the world. Access to our E-album for downloading shall be placed later. We also plan to share these lovely gifts during our jamboree this year, and we are waiting for your coming!

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Notebook-content_-_-_TEXT.html," RT for 5 min. 300 μL of Neutralization Buffer A3 was added to stop the reaction. As final step of the alkaline lysis the mixture was centrifuged at 10.000 x g for 10 minutes. Afterwards, the NucleoSpin Column was loaded with 750 μL lysate and then centrifuged for 1 minute (10.000 x g). Subsequently the DNA was washed with 500 μL Wash Buffer and centrifuged again for 1 minute (10.000 x g). The DNA was the precipitated with the Ethanol containing wash buffer and separated by another centrifugation (1 min, 10000 x g) and dried. At last the DNA was eluted with 50 μL elution buffer, which was pre-heated to 60 °C, and incubated for 5 min. The eluted DNA was separated from the matrix by a final centrifugation step (1 min, 5000 x g).
Colony PCR
After successful transformation single colonies were picked and analyzed by colony PCR. Therefore each colony was picked from the original plate with a pipette tip and dipped into the PCR-mix. Afterwards the pipette tip was used to inoculate a second agar plate. PCR fragments were analyzed via gelectrophoresis.

Abstract
iGEM teams regularly engage with the general public in explaining what synthetic biology signifies. A concept rarely explored within iGEM is the reflection on these interactions with the public, which is a shame since there is always room for improvements. Besides that, the interactions between scientists and the public are highly criticized by scientists. To improve our dialogue with the public we invited Paulien Poelarends to organize a workshop. In this workshop, we analysed conversations of previous iGEM teams. The workshop gave us new insights in how to improve our conversations with the public. After the workshop we decided to set-up a Science cafe that enabled us to apply the knowledge obtained and subsequently analyse the conversation between scientists and public again.
Though iGEM is a mostly scientific adventure, there is also an essential aspect in human outreach that is communicating synthetic biology to the public. This could be with school kids, or through video games, art festivals or scientific festivals with college students of all disciplines. New approaches to the outreach are however always welcome, since they may appeal to a larger audience or have a bigger impact, like the outreach project from Evry in 2012. They included a philosopher in their team that catalysed the discussion on ‘am I a chassis?’ Organising a Science cafe is a different approach to communicating with the public and attracting a broader audience. Also few iGEM teams have analysed, or reflected on the role of the scientist in these interactions.

Our first try did not yield correct results, with all three cell samples leading to a positive color change. Our second attempt also did not turn out right. Only the E. coli C gave a positive reading of Beta-gal activity.
Week of 9/7/14 through 9/13/14
Continuing in our goal towards collaboration with other iGEM teams, we came into contact with the Cornell iGEM team. They are working on detecting heavy metal pollution in water. To aid them in their research, we sent them two 50cc water samples from local sources (including the Saint Joseph river and Potato Creek.) Hopefully this helped them out!
As well as our journey towards working with other teams, this week we reverted back to running an electrophoresis gel for our parts. With the help of a new addition to our advisers-Shaunasee Kocen-we found newer materials, and began using different sized DNA ladders to compare. After a few more tries, we were able to get our DNA bands looking great, and we are ready to send our parts into the iGEM registry.

Week of 8/31/14 through 9/6/14
The South Bend Ivy Tech team has decided that we are going for the gold medal at the Giant Jamboree.
This week we began collaborating with other iGEM teams to help them progress in their own research as well as help ourselves reach a new level of accomplishment.
To begin, we exchanged emails with the ETH Zurich team. They asked us to complete surveys as well as send them to friends and family members.
Altogether, we were able to fill out over 30 surveys.
However, we were not able to reach our goal of 50 which was disappointing. Still, the Zurich team graciously rewarded our efforts with a team badge for our wiki in appreciation of completing the surveys.
Week of 8/24/14 through 8/30/14

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration"

Dylan Webster
Dylan visited our world when our universe's membrane collided with an adjacent one. A being composed of energy, but not matter, he chooses to veil himself in a human guise because he found the stares distracting. Because he exists independently of time, he experiences all of time simultaneously, and does not believe in free will. When we asked him whether he could tell us if we'll win, he simply shook his head and replied cryptically ""If you immediately know the candle light is fire, then the meal was cooked long ago"".

In lab he can be found crafting tools for our next challenge, working on the latest iteration of Septimus Prime. He is rumored to live a double life as a Deus Ex Aug. With a sweet pair of shades.

Dr. Lars Angenent - Biological and Environmental Engineering
Lars Angenent is interested in converting organic materials with undefined mixed cultures, defined mixed cultures, or pure cultures of microbes to generate specific products, such as the energy carriers – methane; carboxylates; electric current; n-butanol. Pretreatment of the biomass may be necessary to increase the conversion rates, and therefore Lars Angenent is also interested in physical/chemical (e.g., dilute acid method), thermochemical (e.g., slow pyrolysis), and biological pretreatment steps. In regards to bioprocessing steps, Lars Angenent studies anaerobic digestion, anaerobic fermentation, bioelectrochemical systems, syngas fermentation, and ABE fermentation. Other areas of interest are biosensors and biocomputing devices that are based on bioelectrochemical systems (BESs); and photobioreactors.
For organic waste conversion into bioenergy, Lars Angenent is promoting the carboxylate platform as an important platform in biorefineries because water and nutrients must be recycled while bioenergy yields must be maximized. This platform is based on microbial conversions with undefined mixed cultures that can handle the complexity and variability of organic wastes. Therefore, Lars Angenent is interested in the microbial community dynamics in engineered systems. For this reason, his lab utilizes second-generation sequencing platforms in combination"
McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"es in AMR research gaps. Dr. Gerry Wright’s research on using molecules to help circumvent resistance was specifically mentioned, alongside immunology and alternatives to antibiotics. He lastly reinforced that “[we] need to protect what we have, judiciously, [through stewardship, better education]... Research on strategies to limit antibiotic use will also have impact, and Canada has a lot to offer there too.”
With Dr. Ouellette’s powerful insights, we were able to further understand just how important the evolving field of AMR, and specifically AMR Stewardship, were in future directions of healthcare and research. He himself saw our work as perhaps being the next step that could be taken in diagnostics for such an issue of import. We can thus justify our work even more through both the scientific impact that we will have and through our decisions to now broaden education about AMR and conduct our own forms of stewardship in our local communities.
Dr. Marek Smieja
— Chief of Microbiology for the City of Hamilton; Founding Member, Ontario Working Group for the Rapid Diagnosis of Emerging Infections
On September 13th, the Human Practices team had the opportunity to interview Dr. Marek Smieja, the Chief of Microbiology for the City of Hamilton. Dr. Smieja’s extensive work with C. difficile made him an excellent resource. After interviewing him, the three most prominent lessons we learned from him were that: 1) hospitals are overflowing and the turn-around time for C. difficile tests is approximately 3-5 days; 2) a test that can be provided in a more consumer-friendly manner is much-needed; and 3) healthcare providers prescribing antibiotics should be providing patients with information regarding the risks of AMR and C. difficile.
After discussing the burden of C. difficile on the healthcare system, Dr. Smieja highlighted the importance of finding ways to redirect patients away from hospitals and move diagnostic testing upstream. In order to help alleviate this load, Dr. Smieja suggested designing a more consumer-friendly diagnostic test that can be purchased at a pharmacy, brought home by family members, or conducted by nurses in nursing homes. This would also shorten the time that patients often wait before seeking medical attention, and would hopefully allow the infection to be addressed before it worsens. Lastly, Dr. Smieja voiced concern about healthcare providers not providing patients with adequate information upon the prescription of antibiotics. He stated, “as long as people think that there are no antibiotics have no side effects, we have issues.” This prompted us to ask if a pamphlet that could be distributed"

Although ODEs provide a thorough, precise description of the whole system, they contain too many equations and parameters which would act as a barrier for simulation and further analysis. A simplification of complicated ODEs is necessary. We simplify every single ODE according to certain appropriate assumptions. Finally, we came up with a set of DDE equations.

The Ministry of Korea Centers for Disease Control and prevention proceeds the former test, and Three institutes, including The Ministry of Environment, Rural Development Administration, and National Fisheries Research & Development Institute proceeds the latter test. About 210 days are required for each of the examinations.
After all the processes, one can finally get the Biosafety report for the GMOs. the result is posted on the site (Korea Biosafety Clearing House) so that the data is available to not only the applicant, but also to anyone interested.
4. As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?
It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
• Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
• Identify the level of risk.
• Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.
• Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.
• Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.
• Good hygiene of workers.
• Special conditions and restrictions on air circulation.
• Waste disposal protocols, among others.
In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.
In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
Employers are not required to adopt any specific safety measures just because their workers will be exposed to biological agents. Instead, under OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), they are only required to address any health concerns a specific organism might pose.
The specific guidelines facilities adopt depend on the risk group classification of the agents involved. For the handling of biological materials under Risk Group 1, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and CFIA recommends containment level 1 (CL1) safety guidelines,"

METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS
In order to reach our goal of breaking down fats, which are a major component of buildups in wastewater systems, we created a novel biobrick which would allow our bacteria to produce an esterase under control of an inducible-promoter.
Design
First, we researched an esterase-producing gene that could be expressed in E.coli. We decided to use the EstA gene, which is found in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
For our promoter, we decided to use pLAC, which is lactose-inducible and is naturally found in E.coli.and was available in the registry (Part:BBa_R0011).
We chose the B0034 RBS (Part:BBa_B0034).
Finally, we chose the double terminator B0015, which is the most common terminator and is known to be reliable. (Part:BBa_B0015).
After we had chosen all of our biobrick parts, we had them synthesized together, creating our new biobrick: (Part:BBa_K2694000).
Qualitative Testing
Once we received our DNA, we transformed it into DH5α E.coli. We then did a plasmid switch to clone our part into PSB1C3 for submission to the Registry. To test our new part, we grew up cultures of our bacteria overnight. We then subcultured them for three hours before beginning the testing.
We first did a qualitative test. From the literature, we found that we could use 4-nitrophenyl palmitate and 4-nitrophenyl octanoate to test our esterase activity. Both substrates, when cleaved by an esterase, would go from clear to green, allowing us to monitor the cleavage activity visually. We set-up a time-course assay where we mixed 1mM of each nitrophenyl ester with 1% v/v Triton X-100 in 0.1M pH 7 phosphate buffer. We also tested DH5⍺ cells without any plasmid as well as the ester mixture"

Monday, July 2, 2012
Kevin completed another component for an animation. Hannah ran a gel to assess the length of the plasmids in the colonies she cultured from her CBAR reaction for the Multiple Start Codon Project. To test the stability of some of her plasmids, she transformed them back into DH10B cells. Chris grew up cultures with the desired colonies for sequencing to ensure there was enough sample.
Tuesday, July 3, 2012
Chris mini-prepped cultures to get plasmids for sequencing. Hannah inspected her cultures for their RFP expression, which was present. She used these plates to culture broth in preparation for sequencing. Victoria and Kait looked through some of the teams stocks for primers that could be used for sequencing the construct for the Codon Optimization Project. Sequencing primers were acquired for the Multidirectional Promoters Project.
Wednesday, July 4, 2012
Hannah inoculated cultures for the Multiple Start Codon Project. Victoria checked her plates for signs of expression of mCherry. The broth cultures for mini-prepping and sequencing still required another day of growth. Kevin made some progress with an animation for the team.
Thursday, July 5, 2012
Chris mini-prepped cultures for sequencing, but the yields were still low. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander mini-prepped their cultures in preparation for sequencing. Hannah also ran some mini-preps to prepare samples for sequencing. Kevin worked more on the animations and was shown a better way for making Chemically Competent cells.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#InVitroAssay_-_-_TEXT.html," three more plats were measured following the protocols for expression of Cry3Aa-HIS by E. coli BL21 pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS and the protocol for carboxyfluorescein leakage measurement with Cry3Aa obtained from E. coli. All with mite vesicles.  One more SDS-gel of protein extract was made and the positive control experiment was repeated.
Week 15. (10/10-16/10)
Linea did a PCR on pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS to remove one of the four forbidden restriction sites. Gel electrophoresis showed that it failed, because only primer dimers were formed.

Protein in Brush Border Membrane Vesicles
To visualize the proteins in the BBMVs, SDS-PAGE was performed. The results, shown in Figure A1, show the presence of a variety of proteins. From the results of the SDS-PAGE we were not able to conclude which proteins are membrane proteins.
Figure A1. SDS-PAGE gel. M is the marker lane. In the other lanes the following samples are visualized: Lane 1, protein extract from T. molitor midgut 100x diluted. Lane 2, BBMVs from T. molitor 2x diluted. Lane3, BBMVs from T. molitor 6x diluted. Lane 4, BBMVs from V. destructor 2x diluted. Lane 5, protein extract from V. destructor. Lane 6, protein extract from V. destructor undiluted.
The non-biobrick cry3Aa with araC/pBAD
We intended to create the mutant cry3Aa mutant library as biobricks. To be able to quickly, in other words before this library was finished, test the BBMVs with a Cry toxin, the non-biobrick cry3Aa with araC/pBAD was made. The construct can be seen in Figure A2. This construct has an HIS-tag and a TEV-sequence for better purification. Another advantage of this construct is that it can be made faster, since the four forbidden restriction sites, which naturally occur in our cry3Aa gene, do not have to be removed. When in a later stage of our research, creating the mutant cry3Aa library kept failing, we decided to use the non-biobrick cry3Aa with araC/pBAD.

Moreover, the reference strain nkuAΔ-IS1::PgpdA::TtrpC::argB (without the lacZ gene) was also inoculated on the plates. The PgpdA 0.5kb promoter on both plates appeared to endorse the strongest expression. When comparing the intensities of the two transformants with the DMKP-P6 promoter it is clear that the expression of lacZ is most similar to the expression with PgpdA 1.0kb. The same observation was made for the PalcA-2 promoter, however the expression of the lacZ gene in the PalcA transform ants seam to differ a bit, since the colour intensity for PalcA-1 is the lower than for PalcA-2. Thus, the qualitative analysis indicates that both promoters DMKP-P6 and PalcA are of medium strength. This is in accordance with previous data for the DMKP-P6 promoter (not published), but PalcA is known to be a strong promoter and we would have expected to see the same colour intensity of the PalcA transformants as we did for the nkuAΔ-IS1::PgpdA 0.5kb::lacZ::TtrpC::argB strain. A reason for this could be a sub-optimalt level of the inducers ethanol and threonine in the X-gal plates.
Quantitative analysis
The level of protein production was examined by performing a β-galactosidase assay. First, conidia from a three-point inoculation were grown in minimal media in shake flasks for 48 hours with the appropriate supplements. For each strain, two individual transformants were used, thus providing biological replicates.
Filamentous fungi have a tendency to growth in pellets, when circumstances are not optimal. Growth in pellets was observed for all the suspensions, but for the strains with the PalcA promoter it was more pronounced, most likely due to the different growth medium. Then proteins were extracted from the cultures and used for the β-galactosidase assay and Bradford assay (described below). All measurements were performed in triplicates.
It can be very difficult to measure the optical density of fungi, because they grow in complex structures, are heavy and not single celled like bacteria. Therefore the OD measurement that is usually performed when conducting the β-galact"

Experimental Design
Having determined the protein components that make up the scaffold, the iGEM UNSW team then moved on to planning out how to experimentally characterise the Assemblase system. It was necessary to first determine the experimental tests we would perform before moving on to building the system, since experimental design informed the design of our DNA sequences for each part.
1. Assembly
Firstly, the team wanted to develop a series of practical experiments that would be able to show how well each of the assembled.
This included SDS PAGE, an analytical method for separating charged molecules by their molecular masses, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), a method which allows for the separation of large protein complexes based on size. Using the known sizes of alpha prefoldin and beta prefoldin subunits (15kDa and 13.8kDa, respectively) and the assembled prefoldin hexamer (87kDa)19, performing SDS PAGE and SEC with our individual subunits versus assembled hexamer would allow us to investigate whether our subunits are correctly assembling to form the scaffold hexamer. This could also be done using our alpha/beta prefoldin-Spy/Snoop catcher fusion proteins, to assess whether the fusion of catcher components to the prefoldin subunits would affect their ability to self-assemble.
2. FRET
Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a mechanism that describes the energy transfer between two light sensitive molecules. It is widely used to study the dynamics of proteins, particularly by quantifying the distance between two subsequent proteins. In deciding that we wanted to use FRET, we prepared the fluorescent proteins mVenus and mCerulean to be attached to the Assemblase scaffold in order to determine their distance apart once assembled on our structure. This would enable us to get a good understanding of how enzymes in our scaffold would be spatially organised.
3. Enzyme Assays
On top of being able to characterise the spatial organisation and assembly of our Assemblase scaffold, it was imperative that we also experimentally showed that our system satisfied our main functional requirement (FR1: Increase product titre). We therefore planned to do assays that would measure the reaction kinetics of our IAA proof of concept pathway.
A simple yet effective way to achieve this was by performing a Salkowski assay. This colorimetric assay is standard for experiments involving the IAA pathway and is an easy way to quantify the biosynthesis of the end product, IAA20. It was also a method the  ZJU-China 2012 iGEM team  "

Figure 1: UV-VIS spectre of six E. coli strains: Wild type TOP10, Wild type MG1655, TOP10-pSB1A2-K274210, MG1655-pSB1A2-K274210, TOP10-pSB1A2-K274210/pSB1C3-K343005 (double transformants), MG1655-pSB1A2-K274210/pSB1C3-K343005 (double transformants)
In the spectrum a sudden drop between 330 and 320 nm occurs, this can be caused when the samples was auto zeroed according to acetone which is the solvent used in the extraction of the beta-carotene and Retinal.
The graph also shows that cell material interferes with the UV-vis measurement where the retinal has the strongest absorption. Therefore, an organic separation is required prior to the measurements.
In order to assess the results, standard dilutions of beta-carotene and retinal were made and measured. The concentrations were 1mM, 100 µM, 50 µM, 25 µM, 10 µM, 5 µM, 1 µM, 100 nM and 10 nM. The standard dilutions were measured on the spectrophotometer. The resulting graphs are presented below:
Figure 2: UV-VIS of beta-carotene at different concentrations. The spectre looks reliable
Figure 3:UV-VIS of retinal at different concentrations. The spectre does not look reliable
The spectrum for the Beta-carotene looks normal and reliable, the standards for retinal however doesn’t look reliable. The spectra for the three lowest concentrations appears to be distorted and implies that something is interfering with the measurement.
The measurement jumps rapidly from nearly nothing to the maximum absorbance, this might be because the concentration of retinal is to low to be measured as a spectrum, but the concentration of the individual derivates of retinal might be high enough to be measured.
It might also just be that the concentrations are to low and something else is influencing the measurements.
Because of the error in the UV-vis spectra concerning retinal detection in both the standards and samples the next characterization experiments is preformed on a HPLC.

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#diary_-_-_TEXT.html," been making. On Thursday we had a big team meeting in order to decide exactly what we want our Wiki to look like and settle on a theme that will be uniform among pages. Further to this we also worked out what each section of the main menu and submenus will contain, something that is highly useful as deciding on all the pages that will be on the wiki means people can now begin to build these pages. It won’t be long until the wiki freeze is here - we are glad we as a team sorted that this week.
Twitter was very entertaining this week and we as a team managed to organise a Skype par-tay with a range of other teams. Hopefully this will work, it will be great to hear about the other projects and also see what areas we may be able to collaborate on. For Outreach we have chosen to make an informative video on the highly subjective topic of Bovine TB, we are currently making an initial plan for this.
Week Eleven   10/8 - 16/08
Woahhhhhh. This has been an intense week. Our Toehold DNA arrived at the beginning of the week and we began the process of getting it to the stage where we can actually test it, however after transformation problems we haven’t been successful in getting past the first stage. As time is flying by, we used this week to decide on what parts we want to further characterise as a team to make sure we are meeting the medal criteria. Lab work is still going to be very busy as we work hard to try and get our Toehold switch to work.
On Wednesday the model team Skyped with Oxford’s 2015 iGEM modelling team to try and work out possible collaborations. As our model is currently a simulation, we are keen to try and integrate a mathematical model into the work we are doing. Fingers crossed this will go ahead! Then on Wednesday afternoon we had another Skype. Initially this had been planned to be with 6 other teams but we only managed Warwick, Manchester and Sydney as the internet was having a nightmare. We all spoke for well over an hour about all the different aspects of our projects and we started to get quite excited about Boston - it really won’t be long until we get on that flight!
We’ve been short on numbers this week and on Thursday we said goodbye to Amy, one half of our physicists, as she goes off on her year abroad at Iowa University. We all wish her the best of luck and are already looking forward to seeing her again in Boston. That’s now two people we have had to say goodbye to during the summer :(."

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," practical, but new questions arose. How would the yeast be exposed to the VOCs? How much air would be needed to give enough VOCs for the yeast to be able to sense it?
The concentration of VOCs in the breath is low, in the parts per billion range for both octanal [12] and butanone [13]. The sensitivity of GPCRs is varying. According to Minic et. al [14] Ri7 can sense 5*10-14 - 5*10-4 M while Olfr1258 can sense around 5*10-4 M [15]. Since the amount of VOCs needed is unsure, it is safe to assume that a couple of liters of air would most likely be needed. However, to keep the yeast incubated with that much air requires a large, bulky vessel. This could be solved by creating a recirculation system with the air from the sample bags bubbling through the suspended yeast culture. In that way the yeast could be exposed to all the collected air but only a smaller amount at a time.
Consulting with experts
Meeting with Dr. Carl Johan Franzén
To discuss the design of such a recirculation system, Dr. Carl Johan Franzén was contacted. Dr. Carl Johan is Associate Professor in Bioreaction engineering at Chalmers and has many years of experience in working with yeast. The general idea considered was to have a tube with a specially designed lid that would be compatible with the recirculation system. With the use of a compressor, the VOCs could be pumped through the yeast media. Air from the tube should also be led back to the sample bag through a pipe. With enough recirculation and a small enough vessel the advantage would be that a shaking incubator would not be needed. The discussion also covered whether the system would have a problem with oxygen limitations. Dr. Carl Johan gave the advise to calculate how much oxygen that is needed and compare to how much breath contains. If the amount of oxygen in the breath is not enough, it might be possible to dilute the collected breath with oxygen. This solution would require the sensitivity of the receptors to be taken into account to ensure high enough VOC concentration to match the range of recognition for the receptors. A third option would be to switch between the collected air, containing VOCs and pure oxygen. To minimize the oxygen consumption the growth rate of the cells should be kept low, possibly with limiting media.
Dr. Carl Johan also thought that the use of a spectrophotometer or a plate reader should be considered since it would allow the amount of cells that"

Isolation of Phage Library
Results of Mutant T4 Phage Isolation
Results of Mutant T7 Phage Isolation
Pre Regional Jamboree
As part of creating our bacteriophage library, we wanted to isolate both smaller and larger T7 bacteriophages. To do so, we first mutagenized T7 by growing it in the presence of 5-bromodeoxyuridine, a mutagenic base analog. This produced many mutant T7 bacteriophages, but they were hard to find amongst all the wild type T7. Therefore the phage purification team ran the mutagenized bacteriophage through a cesium chloride gradient. This separated the phage according to size, with the biggest phage traveling farther down. After determining where the mutant phage was in the gradient, we then plated the phage and looked for plaques that were smaller or larger than normal. Out of the 31 plaques we selected, two of them reproduced their plaque sizes, revealing that they were indeed mutant T7 bacteriophage! This can be seen in the two pictures below. The S4 plate with small phage produced larger plaques that were 0.592cm on average in diameter, while the L8 plate with large phage produced smaller plaques that were 0.264cm on average in diameter (Wild type T7 made plaques 0.388cm on average in diameter). The next step will be to get pictures of the phage with an electron microscope and sequence the genome to determine where the mutations occurred.

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html,".
I would like to add a note on the jellyfish Aequorea at Friday Harbor. Between 1961 and 1988, we traveled to Friday Harbor and back to the East Coast 19 times (13 of which were road trips) and collected a total of about 850,000 Aequorea specimens to obtain aequorin for my research. The jellyfish were always abundant during that period. Mysteriously, however, they suddenly decreased in number after 1990, and it became very difficult to collect even a few. The cause of this drastic decrease could be pollution of the sea bed by crude oil spilled from the tanker Exxon Valdez in 1989, or it could be a natural cause. If the disappearance of the jellyfish had occurred 20 years earlier, we wouldn't have been able to learn the mechanism of the aequorin bioluminescence reaction, as well as the chromophore of GFP.

UI-Indonesia,2014,Team:UI-Indonesia#Human Practice#Expert Talking#aroem#_-_-_TEXT.html," applications in Synthetic Biology in Europe and US is very high, but Asia has been left behind. Japan––as the most developed country in Asia––is known of its high technology development. Depart from this statement; Professor Yohda from TUAT (Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology) stated that there are restrictions in Japan towards GMO application. This condition biased the usual fact and in real life, a part of Japanese people are intolerant of science implementation, so the government of Japan protect all of the people including the conventionalist by restricting synthetic biology and especially GMO. Safety module might works, but back to reality. Every machine that works can’t be 100% effective, and so is safety module. There’s always a chance of failure of microorganism to escape and contaminate environment, especially because the size of microorganism and bacteria is very small. Although there are chances of failure, Prof. Yohda as a scientist wants a higher degree of Synbio development in Japan. He’s excited about synthetic biology development because it will cope problems many industries. People need to take more risks and accept this novel development. [Read more…]

Background
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a term for autoimmune diseases that are mainly divided into two types—Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, especially the terminal ileum, while ulcerative colitis only occurs in the colon and rectum. However, both CD and UC can have extra-intestinal manifestations such as eye problems and arthritis. Mesalazine is an efficient treatment for UC, while antibiotics have a better effect on Crohn’s disease. IBD affects a large number of people around the world - over 4 million people in Europe as and the United States. And the incidence among children and teenagers is even higher. Additionally, IBD is more likely to occur in industrializing countries like India and China. A survey conducted by Ray, G shows that IBD is an emerging problem in India and UC is becoming more severe and widespread.
In order to treat the IBD disease, people have tried different methods. In the past, most active pharmaceutical ingredients were small molecules. However, with the development of biological technology, nowadays there are a number of medicines that are composed of biological macromolecules. Such drugs are often more specific in targeting, with less side-effects, and are more amenable for improvement.
There are still some disadvantages of biological medicines. Usually, it is hard to mass-produce them, and they usually cannot be stored for a long time. Thus, although such medicines are efficient, they often cost too much for most patients and inapplicable in real life. But there are ways to deal with it, like increasing the production to a larger quantity to make it worth be provided with special transporting methods.
Back to the research level of detecting gut inflammation. In previous researches, it is very hard to detect molecules that can indicate gut inflammation, like H2S, mainly because the environment is too complicated and it is too difficult to simulate intestinal environment. Thus, previous scientists are facing mainly two problems: first, making bacterial strains to sense easily distinguishable metabolites produced in the gut, and second, developing methods to assay reporters’ gene expressions from those strains in animals with an intact microbiota. Then, we found that thiosulfate and tetrathionate are two ideal targets in studying gut inflammation ("

This model use different unit than before, in which the response is measured by the frequency change in the biosensor, therefore, the initial equation that are used is:
where,
Δf  = the observed frequency change (Hz)
Δm  = the change in mass per unit area (in g/cm2)
Cf  = the sensitivity factor for the crystal used (i.e. 56.6 Hz μg-1 cm2 for a 5 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal at room temperature.)
After finding the mass per unit area, the response unit can be calculated, and from that, the calculation is the same as before.

UCAS,2016,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," with medium being shaking all along. Growth rate are calculated by five-point method. Error bars show the standard deviation of fifteen parallel samples.
Fig. 1 shows the curves of OD and growth rate. Since the quantity of substrate is limited in our experiments and the parameters should have clear physical meaning for further analysis,  we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model [5] as follows：
\frac{\text{dN}}{\text{dt}}=\frac{v\left( t \right)}{1+v\left( t \right)}{{\mu }_{m}}\times \left( 1-\frac{N}{{{N}_{m}}} \right)\text{N}\quad(1)
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6] . It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
v\left( t \right)={{v}_{0}}\exp qt\quad(2)
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
\text{ }\!\!\mu\!\!\text{ }=\frac{1}{OD}\frac{\text{dOD}}{\text{dt}}=\left( 1-\frac{\text{OD}}{\text{O}{{\text{D}}_{m}}} \right)\left( 1-\frac{1}{1+{{v}_{0}}\exp qt} \right){{\mu }_{m}}\quad(3)
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 2. Dots are experimental values, and red curve is the fitted results. In the first three to four hours, the physiological factor $\left( 1-\frac{1}{1+{{v}_{0}}\exp qt} \right)$ limits the growth rate, as is shown in green curve. The later stage is governed by the environment factor $\left( 1-\frac{\text{OD}}{\text{O}{{\text{D}}_{m"

Super Soldier Bacteria: Manipulation of Contact Dependent Growth Inhibition Systems
Antibiotic resistance is a well-known and pressing global health concern. In more recent times, there has been a stagnation in discovering new classes of antibiotic, particularly for gram-negative bacteria. Throughout the mid-1900s, scientists were rapidly discovering the current major classes of antibiotics using the Waksman platform, which entailed systematically screening soil and fungal microbes for growth inhibition. However, the recurring problem of rediscovery and failure of subsequent high-throughput biochemical assays led many pharmaceutical companies to abandon their antibiotic development programs. Current antibiotics are generally broad-spectrum, acting against symbiotic gut flora in addition to pathogenic invaders. Therefore, specificity has recently become a target in modern antibiotic development in order to bypass challenges of both rediscovery and indiscriminate killing.
The core of antibiotic development lies in targeting a molecule or pathway essential for bacterial survival. Bacteria themselves have already developed several mechanisms to both communicate and compete with other bacterial strains occupying similar niches, which can be exploited for the creation of new antibiotic drugs. While some systems rely on secreted signaling molecules, direct cell-to-cell contact is also used to mediate intercellular interactions. Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is one such system that allows CDI+ bacterial strains to outcompete closely related CDI− siblings by synthesizing and translocating a toxin through the membrane of strains expressing the appropriate receptor. The CDI system is common in many strains of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, making it a potentially suitable target for future antibiotics.
This type of growth inhibition was first seen in E. coli strain EC93, in which toxin delivery is mediated by the CdiA/CdiB two-partner secretion system and the outer membrane protein BamA, which is a conserved receptor among all strains of E. coli. EC93 is protected from its own toxin, located at the C-terminal region of CdiA (CdiA-CT), by the expression of a CdiI immunity protein that interacts directly with the toxin to neutralize its pore-forming capabilities. The C"

Tuesday June 19th
We began the day with some wetlab work to keep on practicing techniques. The E. coli cultured with J45200 smelled like bananas, which was exciting! The R0010 and E0240 liquid cultures were miniprepped, but we messed up on them due to inexperience. More practice was done to learn the procedures of DNA purifications, while other members of the team nanodropped the miniprepped R0010 and E0240 liquid cultures for practice using the machine. Following the nanodrop, a digestion was set up of the R0010 and E0240 parts. R0010 was cut at SpeI and PstI sites; E0240 was cut at XbaI and PstI. We liquid cultured the transformations from yesterday, and made plates and LB media. In terms of our project, more research was done on spider silk and plastic degradation, as we read papers on studies that dealt with both themes and we looked at the methodology used to approach the problems, searching for similar assays and pathways that we could use.
Wednesday June 20th
As soon as we came into lab today, some of our team members began miniprepping the liquid cultures from yesterday. These were nanodropped, and the concentrations looked good! Some of our team members were also taught how to make and use gels, as we ran the digested parts from yesterday on a one percent agarose gel. We also made another stock of 1x TAE buffer from the 50x TAE buffer by dilution. Once extracted, the parts were ligated and transformed, which took some time. Once finished, we stored them for further examination. In terms of research, we spoke with one of our mentors, and narrowed down the possible project ideas to either plastic degradation or a toolkit for archaea. The spider silk seemed to be more and more impractical as we read more papers concerning the spinning and formation of the fibrous materials that make up spider silk.
Thursday June 21st
Today consisted of mainly reading and researching more into pathways for plastic degradation and meeting the gold medal requirements. The Ligation from yesterday turned out to be unsuccessful, but the parts we were trying to ligate were not immediately necessary, but it was rather done more for practice. We also went out as a team to a sushi buffet, continuing a tradition of team bonding on Thursday for lunch.

Berlin Biotechnology Conference
Check out our poster
On June 28, 2012, the iGEM team attended the 3rd Annual Congress on Strategy Process titled ""Biotechnologie2020+"" in Berlin. The conference was sponsored by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research as an initiative to support development of next generation biotechnology. The conference was visited by approximately 200 stakeholders in academia, industry and government, including 11 German iGEM teams.
At the conference, the LMU-Munich iGEM team presented our poster, listened to talks by others in the field, and participated in brainstorming and creative workshops. Two of our team members, Jara and Jenny, were in the winning group of their creative workshop -- they had to generate an idea of how to rapidly earn support for clean water initiatives abroad. We also visited the posters and presentations of industrial entrepreneurs, learning what synthetic biology concepts are being employed at present, and what the challenges are of industrial application.
In the poster presentations, we got to discuss our ideas with experts, learn the projects of other German teams, and consider collaborations for our projects.

The system for capturing of ions Hg2+ into the cell and it consequent reduction for Hg0 it is a complex process that has several steps for its realization. Such procedure aims to transform mercury ion in a volatile element (Hg0) capable of passive diffusion through membrane to cell’s exterior.
According to Picture 1, the capturing and reduction system work, basically, with proteins merP, merT, merC, merF and merA, where the first one a periplasmic protein, that binds to mercury ion to carry it to one of the transporters (merT, merC ou merF), that are localized at the inner membrane, and release Hg2+ to intracellular. Then it will get under MerA enzyme action that is capable of reduce Hg2+ into Hg0, making it possible to get out passively through cell membrane.
In order to simplify such processes, those were written as a sequence of chemical reactions where it was considered that the formation of complexes enzyme-substrate and mer proteins were in balance.

• CI – Complex concentration Hg2+-merP

• CIV – Complex concentration Hg2+-merP-merF
As stated before, all this supposing that the reaction I is in balance.
To keep it simple, it is supposed that just one of Hg2+ transporters to cell interior was active, in this example, the protein merT. Calculating formation speed of the elements involved in ion transport to cell interior:

Project description
While low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism.
In terms of fat storage, conversion of carbohydrates or protein into fat uses ten times more calories of energy than simply storing fat in a fat cell. This brought us attention to one method of burning calories - increase energy expenditure by converting fat into glucose. However, mammals cannot convert fatty acids into carbohydrate due to lack of glyoxylate enzymes, while plants and bacteria can. We envision to introduce glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells and create an artificial futile cycle.
While the consequence of introducing nonnative cycle unknown, Dean et al. at UCLA recently has introduced glyoxylate shunt into mammalian liver cell to investigate fatty acid metabolism (2009). They observed that although fatty acids could not be converted into glucose in normal mammalian cells, human hepatocytes expressing the glyoxylate shunt have increased fatty acid oxidation and mice expressing the shunt were resistance to diet-induced obesity.
In addition to introducing a constitutive glyoxylate shunt, our team plans to elaborate the UCLA study by introducing inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. This inducible system prevents the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while greater fatty acid uptake at high circulating concentrations can be facilitated. Fatty acids uptake will be quantified to compare the activities in wild type cells and cells expressing constitutive and inducible glyoxylate shunt.
We believe the introduction of an inducible glyoxylate shunt will serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cell that increases energy expenditure responding to high circulating fatty acid levels. This will help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.
