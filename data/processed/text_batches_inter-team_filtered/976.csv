Team
For its second year, the UPO-Sevilla team participates on the international Synthetic Biology competition iGEM. Synthetic biology is a new and exciting discipline of science that puts together computing, engineering and molecular biology with the goal of designing and constructing biological machines: living organisms with the ability to perform new and useful tasks. The iGEM contest is an initiative that hosts undergraduate student teams from all over the world to develop new biological designs, work on them over the summer and present them in the iGEM Jamborees.
UPO-Sevilla was the pioneer Andalusian team to participate in the iGEM competition last year. The UPO-Sevilla team has grown from six students and two supervisors in 2010 to ten students and seven supervisors in 2011. This year's team hosts a mixture of computer science, engineering, biotechnology, genetics, physiology and microbiology students and professors. This multidisciplinary team is working hard on the Flashbacter project, aimed to develop biological machines able to store information, much like a computer's memory does. Find more details on this in the Project section .
In addition to research, the UPO-Sevilla team has undertaken during this year an active diffusion program to promote awareness of Synthetic biology, especially among younger students in Andalucía including seminars, workshops, and the first blog in spanish devoted to Synthetic biology, Tornillos y genes.

Cork_Ireland,2015,Team:Cork Ireland#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," was delighted to get involved and become pioneers in this       upcoming community of synbio lovers! This movement is a great benefit for all involved and is a platform for learning and creativity.
Bill Liao addressing the attendees of Forma Labs’ official opening. This was attended by our team and supervisors.
Getting to know the young audience at Forma Labs.
We had the opportunity to get to know the UCL iGEM team when they came to visit Cork for the IndeBio Demo Dinner and Summer Party. We took this       opportunity to show them Forma Labs and we talked about our vision for the community project. We learned about London Hacker Space and the potential       for such an amazing community to work together in unique and modern ways. We can’t wait to see them at the Giant Jamboree!!
Cork iGEM meet up with UCL’s iGEM team at Forma Labs.
We spoke at the SynBio Future Conference about iGEM, synthetic biology and       projects that were carried out by last years Cork iGEM team.       We got to meet biohackers, academics, students and mentors from around the world who had come together to discuss synthetic biology.      We were delighted to be invited to speak at a workshop for Masters students at the Cork Institute of Technology in April about the work we       do as an iGEM team.
Timothy and Shama giving a talk on last year’s iGEM project at the SynBio Future conference in Cork.
This year, three of our members gained invaluable experience interning for IndieBio during the summer. This opportunities was only made possible because our       iGEM team is recognised as an enthusiastic, hardworking and motivated team looking to get involved in the local synthetic biology community.
The internships were varied, stimulating and expanded our horizons regarding synthetic biology on a global level. Donnchadh interned as an Event Manager to       organise the globally publicised Summer Party and Demo Dinner, Shama interned as Assistant Director and Timothy interned with one of the companies that participated in the accelerator, Biocellection, who aim to make a sustainable fish food.

Beginning of Cell Lysis
The start-up culture incubated overnight in 1 L of LB is removed from the shaking incubator. An OD check is performed, and reported to be 0.65. The contents from the flask are divided up into 20 Falcon tubes, with each one containing approximately 45 mL of start-up culture in LB. The tubes are centrifuged for 15 minutes at 5,000g at 4 degrees Celsius. The liquid is decanted and the cell pellet is weighed. The cell pellet is then suspended in 1X lysis buffer in a 1 to 3 weight (g) to volume (mL) ratio. The tubes are stored at -80 degrees Celsius.
Preparation of 1X Lysis Buffer
-5 mL of 8X Lysis Buffer
-35 mL of DI H2O
NOTE: An error occurred when weighing the cell pellets. The weight of the Falcon tube was not cancelled out. Thus the weights of the cell pellets are highly inflated, resulting in much more lysis buffer added than necessary. The cell pellets are much more diluted. However, this is not a huge issue as the quantities of reagents used in the next steps of lysis can be adjusted accordingly."

Today was relatively fruitful. All amino acids have been PCR'd out of the genome, all the resistance cassettes are ready for the knockouts, and several colonies appeared on the ArgE plate. One colony was selected and grown in culture. The rest of the biobrick ligations were redone and allowed to ligate overnight.
The digests of the products were done with EcoRI and PstI in buffer 3, as opposed to the EcoRI-HF and PstI in buffer 2 we did previously. This was done because PstI has 100% activity in buffer 3, as opposed to 75% activity in buffer 2. Also, we learned that EcoRI-HF has 0% activity in buffer 3.

Transformed with the overnight (Room temperature) ligation, using 1 uL ligation mix and 1800V. Joe then plated the cells after recovery.
Cameron reported knockouts!
Found a MetA biobrick colony on the appropriate plate from 2 days ago. Decided to grow it up in culture and run a PCR to confirm that it was successful.
Had previously grown up 10 mL of each fluorescent strain (GFP, RFP, YFP), but the plate reader became unavailable.
Wanted to design mutagenesis primers, but couldn't remember what software to use. For future reference:
NCBI for FASTA
Nebcutter to find sites
Virtual Ribosome for associated peptide
Wikipedia for codon table
PrimerX for basic design.
To whom it may concern, I think doing 4 sequential site directed mutagenesis reactions on dszA is going to take far more time and nearly as much money as simply synthesizing it.
Joe appears to be successfully growing IGTS8 (Rhodococcus) and IGTS9 (Bacillus) in TB at 30°C, and Pseudomonas putida at 37°. He also reports being unsuccessful in doing a cPCR for the dszD gene.
-Jacob
The IGTS8 and IGTS9 cell cultures in both terrific broth and LB grew dense and cloudy at 30C.  Glycerol stocks will be made out of these.
We have been having issues with having no colonies grow on plates with cells transformed with PCR products ligated into vectors.  One possible cause is the transformation itself.  All of Joe's"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Interlab Measurement Study
The Interlab Study is an initiative started in 2014 by the iGEM foundation to collect standard measurement data from around the world. This year, as a part of the measurement track, we completed the Interlab study according to the directions provided on the iGEM Interlab Study webpage. The purpose of this year's study was to measure the absorbance and fluorescence of three different GFP containing devices as well as a positive and negative control. The absorbance and fluorescence of a series of diluted FITC samples and LUDOX-S30 served as measurement standards. Below, we have detailed our procedures, implications of our results, and conclusions we have drawn that relate back to our main focus of evolutionary stability in synthetic biology. In synthetic biology, it is important that part characterization is consistent between different labs to create well-defined standard parts for the Registry. We are excited to contribute to this study!
Protocol
Transform the genetic parts from the Interlab 2016 kit into TOP10 E. coli cells using electroporation
Streak out an agar plate (LB/CAM) with the E. coli containing the device and any controls
Streak out one plate/device and control
Incubate plates overnight (18-20 hours) at 37°C
Inoculate liquid culture with experimental devices (in duplicate) and controls in test tubes with 10 ml LB/CAM media (2 test tubes for each device for a total of 10)
Plate Reader Protocol
Obtain an initial OD600 measurement of the overnight cultures, based on this data dilute the samples to a target OD600 measurement of around 0.02
Incubate liquid cultures for 6 hours at 300 rpm in 37°C. At each hour time point, starting with 0 hour, a 100 µl sample of each culture was loaded onto a clear-bottom 96 well plate, this ended after 6 hours
The samples were measured using a Infinite 200 Pro plate reader. The settings were: Excitation at 495 nm with a 9 nm bandwidth and Emission at 530 nm with a 20 nm bandwidth. The OD600 was also measured

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Modeling du traitement_-_-_TEXT.html," développement de la tumeur est plus rapide que son élimination par les médicaments.
Objectif
Nous avons décidé de modéliser l’efficacité de notre traitement face à ce type de tumeur. Pour cela, nous avons modélisé l’évolution de la tumeur, l’évolution de notre traitement et son efficacité. L’objectif de la modélisation est de vérifier si notre traitement est capable d’éliminer la tumeur dans son intégralité.
Haut de page
Segmentation du modèle
Pour commencer, il a fallu retracer le schéma d’action complet du DVS et l’évolution de la tumeur. Ensuite, pour chaque étape du traitement, nous avons identifié l'ensemble des paramètres qui entrent en jeu, leurs actions et leurs interactions, afin de déterminer les équations du modèle.
Pour simplifier l’équation, tout en dressant un modèle réaliste, il nous a fallu découper chaque étape et les modéliser séparément.
Evolution de la tumeur et du DVS en fonction du temps
Première étape : le développement de la tumeur en fonction du temps
On considère la tumeur non métastasique et sa croissance exponentielle.
Soit une tumeur de volume V1 en cm3 à un instant t1.
Soit la même tumeur, à un instant t2, avec un volume V2.
La tumeur est considérée en phase de croissance exponentielle et sans métastase donc l’équation qui régit son développement, le Tumor Growth Rate (TGR), est égal à :
Ainsi, le Volume de la tumeur en fonction du temps (V(t)) est égal à :
Enfin, connaissant le Volume moyen d’une Cellule Cancéreuse (Vcc) (obtenu expérimentalement), on peut déterminer, si l’on considère la tumeur comme pleine (c'est-à-dire sans cavité ou vaisseau sanguin), que le Nombre de cellules cancéreuses en fonction du temps (Nc(t)), sans action du traitement, est égal à :

We were invited to run an event at their monthly adult night, where adults come to the science centre after hours to participate in science activities. Alongside DIY blood typing and glow in the dark paint, we ran ‘Bacterial art’. Using bacteria expressing six different fluorescent proteins, participants got to create their own agar plate masterpieces while we explained how we can modify bacteria to express different genes.

Overview
Kill switch is a safety system which is necessary to control the release of genetically modified                                 organisms (GMOs) into the environment. Since we aimed to construct a biofilm with GMOs which will convert CO to CO2, we needed a kill switch that can prevent our system to cause any harm to the environment. In order to achieve that aim we used the kill switch designed by Berkeley 2008 iGEM Team (Bba_K112808) and also we tried to develop it.
How The System Works ?
In order to construct our kill switch system we needed a reagent that E.Coli will grow and in the absence of that reagent all the bacteria should die. For that purpose we prefered to use IPTG (Isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) because it cannot be metabolised by E.Coli and that is why  its concentration remains constant in the cell.[1] When IPTG is present in the cell it will bind to LacI which can be produced by the promoter J23116. Basal LacI expression is already present in E.Coli but at low levels and it is hard to control the system with that much LacI. Hence, we prefered to produce it with the help of  J23116.                               Our kill switch system includes the expression of endolysin, holin, antiholin and their production is controlled with the initial concentration of IPTG in the environment. Actually                             cell lysis can occur without IPTG but the lysis rate will be high. By using IPTG we aimed to keep our system under control.
Endolysin-Holin System; Endolysin and holin are the proteins needed for the cell lysis. Endolysin is a lysozyme and its funtion is to hydrolyze the peptidoglycan bacterial cell wall but it needs holin to form pores on  inner membrane, then it can reach periplasm and cell l"

The growth rates arr based on the measurements of the optical density measured at the 600 nm with the NanoDrop.
When investigating the influence of plasmidcopy number of the transformed plasmid on the metabolic burden, the low copy plasmids turned out to be the best choice for the growth, when expressing aminoacyl tRNA/RS to incorporate ncAA. The tendency of a better growth when coded on the low copy plasmid, depicted in Figure 1 and 2, is caused by the different antibiotic resistance. The comparison of the low (Figure 2) and high copy (Figure 1) plasmid backbone, did not lead to the same conclusion, due to different antibiotic resistances. In context of a better while transforming the construct with a low copy plasmids (Wang et. al., 2001, Wang et. al. , 2000), the chloramphenicol resistance appeared to be the better choice for the expression of aminoacyl tRNA/RS.
Due to the fact that the incorporation of an ncAA through the amber codon implies a major metabolic pressure for the organism, we also investigated the influence of the re-coding of the leucine codon. For this purpose, we used variants of the p-Acetylphenylalanine (AcF) ‑tRNA/synthetase pair, adapted to the amber codon (AcF‑TAG), and to the leucine codon (AcF‑Leu). When comparing the growth of the different variants, growth rate of the AcF-TAG variant is evidently lower. When coding the ncAA through amber codon, the low specificity of the AcF‑TAG synthetase induces an extension of the translated proteins, which results in the lower growth. In contrary, the incorporation of ncAA through the leucine codon is much more specific and therefore causes less disadvantage for the cell growth.

We also were wondering what your plans were for implementation of the biobrick into the real-world, and safety precautions to be taken outside the lab through implementation.  Looking forward to hearing back from you soon and we understand if you can't answer some of our questions.
Thank You,  Sincerely,   Our Lady Of The Snows Catholic Academy 2015 iGem Team.
Hello Our Lady Of The Snows Catholic Academy iGEM Team,
Nice to receive your email. I'm Kevin, and I'm the president of our student organization on campus here at UChicago. Our entire team during the school year is larger, but our summer team consists of me, as well as three other undergraduates (CC'd here on this email, in case they have anything to add that I forgot). So obviously this is not the project we are currently pursuing, but I and others did quite a bit of background research into what we could do with this project before deciding against it. I can answer some of your questions hopefully, as well as describe issues that made us stop pursuing this project (that you may be able to overcome). As you know, our 2013 team pursued the Keratinase expression idea, primarily with a focus on digesting feather waste. We didn't get very far, but that year we aimed to express KerA in B. subtilis. Obviously, ideally you would want to express in E. Coli if you're doing it on an industrial scale due to growth rate, but as you may have read on our website, the issue is with KerA getting trapped in the periplasm since it's not endogenously expressed. On the other hand, B. subtilis has the export machinery required to  So here is the format for a couple of theoretical functional systems you could think about that we were deciding between when considering this project, as well as a brief evaluation of each approach: 1. Express in B. Subtilis: Advantage: You don't have the problem of it getting stuck in the periplasm like E. coli since B. subtilis actually recognizes KerA. The Disadvantage: B. Subtilis growth rate is majorly terrible compared to E. coli and people have reported difficulty getting it to grow on an industrial scale, which is why it would be extremely great to get it in E. coli. Also, when we tried it with B. subtilis, the reason we didn't get very far with the 2013 team is because we"

Sequencing of psb1c3+T7 promoter+silk biobrick'
The miniprepped samples from 7/29 were sent in for sequencing.
Running HoneyBee Protein on SDS PAGE gel
In the morning I incubated the purified inclusion bodies in a slightly above RT water bath in order to resolubilize the SDS and the protein.
I then took a 40 ul fraction and put the rest in the 4c room for storage.
Fasih Asahn taught me how to load a pre-cast SDS PAGE gel with my samples.
Put the samples on ice.
Establish what sample will go in which lane.
From left to right it is F1,S1,F2,F3,S2,S3, Final product, and BSA positive control.
Calculate and prepare the Sample Buffer (2x).
The sample buffer is composed of 5% Beta-mercapto ethanol, and 95% Laemli sample buffer.
Since I have 8 samples, 40 ul each, I will need 320 ul of this 2X sample buffer.
Add the BME in the fume hood into an epi tube, and add the Laemli buffer. (must be prepared fresh every time.)
Add 40 ul of this prepared Sample buffer to each of the 40 ul samples and mix thoroughly by pipetting.
Set the heat block to 95C and incubate tubes for 5 minutes.
While the heat block is warming up, set up the gel rig.
Prepare the 10X running buffer, lock in the apparatus, shake up the buffer, and fill up the inner chamber before adding to the outer chamber.
Once samples have been boiled, remove the comb from the gel, and add samples to the lanes.
Don't forget to add ladder.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," a natural system the LuxR-AHL complex controls transcription of LuxI, forming a positive feedback loop that increases the amount of AHL in the system 3 . When there is more AHL in the system, AHL is more likely to bind to the LuxR protein. In Figure 1 you can see a schematic representation of the system.
Figure 1: Schematic of the quorum sensing system. The arrows indicate activation of a part and the flat bars indicate inhibition of a part. The quorum sensing system consists of two parts: LuxR and LuxI. LuxR constitutively produces a transcriptional factor that binds to AHL and LuxI produces an AHL autoinducer that diffuses  freely through the cell membrane, from cell to cell.
According to the 2011 team from Davidson College and Missouri Western State University 5 , LuxR protein represses transcription of the luxR gene in the absence of AHL, establishing a negative feedback. We investigated whether this negative feedback can be used to create different populations. As you can see in Figure 3 different states of GFP responses can occur when the production rate of luxR and rate of complex formation are changed. However, when we remove the feedback in the system and change the same parameters, we get similar responses of the system as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Quorum sensing without negative feedback. In the left graphs you see the production of GFP when  the production rate of LuxR and complex formation parameters are different in each cell. Every line represents one cell, the system is simulated with 10 cells. Five of the 10 cells have a value of   0.01 for the production rate of LuxR and the complex formation parameters, and the other half of the cells have a value of   1.0 for these parameters. In the right graphs you see the responses of the GFP where the parameter values are the same for each cell.

After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Characterisation
The Framework characterisation has been performed using a BMG-Labtech fluostar optima plate reader in order to monitor the absorbance (OD600 nm) and GFP fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 510 nm).
The 3 cultures (IPTG detector, processor and sfGFP reporter) were grown separately in LB+ chloramphenicol on a shaker at 37C. After the overnight incubation the cultures were diluted to OD600 0.1 in order to achieve the syncronised growth to reach the late exponential phase. At OD600 between 0.5 and 0.7 the cultures were mixed in ratio1:1:1 and IPTG 1mM was added. To test the functionality of the processor and the output, tests with the specific quorum sensing molecules were performed as described below.
Reporter test. The culture carrying the reporter device BBa_K2205015 was also tested individually after induction with the connector C12-RHL 2 ug/ul as shown in the graph (Figure 6).
Figure 6: The reporter part BBa_K2205015 test shows a significant fluorescence increase after induction with the connecting molecule 2 C12-RHL.
Processor test. The connector 1 (C4-HSL) was added to the co-culture consisting of processor BBa_K2205012 + reporter BBa_K2205015 in ratio 1:1. The plot shows the successful communication via quorum sensing in the Sensynova device. It is clear that the presence of 1mM C4-HSL is detected by the processor cells which produce the connector 2 (C12-RHL) for the reporter cells to detect. This induction in the reporter cells leads to the expression of sfGFP (Figure 7).
Figure 7: The processor BBa_K2205012 and reporter BBa_K2205015 co-culture test shows increasing fluorescence/time after specific induction with the connecting molecule C12-RHL.
Framework test. The co-culture of the 3 cell types was inoculated at ratio 1:1:1 (detectors:processors:reporters), growth and fluorescence were monitored after induction with IPTG 1mM. The plot shows no significant increasing fluorescence in the induced samples (Figure 8).

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of some of our parameters. Oxford recommended we used Karzburn’s 2011 paper, ‘Coarse grained dynamics of a cell free system’ for the translation constant. They also pointed out that we had forgotten to change some of the parameters’ units so our model was not dimensionally consistent, and we updated the model to fix those.

One of the biggest potential problems we identified was that if enough translation of closed switches occurred, it would be difficult to see any meaningful results. The kleakage parameter represents the ratio of translation rate on the closed and the open switch. We concluded that would not get any observable difference if translation on the closed switch was above a ten thousandth of the rate on the open switch, something we would never have been able to quantify easily without the model.
Without the model we wouldn’t have realized quite how crucial reducing leakage was. We spent a lot of time designing our switches to minimize leakage.
The lab team also asked us to find the optimal concentration of DNA for both output variation and overall output. By varying ktranslation and the concentration of DNA we found that a higher concentration was better in general, however it would plateau eventually as miRNA consumption became the limiting factor. In the specific case of miRNA degradation being 2 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of degradation of the other RNAs the GFP concentration plateaued around 5×10-9 mol dm-3.

Team project description
Biofilms are responsible for billions of dollars in production losses and treatment costs in the industry every year. Biofilm-related problems are major concerns in the food industry where it can cause food spoilage or poisoning, in health industry because of pathogens' persistence and dispersal, or in the oil and water industry where it causes corrosion. Assuming that the environment is already over-saturated with harmful chemical products such as biocides, whose long term health effects remain to be elucidated, there is a great need for novel solutions to reduce detrimental biofilm effects.
Our project presentation Biofilm Killer Lyon...
To reduce the use of biocides, the INSA-Lyon iGEM team aims to engineer bacterial ""torpedo"" capable to infiltrate and destroy biofilms formed on industrial equipments, pipes or reservoirs. Industrial surfaces will then be protected from further deleterious contamination by either a surfactant coating, or the establishment of a protective biofilm.
Our experimental model consists of Staphylococcus epidermidis as the detrimental biofilm, and Bacillus subtilis as the ""Biofilm Killer"" agent. Three complementary modules will be constructed to arm our ""Biofilm Killer"" strain:
The first step will be to fit Bacillus subtilis swimmers with both a biocide and a scattering agent. Irrigation of these active substances in the biofilm should be facilitated by the tunneling activity of these swimmers cells.
Then, to protect the surface which used to be the biofilm's substrate from next possible bacterial adhesion, we will engineered the conditional production of surfactin, a naturally toxic bio-surfactant produced by B. subtilis and displaying well-known antimicrobial properties.
Finally, the conditional establishment of a competitive barrier flora, constituted of B. subtilis"

Hello, dear reader! Remember we had a tricky question again? Here is the solution!
Electrophoretic profile of  BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI and EcoRI + PstI
1: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 not digested, extracted from colony 3
2: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI extracted from colony 3
3: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI and PstI extracted from colony 3
YEEEEEEAAAAAHHH!!! It is right!!! Our fragment (1.823 base pairs) shows about the same size as PSB1C3 (2.070 base pais), making the separation on gel difficult. We can confirm this because the linear vector has the sum of bio brick and vector! Super cool!! It even started to separate a little bit!!
We have our firsts bio bricks ready!! We are really happy!! Tomorrow will be the first test with mercury!

USTC,2009,Team:USTC#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," as Stimulus Signals
We choose to use constitutive promoters instead of the conditional operon impressions (represented by IPTG-induced expression ) as the stimulus signals to test the system. The stimulus signals in a testing system are supposed to be definite and stable. However, the IPTG-induced signals are susceptible to many environmental factors. The process of inducible expression involves a series of dynamic actions in physical chemistry: the diffusion process of IPTG molecules, and the equilibrium between the attachment and disattachment of IPTG to the promoter. That way, the expression signals would fluctuate in a large scope in experiments and the mathematic analyses would be very complicate.
Comparatively, the stimulus signals based on a series of constitutive promoters of different levels are far stabler since the process are relatively direct.
The signals produced by the constitutive promoters can maintain at the steady state during the measurement.
Constitutive-promoter expressions can give out several different stimulus signals in one system without any disturbation among them. That is, several constitutive promoters can work independently in one system to produce double or triple stimulus signals. Instead, the IPTG-induced testing system can imput only one signal at a time corresponding to the concentration of the IPTG.
Two or more systems with different stimulus signals can grow in the same nurture if the signals are produced by the constitutive promoters. For example, in our project, several kinds of E.coli with different imputs signals can grow in the same culture medium preparing for the screen.
We have characterized the constitutive promoter family in detail and the measurements and the results are described in the registered parts [1] .
Design of the Self-Adaptive Controller
Design of the self-Adaptive Controller
The self-adaptive controller consists of two quorom sensing parts one tetR parts and a hybrid promoter.
Two quorom sensing systems
There are two quorom sensing parts in the self adaptive controller. LuxR is expressed by a constitutive promoter and interacts with AHL produced by both LuxI in two parts. The complex then activates hybrid promoter. LuxI in different parts perform different functions. LuxI's expression in Quorom sensing 1 depends on the population density and take effect in evolution in the aspect of cell density. LuxI in part 2, on the other hand, is expressed correspondent to the evolution score directly. Thus it takes part in the evolution process directly.
TetR parts
TetR is expressed correspondent to the evolution score, just like the LuxI from quorom sensing part 2. However tetR represses the hybrid promoter. High score means high"

Week 1
(1st - 7th August)
An overview of the Photosystem II (PSII) project was given. What had been completed and what needed to be done was discussed.
Planning to build biobricks with Gblocks psbD and psbT-B and how assemble operons that are apart of PSII.
Week 2
(8th - 14th August)
Built biobricks with Gblocks psbD and psbT-B. The parts and plasmid backbones with antibiotic resistance were digested. The parts were ligated into the backbones to build biobricks. These plasmids were transformed into E. coli .
3A assembly was used to make composite parts MZH+WK (for operon 4) and O+P (for operon 5). These were also transformed into E.coli (both commercial and competent cells).
A gel was run to check the digestions:
Fig 1.Samples digested as a part of 3A assembly were run on an agarose gel against a DNA ladder to check whether the samples were digested correctly. From these digest results it was expected that for each sample there would be a band slightly above 2000 representative of the backbone that the Gblock was in and a band corresponding to the size of the Gblock. The digest of WK (614bp), MZH ( 541bp) and one sample of O (908bp) provided expected results. Results for P (727bp) did not match what was expected.
Digestion of O and P didn’t work very well – may be due to a higher concentration of DNA which can inhibit the restriction enzymes. MZH and WK digested well.
The transformed E. coli was plated onto LB agar plates with the corresponding antibiotic to the antibiotic resistance in the backbone of each backbone.
Colonies grew on plates for both the new biobricks and composite parts that were made.
Week 3

When the number of cells increased to a certain extent, the gene regulatory network was started to control the number of live cells.
Method description
Currently, there are a variety of models, such as the directed graph model, Bayesian network model, Boolean network model, ODE models and stochastic differential equations models, could be applied to the analysis, modeling and simulation of gene regulatory networks.
ODE models implicitly assumes that the underlying quantities, i.e., concentrations or molecule numbers, vary in a continuous and deterministic fashion. However, at the molecular level these assumptions are mere approximations which might not accurately reflect the underlying dynamics, especially when the number of molecules involved is ""small"", such as is the case for transcription factors, which, in certain circumstances, can be expressed at low levels, i.e., a few tens of molecules, or for chromosomal DNA, for which a single copy exists in the cell.
Intrinsic stochasticity at the molecular level may not be neglected any more when small numbers of molecules are involved (since in this case the ""averaging"" out of stochastic effects due to the application of the law of large numbers does not hold any more). Therefore, stochastic models have to be considered.
The system may contain rare, discrete, but critical events and continuously occurring deterministic or stochastic transitions.
Stochastic simulation of protein degradation
A is the chemical species of interest, and the number of molecules of chemical species A at time t is simply denoted as A(t)
The symbol φ denotes chemical species which are of no further interest in what follows.
k is the rate constant of the reaction and is defined so that k*dt gives the probability that a randomly chosen molecule of chemical species A reacts (is degraded) during the time interval [t, t + dt)
the probability that r < A(t)k∆t is equal to A(t)k∆t, since r is a random number uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1)
A(t)*kdt gives the probability that exactly one reaction occurs during the infinitesimal time interval [t, t+dt)
The goal is to compute the number of molecules A(t) for times t > 0.
With k = 0.1, protein (0) = 20 and ∆t = 0.005.

Penn_State,2010,Team:Penn State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"AFP) is used as an indicator.
cI mechanism
The Tet inverter behaves somewhat as a constitutive promoter when no promoter is in front of it.  Following the Tet inverter is a cI coding sequence (which codes for the lambda repressor).  The lambda repressor binds to the lux promoters in the front of the circuit, which are also lambda repressible.  This, coupled with the fact that the conditions are anaerobic, provides a very strong ""OFF"" switch that does not allow the expression of the Anaerobic Fluorescent Protein (AFP) to occur.
FNR breaks apart in oxygen
FNR can act as a repressor or inducer depending on its position relative to the RBS.  In nature, an activated FNR dimer represses aerobic functions while inducing anaerobic functions.
In the event that conditions change to aerobic in our circuit, oxygen molecules break up the dimer formed by FNR, causing the FNR dimer to detach from the oxygen promoter.  Assuming that the oxygen promoter used in this assembly is a repressor, the end result will be that the coding sequences following the promoter will begin to be expressed.
Ptet is repressed, and the positive feedback loop is switched on
The oxygen promoter is followed by 3 protein coding sequences.  Two of them are genes that code for the Tet repressor and LuxI (which produces [N-]acyl-homoserine lactone, or AHL).  These two parts serve to strengthen the genetic switch once it has been turned on.  The Tet repressor binds to the Tet inverter, causing the expression of the lambda repressor to be switched off.  Meanwhile, AHL production resulting from the LuxI gene couples with the constitutively-expressed LuxR in order to activate the Lux promoter at the beginning of the circuit.
In addition, the Anaerobic Fluorescent Protein begins to be expressed at a high rate.
AFP expression ramps up
Because both the oxygen promoter and the Lux promoter are turned on as part of the positive feedback loop, AFP is now expressing at a very high rate.  This is also bolstered by the fact that that the Super RBS is in front of this protein.
The Experiments
Oxygen Sensor
The design of the oxygen-sensing promoter was based on the dcuC gene of E. coli.  The two binding sites for FNR surrounded the RNAP binding site and were systematically shifted upstream and downstream from this site in multiple constructs, causing overlap of the RNAP binding site in some cases.  Using this strategy"

Bad news: I've honestly been goofing off the past two days.
The filechoosers are all done, for now. I doubt a picture would really tell you much, 'cuz you've all probably seen a filechooser before. I'm working on fleshing out that features library now, as well as the features connection. Hopefully they'll be near done by Monday.
July 1, 2008
Been a while since my last update. I've been reworking through a bunch of ClothoHelper extensions and creating a few more, like highlighting, underlining, shrinking highlights, filechoosers, highlight data storage, etc.
I've mostly been working on file i/o with my ClothoLibraryConnection, which I'd posted before. I have also created a few new frames for ""new library"" and ""add feature"". Once they're fully functional (and I have more time) I'll gladly post the visuals :). Oh! And I made some leaf/node graphics for my help window in the JListPane. Will also show, soon =).
Recently also just got a camera (Canon Rebel EOS XTi!). I've been hugging it constantly for the last three days. Expect some good changes to the wiki soon :).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

HIV is a huge epidemic around the world which can cause AIDS in infected people. To identify HIV is very difficult for people in limited-resource countries and individuals who wants privacy. An easy-to-use, cheap and portable testing device is urgently need around the world.
To further engineer the mosquito to recognize HIV, we designed and created a synthetic HIV-specific receptor composed of human CD4 extracellular domain (1-396 aa) and Drosophila Toll transmembrane and intracellular domains (808-828 aa and 829-1097 aa, respectively) based on UniProt protein database.
The DNA fragments of human CD4 and Drosophila Toll domains were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT). The DNAs were cloned onto pSB1C3 as BioBrick basic parts and confirmed by sequencing. The CD4 and Toll was further assembled with Ac5 promoter and polyA to become BioBrcik composite parts. Finally, the fusion protein was made as Ac5-hCD4-dToll-polyA / pSB1C3 ( BBa_K2543010 )
Ac5 promoter with strong activity
To test the gene expression driven by Ac5 promoter, we cultured a mosquito Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell line and transfected cells with the plasmid of Ac5-GFP-polyA (K2543004). GFP positive cells and intensity were analyzed 2 days after transfection.

Purified GFP refers to the signal of a His-tagged GFP solution at a concentration of about 320 µg/mL we kindly received from our advisor Lukas. Error bars represent standard deviation of triplicates.
Optimization: Positive effector RraA
General optimization
During our project, we constantly optimized our extract. Our success is demonstrated by the following bar graph which shows how the fluorescence signal of our positive control in CFPS reactions increased during summer. In the end we were able to see the greenish color of a reaction at 30 µL scale with the naked eye, and when the tube was pictured with our measurement device, sfGFP fluorescence became even more observable like you can see in the nearby pictures. Time issues held us back from further optimization, although we are confident that further optimization is still possible.
In vitro produced sfGFP pictured without filters. Also it might not be obvious, the greenish color can be seen with the naked eye

Evolution of reaction performance. Fluorescence signal of positive controls accompanied in the experiments raised constantly during our project. The first two bars shown were single performances whereas the others represent the mean of three replicates with standard deviation as error bars.
One optimization approach based on the addition of a protein to the cell-free reaction is depicted in the following section.
Positive Effector RraA – Background
The product of the rraA gene (Regulator of ribonuclease activity A, former menG) has been reported to interact with RNase E from E. coli and to alternate its activity ( Lee et al. 2003 , Yeom et al. 2008 , Gorna et al. 2010 ). RNase E is coded by the rne gene and is essential for E. coli. The protein takes a dual role in the bacterium as it enables processing of important RNAs but also participates in nonspecific degradation of RNA ( Mackie 2013 ).
Airen showed that if RraA-protein is added to a cell-free protein synthesis reaction, the productivity raises about 30% in his cell-free system ( Airen, 2011 ). He postulated that activity of RNase E in the reaction is lowered due to the interaction with RraA-protein, therefore mRNA-levels are stabilized.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#model features_-_-_TEXT.html," Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.
Figure 5: Template reaction
We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling DatabaseLanguage) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It"

Nadine Übelmesser - The baker
Nadine is a bright and perpetually cheerful little live wire. Apart from finding sponsors and doing voluntary work at the animal shelter, she always has the time to work in the lab. To the great delight of us all (the advisors, instructors, TAs and the team of course), she always brings us homemade treats! Without her, we definitely would be pushing our limits with too much caffeine and too little food. Nadine was born and raised in Nuremberg, Germany and came to the FAU in 2011. Right now she is attending the Master's program in Cell and Molecular Biology.
Frederike Winter - The optimist
Frederike is – similar to Vlady – a rather quiet soul. She observes every detail meticulously, helps us with finding sponsors and does a whole metric ton of cloning! Contrary to us all, she manages to never give up and sink back in despair during lab work. After a stressfull lab day she still finds some energy left, which she uses at the volleyball field. She was born in Schweinfurt, Germany, raised in Hammelbrug, Germany and came to the FAU in 2011, where she does her masters program in Cell and Molecular Biology.
Ezgim Sahin - The greenhorn
Ezgim, who studies Biology B.Sc. in the 2nd term, is our youngest member of the team. She was born and raised in Frankenthal (Pfalz), Germany, took a semester abroad to Pennsylvania, US, in high school and came to the FAU in 2013. Since she doesn't have much lab experience her main assignment was finding sponsors and helping with the wiki, especially the translating part of it. During her free time she loves to travel all around the world. The iGEM competition truly opened her up to the impressive field of biochemistry.
Filip Cierniak - The sequence guy
Filip always keeps a level head when it comes to designing and organizing sequences. Fortunately, he has his own peculiar brand of humor to keep us relaxed. His work is always excellent, although we quickly learned not to expect it – or him - on time. However, he has a great method in covering that up with his contagious confidence.

An ‘A-type’ monomer is ligated to the end of the initiator. Afterwards, any unreacted fragments, as well as the ligase are washed off.
Next, the ‘B-type’ monomer is ligated to the end of the growing chain. In this reaction mixture, an ‘A-type’ cap is also included, to terminate any chains that failed to extend in the previous ‘A-type’ ligation. Again, unreacted fragments are removed by washing.
Next, the ‘C-type’ monomer is ligated. This reaction mixture contains the ‘B-type’ cap.
Next the ‘A-type’ monomer is ligated. This time, the ‘C-type’ cap is also included in the mixture.
This proceeds in a repetitive fashion until the desired construct length is reached.
The final constructed is eluted off the beads. The eluate is used as a template for PCR to amplify the construct. Only complete constructs that contain the initiator and terminator are amplified. Capped constructs do not amplify.
The amplified construct can now be used for downstream cloning.
Fig 3:In ICA, the initiator of the growing DNA chains are immobilized on magnetic streptavidin beads to facilitate removal. The first monomer is ligated to the initiator. (Step A) Subsequent ligation steps incorporate capping oligos, which prevent the extension of incorrect chains: those that failed to ligate in the previous round. (Steps B, C) Ligation continues until the construct reaches the final desired length. The final step incorporates a terminator oligo. (Final Step) Only DNA constructs of the correct size can ligate to the terminator, as all incorrect constructs will have been capped. Image from Cloning Guide by 2015 TU Eindhoven iGEM team.
Fig 4:Downstream Cloning after Iterative Capped Assembly. After elution from the beads, the ICA constructs are amplified using PCR primers that anneal to the initiator and the terminator. These primer binding sites are unique in the construct, and can be found nowhere else in the sequence. The only constructs that are amplified are those that have the initiator and terminator. All other constructs, while present, are excluded from amplification. After amplification, the construct can be cloned into a vector using traditional techniques.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Silk Construct_-_-_TEXT.html," the creation of functionalized silk fibers, several biotechnological methods have been analyzed during the last decades. The silk fibers can be solubilized with a variety of solvents like water, organic solvents and ionic liquids. Once they are solubilized they can be processed into a range of different structures such as films, sponges, hydrogels, electrospun mats and tubes Kluge, J. A., et al. (2008). ""Spider silks and their applications"" Trends in Biotechnology 26(5): 244-251. . The type of structure applied, depends on the purpose of the silk. For example, is a porous feature preferred for wound healing biomaterials, since it allows the promotion of oxygen exchange, which is vital for fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and polymorphonuclear cell functions Gil, E. S., et al. (2013). ""Functionalized silk biomaterials for wound healing."" Advanced Healthcare Materials 2(1): 206-217. . This type of scaffold does also support cells, allow transport of nutrients and metabolic wastes, and promote tissue development Kluge, J. A., et al. (2008). ""Spider silks and their applications"" Trends in Biotechnology 26(5): 244-251. .
In nature spiders draw the the thread with the hind legs. By copying this method in the laboratory it has been found that the spinning speed and temperature can cause differences in resilience, ductility and the diameter of the thread Römer, L., et al. (2008). ""The elaborate structure of spider silk"" Prion 2(4): 154-161. . The spinning conditions can therefore be varied in order to optimize the mechanical properties of the silk.
For this project the goal had been to form a thread of silk by wet-spinning, which is a very simple and inexpensive method. First the recombinant silk proteins must be completely dissolved in 100 % hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) to make a 25-30 % (wt/vol) silk spinning dope. It should be noted that HFIP is a very toxic and volatile component and proper precautions should therefore be taken. The silk protein concentration should be about 30-40 mg/ml to make sure that the concentration is high enough for the polymer to form. A syringe pump will be used to extrude the silk through a needle into a  90 % isopropanol bath at a rate of 0.6-1 mm/min. The spinning"

6.Survey
Because their knowledge about solid tumors and the new achievements was very limited, many people worried the behavior of the microbes inside human body. They thought that it was difficult to control the proliferation of microbes in vivo, which might cause some side effects. Many people held the belief that there were many other severe problems that remained unknown if the microbes were introduced into human bodies. Some people also thought that the efficacy of using protein drugs to cure solid tumors was limited.
In conclusion, even in the well-educated population, the knowledge of solid tumors was not widespread. About curing solid tumors by the means of synthetic biology, many people questioned the risk of the introduction of bacteria into the bodies and the efficiency of this approach. We could learn from the results that it is important to raise public awareness of the threat of solid tumors, and it will be very helpful if we could promote the public interest in curing solid tumors with the aids of synthetic biology.
7.Social Network Platforms
WeChat and Twitter
Though social network platforms, such as Wechat and Twitter, we shared our experience and enthusiasm with others. By recording the on-going events, we shared our failure or success and everybody could look at our growth. Sometimes we posted our lab-notes and our efforts in laboratory can be seen by our fans. We also promoted external communication, interacted with other iGEM Groups. Most importantly, we used these platforms for educational purposes. With our fan page, people who are interested in our project and the iGEM competition can follow us all the time. By doing that, they can learn basic information of synthetic biology, and get further knowledge in frontiers of this field.
Our fans give us support and encouragement, and they make our promotions no end at all. When operating these platforms, we saw a lot of support or accompany from our fans. Each response is the hopes, and they make us to know that there is always a group behind us. We are just a small group, but with our efforts, we are confident to take a try and solve social problems. A refueling let us have motivation to continue efforts. The Internet will help the knowledge and our enthusiasm cross all the boundaries.

Therefore, if background expression of the AHL is high enough to reach above the threshold level, then expression of the next quorum sensing molecule in another cell (in this case C4 AHL) will occur. By reducing the amount of detector and processor cells present in the system, the background expression levels of C12 and C4 will be lower, and hence expression of sfGFP by the reporter cell will be lower.
Qualitative test with chromoproteins expression. In order to check the performance of the Sensynova device in terms of modularity, cultures of IPTG detector, processor unit and 3 different reporter modules carrying two chromoproteins ( BBa_K2205016 , BBa_K2205018 ) and sfGFP ( BBa_K2205015 ) were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+Chloramphenicol (12,5ng/ul). The day after the cultures were diluted at OD600: 0,1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:1 and 1:1:13. Some samples were supplemented with 1mM IPTG to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the chromoproteins visualisation (Figures 10, 11, 12).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

4mL of liquid culture was created for both spisPink and amilCP circuits.
After growing overnight, there were no color changes in the cultures.
Week 11
More cloning
Since we had a lot of trouble seeing any reporter expression, the team wanted to clone the individual parts of just the regulator and just the reporters. This will allow us to see if the reporter will turn on when its not being repressed with ArsR. Unfortunately, we ran into the same problems as before. By this, we mean that the ligation reactions were not demonstrating successful insertion of our DNA into the vector.
Week 12-13
Different members of the team kept trying to clone the individual parts. The individual parts were amplified using our standard PCR protocol. Following PCR amplification, the reactions were run at 120V on a 1% Agarose gel. After seeing in the light box that the PCR was successful, the PCR products were extracted using a standard protocol and stored at -20°C.
Fig. 4. DNA gel of PCR products.
The purified parts and pSB1C3 were digested overnight with XbaI and SpeI.   The ligation was performed the next day using reactions contained 4.1μL of digested insert, 1.35μL digested linear pSB1C3, 1u T4 DNA ligase, and 1x T4 ligase buffer, and Molecular Water to a final volume of 10μL. It was incubated overnight at 16C.  Then, the ligation was tested with PCR primers amplifying the region between the XbaI and SpeI sites on pSB1C3. The PCR reactions contained 1x GoTaq Flexi Green Buffer, 0.15mM DNTP, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.63u GoTaq Polymerase, 0.5μL of Ligation Product, 0.38μM FWD primer, 0.38μM REV primer, and molecular water to a final volume of 10μL. We ran it on a 1% agarose gel and saw no bands of the desired size.
In order to test the amilCP reporter, we created a circuit with a high expression T7 promoter, amilCP, and the same double terminator used in our other circuits. We began cloning by digesting IDT stock solutions"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Exemple of sequences of base units.
From the modeling side, we calculated analytically the steady state of the integrase and terminator modules, and it  appears that the deterministic model gives a binary steady state corresponding to an XOR gate. This is what we expected, it confirms that deterministic model in our case is interesting for the study of dynamics of the whole system, and not for steady state calculations. So we are now moving to dynamic studies.

Week 4: Improving plasmid design, Modularization of the whole model
Wednesday, June 18th
We improved a little bit the plasmid design, determined which parts will be taken from the iGEM registry, and which parts we have to synthesize.
Second draft of plasmids. The repressors production genes have been moved to the sensor plasmid in order to distribute more evenly the number of kb.
Sensor plasmids will be approx. 9.3kb long, and logic plasmids will be approx. 5,2kb long.
From the modeling side, the whole model has been modularized and we have calculated and simulated steady state for the quorum sensing module.

Modularization of the system
Sunday, June 15th
The idea of our system is to associate a quorum sensing part, which should be able to react to a certain concentration of input, with a integrase-base logic part, which should be able to derive a computation given the transformed inputs.
From a modeling point of view, it seemed obvious that we had to consider these two entities separately. That is why we chose to have a modularized approach, where we regrouped, on one hand, the equations corresponding to quorum sensing and, on the other hand, the ones corresponding to the integrase logic phenomena.
As the integrase module is not that well known, we further decomposed it into two successive parts. The first one only models the path integrases go through in order to bind to DNA. The second one models the switch behavior of the integrases (after they are bound to DNA) and describe the XOR logic of our system.
As we see, these modules are successive. After the logic module, we added a production module, which is"

Parts
You get the DNA to make the parts. You make the parts to build the system. You build the system to do the thing. You do the thing to make a difference.
The Degrader
BBa_K2143003
This part contains the Nah Upper Operon from Pseudomonas putida which produces a series of enzymes that degrade Naphthalene into Salicylate. NahA1-NahA4 form the enzyme complex 1,2-Napthalene dioxygenase. The other 5 genes each code for a single enzyme.
How does it work in your system?
Our project is all about detecting small amounts of an aromatic compound called 1-Mehtylnapthalene (1-MN). While our “Detector” can’t detect that compound, it can detect 3-methylsalicylate (3-MS) which is produced when our “Degrader” part’s enzymes act on 1-MN.
How did you choose this part?
The operon comes from the NAH7 Pseudomonas putida plasmid. When trying to find a way to detect 1-MN we came across the Naphthalene degradation pathway. We thought, if we can’t detect 1-MN, can we detect anything along the pathway?
The Detector
BBa_K2143001
Based on the Peking 2013 iGEM team’s Part:BBa_K1031610. NahR is a transcription factor that binds to a specific sequence upstream of the Psal promoter. Psal is then induced by the addition of salicylate like compounds. Our version of NahR has a single amino acid change at position 248 from Arginine to Histidine, this change causes the induction of Psal by NahR to become more sensitive to Salicylate.

Barnaby was in our target age range for BioMech, meaning his voice was invaluable in designing the game and writing out the rules - he told us from his view what would be engaging, what would be too complicated, and played a large role in shaping the game.
Juliet was a year 12 work experience student who joined the team from 18.07.16 to 29.07.16. Juliet worked predominantly with the lab team given her strong interest in Biology, and was incredibly helpful. She helped specifically with important duties like making plates and media for experiments done by the team, but was also a helping hand for early cloning strategies. Due to Juliet being with us for two weeks and joining us later in the project, she was able to integrate with the team more and engage with the project to a greater extent than Barnaby was able to. At the end of her work experience with us, she gave us a card which said:
The past two weeks have been without question the most enjoyable and useful work experience I have had!
Our time with Juliet was a reminder of the direct impact our work could have on school students and gave us the drive to work harder on improving education and public engagement with synthetic biology.
George was a year 12 work experience student who joined the team from 01.08.16 to 12.08.16. George, like Juliet, worked predominantly with the lab team as he had a strong interest in Biology and had A Level knowledge. George also integrated very well with the team as he was with us for two weeks, and developed a vested interest in following the project after he left us.
Our time with each work experience was very useful for both progress in the lab or human practices, and helping us better understand our target demographic. Barnaby was particularly useful, being a GCSE student himself, for feedback on early versions of the board game. His insight was supported by students at the Judd School and thus we were able to improve and better the board game from the criticism and feedback of those it might affect. Both Juliet’s and George’s help in the lab was invaluable, at a time where we were particularly busy, however their individual feedback of the human practices work, allowed us to improve and develop our work on public engagement. We therefore recommend that more iGEM teams take on work experience students as the experience itself is both mutually beneficial and very enjoyable.

Gluc-o-gone!
With more and easier access to high-calorie foods the worldwide prevalence of obesity has been on the rise in the past quarter century. In Canada alone, the average rate of obesity has doubled from 1979 to 2004, and approximately 23% of Canadian adults are obese (as estimated by Statistics Canada). Obesity is typically associated with many adverse health conditions and puts an enormous strain on the public healthcare system. Our goal is to engineer a strain of Lactobacillus plantarum to express cellulose synthase genes required for the synthesis of cellulose from glucose and other sugars in an attempt to reduce the caloric intake of food, while increasing the dietary fibre present. Cellulose, or dietary fibre, is a polymer of linked D-glucose units that cannot be digested by humans because of its repeated β(1→4) bonds. It is widely recognized as beneficial to good health, because of this property. L. plantarum is a strain of bacteria which is commonly used to make yogurt, cheese, beer and other fermented foods, and is in fact part of the natural human gut flora. It is present in the plethora of probiotic yogurts and other dairy products currently on the grocery store shelves and is generally recognized as safe. Our strain could be used as a probiotic in combination with a healthy lifestyle to increase overall wellness by reducing sugar intake, promoting a healthy gut flora and increasing dietary fibre in the gut.  We've had to adapt to using two novel strains of bacteria with this project and it has been a steep learning curve, but we've figured it all out and have managed to get them to cooperate well. Currently we're working hard on building constructs, removing standard cut sites and extracting and amplifying the cellulose synthase genes we require. We hope to move to biofilm testing by the end of the summer and it looks like we'll make that time line, with the enthusiastic and hardworking lab team we've got!  In addition to this, our team is working on generating E. coli - yeast - mammalian crossover parts, as well as characterizing some parts already in the Registry.

Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," coli cannot survive in the higher chlorite concentrations and has significant reduced growth at a chlorite concentration of 2 mM. Hence, in our bioreactor we need to ensure that both the perchlorate reductase and the chlorite dismutase are active to prevent the build-up of chlorite, which would otherwise kill the bacteria. On our modelling page , we have investigated the different reaction rates of enzymes, and which one would be most suitable to use in our bioreactor.
One of our aims is to bioremediate perchlorate from Martian regolith to allow future colonisers to use the soil to grow crops. The Newcastle University 2018 iGEM team are working with denitrifying soil bacteria. We were interested to discover whether these bacteria would suffer in the present conditions.
Figure 3: Newcastle collaboration data for alternative soil bacteria in perchlorate
Figure 3 shows that all three of their bacterial species are unable to grow in the 100 mM conditions (100 g of Martian regolith in 100 ml water). Therefore demonstrating our goal to bioremediate perchlorate is essential. The data also shows that if we are able to reduce perchlorate contamination the three bacterial species can survive in 2 mM perchlorate concentrations, indicating we do not need to completely remove perchlorate.
Signal peptides and GFP
Perchlorate reducing bacteria rescue the substrate perchlorate all the way to oxygen and chloride, via a toxic intermediate chlorite. Perchlorate-associated oxidative stress, the toxicity of chlorite, and the potential of reducing reactive chlorine species are likely reasons why perchlorate reduction occurs in the periplasm of these bacteria. Signal peptides are at the N-terminal of the majority of the enzymes involved in this pathway, to enable export from the cyotplasm into the periplasm. As our project involves expressing these enzymes in E. coli we needed to determine whether the signal peptides from perchlorate reducing bacteria are able to export the enzymes into the periplasm of E. coli. This was so we could address the question:
""Will our target enzymes be transported into the periplasm of E. coli?""
We inserted the signal peptides from: A. suillum PcrA, PcrC and Cld; A. oryzae Cld; D. aromatica Cld; and N. defluvii Cld. These were synthesised by IDT along with the T7 promoter from plasmid pET21 (Novagen) and the B0015 terminator, and a modular cloning strategy was used to build the complete genes in"

Multicellular Analog Clock
Systems
What is the Multicellular Analog Clock?
The goal of the project is to make the Multicellular Analog Clock which has following features;
1. One directional movement of position of gene expression on a multicellular scale (like the movement of clock hand).
2. Easy observation; visible under natural light without any special equipment.
3. Easy opreration; a familiar agar plate with E. coli population on it.
We designed “gear” and “clock hand”. The genetic “gear” of the clock, which generates gene expression in response to a stimulus and relays this stimulus to surrounding cells, consists of a positive feedback loop and a Multi-negative feedback system. The “clock hand” to visualize this gene expression is mCherry, a protein visibly red under natural light (Table 1). E. coli possessing this genetic behavior is placed on an agar plate so as to create a circle. Agar plates are relatively inexpensive and easier to use than microfluidic device, which is used to observe the spatiotemporal behavior of gene expression in previous research (Tal Danino et al., 2010 [1]). Agar plate is small and portable while microfluidic device has machines and tubes connected to it. These advantages of agar plates may contribute to the intuitive understanding of clock hand movement, and lead to  future applications.
Table 1
The clock device also contains a “control” reporter (amilGFP) for dual-reporter assay and a UV reset device (lambda cI repressor), which are explained later.
Figure 1 Multicellular Analog Clock
Figure 2 The clock device. Pink box genes (luxI and luxR) form the positive feedback loop of AHL production. Blue box genes (tetR, aiiA, and sRNAs) are the suppressors used for negative feedback loops. mCherry is a red reporter protein for visualization of the excitation wave (“clock hand”). amilGFP is the yellow reporter protein expressed constitutively as an internal standard.

production
The first challenge our group had when we chose to use a bacteria to be our chassis, is the fact that the insulin is the result of post-traductional process of another peptide called proinsulin, which requires a biological machinery that prokaryotic organisms don’t have. To solve this we adopted the SCI-57 gene sequence, a single chain insulin analog designed by HUA and colleagues (2008) [1].
The therapeutic actuation of our system is determined by two steps: secretion and absorption. The secretion system is executed by secretory signal peptides, small amino acid sequences that, by targeting the translocation machinery, are responsible for protein exportation out of the cytoplasmic membrane (figure 1) [2]. We used the signal sequence usp45 for L. lactis and YncM for Bacillus subtilis (figure 3).
Figure 1. Signal peptide mechanism of action. When associated with the SCI-57, the signal peptide will interact with the translocation machinery on the plasma membrane and the insulin will be secreted into the extracellular environment.
After the secretion to the extracellular site, the SCI-57 must be absorbed by the enterocytes, passing through its membrane and finally reaching the bloodstream. The absorption step is accomplished by the association of the SCI-57 sequence with Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPPs), also known as Protein Transduction Domains (PTDs). The CPPs are able to carry peptides and proteins inside the cells by passing through its membranes and are classified as cationic peptides, hydrophobic peptides and cell-type specific peptides (figure 2). We chose two CPPs for the expression design: penetratin, that demonstrated a 35% enhancement at intestinal absorption when co administered with insulin, according to Kamei et al. (2013) [3] and PenShuff, a synthetic CPP designed by Kristensen et al., "

Terminator
Background
Gene  expression  in  both  prokaryotes  and  eukaryotes  is  frequently  controlled  at  the  level  of  transcription.  This  process  can  be represented  as a cycle  consisting  of  four  major  steps:  (1)  promoter binding;  (2)  RNA  chain  initiation;  (3)  RNA  chain elongation;  and  (4) termination. Since regulatory controls are exerted at each step, an understanding of the mechanism of each step is of general importance in understanding gene expression.
In the promoter part of our program, we've discussed the mechanism of promoter binding step and how it affects the transcription level.  To complete our biobrick evaluation program and to better understanding of transcription process, we integrated the software developed by 2012 iGEM team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B to realize the prediction of transcription termination efficiency.
Introduction
Termination, the last step of the transcription cycle, occurs when the RNA polymerase releases the RNA transcript and dissociates from the DNA template. It is important that transcription is imperfectly terminated at some terminator so that the ratio of the amount of the mRNA transcribed from upstream and that from downstream of the terminator is controlled. This regulation is quantified by the termination efficiency (%T).
Two mechanisms of transcription termination and two classes of termination signals have been described in bacteria:"

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Questionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html," possibility to study how students perceive and approach the challenges of interdisciplinary work. To specifically study the relationship of mathematical modeling and laboratory work in iGEM teams and gather information about pitfalls, good practices, and the integration of modeling and laboratory work we created a questionnaire and sent it to a number of teams. We also studied the expectations students had for modeling, how the modeling efforts were organized and how well modeling and experimentation was integrated in iGEM teams.
Having finished the questionnaire, we found the share of respondents from a mathematical background surprisingly low. To find out how well our sample represents iGEM teams we looked up the majors of students from 84 iGEM teams from 2014. We also compared the results to compositions of professional synthetic biology research groups to see if there are any differences.
Main findings
Models are expected to aid in understanding factors that affect the biological system, in predicting outcomes of experiments, focusing wetlab efforts and figuring out if an idea can be realized at all
Biggest issues in collaboration between modelers and experimentalists are: lack of knowledge of the other field, lack of common terminology and differences in ways of thinking
Both modelers and biologists need to understand the basics of the other field to be able to effectively collaborate.
Having experimentalists and modelers work close together is beneficial. One approach generally found successful is to have some biologists involved in modeling to ensure models are connected to reality and useful for the project.
Regular team meetings for presenting and discussing progress and issues of every field take time, but ensure all team members stay informed and can voice their insights
Having one person do both modeling and experimentation alone is one way to avoid collaboration issues, but works only in very small projects
Students with a mathematical educational background are underrepresented in iGEM teams as compared to professional synthetic biology groups. On the other hand, there are relatively many biotechnology students taking part in iGEM.
While modeling is most often done by students with a background from mathematical sciences and experimentation by students with biological background, biotechnology students often stand somewhere in between, acting as mediators between the approaches.
Materials and methods
The questionnaire was built in Google Forms and contained the following questions, with each question except number 7 (multiple choice question) having an open text box for the answer:
What team are you in?
What is your field of studies?
How long have you been studying?
Is your team doing any modeling? If yes, is there an assigned group for this task?
What kind of roles do you have in your project?
What were your expectations for combining modeling with biology? Was there something surprising?

Bioengineering: Bioinformatics, 2015
I was excited for the start of summer 2014 for the experiences and work that would be done by our UCSD iGEM team. The focus of my work was the database creation. The initial progress of the SBiDer database included lots of learning SQL and Python for the usage in the SBiDer database creation. Although I had some programming experience in Python which helped populate the database, the creation of the database itself was not an easy task. To create just any database is easy, but what I found to be really difficult was creating a database schema that planned ahead for the SBiDer network. I had great team members and together we managed to both create a reliable schema and populated a database that helped move our project forward.
I came into iGEM expecting to learn a lot of about programming, but iGEM was also a great experience to learn teamwork. Communicating seems like a given in a team project, but that doesn’t mean that ideas are put into clear words. I learned to talk clearly with my teammates to establish tasks we had to do and how we could work together. As the project was coming to a close we really depended on one another and I learned to sit down and work out problems with people. For the future I expect UCSD iGEM teams to be able to build upon our successes and failures. Being part of iGEM this summer has encouraged me to begin a club on campus that focuses on synthetic biology, stressing programming and teamworking skills that would make future UCSD iGEM teams successful and competitive.

Having little experience with programming, the possibility of applying my knowledge in Biochemistry to help create an application was very appealing. The chance to improve in programming and possibly learn different coding languages definitely was the icing on the cake.
Biochemistry is something I have always been fond of, but having a chance to translate that knowledge into something that people could use and benefit from was extremely exciting."

She was infinitely helpful, coming in at weekends and staying late every evening in order to complete the tasks at hand and studying for her exams alongside.
Dan Goss
After briefly lapsing his strong vegan beliefs and accepting the use of fetal bovine serum and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in the lab, he took charge of the measurement study and put his controversial views to good use at the forefront of our human practice ventures. He spurned interesting and heated debates about the project and its applications as well as its environmental impacts.

A Day of Wonder
During the first week of June, the international Festival of Technology (iFOT) was organized for and by students of the Technical University of Delft. In order to officially close the festival, A Day of Wonder was organized on the fifth of June. We had the opportunity to be part of the health area and present our own project to the visitors of the festival. Our aim was to teach the public more about synthetic biology and to make them excited about our project.
Description of the event
A day of Wonder was the spectacular final of an entire week of celebrating technology. The event gave intellectuals and curious minds a chance to see innovations on the edge, with a mix of technology, music, art and great food. The               Health Area was located in the Aula where all projects related to health topics were presented, ranging from end projects of master students, such as the Exoskeleton and the Buddy, to the fall course in which cameras were used to register               the exact movement during the process of falling. We had the opportunity to be part of the health area and present our own project to the visitors of the festival. Our aim was to teach the public more about synthetic biology and to make               them excited about our project.
Our stand
Since the festival was for everyone interested, ranging from young to old and higher to lower levels of education, we organized our stand in such a way that we could explain the basic concepts of synthetic biology and the iGEM competition.               In order to teach, in a visual way, what synthetic biology is, we designed two puzzles, representing two types of bacteria. With these puzzles, we could explain how genes can be transferred from one bacteria to the other. Moreover,               we brought some microscopes and lenses (built with Lego) to show the people how to enlarge pictures.
Activities
To have an interactive activity, we gave the public the task to write down their first thought when they hear about bacteria. The replies ranged from ‘dirty’, ‘zombie apocalypse’ to E. coli. In our opinion it was really funny but useful to               see what the general knowledge (and opinion) is about bacteria. Our main attraction was the functional 3D printer that we had lent from Frank & Frens. With the printer we were able to show the public how the process of 3D printing works,               what we want to do with the bacteria and why 3D printing could lead"
