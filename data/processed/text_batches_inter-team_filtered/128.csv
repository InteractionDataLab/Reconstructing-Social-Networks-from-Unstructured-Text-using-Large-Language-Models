UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Human Practices#Commercialisation_-_-_TEXT.html," development, focusing on MiCheck, a prostate cancer diagnosis tool, which works via antibody-mediated analysis of serum samples. Brad informed us that from Minomic attaining the licence for this product, it took 4.5 years and $25M AUD to take it to market, despite the large quantity of research already available verifying both its function and safety. One of Brad’s key messages from this was how important it is to know your target customers before attempting to integrate the product into the market, something we took on board with our product design . He explained how Minomic achieves this by surveying relevant industry professionals, such as insurers and healthcare practitioners, to ascertain where their device would sit within the industrial market when compared to current technologies. Brad advised us to conduct market analysis as we moved forwards in order to suitably determine a market need and price for our scaffold, if we were to scale it up in the future.
Reflecting on this process, in combination with our investigation into intellectual property , we came to realise the extent of the challenge ahead of us if we decided to commercialise our Assemblase system. Although Brad discussed how legal protection enables Minomic to capitalise on their research investment, the process and loopholes described seem daunting. As such, the UNSW iGEM team decided to focus more on the experimental investigation and characterisation of our system.
One positive takeaway from our consultation with Brad was how arranging enzymes into tethered spatial organisations could have many further applications. Our scaffold’s could possibly assist bioremediation using metabolic engineering, or could even be adapted for use in the drug targeting space. Although these suggestions weren’t directly incorporated into our enzyme-centric design, the suggested applications were in the forefront of our minds as we discussed the future of our project with the wider community .
Integrate
Research into the commercialisation of our scaffold has guided the focus of our project and influenced the experiments we have performed. As a result of the team’s research into the use of IAA and plant hormones in industry, we have gained information about the commercial applications of IAA. Although the prospects of commercialising our scaffold with a focus on IAA were bleak (upon discovering that IAA was not widely used in industry), this information pushed the team to explore further applications. Our meeting with Prof. Paul Groundwater gave us a new perspective on the target market of our scaffold. The suggestion to concentrate our pathways and commercialisation research on ones with products where chirality is an important factor during synthesis (e.g. Taxol side-chain synthesis and Astaxanthin synthesis) directed our approach to future applications"
Berkeley,2012,Team:Berkeley#Project#Localization_-_-_TEXT.html,": pTEF1, pTDH3, pRPL18B, pRNR2, and pREV1 - listed from strongest to weakest. These were chosen based on the data from a paper from UCSF (Ghaemmaghami, et. al, 2003) in which every yeast genome open reading frame was tagged with GFP and observed for protein abundance. The 5 promoters listed above were simply 5 promoters that spanned a reasonable range in promoter strength and were promoters that Dueber lab was already familiar with. The promoter library we created allowed us to systematically compare all 5 promoters. Each yeast strain in the library expressed only one organelle localization tag, with one promoter, and we imaged them all under the same microscope settings. Two modes of image analysis were used for thorough comparison: one with the pixel brightness range set from 0-4095, and another with range 25-1000. The data can be seen here .
To assay their potential use in our project, we characterized the strength of several registry yeast promoters. We wanted to compare their consistency of expression and relative fluorescence, then quantify them against a standard promoter fluorescence. The promoters we used in our assay:
pSTE5, a weak constitutive promoter for the yeast scaffold protein STE5. Registry Part: BBa_I766557 .
pCYC1, a mid-level constitutive promoter for yeast Cytochrome c. Registry Part: BBa_I766555 .
pADH1, a strong constitutive promoter for yeast Alcohol Dehydrogenase. Registry Part: BBa_I766556 .
pTDH3, a strong constitutive promoter for the yeast glycerol synthesis protein GPD1. Registry Part: BBa_K124002 .
Experimental Design: We designed our promoters to express a fluorescent protein so that we could quickly measure bulk fluorescence via TECAN. To test if downstream sequence affected expression, we cloned the promoter in front of two different fluorescent proteins, yellow fluorescent Venus and red fluorescent mKate in different strains. If expression was sequence-independent, we expected similar fluorescence intensity from both channels. The device was cloned on a backbone with Leu2 marker and Cen6 origin of replication and transformed into S228C S. cerevisiae. Ideally, we wanted the calibration curve to span several orders of magnitude and exhibit a linear relationship, which was true for all the promoters we characterized except for pCYC1.
We collected data for 8 samples per strain. the averaged data that we acquired is shown below:
Calibration curve of fluorescence intensity. Error bars are +/- one standard"

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html,", 2012). When the entrepreneurship track ended after the 2014 Jamboree, it was not because iGEM did not value entrepreneurship but because there was a growing realization that “entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project,” (Entrepreneurship, 2015.igem.org, 2015). As a result, there is now a Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Award that is open to all teams. In this section, we will describe trends in where and when they were formed and provide two taxonomies of iGEM startups. Information on each startup including the iGEM team they came from, the team’s university, the company’s native country, and a brief description of what the company offers is in the appendix.
We found a list of 18 iGEM startups from the iGEM website (iGEM Startups, 2016), one more through internet research (Chatsko, 2015), and one more from a member of an iGEM team that generated that startup (Balbon, 2016). Our list includes companies that were founded by iGEM members and thus not every company we study is based on an iGEM project; this decision was made because the list on iGEM’s website includes teams like Hyasynth that are not based on an iGEM project and the information needed to determine whether this is the case for a given business is not always available. Seven company-founding teams were in the entrepreneurship track, while three competed in years where the entrepreneurship track was available but did not participate in the entrepreneurship track. Below is a visualization of when the teams that generated the startups competed at the Jamboree (half teams indicate when two consecutive years were credited by iGEM.org with forming a startup).
graph3.png
The early 2010s were a very fruitful period for iGEM entrepreneurship. 2012 was the first year of the entrepreneurship track, and this might have something to do with the large number of startups formed from teams in that year. We believe the drop-off after 2012 is similar to the drop-off in publications after 2013: it takes time to start a business. Any businesses from 2013-15 that were not uncovered by our research are likely either still in the very early stages and have not reported the startup to iGEM or do not have a sufficient online presence to be found by our research.
Our list of twenty includes businesses that were formed from teams exclusively from North America and Europe. They also show a remarkable degree of clustering on a"
Goettingen,2015,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," compatible for insertion into the multiple cloning site of the pBAD vector. The genes for these two enzymes had been found in screenings of     metagenomic libraries.
After purification of the PCR products, they were ligated into pJET by blunt end ligation. This vector serves to clone the enzymes without triggering their     activity, which may interact with the vector or the E.coli. In the case of phosphatase, the PCR products needed to be purified by gel extraction,     to eliminate left over template plasmids, which could interfere with the transformation.
Ligation into pJET was followed according to the protocol in the methods collection. After over-night incubation colonies were picked, plasmids extracted     with a Quiaprep spin Miniprep kit and restricted with either KpnI and SacI or XhoI and PstI, depending on the Enzyme (Fig.2&3).
Once restrictions showed the correct bands, both pJET containing esterase and phosphatase were sent for sequencing by the G2L laboratory.
The sequencing was successful and proved that both enzymes were properly inserted into the vector. The next step was a big restriction of the whole plasmid     extract with the correspondent pair of restriction enzymes. That allowed us to isolate the enzyme inserts carrying the desired restriction sites. The     fragments were purified with the peqGOLD Gel extraction kit.
The esterase was then ligated into the pBAD vector containing the CCEL (Clostridium cellulolyticum) dockering. Competent E. coli Top10     cells were transformed and the pBAD_Est_CCEL construct was isolated from the positive clones with a Quiaprep spin Miniprep kit.
A restriction control with SacI for the esterase constructs was run in a 0,8% agarose gel (Fig. 4). Samples #2, #3 and #9 correspond to the linear plasmid containing the insert.  Phosphatase construct was control restricted with EcoRI (Fig. 5), in this case 13 of 14 samples showed successful insertion of the enzyme fragment into the vector.
Future plans
The next steps include changing to a better expression vector in order to test and measure the activity of the enzymes, especially to ensure that the fusion with the dockerins is not interfering with the function of the enzymes. Finally the aim is to combine the purified enzyme-dockerin proteins with the synthetic scaffold and prove the self assemby of the Flexosome tool.

Meanwhile, fill the inner chamber (in between the glass plates) with buffer until the buffer
reaches the top of the inner chamber. Fill the bottom of the outer chambers with more buffer
so that it covers the bottom of the gels by at least 2cm. A large amount is not needed. Take the
gel comb out gently. straighten any lopsided well walls with
pipette tip.
Add the protein ladder to the first well and the protein samples in the other
wells. Load 10-20ul per well (same volume for every well). Be careful not to overfill a well!
Record order of loading in lab notebook!
Dip the pipette tip through the surface of the buffer, centre it near the bottom of the well and
SLOWLY depress the pipette plunger into the well. Make sure all of the solution actually goes
into the well as to not contaminate the other wells.
Place the lid on the apparatus and connect the apparatus to the power supply.
Make sure the cathode and anode are connected correctly (black to black, red to red)
Set the voltage to 140 and run the gel for around 70 minutes.
Monitor movement of loading dye through gel. Stop running when dye front reaches bottom of
gel. Once the process is finished, take off the lid, remove the inner chamber and pour out the
buffer carefully.
Remove the glass carefully.
Rinse the plates with water and separate the plates
The stacking gel should be removed by cutting with a spatula or razor blade. Try not to tear the
resolving gel.
Staining the SDS-PAGE gel
Fill a wide container with deionized water and separate the resolving gel from the glass plate. Leave the
gel in the container.
Rinse the gel with deionized water gently. Repeat 2-3 times.
In a container with deionized water, microwave the gel for 30 seconds.
Transfer the gel to the staining solution and microwave for 30 seconds.
To make the staining solution:
In a new container, add 2.5 g of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 to 450mL 100% ethanol. Dissolve
the Brilliant Blue with a magnetic stir bar.
Add 100 mL of glacial acetic acid

The upper two lines show the site of mutation, here. K stands for guanine or thymine, N for any possible base. Corresponding to the DNA sequence the amino acid sequence is shown with labeled positions of mutated amino acid residues (*) above. G: guanine, C: cytosine, A: adenine, T: thymine.
The introduction of targeted saturation mutations requires mutant primer design ( primer mutagenesis ). We divided our library generation into two rounds, each mutating different residues (Fig. 12A). Amino acids 149, 150 and 154 were mutated in the first (1st), amino acids 69 and 73 in the second round (2nd). Each library generation consists of the following steps: 1. primer design, 2. saturated mutagenesis PCR, 3. DpnI/BsaI restriction, 4. ligation, transformation and plasmid isolation, 5. PCR for 2nd round; the template for 2nd round being the isolated mutated plasmids of the 1st. After 2nd round, the plasmid library is completed. Figure 12B shows gels from the 2nd round of mutagenesis. The gels of step 2 (PCR), step 3 (digest) and step 4 (ligation) show a band of the expected size at 3769 bp, indicating that the intermediate steps were successful. The primers we used for the mutagenesis PCR randomly mutate five amino acids residues at positions 69, 73, 149, 150 and 154, which are known to bind to L-Aspartate (Fig. 12C). The outcome of the mutations is depicted in Figure 12D.

Description
a. The average transcription rate is about 50 nucleotide per second in E.coli. The transcription rate of each transcript is calculated according to their lengths.
b. The average translation rate is about 15 amino acids per second in E.coli. The translation rate of each protein is calculated according to their amino acid numbers.
c. The average half-life of mRNAs is set to 10 min. The degradation rate is calculated according to the half-life value.
d. The average half-life of proteins is set to 2 h. The degradation rate is calculated according to the half-life value.
e. There are no data about the degradation rate constant, kinetic parameters of hdnoR. Because hdnoR is homologous to TetR protein, so the parameters related to hdnoR is from the experiment data of TetR
f. We add SrrA tag to the end of GFP, so the degradation rate is 10 times faster than the normal condition.

These dyes would do harm to human health and ecological system. The biological degradation of dyes is an economical and environmentally friendly alternative. Thus, the aim of team SHSBNU_China is to create a biofilm for discoloration of synthetic reactive dyes. The team would use biofilm of E. coli and engineered it to contain the laccase CotA from B. subtilis, which is a polyphenol oxidase that can catalyze the degradation of dyes.

GlmS and BtuF constructs:
Cloning of the two constructs into the pBAD202 according to the D-TOPO protocol was repeated, followed by transformation of TOP10 cells. After growing the cells, plasmid preparations were performed.
Week 2: ME, MS, GH, AB, TK
GlmS and BtuF constructs:
The plasmids from last week were digested with respective restriction enzymes and new liquid cultures for both constructs were prepared. But none of the prepared plasmids showed the right restriction pattern after digestion.
MutB construct:
MutB1 blunt end was prepared by PCR and gel extraction and amplified by PCR. Additionally, MutB1 and MutB2 were again generated with overhangs by PCR. The PCR was not successful, so we tried another approach by following the protocol for overhang generation used by Harrison et al.
Week 3: AB, TK, GH, MS, TS, LK
GlmS and BtuF constructs:
Cloning of GlmS and BtuF into pBAD202 and transformation into TOP10 cells had to be repeated. The transformation was then plated on plates with minimal M9 medium, but no colonies grew.
MutB construct:
The generation of MutB1 and MutB2 with overhangs and MutB1 with blunt end was repeated. Only MutB1+blunt end could be produced. Additionally, a repetition of the PCR of MutB2 with the phosphorylated MutB2 was done, but MutB2 could not be amplified.
Week 4: GH, LK, ME, TK, TS, IF, MS, AB
MutB constructs:
The MutB+blunt end DNA was amplified by PCR, but the control gel was showed negative results.
Preperation:
Our LB-Kan and M9-Kan plates were tested with a transformation of PLP03 in DH5α and compared with plates provided by the lab. After negative results, our plates had to be discarded but plasmid preparation could be performed from clones of the control plates. We prepared new plates for us.
GlmS and BtuF constructs:
The constructs could be successfully amplified with the newly designed primers and GlmS and BtuF in pBAD202 were transformed into TOP10. The transformation for GlmS was successful and plasmid preparation could be performed.

pET15BB
BBa_K1830000
IPTG-inducible E. Coli Expression vector with RCF25-compatible MCS
pET15BB is a vector designed for expression and purification of proteins of interest from E. Coli. It is derived from the iGEM standard pSB1C3 backbone and so includes a Chloramphenicol resistance selection marker. The LacI operon was added to the backbone for inducible expression as well as a multiple cloning site designed to welcome any part displaying a 5’ NgoMIV and 3’ SpeI cut sites, in accordance with the RCF25 compatibility

PnisA
BBa_K1830001
Nisin-inducible promoter and ribosome binding site
This promoter requires complementation from the Lactococcal nisin operon genes (nisZBTCIPRKFEB). Lactococcus lactis is inherently resistant to the antimicrobial peptide nisin. These two operons are responsible for both the immunity of L. lactis and nisin production. NisA is in fact the gene coding for the nisin precursor and its promoter (PnisA) will express any gene under its control when induced by nisin.
De Ruyter, P. G., Kuipers, O. P., & De Vos, W. M. (1996). Controlled gene expression systems for Lactococcus lactis with the food-grade inducer nisin. Applied and environmental microbiology, 62(10), 3662-3667.

YY1 repressor + YY1 repressor reporter (Z0416 + Z0511)
null repressor + YY1 repressor reporter (Z0411 + Z0511)
Again, the null repressor has the repression domain but lacks any binding sites, so we expect it to have no activity on the reporter.  We will attempt to include it in every test where we are looking at activity of repressors as a control.  It might be nice to make an activator version of this, too.
Thus, we decided to make some Ura, Trp dropout plates today.  In 250 mL water, dissolved 6.815 g of SD complete dropout mix, 5 g BactoAgar, 0.5 g histidine, 0.5 g methionine, and 1 g leucine.

Yeast cultures went into incubator at 3:45 pm. Will take them out in the morning to use for transformations of the remaining parts.
In desigining Test #2, should compare PMET25 activity to that of our constitutive promoters.  Is there literature outlining this?  Yes, the two papers are both by the same group.
""Regulatable Promoters of S. cerevisiae: comparison of transcriptional activity and their use for heterologous activity"", Mumberg et al, Nucleic Acids Research (1994)
""Yeast vectors for the controlled expression of heterologous proteins in different genetic backgrounds"", Mumberg et al., Gene (1995).
Note that based upon the graphs it seems that the PTEF promoter is the best choice for PMET25.  It appears that for two different levels of activity (low vs. high copy number plasmids), TEF has constitutive activity that is higher than the highest recorded activity of PMET25.  Ideally, we would want a promoter that has constitutive level in the middle of PMET25's operating range, so that we could alter PMET25's activity above and below this value.  We were told that PGAL1 has a poor degree of tunability in comparison with PMET25, which is why we decided to select PMET25 to drive expression of our activator. Mumberg's results were not recorded in our particular strain of yeast (W303) so it might be beneficial"

The Open House Day ended around 6 in the evening. As one of the visiting students commented, this lab tour was very impressive and amazing which greatly aroused his curiosity to explore the secrets of nature. And this was just the core value shared by iDPI to pass the knowledge and inspire the interests to the next young generations.
Self-developed Movie for Propagation Purpose
To better illustrate our strategy and mechanism behind the Solar Hunter, our team self designed, filmed and edited a movie. The movie can be viewed in the following to help you build a better understanding on our project.
Meanwhile, this video is used as propagational and educational tools to spread the iGEM competition as well as synthetic biology. Multimedia approach is undoubtedly the best way to arouse interests when it comes to the young generations. Through our efforts, we expect more and more people, especially young kids could know deeper about synthetic biology, eventually resulting in more social contributions and significance.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," platform consists of two parts, monomer streptavidin surface display system and biotin surface display system. It is known that avidin can bind with biotin firmly in nature, so we choose the biotin-avidin system to achieve the adhesion between heterogenous cells. An important advantage of this platform is that it is not a traditional co-culture system. Through the exploration of expressing condition, we break the obstacle of the pollution between heterogenous cells. At the same time, we can use the adhesion platform to build a CBP (consolidated bioprocessing ) degradation and fermentation system.
Q3: Why choose ice nuclear protein as the surface display system of E.coli?
INP is a kind of secretive outer membrane protein that exists in gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas syringae. The N-terminator domain contains abundant aspartic acid and hydrophilic serine and threonine, and can be fixed on the surface of cells through glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol(GPI), which is good for the display of macro heterogenous protein. Compared to the Lpp-OmpA fused protein, this system will not lead to an unstable growth of cell, thus, the choice of anchor unit is the key to construct the surface display system. Furthermore, INP surface display system has the following advantages: 1) it can be expressed in many kinds of gram-negative bacteria with a steady expression level. 2) INP can display large molecular protein, so it has a larger applicate range. 3) INP naturally has the ability to secrete, locate, and anchor, and can display interest protein without accessory protein. It has been confirmed useful in many reports.[9][14][15]

Q4: Why choose The Yeast Display System with the a-agglutinin receptor?
To stabilize cell-cell interactions during mating and to facilitate fusion between a and α haploid yeast cells, we choose this receptor. The Yeast Display System uses the a-agglutinin receptor of S. cerevisiae to display foreign proteins on the cell surface. The a-agglutinin receptor consists of two subunits encoded by the AGA1 and AGA2 genes. The Aga1 protein (Aga1p, 725 amino acids) is secreted from the cell and becomes covalently attached to β-glucan in the extracellular matrix of the yeast cell"

13.We have designed a device using light to complete the coupling of oscillations,and it can be seen from the video .
As for the Best Information Processing Project:
The life systems in the real world and the virtual world are thought to be entirely independent. The gap between them appears to be hard to break. However, we choose an oscillator to stand for the life system of both real and virtual and the light is regarded as the medium to connect them together. This ingenious design leads to the data exchanging between them accessible. This is truly an unprecedented attempt. Till now, we have completed a perfect loop to make the information flowed and have confirmed it is effective.
As for Best Model:
In terms of our project, modeling part is performed at the same time with the wet lab, which is different from simple prediction or verification. Through analysis of the biological processes, two oscillators were built in E. coli and computer, respectively. To reach our goal, mixed-reality state, we divided it into three stages, the former two of which have been completed. We have achieved the coupling of virtual and virtual systems, and even the coupling of real and virtual parts through interface devices. It’s an excited moment to witness the coupling simulation results in Video 1 and 2.
As for the Best Policy &Practices Project:
This year, we have held and participated activities in various forms. Plenty of meeting up, education activity and novel club! We have joined 3 Meetups and have learned a great deal from others. We volunteered in science and technology museum at the Children's Day which integrated education and propaganda as one. Besides all the above, we focused on the inheritance and the expansion of influence in iGEM and set up a club to share fresh news with everyone concerned about synthetic biology. Moreover, we wrote a paper to show the deep reflection of the influence of our project.

But today, a mentor was able to code pretty much my (and my lab mates) whole summer’s worth of code and more, and have it work! all in 1 night.
Man, I wish I knew how to code like that.
<!— here’s some cs, feel free to skip —>
I learned today that jSON is a subset/ library of JavaScript, so both are compatible (no more compatibility issues). Yeah!!
July 26: webpage is looking prettier
I got one of the websites to look a lot prettier! Yeah! I finally got a yes from Orit.
I did this by looking at popular websites such as google and aesthetically compare their properties and what I like about them.
It’s really interesting because it’s all the small things that makes it pretty. Also, if the website is organized well, then you don’t notice the flaws at all. Only when it’s badly designed do you notice how bad it looks. right?
July 27: working from home
I worked from home today because I had to leave early for Wildwood.
I got the front page of the UI to look prettier. I realize that designing UIs are a lot of fun. But sometimes you also need inspiration. But once it looks pretty, it just does.
I don’t know how I could have designed that previous version. This summer, I really learned how to make a website!
July 31: Learning, learning, learning
After talking to an advisor, I understood more about what I’m supposed to do.
learned more what rubys/ perls/ js/ all this mess and what i’m supposed to link together.
I finally go to talk to someone about these concepts instead of learning on my own through the internet. I mean I thknk that I didn’t do that bad with learning on my own. But it was definitely helpful with getting things/ ideas cleared up and getting a better sense of what I’m supposed to do.
Yeah progress!!

After a day of coding, our lab went to Bikrum Yoga to relieve some stress, a lot of it. Tomorrow is the final day, where everything is supposed to wrap up. (haha. It’s SO NOT AT ALL for me.)

EPF_Lausanne,2013,Team:EPF Lausanne#Cell surface display_-_-_TEXT.html,"ylated nanoparticules to the cells. We thus designed assays to clone this fusion protein and verify its functionality and localization. For the biotin assay, we were expecting ISA, ISI cells to bind biotin and ISD, competent cells to not bind it. We had the right patterns for ISA and ISI. We thus though that we had things working, but by repeating experiments several times and looking carefully at the competent and the ISD cells we found fluorescent cells also having the same characteristics as the ISA and ISI cells, which is unfortunately a contradictory result. We also had our immunostaining experiments that didn’t work, but the western blot results were positive. So knowing that we did all this very carefully with a strict scientific approach we came to the conclusion that our protein is expressed but might be localized inside the cells. It could be that it is not well folded preventing the fusion product to behave exactly like BBa_K523013 protein.
New Biobricks/Microscopy after the Jamboree in Lyon
With the additional time we designed new Biobricks BBa_K1111015 & BBa_K1111016 . in order to prove surface localization of streptavidin. We designed a plasmid that contained INP-Streptavidin-YFP and one plasmid that encodes INP-YFP-Streptavidin. Indeed YFP should act as a reporter is the protein is expressed and could be target by an antibody as we did to characterize BBa_K523013. In addition an anti-Streptavidin antibody could be used to see colocalistion of the signals thus showing that the streptavidin is also at the outer membrane. In the following you see the results of the microscopy.

Finally we chose to use a discrete version of Flick's law to solve this problem, what turned out to be good for our dry lab's objectives.
Furthermore, the experimental work at the IPN-UNAM-Mexico iGEM team fell behind in the middle of the summer because their 2009 iGEM kit plate was retained by the Mexican customs and the critical bioparts for their project were not available in previous iGEM Kit plates. Therefore we supported them with elutions, transformations and plasmid extractions of the needed biobricks.
The collaboration between LCG-UNAM-Mexico and IPN-UNAM-Mexico made things easier for both teams and is a really important factor that contributed in achieving both projects' current advances.

Interview Transcripts
What is your scientific background? I have a BSc in physics from Dalhousie University and I have a couple of degrees after that such as in the history and philosophy of science. Where in your timeline did you become interested in science communication? I have always been interested in science communication and I have always liked explaining things to people. Of course quite a while went by before I decided that this is what I want to do for a living. What is your favourite/preferred platform to communicate to a general audience? My journalism colleagues all seem to be on Twitter so it seems to be an important platform, but I don’t think it is my favourite platform. I prefer Facebook because you don’t to work about character counts. Also, Facebook has the public page which is easy to use and I like the interface. I’ll often post something I like on Facebook and then think to myself how can I make this shorter to post on Twitter. I appreciate though that they are very different tools. Talk to me in a year and maybe I’ll have become an Instagram master. Where do you think science communication is lacking, and where it can be improved? I think science literacy is a big problem in general. For example, we have people not believing what scientists say about climate change. So what to do about that? Scientists should be more open by talking to journalists. When a journalist calls you [a scientist] welcome it. Scientists, many of whom are partly funded by the public, have a responsibility to talk openly about what they are doing. I appreciate that this is a complicated subject and so that there is no easy fix. There is also the public education section—anything to keep young kids interested in science so that when they grow up they aren’t frightened of science or highly suspect of it. The other part is that the role of the science journalist is above and beyond promoting science. There are times when something bad is happening in science and it is also the role of the science journalist to expose and explore these problems. When you are writing a non-fiction book, who do you imagine your audience to be? I like to think of them as an educated, interested reader who happens to be interested in the subjects"
Cornell,2014,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," people thinking and talking about the ethics of synthetic biology. Our proposed system would be easy, cost-effective, and potentially usable on a global scale. Additionally, the modularity of our platform allows it to be adapted to the needs of different communities, in order to best serve global populations and environments.[4]
Limitations and Future Directions
We have learned from our studies that there needs to be more education about synthetic biology, as many people are not fully aware of this field. In addition, it would be helpful to have a comparison of opinions before and after we discuss what synthetic biology is. In order to make our human practices assessments more effective, we would need to have a broader sample size of people taking surveys and answering our questions. Because we live on a fairly liberal university campus with a constituency that socioeconomically slants towards the upper-middle class, our answers may be biased. However, if we were to interview a much larger and diverse sample size, our survey results would be more informative.
Risk assessment can constantly be improved upon. It would be interesting to know what versions of our project, within our portfolio of future ideas and applications, would be the most widely used and accepted. What scale filter would be most effective? Which ones would be more efficient to produce and to market? Which ones would impact the most lives? The ideal implementation of our project will occur when the technological development is made to match the exact needs of the community.

Scenarios
The aim consists of reducing the possibility of meeting among moths of opposite sex. Thus, we will analyze the number of meetings in the three following cases:
When sexy plants are switched-off and males only interact with females.
When sexy plants are switched-on and have the effect of trapping males.
When sexy plants are switched-on and males get confused as the level of pheromone concentration is higher than their saturation threshold.
It is also interesting to analyze a fourth case, what does it happen if females wouldn’t emit pheromones and males just move randomly through the field? This gives an idea of the minimum number of male-female encounters that we should expect in a fully random scenario, with no pheromones at play.
Males and females move randomly. How much would our results differ from the rest of cases?
If Sexy Plant works, the first scenario should give higher number of encounters than the second and third ones.
Scenarios
With all values fixed excepting the number of males and females, we started the simulations. Each test was simulated more than once, in order to consider the stochastic nature of the process. Again, we considered different sub-scenarios for each one of the cases mentioned above. In particular, we considered the cases of having male and female subpopulations of equal size, or one larger than the other one.
Experiment 1
What does it happen when the number of females is equal to the number of males? (F=M)
T_{0} : Start
T_{1000}: Switch-ON
T_{2000}: End
The results show that the number of encounters during the time sexy plants are switched-on is almost the same,"

Along with using new parts registry standards we     will be improving the algorithm, so that the software can search through     more complex relations and returns all possible functional constructs.
Project Introduction
As the field of Synthetic Biology is on the rise, iGEM is growing     up very fast and the number of parts in the parts registry is increasing     with the addition of more complex parts each day. After facing some     difficulty while running our algorithms on the parts registry, the need     for more effective standardization of parts entry was apparent. We have     investigated the information on parts in iGEM’s 2010 distribution and     reorganized the information on the parts registry forms according to     the needs of our algorithm. Then we have used graph theoretic modeling     to visualize the relations between iGEM Parts and to standardize the     representation of the parts as much as possible by graph theoretical     methods. This helped us to find input output relations between the parts.     Furthermore, our program BioGuide is now able to provide alternative     pathways to construct the most reliable and functional Biobrick devices     with respect to given inputs and expected outputs as a guide to Biobricks     parts registry.

Repression studies
In order to test whether a UVR8 fusion with the TetR DNA binding domain (TetRDBD) is reasonable, we first had to test, if our used TetRDBD is not able to repress the expression of GFP that is controlled by a Ptet promoter. For this purpose we measured the fluorescence from three different cultures: reporter only, reporter co-transfected with full length TetR or TetRDBD. Cells without any plasmid termed WT were used as a background fluorescence control.
As expected, cells with reporter only showed high GFP fluorescence, whereas cells containing full length tetR have a tightly repressed GFP production. In addition, cells expressing TetRDBD also express GFP at similar levels to those with just the reporter plasmid (see figure 2). These results can be explained in two ways: dimerizing domain is required for proper TetRDBD folding. Another explanation would be that TetR can bind Ptet more efficiently due to cooperativity. If the latter is true, fusion of the TetRDBD with proteins, that are able to dimerize, would restore its activity to repress the Ptet promoter.
Figure 2: Fluorescence normalized to the OD for wt, reporter only, TetR and TetRDBD. TetR shows the fluorescence level as the wildtype.
Thus we fused TetRDBD with three versions of UVR8 proteins each varying in linker length ( see Design ). Again, fluorescence from cells cotransfected with fusion proteins and reporter ( see Plasmids ) were compared with reporter only and wildtype. Figure 3 shows that we are able to repress GFP production by fusing TetRDBD with UVR8. We limit our further studies to the best performing chimera – TetRDBD-truncated-UVR8 ( see 3. ).
Figure 3: Comparison of different TetRDBD-UVR8 fusions with TetR and reporter only
Figure 4: Cell growth dependent on UVR8 expression
However, high inductions of UVR8 are toxic for cells and impair cell growth (fig. 4). Nevertheless, for our purposes we do not need high overexpression of the protein thus we tested repression dependency on protein induction.  Since the expression of UVR8 is induced by IPTG, we varied IPTG concentrations. The results show that even small amounts, 0.01-0.025 mM, of inducer results in GFP repression which does not impair cell growth (fig."

DRAG FORCES ON THE TUMOR REGION
In our study of the fluid flow near the tumor, it is essential to determine the drag forces on the tumor if we want to predict whether our 'bactofectors' will manage to stay attached to the tumor. Thus, due to the small cohesive forces between the bacteria and the tumor surface, it is safe enough to assume that the total stress forces on the tumor due to the fluid will apply to the bacteria as well.
We computed the total drag forces on the tumor arc boundary (same as the velocity magnitude) by integrating the total stresses over the entire arc length.
What seems interesting in these diagrams is the fact that for different values of fluid viscosity the total stress on the boundary remains the same. Why does this happen?
Well, let's remind ourselves that by integrating the total stresses on the arc boundary, we assume both the pressure and viscous forces. Thus, we should distinguish the two cases and examine which case is affected by the varying viscosity values.
If we could make a prediction, it would be logical to assume that viscosity affects the viscous forces which interest us.
VISCOUS FORCES ON THE TUMOR REGION
Shear Rate and probability of Tumor Surface Attachment
Bacterial locomotion, in fluid flows with low Reynolds numbers, behave in a bizarre manner. To be more specific, the Navier – Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid takes the following form:
\[\nabla p - {\bf{f}} = \mu {\nabla ^2}{\bf{u}}\]
In case there is an imbalance between the driving forces and the dissipation, the fluid reacts to this imbalance by altering the magnitude and direction of u in order to reach a state where there is a balance between the viscous and other forces. The imposed boundary conditions on the system determine the state of the system on the same time step as no boundary “memory” appears. Thus, the fluid depends on each time step on the boundary conditions and that implies the existence of time-reversibility [ 13 ].
According to literature [ 6 ], surface attachment of bacteria is enhanced not in high-shear regions as one could expect but in low-shear regions. More specifically, the factor which determines the degree of bacterial attachment on a surface is the shear-induced trapping which in low-shear regions is enhanced. Thus, for small shear rates (0 – 10 s-1) one could expect sufficient bacterial surface attachment. However, in these low-shear regions chemotaxis may be compromised. Fortunately, in our Quorum"
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#NeuTest_-_-_TEXT.html," in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the world competed against each other. This year, it is the first participation of the University of Goettingen, Germany. The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for students to gain and improve a multitude of skills that are necessary during a carrier as a molecular biologist. Such skills would be planning and organizing a project, including fund raising and team recruitment, coordination of lab work, designing experiments and working together as a team. Next to intensive lab work during the summer, also literature search and well-structured documentation of the experiments is crucial. Moreover, safety for humans and environment is key.
Homing Coli
Escherichia coli is a commonly used bacterial model organism. It has lots of beneficial traits, e.g. a short generation time and it can be easily manipulated. Most E. coli strains that are used in laboratories do not exhibit high motility. The crucial element for motility is the flagellum, which is rotated by a molecular motor within the cell wall. Consequently, these are reduced in cultivated E. coli strains.
Our goal is to create an E. coli strain with increased swimming motility on special  agar plates. Therefore, we will overexpress regulators and parts of the E. coli flagellum in cultivated strains in order to enhance bacterial swimming ability. The fastest E. coli strains will be selected and  further improved. At the same time we will then be able to create an effective motility-selection   method.
Now, you are probably wondering what the advantage of a fast E. coli might be. The beneficial fast phenotype can be combined with the ability of this bacterium to sense specific compounds in their environments. Chemo-receptors enable it to move towards or along gradients of such substances. We will use PCR-based site directed mutagenesis on the E. coli Tar receptor. The combination of speed and chemotaxis allows us to identify E. coli strains, which can sense interesting compounds. Thereby, an easy method for the detection of pollutants, toxins or even tumors could be provided.

Future work
1. Characterization of SΔTMD1 quantitatively
We checked the function of SΔTMD1, however, we couldn’t confirm that SΔTMD1can inhibit S gene when SΔTMD1 expresses simultaneously. We think this is because the expression level of SΔTMD1 is too low to inhibit the  activity of S gene in the experiment. By Jamboree, using more strong promoter to express SΔTMD1, we check the function of SΔTMD1, which prevents cell-lysis.
2. Change the point of cell lysis and make lysis cassette more useful device.
We used the inducible promoter to express S gene and measured what the promoter activity leads cell to lyse. Such experiment suggests that there is the threshold for cell lysis caused by lysis cassette. By expressing SΔTMD1, we can make cell lysis at higher expression level, and change the threshold of the cell lysis.
If lysis cassette expressed by promoters which cannot exceed this threshold, cell lysis does not occur.  Expression of SΔTMD1 by constitutive promoter may inhibit the activity of lysis cassette and increase the threshold. Therefore, we can regulate cell lysis by controlling expression level of SΔTMD1. Besides, by characterizing of the relationship between cell lysis and the balance between S gene and SΔTMD1 with RPU, we can control cell lysis easily with promoters characterized by RPU in the partsregistry…. There are many kinds of well- characterized constitutive promoter in the partsregistry.

I. Starting the team:
The 2016 iGEM team BNDS_China was established first by Yunpeng Li and Zhongxiu Hu. Then the two of them send the information of this competition available to students in the International Department of Beijing National Day School. After several meetings, the final twelve members of the team (see the team information page) has confirmed.
The registration fee was first paid by Jiangyun Hu (Zhongxiu Hu’s father) and collected as twelve subunits from all members.
II. Finding the Principle Investigators and advisor:
The information of the iGEM competition was also distributed to all the faculties in Beijing National Day School. The Biology teacher, Xiaoling Yao, who has majored in Molecular biology for more than ten years, was very interested in guiding a high school team of iGEM 2016.
Our secondary Principal Investigator is David Brackett, who teaches Chemistry at Beijing National Day School. He used to be the instructor at Portland Community University with condensed researching experience.
Xiangmei Dou is our team advisor who lent us her own lab. She is the teacher who in charges of researching projects at the national department of the school.

This plasmid can be inserted into either bacterial or animal cells. Introducing DNA into bacterial cells can be done by transformation (via uptake of naked DNA), conjugation (via cell-cell contact) or by transduction (via viral vector). Introducing DNA into eukaryotic cells, such as animal cells, by physical or chemical means, is called transfection. Several different transfection techniques are available, such as calcium phosphate transfection, electroporation, microinjection, and liposome transfection. DNA can also be introduced into eukaryotic cells using viruses or bacteria as carriers, the latter is sometimes called bacterial infection and in particular uses Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The plasmid may be integrated into the genome, resulting in a stable transfection, or may remain independent of the genome, called transient transfection.
In either case, DNA coding for a protein of interest is now inside a cell, and the protein can now be expressed. A variety of systems, such as inducible promoters and specific cell-signaling factors, are available to help express the protein of interest at high levels. Large quantities of a protein can then be extracted from the bacterial or eukaryotic cell. The protein can be tested for enzymatic activity under a variety of situations, the protein may be crystallized so its tertiary structure can be studied, or, in the pharmaceutical industry, the activity of new drugs against the protein can be studied.
Named after its inventor, biologist Edwin Southern, the Southern blot is a method for probing for the presence of a specific DNA sequence within a DNA sample. DNA samples before or after restriction enzyme (restriction endonuclease) digestion are separated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a membrane by blotting via capillary action. The membrane is then exposed to a labeled DNA probe that has a complement base sequence to the sequence on the DNA of interest. Most original protocols used radioactive labels, however non-radioactive alternatives are now available. Southern blotting is less commonly used in laboratory science due to the capacity of other techniques, such as PCR, to detect specific DNA sequences from DNA samples. These blots are still used for some applications, however, such as measuring transgene copy number in transgenic mice, or in the engineering of gene knockout embryonic stem cell lines.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

We decided not to carry out a digestion on the PCR material, as we ran it on a gel and the results seemed to show that our desired product (AMP gene) was present in ample amounts. Overnights were made for the arabinose test to be done tomorrow. Simple graphs of the experimental results from last Friday were produced and discussed. Max inputted the first three equations into MATLAB and found they were producing a straight line, which the modellers were quite wary of and decided to look more into it. Charlie finished the re-writing of the safety form. Chris continued to look at various statistical tests for the human practices spreadsheet.
Day 3:
Sam worked on a ligation experiment that involved running several ligations for different lengths of time.  We ran these ligations on a gel to find the optimum length of time required to run a successful version. A subsequent ligation was then made to run for this optimum time, with the intention to run a transformation the next day.  Lamya and Ogaga attempted another Kill Switch Proof experiment.  The modelling team looked at changing the order of magnitude of the constants to glean results, looking in particular at the diffusion constant of arabinose into the cell. Five separate graphs imitating what was expected to occur in the cell were produced.
Day 4:
We had our bi-weekly morning meeting with our supervisors. Charlie created a plan covering the next two weeks in an attempt to keep all the lab work on schedule. We discovered we had been using D-arabinose instead of  L-arabinose due to an ordering error, which explained why our Kill Switch Proof results had not been very successful so far. The modelling team looked to see the effect of having a log scale on the vertical axis, and how those graphs portrayed multiple parts of the system. They also looked into if altering the concentration of arabinose outside the cell would have an effect on the output of protegrin-1.  For the human practices review, the team decided that we would no longer use hypotheses to test statistical data; instead we wanted to have a broad spectrum of statistics comparing all the variables against each other. This way will have a more conducive idea of what variables are independent/dependent.  A few biology lecturers with a strong knowledge of bio-statistics were e-mailed to help out.

5. As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMO?
The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labelling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada, unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.
In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labelling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product"

Through these talks we find out how people from different disciplines other than natural sciences come up with new ideas and points of view that challenge and make us rethink biology.
We are planning to develop a game (either a computer game, a cards game or both) for spreading synthetic biology concepts and strategies among young and non specialized people
Video : SynBiology from a simple Computer Scientist point of view.
Future plans: Solving local problems
At the beginning of 2012, Garage Lab contacted  our instructors to begin a productive relationship. They believe in the impact the use of Synthetic Biology's standard parts could have in Argentina, as a tool to help solve endemic issues and they want it to become part of their projects and society. Since then we had a formal presentation of the group and our main project at a Garage Lab Meeting and several of our team members have attended the group meetings often.
Shortly after the first contact with Garage Lab, they came to our laboratory and together we planned on giving use to the parts that come in the Kit in order to assess a key problem in Buenos Aires, which is the contamination present at Riachuelo, a branch of Río de la Plata.
Several thousands of people live on the banks and nearby this highly polluted area which has been proven very hard to remediate from the environmental point of view, but also, a political challenge given its social and economic implications.
As a iGEM team we are thrilled to be part of this competition, but our ultimate goal is to spread the word about this discipline that is still new and unexplored here, not only to the general public but in the scientific community. Our collaboration with GarageLab will be a sort of testrun; a direct application of the ideas we've communicated  about the Synthetic Biology Community and specifically the possibilities of iGEM developed free technology to help solve both big and small problems in our country.
Therefore, we decided to explore the question Garage Lab presented us as a secondary project for after the Jamborees, to develop a way to identify and measure water contamination; such as heavy metals and maybe other noxious components at Riachuelo in the form of an unexpensive kit that could be distributed so that each community is able to periodically measure contamination levels in their area.

Summary
Our team aims to fully exploit our university’s advantage in pharmaceutical science to design an effective treatment of a disease. By comparing the data collected, we chose rheumatoid arthritis and other refractory autoimmune diseases for our project. Conducting thorough field studies and understanding the current clinical status of rheumatoid arthritis were very important to our design and optimization.
Through field studies, we knew that Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy satisfies the patient's desire for new                 therapies, and through a questionnaire survey of physicians, we concluded that Syn-Notch CAR -Treg cell therapy                 just hold the advantages of the minor side effects and lower recurrence rate compared to existing drug treatment.                 In designing the therapeutic method, we were also fully dependent on the patient's request for new therapies                 to meet current clinical needs.
We actively design, perfect and verify our own project. In the meantime, it is an opportunity for every                 single person to understand the competition, together with a new frontier in life science. What’s more, we                 communicate with other iGEM teams and help each other.In addition, all of the members actively organized                 various academic activities, and actively participated in disparate meetings inside and outside school to                 promote the majority of teachers and students to comprehend the field of life science, as well as to improve                 the international influence of iGEM. At the same time, it also made our team members accumulate cutting-edge                 knowledge, and provided a strong guarantee for the improvement of the subject
Survey data
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that may exhibit chronic synovitis, synovial hyperplasia and fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, synovial fluid T, B lymphocytes and plasma cells, increased collagenase, etc. It’s a chronic disease with high morbidity. There are several new therapies that have been used for the treatment of RA, but due to low awareness and low recovery rate, many patients fail to receive a proper treatment in RA’s preliminary stage which not only afflicts the patients, but also brings a heavy financial burden to their families"
Lethbridge_HS,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," protect all the bees and larvae from the inside out. Using synthetic biology, we designed E.coli that produces the miticide oxalic acid in the midgut of any bee that ingests it. Our construct will include the Petal Death Protein (PDP). This protein aids in the conversion of oxaloacetate, a natural product of the Kreb’s cycle, into oxalic acid.  Oxalic acid is an optimal weapon against the mites as the concentration needed to kill a mite is 70 times less lethal to the bee. The acid is already being used in syrup and spray solutions.
In order to apply this construct to the hives, we plan to use nurse bees to feed a mixture of E.coli and sucrose to the young bees. In the midgut the E.coli will produce low concentrations of oxalic acid that are lethal to only the mite, and that will diffuse into the hemolymph of the bee. This will cause the Varroa destructor to die if it sucks the bee’s hemolymph.
Our construct is  more effective than current methods used, as it allows us to tackle the issue at an earlier stage, when the bee has not hatched from the uncapped brood. It also targets the mite more directly than other spray-on insecticides. With this project, we will take one step closer to combatting Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), the devastating issue of decreasing global bee population, by improving the method of killing one of the main culprits of CCD: the Varroa destructor mite.
Description The purpose of hospitals is to help people get better. However, in the United States, 2 million people are infected during their hospital stay and bacterial biofilms are responsible of 65% ( Sydnor, E., & Perl, T. (2011, January 24). Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control in Acute-Care Settings. Retrieved September 18, 2015, from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3021207/)    of all hospital acquired infections. A biofilm is a conglomeration of bacteria that is enclosed in a matrix of sugars and extracellular DNA, this helps to hold the bacteria together like a community. Biofilms can adhere to any surface and are commonly found in nature. However, biofilms can become problematic when they adhere to surgical tools such as catheters, endotracheal tubes, and scalpels. Currents methods used to destroy biofilms include antibiotics and biocides. These methods are often expensive, harsh, and ineffective"

The experimental part of our project consisted on implementing, or more precisely trying to implement, the basic design of the PLA system. Thus, we aimed to express PhaC, Pct and LDH genes in our host organism Pseudomonas putida. Before starting, we designed our genes and command them using the sponsoring of IDT gBlocks. We also asked for pSEVA plasmids, which were provided by Víctor de Lorenzo Lab (CNB-CSIC), and we designed primers necessary for cloning and checking PCR protocols.
Figure 1 shows a general schema on what we planned to do for PLA production.
A part from these experiments, we had to work parallely on the following points:
Growth experiments: We wanted to check different growth conditions depending on carbon source on the medium.
BioBrick construction: We had to clone our genes, pSEVA promoters and other potential devices on pSB1C3 as BioBricks and characterize them.
Gene deletion: We wanted to try the gene deletion of the WT PhaC on P. putida genome, as it could help improving the yield.
Others: We had to help Paris Bettencourt by running HPLC and MS experiments, and report growth conditions to Imperial College.

The steps illustrated on the Figure 1 schema correspond to the following:

Protein Purification - Heparin Chromatography
The Tn5 protein was further purified with Heparin chromatography. The 1mL HiTrap Heparin HP column was connected to the AKTA pure in the cold room at 4 ℃. 2.5mL of nickel chromatography elution fraction 1-5 from Tn5 protein was injected into the injection loop and the chromatography was followed according to the Purification Protocol.
Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the heparin chromatography of the Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 20% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

Chemical/Microbial EOR
This method involves the addition of chemical or microbial agents to the reservoir to modify the fluid properties, thus the oil recovery is more favorable. The principal chemical EOR methods include injection of polymers, alkaline chemicals, or surfactants.

The Potency of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in Indonesia
The database of reserve oil and gas managed by LEMIGAS showed that about 62% of the oil was still lagging in the reservoir after primary and secondary drain. The oil could be retrieved by the chemical injection, such as surfactant.
Currently, the EOR contribution to the national oil production is about 20%. The potency of Indonesia EOR is predicted to be around 42.8 million barrels of oil. Around 58% of this number is accumulated in the Central and South Sumatera region. Further study related to the EOR potency in Indonesia is necessary to develop a strategy for the future[5]

If we are talking about technology to enhance oil production then we can’t exclude OPEC member countries. According to OPEC’s Annual Statistical Bulletin, OPEC members has  81% of world’s crude oil reserves at the end of 2014. As we can se in Figure 1, among OPEC countries Venezuela ranks first with 299,95 bb (billion barrels) oil crude reserve (24,9%),  followed by Saudi Arabia with 266,58 bb (22,1%), Iran with  157,53 bb (13,1%), Iraq with 143,07 bb (11,9%), Kuwait with 101,50 bb (8,1%), and Uni Emirate Arab with 98,7 bb (8,1%)[6].

As the prime example of how our investigations touched and affected our project, we have antibiotics. From an economic standpoint, our vision of space exploration is unlikely to be achieveable unless the cost and mass of our co-culture can be heavily reduced. Thus we chose to avoid the usual use of antibiotics, even though it would have made it more efficient.
This we know, amongst other sources, from Associate Professor Ole Nybroe that was also kind enough to supply us with the relevant strains of Bacillus Subtilis.
Likewise, from an ethical standpoint, the matter of resistance to antibiotics is embroiled in controversy. We sought to avoid it then, which was no easy task, to ensure viability and practical use of our co-culture both on Earth and the intended target of Mars and space.
Our presentation in Boston and our efforts to educate the public and initiate the developing dialogue has been greatly influenced, mostly by our training in public speaking, but also by all the experiences we achieved by going to Stockholm, Paris and Athens for the Nordic iGEM Conference, the European iGEM Meet-Up, and the AbGradE Symposium on Astrobiology. This is by far the least tangible way our project has been influenced, but suffice to say we have ended up with articles in more than 7 languages and have been invited to give a talk at the Giant Jamboree on how to host such events.
Another equally as important but somewhat cynical aspect is the matter of intellectual property rights. Before investigating the legislation, we did not consider what we did and didn’t say during presentations and published on papers and articles.
Our work with the Mars One Round 3 Candidate, Christian Ohlendorff Knudsen, has resulted in a “Manifest of Space Exploration” which has supplied us with streamlined arguments for our vision of going into space.
This is a fusion of both our practical, scientific arguments and his more emotional and ideological arguments. That we came together and formed this has strengthened the dedication of both parties, and has certainly helped us entice the"

For this purpose the same cells were stained with app. 10 µM A3C5-Fab that was coupled to the fluorescent dye Dy634-NHS and 100 µM of the chemical compound biotin-atto488. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C, washed twice with PBS and analyzed using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD bioscience, voltages for fluorescence channels were all at 750 V).
For the channels FITC (biotin-atto488) and Dy634 (A3C5-Fab-Dy634, detected using a HeNe laser (633 nm) and a 660/20 band pass ﬁlter) the fluorescence signal was measured and mean values are given. The cells showed a homogeneious population in the FSC/SSC plot. The A3C5-Fab staining detected high signals up til a mean of over 4000 for the eMA-autotransporter dependent on the inducer concentration. For the same bacterial cells the binding of biotin-Atto488 could be confirmed as well. The single chain Avidin (scAvidin) cells showed absolutely no A3C5 signal but a low Biotin-Atto488 background signal that could be caused by biotin-importers that transport biotin into the cells or the slow diffusion into the periplasm of E. coli. In contrast the BAP-Receptor also shows a high surface presentation as seen in the A3C5 signal of nearly 4000 for the ""high"" induced sample. The elevated biotin-Atto488 is unexpected but could be explained by the weakened and partly permeable out membrane that does not stop the small-molecule dye from entering the periplasm.
Discussion: The autotransporter is working and can present small protein cargo on the bacterial surface
The performed experiment confirm the functionality of the device including the tetracyclin repressed promoter, the secretion into the bacterial periplasm as well as the presentation of the protein cargon on the bacterial outer membrane. In agreement with the expectation the 62 kDa big scAvidin with its extremely strong fold is too big in size for the autotransporter and can not be presented on the bacterial surface. In contrast the smaller BAP-NanoLuc (19 kDa for the NanoLuc) or the eMA (15 kDa) both can be efficiently presented on the surface. The enzymatic biotinylation of the Biotin Acceptor Peptide (BAP"
HUST-China,2014,Team:HUST-China#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," the smeltery is finely treated in a water purification station. We also visited this station after visiting the core production zone. There are 2 steps of precipitation in this station. The waste water is treated here and then can be released to environment under checkpoint Q.C. standard.
The waste water containing copper was neutralized with calcarea and the insoluble neutralization product enriched onto the bottom of the precipitation pool, while the supernatant is believed to be safe for environmental release. The precipitation was collected and used for copper retrieve. We separately took samples of the neutralization solution and supernatant from the entry and the precipitation pool.
After the visiting, we sub-packaged the samples taken from the smeltery into test tubes, stored in -20℃, and used these samples for further analysis and biological water treatment tests.
We found that currently, the most widely used method of sewage treatment in China is Sedimentation and Filterability of Sludge. This traditional method, though has the advantage of low cost, wastes so much time and needs a large area for multilevel sedimentation treatments. However, since the development of biological technology, new methods and devices, such as bio-rotation containers and membrane bioreactors, have appeared. Because they have the benefits of effectively overcoming the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional activated sludge processes and no importing secondary chemical contamination, we are sure that they will be put into use universally in sewage treatment plants in the future.
Part 2: The human practice survey of our project
Introduction
China is a country that facing the problem of water resource shortage. There are 2800 billion cubic meters fresh water in China, which is 6% of the whole fresh water on earth. However, the average water resource per capita is only 2200 cubic meters, which is the 1/4 of the world standard and 1/5 of the US standard. China is one of the 13 countries that are most lack of water resource in the world.
If we take off the water resource that is hard to use, for example, flood and underground water in the remote area, the usable fresh water resource in China will reduce to 1100 billion cubic meters and the average water resource per capita will come to only 900 cubic meters. At the mean time, the distribution of fresh water resource in China is obviously disproportion. At the end of 20st century, in 600 cities of China, 400 cities have faced the problem of fresh water shortage and 110 cities in them were even in serious water shortage condition.

In order to create a more accurate test, we used a different method of detection. Our proposed kit relies on HIV viral DNA and utilizes protocols that can be replicated in low resource environments as well. In order to better understand the currents testing protocols in rural locations, we discussed with Dr. Leautaud (who works with Rice Global Health) and a research fellow, Jessie Anderson on the current conditions. After reviewing the issues faced by patients in these locations, we were better able to focus our project to handle the problems. We learned that the hospitals were regularly understaffed, and the hospitals in the area (district hospitals) did not have adequate resources in the lab either. According to Dr. Leautaud’s experience, “In Malawi, there is no lab. They had a separate room with a fridge, centrifuge, agar plates, did not have pipettes or a vortexer; Eppendorf tubes and gloves were scarce.” In order to corroborate her statements, we discussed with Jessie who stated, “The neonatal wards for both QECH and KCH seemed understaffed, even for this season which is not the busiest of the year. There were two short (10-30 seconds long) power outages within 20 minutes in the KCH ward. KCH had more equipment available to them than QECH (much more incubators, radiant warmers, blue-lights, etc; I think also a higher proportion of the room heaters was working), but the flow and size of space available seemed better at QECH. Still not ideal at either location.” Throughout our conversations, it became increasingly clear that local hospitals did not have any substantial equipment.'),     p('Additionally, when discussing with Dr. Leautaud, she mentioned that “One major problem in Africa or Malawi is that there is no communication and follow up with patients and the hospital, so even if a child is diagnosed the parent will not know. The hospitals don’t have the manpower to do that.” The mother’s that came to the hospitals often left soon after delivery, hence any testing results may not reach the mother, nor any future precautionary measures.  On top of short-staffed hospitals, many of the nurses or lab technicians that ran the test were not trained adequately. During discussions with Dr. Leautaud, she mentioned, “The nurse or lab technician, who is not as highly trained as they are in America. Instead, they have technical degrees. You need to teach"

Week 24: October 7 - October 11
New wetlab data has become available and we have resumed our modeling work. We are currently asking what concentrations we need to be playing with in the lab to see the response we want from Taylor's prussian blue ferritin. To do this we've been looking at differential equations that will show binding of our various TALEs to their DNA targets to form complexes of immobilized DNA (DNA + the TALE on the strip) and then the immobilized reporter (when the FerriTALE is exposed to the immobilized DNA). We can then use the constants Taylor elucidated for his prussian blue ferritin to calculate how quickly we hit the visible threshold.
Week 25: October 14 - October 18
The equations have been put together in a MATLAB clone called Scilab. We are currently looking for constants to plug into the model for the DNA interactions of the TALEs. We have the Kd values for the TALEs, but cannot find any literature relating to separating this into the forward and reverse reactions for TALEs. One thing we plan on doing is testing this to try and feed some data into the model, but haven't been able to do this yet due to lack of protein.
Week 26: October 21 - October 25
The model is ready to test with our experimental data. We were able to obtain the kinetic constants for our TALEs to plug into the model. We are able look at 6 variables in our model and test them over time to see how fast we can get a result in our system. The preliminary results show that our system should be able to give a visible response in a reasonable amount of time.

Experiment: 3A assembly of NTC resistance gene and Gibson Assembly.
The only interesting results from this Gel electrophoresis were C4,D1-D4,E2-E4.
The cultures for C4, (D2, D3?), E2, E3 where set to incubate O/N.
C: pCaMV+Nat1+CamC Term
D: pTrpC+Nat1+CamC Term
E: pGpdA+Nat1+CamC Term
Given the migration patterns on the gel, I suspect that the the C,D,E constructs are too short to have both the promoter, the NAT1 gene and the terminator. This can be investigated from the O/N cultures.
Concluding remarks: It seems that this round of gibson transformations was unsuccessful.

Three colonies of the latter were cultured in LB with kanamycin antibiotic. The pC13BF ligation created using the PpelA gel extract into DH5a E. coli was electroporated and plated on chloramphenicol plates. As the reference plates did not produce single colonies, we re-streaked PpkiA and TxlnD as well.

There weren’t any colonies of Psal, but there were a few colonies for the PtrpC + ‘’afp1’’ construct. We picked 3 to grow for sequencing. The reference plate colonies for pC13CY grew together and can’t be used. If sequencing comes back good for any one of the colonies, then we will need to re-transform. We cultured the pC13BF transformants and single colonies of ‘’PpkiA’’ and ‘’TxlnD’’. On carotenoids, we performed ligations from scratch for pAK13CS, pAK13AA, pC13DT, as well as putting ‘’PT7’’ and ‘’rbs’’ with ‘’crtEB’’, and ‘’PT7’’ with ‘’crtBI’’.
No colonies for ‘’Psal’’ grew, but a few for PtrpC and ‘’afp1’’ did and were cultured. Additionally, the reference plate for pC13CY is really messy. For the carotenoids pathway, we redid many of our ligations.

In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Part:BBa_K324003 - TetR repressible generator of LacI
This part combines two biobricks, a TetR repressible promoter+RBS (BBa_J13002) and the LacI regulatory protein in RFC25 assembly (BBa_K324000). This BioBrick allows the expression of LacI when inserted into E. coli, for the purpose of testing constructs controlled by the LacI promoter.
Design Notes
These parts were joined together with standard biobrick assembly, even though the LacI protein was in RFC25 and thus capable of protein fusion assembly as well.
Source
A simple Biobrick assembly was conducted to join the TetR promoter+RBS ( BBa_J13002 ) with LacI ( BBa_K324000 ). J13002 was obtained from the 2010 Spring Distribution, while K324000 was adapted by 2010 Brown iGEM from an existing part. See the part's page for further details
Part:BBa_K324004 - AraC inducible ChFP generator
This part combines two previously available BioBricks via standard assembly: a promoter inducible by AraC (BBa_R0080) and CherryFP generator (BBa_J06702). This composite acts a reporter in E. coli, allowing cells to produce cherry fluorescent protein in the presence of AraC protein. In the absence of AraC, minimal levels of fluorescence should be observed.
The cherry FP generator consists of an RBS, mCherry, and double terminator.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#landmines_-_-_TEXT.html," also available. For example, there is a tool sensor which uses a ground penetrating reader and a metal detector. The main disadvantage of the method represents the high costs, which makes it not widely used. Other experimental methods include the usage of bees and plants changing color in the presence of nitrogen. These experiments did not yield very positive results and therefore these methods are currently not in use.
For manual mine detection, metal detection methods are widely used. The Kampfmittelräumdienst uses a magnetometer when a certain area is suspected to contains bombs. They go over there to thoroughly search the area for bombs  “Magnetometers sense changes in field lines of the earth’s magnetic field due to the metal in the bomb. A larger bomb has more influence on the magnetic field, but depth, position and shape also matter.” When a signal is picked up, the metal object has to be dug up. The signal often does not match with what is found: “Sometimes you expect a hand grenade, and you find a 250 pound bomb!” However most of the times a suspicious signal just comes from an iron bar or something like that.
Yet, the use of a magnetometer pose several difficulties. Although, they can detect signals up to a depth of approximately 5 meters, much of the bombs lay at depths of around 10-15 meters and therefore cannot be found in this way. Lenz: “Although I’m not really convinced of the number, it is said that 30% of the bombs is missed by magnetometer searches.” “Current methods are not that satisfying that I can go to sleep well. Words like ‘maybe’ and ‘possibly’ are not in use by EOD specialists, because it is a matter of life and death.”
In addition, apart from the physical limitation imposed by the detection methods, when dealing with landmines clearance there are also several social limitations, including poor infrastructure and a low level of education of the local workers (mainly due to the fact they don’t have great exposure to technology).  Other problems are posed by the heavy machinery. Mr. Brady recalled cases in Angola, where the equipment was not able to arrive at the field. Also, the equipment consumes a lot of fuel and with metal detection battery life represents an issue. All these small things tend to become obstacles in the long-run.
On top of it all, the price for screening affected areas is very high, although the organizations are taking various measures to lower the price. Mr. Brady said that the price for screening the area is around $1 per square meter, including all the costs: logistics, administration costs,"

We have helped Taichung First Senior High School and Chung Cheng University set up their iGEM teams next year. (see Education )
Newsletter
This year, we were honored to take part in the Newsletter team collaboration edited by XMU-China iGEM team. We have penned an article in the Newsletter describing our project. (see the link for the Newsletter )
Survey Collaboration
International Survey aims to investigate the background knowledge of synthetic biology and the experience about genetic engineering across the world. There are 11 iGEM teams from different continents in the collaboration. The idea of the survey was first proposed by iGEM Aachen 2016, and fortunately, we had had online meetups in August. So we gladly accepted the offer as a principal team in Asia. We surveyed people on the street. Finally, we collected more than 500 samples and got some great result. Here are the teams that participate in the survey.
iGEM Team Aachen
iGEM Team Vilnius
iGEM Team NCTU Formosa
iGEM Team Graz
iGEM Team Linköping
iGEM Team TecCEM
iGEM Team Technion
iGEM Team Sheffield
iGEM Team Valencia
iGEM Team Delft
iGEM Team Dundee
Video Collaboration
Furthermore, we shot episodes to promote and discuss different topics, including “What is synthesis biology?” “Biosafety,” “How to share the things we develop?” and so on. The episodes then converge into one film Also, in the film, it integrates multicultural topics. The diversity of cultures is what we want to present in the film. The teams are from 5 countries including Germany, Mexico, Taiwan, England and Pakistan.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Merging Model_-_-_TEXT.html," we chose tflow as an upper limit of the time it requires for the droplets to pass through the coalescence chamber. The flow time is expressed as a ratio of channel volume to a unit-volume of fluid (total of the oil):
(31)
If the calculated time tcoal is longer than tflow, droplets will pass the coalescence chamber without fusion. That means if the droplets take a longer time to come together and merge then the time they spend in coalescence chamber, the merging will not occur. That is why we chose the tflow as the higher limit of allowed values.
Next, to find the lower limit must solve the different balance equation. We chose the lower limit as a time needed to remove the double volume of oil between two droplets. In other words, it is the situation where three droplets would merge instead of two. We express the volume of oil between three droplets as \(V_{oil}^{(limit)}=2 T_0 W_1 H\). This volume will be drained at the drainage flow rate. We then write the equation:
(32)
If the equation is True, three droplets will be fused together instead of two. Again, we need to limit our initially found tcoal values. Therefore, if the coalescence time of 3 droplets \(t_{coal}^{(3d)}\) is shorter than that of tcoal, we will find no pair-wise coalescence. The results are shown in Figure X below. The straight lines indicate the upper limit (time of the flow). The curves below are times for 3 droplet fusion. The points that are slightly below the curves for \(t_{coal}^{(3d)}\) represent the regions of stable 2 droplet coalescence with the 3 droplet coalescence time being longer \(t_{coal}^{(3d)} \gt t_{coal}\).
Figure 3. Droplet coalescence time dependence on fused droplet volume ratios at different applied voltage Uapp values. The black line displays tflow - the coalescence time limit, at which droplets leave the merging chamber without fusing. Dotted lines correspond to coalescence time limit tcoal(3d) at which coalescence of 3 droplets occurs. The points that are slightly below the curves for represent the regions of stable 2 droplet coalescence
In conclusion, we find there to be an optimal range of droplet volume ratios V2/V1 that allows stable effective 1:1 coalescence. Aprox"

Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries.        One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation        of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle       vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that        A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by        spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin).        These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and        even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and        capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE diagnostic and treatment pathway (in the case of NSCLC). [11]
The distribution of test values in the target population should be known and a suitable cut-off level defined and agreed.
There should be evidence from high quality randomized controlled trials that the screening programme is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity or evidence from high quality trials that the test accurately measures risk when helping a patient make an “informed choice”
Hennessey et al.’s cohort was not large enough for this to be conclusively known. [3] Further validation with a larger data set is required. The same is true for the links between miRNAs and disease more widely. However, preliminary results are promising. Our test would also need to undergo clinical trials - to test the efficacy of the toehold switches in measuring miRNA levels.
There should be evidence that the complete screening programme (test, diagnostic procedures, treatment/ intervention) is clinically, socially and ethically acceptable to health professionals and the public
To be clinically acceptable our test would need to to undergo large scale clinical trials. This would validate our research showing that it would be specific and cost effective. Socially and ethically, there should be no issues, for the same reasons as above.
The benefit gained should outweigh any harms from screening such as overdiagnosis, overtreatment, false positives, false reassurance, uncertain findings and complications.
The NLST showed 20% reduction in mortality with high risk screening for NSCLC using LDCT. Screening is therefore recommended in the US to high risk population groups. However, our test could prevent unnecessary further testing in many - and overdiagnosis could be reduced by examining the miRNA signature of the tumor. Furthermore, as mentioned in silver human practices , our test would not be offered as a conclusive diagnosis - only to rule out cancer in some and refer the others for further testing. There would also be psychological benefit using our test compared to existing methods in that a possible cancer could be ruled out far more quickly.
The screening programme should be economically balanced in relation to expenditure on medical care with regard to evidence from cost benefit and/or cost effectiveness analyses
We have created a cost effectiveness model - that works out who we should screen for the sensor to be cost effective and result in the cost per QALY being within NICE’s guidelines.
Clinical management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#InformedDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," infrastructure. We saw opportunities where cattle could theoretically be monitored on a single animal basis, but only at specific periods when they are processed for vaccines and checkups. During the tour, Dr. Behlke also showed how the feedlot has computerized systems to collect and assign data to individual animals.
We concluded that by combining these routine checkups with the animal information database, feedlots could monitor super shedders in individual animals. However, their feedback revealed three design considerations which we would have to incorporate into our prototype. First, it would have to be cheap so that it could be scaled-up to entire feedlots. Second, it would have to be easy to use by non-laboratory employees in feedlots. And third, it would have to provide a definitive measure of EHEC shedding levels within an hour to be used during routine check-up procedures.
From these three discussions, we incorporated feedback from critical beef stakeholders covering the complete beef cattle lifecycle. To ensure ease of use, we settled on constructing a prototype resembling a home pregnancy test, to give an easy to read visual yes or no answer as to whether an animal was a super shedder. We decided to make a DNA sensor. A DNA sensor is more reliable than a protein sensor, as proteins can get degraded during sample preparation. In addition, targeting proteins requires antibodies, which dramatically increase the cost of our system. Our team decided to use an in-vitro based sensor, using components extracted from cells, to make the system more portable and reliable in the field. Our selection of common paper materials for the prototype was also influenced on the low cost to build.
Other ""Steak"" holders
We believed that we were on the right track to developing something of relevance to the beef cattle industry. But we still questioned whether it would be wise to monitor E. coli in individual animals. It was apparent that because of the density of cattle in feedlots, super shedding from a few animals in the pen would expose all neighbouring animals to higher levels of this pathogen.
To answer these questions, we engaged a company called Bioniche , a manufacturer of a bovine E. coli O157 vaccine. We spoke to Rick Culbert, the President, and Susan Goebel, the E. coli project manager, about where they saw our ideas fitting into the industry. These individuals have worked tirelessly to bring their vaccine to market and are experts in management of E. coli prior to slaughter.
This meeting was critical because they revealed the broader implications which our E. coli monitoring tool could have in the livestock industry. We learned that approximately one-third of E. coli O157 illness"

We should emphasize that these de novo parts were built from scratch, and the part BBa_K1378005 , BBa_K1378007 and BBa_K1378025 have experimental data available both on our wiki: https://2014.igem.org/Team:Peking/Parts and on part registry pages.
We also used parts BBa_K554009 , BBa_K523013 BBa_K208006 from iGEM Part Distribution and further distribution directly from the Registry. These parts have played important roles in the killing and its improvement parts of our project.
2.Team communication
The significance of team interactions has long been recognized by Peking iGEM and this year our team members and instructors had visited several other teams and was involved in a regional Jamboree-like iGEM Club in Wuhan this summer. https://2014.igem.org/Team:Peking/TeamCommunication
Furthermore, we have helped other teams in this summer, including BIT, BNU, and OUC-China. https://2014.igem.org/Team:Peking/Mutualfacilitation We also received help from ZJU-China that they helped us to transfer specific genes into E. coli’s genome. We also helped two high school students from Beijing Huiwen Middle School and Beijing No.4 High School.
3.Investigation beyond bench
Holding the belief that responsive research lies beyond lab bench, we visited Taihu Lake in July to investigate the algal bloom there. We interviewed the researchers in NIGLAS(Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences)who monitoring the algal bloom there and we sampled the water in the Taihu Lake and brought these samples back to our lab. https://2014.igem.org/Team:Peking/FieldInvestigation

Kent,2015,Team:Kent#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"ences in 2011. He was born in England, was brought up in North Wales, and subsequently studied Biochemistry at the University of Sheffield (1996-1999). He stayed in the Department of Molecular Biology & Biotechnology to undertake a PhD with Professor Neil Hunter FRS (1999-2003), where he developed his interest in the enzymology and spectroscopy of chlorophyll and haem biosynthesis. After completing his PhD studies, he conducted postdoctoral research with Prof. Harry Dailey at the University of Georgia (2003-2005), where his research focussed on the terminal enzymes of haem biosynthesis. This was followed by a move back to the University of Sheffield in 2005 to take up a postdoctoral position with Prof. Robert Poole, where he developed interests in E. coli respiration, globin proteins, and the response of bacteria to nitric oxide. A subsequent position at the University of Queensland (2010-2011) with Prof. Mark Schembri focussed on nitric oxide stress in Uropathogenic E. coli.
In 2011 Mark moved to the University of Kent, where he is a Lecturer in Microbial Biochemistry and a member of the Microbial Pathogenesis Group .
Dr Gianluca Marcelli
Dr Gianluca Marcelli is a lecturer in the School of Engineering and Digital Arts. In the last 9 years of his research career he has been developing mathematical models for biological systems. He helped the modeling team and it was his idea to create a Monte Carlo simulation.
Dr Mark Wass
Mark joined the School of Biosciences in October 2012. He obtained his first degree in Natural Sciences at Cambridge University in 2000 followed by a Masters in Computing at Imperial College London. After a few years working in Industry as an IT consultant Mark studied for a PhD with Prof Mike Sternberg at Imperial (2004-2008) and continued onto a post-doctoral position in the group until 2011. In 2011 Mark was awarded a FEBS Long Term Fellowship to work in the group of Alfonso Valencia at the CNIO (Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, Madrid, Spain).
Mark's research interests are in Structural Bioinformatics particularly the analysis and prediction of protein function, structure and interactions. He is also interested in using such approaches to analyse genetic variation and identify the functional effects that are associated with disease.
Mark is a member of the Cytogenomics and Bioinformatics Group ."
