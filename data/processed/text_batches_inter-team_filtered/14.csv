CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," of 5 year survival rates of stages 2-4 and for cases were stage was unknown. [21]
The cost of a false positive was taken as the cost of a contrast enhanced chest CT scan (£359 [19] ), plus the cost of the test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110) as it would be done for 6 years - as that would be the follow up of a positive result of our test. We assumed that all patients with a false positive would subsequently have their cancer ruled out by a CT. Previous screening trials have showed that other procedures are needed, sometimes bronchoscopy, or a false positive proceeding all the way to surgery and treatment. However, we believe a CT in combination with our test would rule out nearly all false positives (especially if several miRNAs were used in tandem to look at the properties of the ‘tumor’ in a subsequent test) - and the probability of a patient having further measures taken would likely be negligible. There is also no data available to quantify this additional cost.
The cost of treatment in stage 1 is £8000 and in stage 4 is £10,050. [19] We used the cost at stage 4 as the upper bound of the cost for stages 2-4. Similar to before, this is likely to decrease were a large scale screening trial to take place and figures for individual stages used - as cost of treatment in stage 2 is far lower than stage 4. [19] We assumed the cost of unsuccessful treatment in stage 1 was the same as the cost of successful treatment in stage one plus average cost of treatment in the other stages - as if treatment is unsuccessful in stage one, a patient is likely to have their tumor progress to later stages. The cost of treatment in stage 4 is not dependent on success as the treatment is just palliative care.
We ignored the cost of recurrence of a cancer - recurrences in cancer are complex and cannot be easily modelled. Furthermore, the earlier the cancer is detected, the lower the chace of recurrence. This means our sensor that can detect NSCLC at stage 1 would drastically reduce this cost.
As Tammemägi gave the probability of cancer in the next 6 years we calculated the cost effectiveness of screening each year for the next 6 years. Hence the cost of 6 true negatives is the cost of our test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110).
Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in"

Interview
Our integrated Human Practices try to integrate our efforts into the practical aspects of our project, and have an influence upon our design decisions. We attempted to engage with potential users to better understand their needs, ranging from safety to access, to inform their technical design criteria.
To determine how our project can be used and who will be using it in order to assess its impact on society, we have connected with and conduct research among those work in laboratories, factories or companies which might use the engineered bacteria in researches or production process.
BluePHA
We chatted with the CEO of BluePHA, Li Teng, and explained our project, with the goal of collecting information on what is the most important thing to be considered in companies and to tailor our project for industry. BluePHA is a biotechnological corporation that masters the leading technology of using special bacteria to produce a low-cost biosynthetic biodegradable material, PHA. Dr. Li told us that extreme microorganism is actually a hot issue as many researchers are trying to find out useful bacterial species with proper characteristics and their specific applications. In fermentation processes with these extreme microorganism as the bioreactors, it is less likely to face with the problem of contamination. However, when talking about the application prospects of our project, he admitted that our robust E.coli is supposed to be more universal because the things we work on can also be applied to other species for the production of various bio-products. Plus, they are still no solution to tackle the problem of phage infection. Meanwhile, it is suggested that we should figure out how serious the contamination problem is among the practical process, from lab scale to full production scale.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli Top10 appeared to be    successful. The samples 2, 5, 6 and 7 showed the right size of band.    These samples were used to obtain the plasmid from an overnight culture.
Validation
Experiment:
29/09/16: Grown cultures of E. coli Top10 with RBS+nucA in pSB1C3 were    used to obtain the glycerol stocks and plasmid isolation was    performed (QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit) . Firstly, concentration of the plasmids    obtained was measured on Nanodrop. Secondly, plasmids were sent for    sequencing and then stored at -20°C.
Sequencing:
Plasmids RBS+nucA in pSB1C3 from colonies 2, 5, and 7 were sent for sequencing with the sequencing primers VF2 and VR. (See primer list ).
Conclusion:
Sequencing results showed that the nucA was cloned in the pSB1C3    backbone but the RBS was missing and the suffix was also incorrect. See    Figure 4. The nucA (BBa_K729004) received from the iGEM headquarters was    sent for sequencing as well. It turned out that the part BBa_K729004    does have the nucA gene but the prefix and suffix are incorrect . See    sequencing results in Figure 5 to 7.
Figure 4. Sequencing result of the RBS+nucA in pSB1C3     for sample 5, 7 and 9. nucA can be seen in pink. The prefix is     marked in red.
Figure 5. Sequencing result of the BBa_K729004 aligned     with the nucA gene.
Figure 6. Sequencing result of the BBa_K729004 aligned     with the prefix.
Figure 7. Sequencing result of the BBa_K729004 aligned     with the suffix.
Experiments
We wanted to improve the BBa_K729004 part by giving it the correct prefix and suffix. Unfortunately we did not succeed to complete this task.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," in the cell steadily             increases even though no AHL was added, which means that the leakiness of the promoter is creating more AHL,             which then induces the promoter in a positive feedback loop. Since the purpose of the Sensing module is to respond             to an AHL signal before amplifying it, this is not an acceptable behavior of the system.
4.2 Simulation with asRNA
In the next simulation, we add asRNA. First, we will show simulation results for two levels of concentration, with             one high enough to activate the positive feedback loop, and the other being too low.
Fig. 3 Simulation with asRNA with [AHL]extracellular = 0 M
Fig. 4 Simulation with asRNA with [AHL]extracellular = 10−5M
Note that to show the relative concentration diﬀerences between the simulation with and without asRNA, we used             the same values for [mRNA]const , [GFP]const , and [AHL]const , setting them as the constitutively produced             concentrations in the simulation without asRNA.
The ﬁgure on the left shows a simulation from an initial AHL concentration of 0, while the right uses an initial             concentration of 10−5 M. As can be seen, the concentration remains low for the ﬁrst simulation, and             rises to an eventual plateau for the second as expected for the module.
The production of mRNA in the left graph can be attributed to the leakiness of the promoter. Meanwhile, the slightly             higher value in the middle of the simulation for [AHL] in the right graph can be attributed to the lower net             diﬀusion due to external AHL concentration. As the extracellular AHL gradually degrades, the intracellular concentration             also gradually decreases, but always remains at least the constitutively produced level with asRNA.
The following figure shows the AHL concentration for each initial concentration after 200 minutes. For the simulation with asRNA, as can be seen             from the graph, the eventual concentrations will have a sharp increase as AHL level increases to more than around             10−8 M.  This behavior suggests that the module has concentrations where it is on or oﬀ which is desirable             in a sensor to respond to changes in AHL . Meanwhile, without asRNA, the response concentration of AHL is at a             high value for most initial concentrations, which would hamper its function as a sensor. Both concentrations increase             when extracellular [AHL] increases above 10−7, which can be attributed to the"

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#team#bios_-_-_TEXT.html," and Maxim's Hot 100, Jim seamlessly integrates his wizardry in chemical engineering and applied economics into a leader's conviction that's not to be taken lightly.
Jim has been especially prolific the past couple of years. He coined the acronym YOLO after wrestling black bears on one of his favorite morning hikes in the great outdoors. As an esteemed member of the Cornell Consulting Group, Jim personally advised Carly Rae Jepsen to append ""maybe"" to her signature call phrase, single-handedly launching her path to fame. He founded the student organization ""Nebraskans at Cornell,"" for which he juggles all the responsibilities as president, treasurer, social chair, and...sole member.
Sorry, ladies, but this bro's heart already belongs to a special someone.
Eric Morris
From an early age, Eric wanted to be a cyborg. In summer 2011, he achieved this goal through the use of a zero point module and some custom-designed recursive nanobots. Now that he's done it, though, life is a little different. Editing HTML and writing regular expressions is a breeze, but visual pattern-recognition has definitely taken a hit. Dreaming in XML has its advantages; it facilitates storage and playback of Eric's dreams on most video-enabled devices. However, it means Eric's rapid eye movement during sleep occasionally undergoes catastrophic subtraction. Try not to be in the room when that happens, because it can cause a bit of a shockwave.
Claire Paduano
One day, Claire met the Energizer Bunny and decided that she wanted to be better than him. So she sat up, jumped out of her crib and got to work. Ever since that fateful day, Claire has conquered every obstacle in her path. Whether it’s imaging mouse brains, dancing on Sitara, solving Quantum Electrodynamics problems or saving Cornell iGEM from certain doom, Claire can do it all.
Shweta Patro
Not much can be said about Shweta – her radiance can only be captured through the joyous harmonies of pop music. After all, she lights up our world like nobody else. The way she flips her hair gets us overwhelmed. Our princess of vlogging, our proponent of public education, and Swati’s beloved twin, she comes with only one disclaimer: after midnight, nothing that she says can be held against her. If only we were her boyfriend, we’d never let her go.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," transformed with the extracted plasmids of the selected clones.
In order to investigate, whether the observed swimming behavior was related to the vector containing the mutagenized tar or the cells themselves, the isolated and sequenced plasmids were transformed into fresh BL21 cells and applied to a new swimming/chemotaxis assay. Additionally to the respective attractant, the effect of L-aspartate  and H2Odd was evaluated. In general, the observed halos of the fresh transformed cells were smaller than the ones of the selected clones every time (Figure 2C). Thus, it can be concluded that the cells themselves were also selected for faster swimming abilities.  L-aspartate  also was an attractant for nearly every clone and the halos were never reduced significantly in size when H2Odd was applied to the Whatman paper.
Separation Assay and RFP-interference
One of the aims of group one was to invent an assay that enables us to separate two strains from each other that have grown and swam together in a mixed culture.  This would be especially beneficial for the determination of the effect of the promoter strength for a tar insert in a vector or to determine whether an attractant affects two different strains in a different way.
In the beginning, it was planned to conduct the separation of the strains via the strong overexpression of RFP of one strain whereas the other strain would not express RFP. The ratio between the red and the white colonies would give us information about the distribution of the different strains in one swimming halo. After the first round of cloning the RFP gene and the tar inserts were on different vectors containing different antibiotic resistances. Therefore, a separation via the resistance marker seemed to be more plausible.
The separation assay described in the methods section was conducted multiple times and in many different variations, but the achieved outcomes were contradictory (no data shown).
In some cases when the agar from the middle of the drop was cut out a much higher number of colonies of the non RFP expressing strain was counted, even though the strains were mixed in the same ratio and thus should be present in the same amount. It was suspected that the expression of RFP contributes to the optical density value measured at a wavelength of 600 nm. Consequently a much higher OD600 value is measured than is actually proportional to the number of cells in the culture. Some experiments were conducted to determine the influence of the RFP expression on the OD600 value. Because of the time limit no statistically significant values could be gained and the achieved data is not shown.  Further experiments have to be conducted to determine the RFP interference"
Edinburgh,2015,Team:Edinburgh#DNPBiosensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"ensor and is freeze-dried onto paper. A dark blue colour in the control will appear as soon as the biosensor is rehydrated. A difference in the blue colour between the two biosensors will indicate the presence of DNP. In the presence of DNP, the colour change will be slower and produce a much lighter blue, which when read with a spectrophotometer at 420 nm has a lower absorbance than the control. This is also a binary detection which should be visible with the naked eye.
For our biosensor, it was essential to experimentally determine the optimal amount of laccase and ABTS to freeze-dry onto the paper, as well as the concentration of enzyme which would  produce a colour change visible enough for our app to detect. Immobilised laccase shows better activity and it is more stable than free enzyme over a time period5.
The laccase we are using is a copper-dependent tvel5 laccase from Trametes versicolor encoded by the gene lccl. To make our fusions compatible, we used biobrick assembly standard RFC25 6. The RFC25 prefix and suffix were added to the gene and all illegal restriction sites (EcoRI, SpeI, AgeI, NotI, NgoMIV and XbaI) were removed. The sequence was codon optimised and ordered as a gBlock. It was then digested and ligated into the pSB1C3 backbone and transformed into an Escherichia coli chassis.

Phytoremediation
What it´s all about
Figure 1: Plants can internalize pollutants dissolved in water [ The Guardian, 2011 ]
Today science and technology are eager to protect the environment from further harm and reverse the damage already done. Of these technologies, bioremediation and phytoremediation in particular are very promising ones as they try to help nature help itself. Bioremediation is defined as ""the process of judiciously exploiting biological processes to minimize an unwanted environmental impact; usually it is the removal of a contaminant form the biosphere."" [ Prince, 2000 ] Phytoremediation is the concept of removing pollutans either directly by plants themselves or by specialized bacteria living in a symbiosis with plants.  There is a multitude of different pollutants that are primary targets for remediation such as Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), insecticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), heavy metals such as cadmium or mercury or pharmaceutical products such as macrolide antibiotics, diclofenac or ethinylestradiol.

Without their help, we are not able to read our results in a critical way and develop good habits of researching.
They also contributed us 1.5 ml of chloromycetin which make our bacteria culture much more easier.
With CIEI-BJ
Collaborating with CIEI has solved our problem with Giant Jamboree participation. Also, team CIEI has given us a chance to have companies at the same age. This time, we had not only accepted helps from other teams, we had also helped team CIEI to find hotels that are more convenient and economical.
Despite their contribution to our Giant Jamboree participation, CIEI also helped us with approving us to use the lab at the Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. With their advanced equipment, we got our final succeed. At their lab, they did the PCR amplification of Orai1 for us and provided the reagents needed for digestion and ligation (e.g. the plasmid pSB1C3, Phusion DNA polymerase, Taq DNA polymerase, PCR purification kit, gel purification kit).  Thanks for their generosity and patience, we had really enjoyed the competition!"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," us from wasting time on testing crRNA 5 in the lab. This is also the reason why we will not consider crRNA 5 in the remainder of the simulations.
Figure 4: Cas13a cleavage probability (relative to on-target) along the sequence of a tetracycline resistance conferring (TcR) plasmid. Cas13a activation on TcR plasmid for crRNA 1 to 5 ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). Figures a-e display the predicted relative probability of cleavage of Cas13a on every position along the TcR plasmid. crRNAs 1-4 clearly showed the designed on-target hit approximately at position 1750. crRNA 5 only shows off-target activity, indicating a design flaw that prevented us from wasting time on testing crRNA 5 in the lab. A) crRNA 1. B) crRNA 2. C) crRNA 3. D) crRNA 4. E) crRNA 5.
By summing the $\mathcal{R}$, the cleavage probability relative to the on-target, over all off-target positions on the plasmid, we compute the $P_{FP}$, the probability of a false positive output, provided that there is a positive output:
$$ P_{FP} = \frac{ \sum _{\textrm{off target}}\mathcal{R} }{\sum_{\textrm{off target}}\mathcal{R} + \sum_{\textrm{on target}}\mathcal{R}} = \frac{1}{1+ \frac{\sum_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}} \tag{8}$$
Computing $P_{FP}$ for crRNA 1-4 (Figure 5) shows that crRNA 3 has the lowest probability of yielding a false-positive result on the TcR plasmid, i.e. being activated by a non-target site on the plasmid: 1 in 100 billion. Interestingly, experiments in the lab show that Cas13a also performs highest collateral cleavage activity when loaded when crRNA 3.

Analytical digestion and gelelectroph"
York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Notebook.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"lyA can transport small peptides outside bacteria (though our initial in silico simulations show the peptidic construct would not be very stable). We might need a special E.coli strain if we work with it. pelB is good for small peptides, easy to use and we have an available vector for it. Another option is to have a poly-peptide, made with the A3, nanoparticle-producing peptide, rather than MIDAS. This poly-A3 would be secreted and cleaved outside of the bacteria; this method would give more stability to the system.
Need to look more into:
        ● Physiology of bacteria in the MFC
        ● What we will compare (e.g. two MFC, one improved and one normal)
        ● We need to design a good, simple end-assay, which will allow us to test the effect of our peptide on electricity production even if the rest of the system does not work/is not ready yet (e.g., he suggests putting the peptide in Shewanella, if we're not ready closer to the finish, and show it produces NP in Shewanella).
June 5th
After exams, we divided into four groups and started doing extensive reading on genes, to start preparing the gene sequences we need to order. Ric, Hannah, Becca and Andra are looking into the gold sensing system existing in Salmonella, GolTS. Alex, Evaldas and Jonas are looking into peptide design and secretion. Ivan, Nick and Andy are looking into modelling and identifying genes in the iGEM Registry. Kobchai, Caroline and Rudolfs are looking into the quorum sensing system and system regulation as a whole.
Notable things so far: some of the sequences for the pGolTS system submitted by other teams to the Registry seem to be wrong; we need to look more into it during the following week.
We might use some of the parts from team Edinburgh, which were not submitted last year, but which they can send to us, for the mtr complex.
June 12th
Evaldas, Kobchai and Andra gave a presentation on what has been done so far.  Andy talked about the modelling he worked on, using the kinetic values obtained from scientific papers. . We need to look more into the details of the MFC we are planning on making, in particular what buffers we are planning on keeping the bacteria in,  whether we will grow the bacteria in an aerobic or anaerobic environment and what bacterial strains to choose.

Our ‘stress bacteria’ will enable us to identify substances that can enhance the effect of existing medicines or create entirely new ones. This means we can outsmart the                                                     resistant bacteria.
With your support we want to tackle the global issue of antibiotic resistance, take home the grand prize in Boston and put Leiden University on the map as a world-class university. Our                                                     project                                                     is part of ongoing research within the university and will be continued when we achieve promising results, even if we do not win in Boston.
Our project requires funding to buy lab materials,                                                     chemicals, and a lot of DNA. You can decide to what extent you want to support us in the battle against antibiotic resistance. Pick the colour of stress you want to expose resistant                                                     bacteria                                                     to and together we will defeat them.

Dear reader, thank you for subscribing to our monthly newsletter. Via this platform we will keep you up to date on our project: Fifty Shades of Stress!
Our progress in the lab!
August already marked our last month of full time lab work in our ‘own’ lab, so we made the most of it.
Maaike and Lotte were able to amplify the SoxS stress-signal - which responds to DNA damage - by fusing multiple SoxS-GFP combinations together. Consequently, Tim and Carli, our validation team,                                                     confirmed that all these strains worked, and at a much higher                                                     efficiency than our previous singular SoxS-GFP strains. Additionally, Laurens made progress on enhancing the GFP signal using a different system called: T7, while helping others in the lab as our                                                     interim-Science manager.

We sent 7 colonies for sequencing to determine whether the dCas9 system is present in Plasmid 1. We ran the digestions from Monday on an analytical gel and got two bands: <1 kb and ~ 5 kb. We were expecting bands of <1 kb and ~9 kb, so we are wondering if there is some contamination. We had our biweekly meeting with Dr. Salis and Dr. Richard and discussed the meaning of these conflicting bands.
Rescue PCR was done again to make sure that we had enough gBlock since we have been using them to re-do failed reactions. Updated website attributions page. Project page created for codon optimization project. Inverse PCR on pFTV accomplished using new reverse inverse PCR primer. Inverse PCR and Rescue PCR products ran in gel, excised and purified. Digestions with Pst1 and Cla1 ran overnight.

Sequencing results were supposed to arrive but had to be re-run. Emily and Ashlee finished the demo and updated the Prezi. Iman ordered new dCas9 primers, truncating them to remove the CBAR overlaps. Hopefully if this was the problem we will have more success.
Sam inoculated thirty (30) cultures, six from each GFP variant, so that they could be miniprepped the next day.

Ashlee finalized the Prezi. Sequencing results are still delayed.
All of the cultures grew. Each culture was streaked on a plate to save it for further analysis if needed. Three rounds of miniprep were done in order to ensure that the lysis reaction did not occur for longer than 2-3 minutes per sample.

Unlike NhaA, the activity of NhaB shows no dependence on pH in the range 6.4-8.3. The affinity of NhaB to Na+ ions (Km = 40-70μM) is higher than that of NhaA.[9]
Design
The gene circuits of the alkali-resistance device is shown in Fig.3. This device consists of two genes and two promoters. The strong constitutive promoter J23119 is used in our gene circuit. In order to resist alkaline stress, we chose two of Nha sodium-proton anti-porter proteins referred before to construct device one. NhaA could make sure E.coli’s survival under alkaline pH. NhaB regulates intracellular pH when NhaA is limited. But NhaB is weakly pH-dependent, so a alkali-induced promoter J23119 is necessary. The construction has been finished .
Fig.3 gene circuit.
Result
Firstly, we obtained the genes, NhaA (BBa_K1) and NhaB (BBa_K2), through PCR. The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of gene NhaA and NhaB is shown in Fig.4.
Secondly, we assembled the standard part J23119+B0034+NhaA(BBa_K3, JBA) and J23119+B0034+NhaB(BBa_K4, JBB). The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of JBA and JBB is shown in Fig.5 and Fig.6.

Conclusion
Introduction
glsA is a kind of glutaminase gene in E.coli functioning at acidic pH ranges[12]. glsA gene encodes glutaminase A(GlsA)[13] which can transform glutamine(Gln) and water into glutamate(Glu) and ammonium[14]. GlsA is activated in acidic environment, and exhibits robust glutaminase activity only at pH 6.0 or lower. The highest activity of GlsA is obtained at pH 4.0, followed by pH 5.0 and 6.0. In contrast, at the pH 7.0 and 8"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three E. coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by replacing the IPTG detector part of the Sensynova design with different detecting parts. In particular, an Arsenic sensing part will be used.
Background Information
The part BBa_J33201 was made by the Edinburgh team in 2006.
Figure 1: BBa_J33201 design.
This part consists of the promoter of the E. coli JM109 chromosomal arsenic detoxification operon (ars operon), including the ArsR repressor binding site and the arsR gene encoding the arsR repressor protein, together with its ribosome binding site. Addition of any other genes to the 3' end of this part will result in their expression being dependent on the presence of sodium arsenate or sodium arsenite. Arsenite or arsenite anion binds to the repressor protein ArsR, resulting in inability to repress the promoter. Based on Edinburgh's 2006 team experiments, a concentration of 1 micromolar sodium arsenate in LB is sufficient for essentially full expression, though this will vary according to conditions.
Design Stage
In order to introduce the Arsenic sensing part in the Sensinova framework, the part BBa_K2205008 containing the RBS B0034, the lasI coding sequence and the double terminator B0015 has been included in the design. The new part BBa_K2205022 presents biobrickable suffix and prefix and has been designed to have specific overhangs to be assembled in the plasmid pSB1C3 by Gibson assembly method.
Figure 2: The new part BBa_K2205022 based on the previous Arsenic detector design BBa_J33201 , implemented by the Sensynova part coding for the connector 1, BBa_K2205008 .
Figure 3: The expression vector pSB1C3 with BBa_K2205022 . (click on the plasmid to enlarge it).
Implementation
The part has been obtained by gBlock synthesis from IDT and subsequently assembled into the plasmid using NEB HI-Fi kit. The assembly mix was heat-shock transformed in competent DH5α and plated on Chloramphenicol LB plates. The colonies were tested through colony PCR"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," terminal electron acceptor and PBS buffer to maintain the pH constantly at 7 throughout the cell’s operation. We needed a proton-selective membrane to separate the anode and cathode compartments so that the circuit may be completed by the transfer of H+ ions from the anode to the cathode without allowing for the direct reduction of the terminal electron acceptor. For this, we chose to use a Nafion membrane due to its highly selective nature and efficiency in proton exchange.
Figure 3 Experimental MFC set-up
With the microbial fuel cell assembled and the bacteria introduced into the anode chamber, we began a series of tests to determine our output potential. The results of which are elaborated here .

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#sRNA_-_-_TEXT.html," of Hfq is then:
Applying a quasi-steady state approximation on the last three equations in the model yields a system of linear equations:
Or, equivalently:
This system has least-squares solution:
We can then substitute these expressions into the first two equations of the model to (ultimately) arrive at a reduced model. After simplification:
Where, Vm = k3, K1 = k3/k2 and Km = (k-1k3) / (k1k2). We could use this simplified model to explore a phase space, however, it is much more valuable to explore the steady state behaviour of the model.
Inspired by [20], where the authors examined the steady state concentration of target mRNA exposed to sRNA regulation as a function of sRNA transcription, we also seek the steady state concentration of mRNA. The major difference is that the steady state expression of mRNA in this case will be controlled by two expressions, those of Hfq as well as sRNA, as opposed to simply sRNA. In our simplified model, it can be shown that this steady state concentration  of mRNA obeys the cubic equation:
Where:
The solutions of this equation describe how the expression rates of Hfq and sRNA control the steady state concentration of target mRNA.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.

We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

Since this combinatorial approach requires the cloning of large plasmid libraries and hundreds of cotransformations, we established HiCT: High-throughput protocols for circular polymerase extension Cloning and Transformation (please find more information on HiCT on our RFC99 Page ) based on CPEC assembly [11]. Moreover, we modeled the indigoidine production of our constructs (please find more detailed information on our Indigoidine Production Model Page )

Expression of Indigoidine Synthetase IndC in Five Substrains of E. coli
The open reading frame of the native indigoidine synthetase indC was amplified from genomic DNA of P. lumninescens laumondii TT01 (DSM15139) and cloned into a pSB1C3 derived plasmid under the control of an lac-inducible promoter. This indC expression cassette was transformed into different substrains of E. coli, namely DH5alpha, MG1655, BAP1, TOP10 and NEB Turbo. All of these host strains were previously transformed with a pSB3K3 derived expression plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp from B. subtilis, which is commonly used in NRPS studies. As depicted in Fig. 3a , Sfp is able to activate the T-domain of indC as determined by the blue phenotype of the transformed cells. Except for NEB Turbo cells, all transformed host strains displayed a decellerated growth and significantly smaller colonies on plate when compared to the E. coli TOP10 negative control. The blue phenotype developed late after transformation ranging from first blue colonies after 24 h and taking up to three days for visible poduction of the blue pigment. NEB Turbo showed regular colony growth and developed a strong blue phenotype upon induction with IPTG. As all host strains were able to express the functional indigoidine sythetase IndC, further experiments were only conducted with one E. coli strain. Due to its simplicity in handling and sufficient expression of the constructs, the substrain TOP10 was chosen.
Figure 3: Comparison between different E. coli strains and PPTases: a) Comparison of different E. coli strains examining growth and indigoidine production The figure shows five different strains of E. coli that have been co-transformed with an indC expression plasmid and a sfp expression plasmid.

The contents of the conical tubes should be transferred into small glass containers and the tubes autoclaved/reused. Gloves arrived today, needed materials need to be updated and immediately communicated to Courtney. Rafferdy got back to Cara and has TLC plates for her to use. TLC standards worked yesterday, solvent used was 85:15:3 chloroform, methanol, acetic acid. Reverse phase was tried as well. 10mL of solvent was used, 250mL of solvent was made which should last a while. All reagents were received from MMG. Gels were ran to check whether PCR worked last night, PCR might have worked. The gels need to be extracted and sequenced in order to check whether it worked. IDT will be e-mailed/called to separate the orders of scaffold and primers due to delay of the scaffold production. 5mg of piceattanol and 100mg of resveratrol are in the inventory. All piceattanol contents were resuspended in ethanol. Resveratrol will be diluted as well in some solvent. Starting fermentation is the next step. Bob plated some things for Asha after transformation. Sponsors were also added to the Wiki and the lab notebook section was updated. Meeting with Melissa will be held by the end of the week. WashU credited UIUC coding done by Bob for the Wiki!!
Thursday, 7/12/12  - Divya - Isiah got the cultures out. Talked to Jin and it turns out that we actually need to wait until the alkanes arrive to use them as a standard for GCMS. Talked to the GCMS lady about conditions. Divya will look up the info and email it to the lady to create the standard curve. Either tomorrow or monday results will occur. On next Monday, will begin helping with cloning.  - Asha - transformation of YFP ligation didn’t work, so replated. Also another ligation with only a 5:1 insert:vector ratio. Also went to the art department to ask about filming equipment for human practices. The checkout counter wasn’t open, but got an email to contact.  - Anthony - failed transformation from yesterday so replated. Also transformed again with a different ligation.

1.1 Experiments
2 Other glues we considered:
2.1 Caulobacter cresentus
2.2 Spidersilk glue:
2.3 References:
Levan
Bacillus subtilis 168 plated on 10% sucrose agar plates produces levan, a long chain polysaccharide made from sucrose monomers. The reaction is catalysed by levansucrase, an extracellular enzyme, which is a product of the sacB gene. It is normally regulated at the transcriptional level by a terminator sequence 5' of the RBS which, in low sucrose concentrations, prevents transcription of the gene. However in high sucrose conditions sucrose is believed to bind to this terminator sequence and disrupt it, allowing transcription.
The function of levan in Bacillus subtilis is unknown, but it is believed to be involved in cell signalling with other microorganisms or plants.
We designed a part that would place levan production under our control. This is BBa_K302030 on the parts registry .
Experiments
We grew our Bacillus subtilis 168 cells on sucrose and they produced levan.
We covered the levan in sand and it formed the letters in our iGEM plates below.
Other glues we considered:
Caulobacter cresentus
ULB-Brussels developed BioBricks for production of Caulobacter crescentus glue, and won the Best New BioBrick Part, Natural award in 2009. Caulobacter crescentus is a Gram-negative bacterium, and the parts are optimised for E. coli. Unclear whether they will work in B. subtilis.
Genes: hfsE, hfsF, hfsG, hfsH, (hfsC), hfsI, hfsD, (hfsA, hfsB).
The inner membrane HfsE protein initiates glycosyltransferase by transferring N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) from UDP−NAG to a lipid carrier. HfsG, a second glycosyltransferase protein, transfers NAG subunits to the growing polysaccharide chain. HfsH deacetylates one or more NAG residues"
USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"1 and figure 2, we find that the maximal GFP concentration ranges from 0 to about 2000 nM with the increase of nicotine input. However, the strength of promoter 1 has no significant impact on the GFP maximal concentration. The heat-map shows that when nicotine input is lower than 3.5e-5 M, the GFP concentration is relative low and undetectable.
In experiment, we use microplate reader to detect the fluorescence intensity of GFP. So the specificity and threshold are restricted by the detection limit and specificity of the device in fact. To fit the real condition in experiment, we need to convert GFP concentration (nM) to fluorescence intensity (au). According to the work of 2016 William and Mary iGEM team, we can build up the function between GFP concentration and fluorescence intensity like this:
Equation 1 GFP concentration to relative intensity conversion
We define fluorescence intensity more than 100 a.u. as significant result because the data of our interlab shows that the basal fluorescence of medium is about 60 a.u. under the same excitation wavelength light. This requirement determines a detection limit of GFP concentration. The lowest of nicotine concentration to be detected is decided in turn:
Equation 2 GFP concentration detection limit
Figure 3 Relative intensity heat-map
Figure 4 Contour line of relative intensity
To get the value of fluorescence intensity of GFP, we transform the simulation data from GFP concentration (nM) to relative intensity (a.u.). Figure 3 shows the change tendency of GFP fluorescent intensity which is similar to the condition of GFP. To identify the boundary of relative intensity 100 a.u., we draw the contour line of 100 a.u. intensity. From the contour line (Figure 43), we find the when nicotine input is less than 1e-3.6 M, the relative intensity is lower than 100 a.u. and the result is not significant enough according to the criteria mentioned above.
In conclusion, the threshold of our sensing system is above 1e-3.6 M nicotine and the threshold does not strongly shift with the decline of promoter 1 strength.
Sensitivity analysis
Last section, we talk about the threshold of the sensing system which is related to the detection limit of sensing system. This part we want to analyze the response of GFP signal to different nicotine input. The nicotine input is set to be within [1e-4,1] M to cover the interval including no GFP response and strong GFP response. Because the interval we set is small, we define sensitivity according to the logarithmic nicotine concentration as the equation"

For this reason, we used a genetically recoded strain that lacks any TAG stop codons as well as Release Factor 1 11 , to make the translation of the TAG codon more efficient.
As long as charged tRNACUA(BipA) is available to BeeT, BipA is incorporated and dCas9-Ala10BipA(TAG) is formed (Figure 3)(1). To switch from expression of dCas9-Ala10BipA(TAG) to nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG), we aimed to use dCas9-Ala10BipA(TAG) to repress transcription 12 , 13 of the aaRS/tRNACUA pair for aspartate (2). This happens for as long as BeeT stays in the hive, where BipA is supplied. When BeeT leaves the hive, no charged tRNACUA(BipA) is available. Consequently, the Cas9 transcript is not translated and dCas9-Ala10BipA(TAG) is not formed. This releases repression of the aaRS/tRNACUA pair for aspartate. As a result, tRNACUA(Asp) becomes available and the Cas9 transcript can be translated again, this time resulting in formation of nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG) (3). The nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG) cuts any DNA for which two suitable guide RNAs are offered, including all heterologous DNA (4).
Figure 3. Genetic circuit for switching between catalytically dead Cas9 and partially active (nickase form) Cas9 depending on the presence of a synthetic amino acid. Arrows indicate activation of a part, bars indicate inhibition. aaRS = amino-acyl tRNA synthetase, SAA = synthetic amino acid, NAA = native amino acid, dCas9 = catalytically dead form of Cas9, nCas9 = nickase form of Cas9.
Cloning And Expression of Cas9 Variants
We introduced the Ala(GCT)10→BipA/Asp(TAG) mutation in dCas9 13 . To express wild-type Cas9, dCas9 and Cas9-Ala(GCT)10→BipA/Asp(TAG), we cloned these genes into the Expresso system for rhamnose induced expression, from Lucigen 14 . This introduced a C-terminal His-tag, for purification by Ni-NTA chromatography. A vector (pEVOL-Bip"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Priontein in yeast
We design and construct a two-plasmid system in yeast. Fusion protein sfGFP11-PrD is inserted into Tryptophan labeled plasmid PYeScGAP and sfGFP1-10 is inserted into Uracil labeled plasmid YEplac195. We expect this system is sensitive to temperature and concentration of GdnHCl. Contrary to Propri-ontein, this system performs function in opposite way. When our rebuilt yeasts exist in relatively low temperature, two fragements of sfGFP can bind to each other spontaneously because of non-aggregation state of PrD. On the contrary, if we give it heat shock, green fluorescence is invisible for the aggregation of Sup35. On the other hand, introduction of GdnHCl eliminates [PSI+], inhibiting the aggregation of Sup35. Thus green fluorescence is visible even when the system is heat shocked.
Like Propri-ontein system, this Pro Priontein system can also be an open tool box, because the sfGFP can be replaced by other proteins of interest and we can use this circuit to control the function of these proteins by giving it heat shock or GdnHCL.

In vivo studies on human proved that to bring a wild-type version of a tumor suppressor gene into tumor cell for which the gene is mutated allow the launching of the apoptosis process and the inhibition of the tumor growth.
By taking up all these data, it appears obvious that the DVS application in the anticancer fight against non small cell lung cancer represent a straight alternative to existing treatments, the tissue vector targeting the organ of interest and the cell vector could deliver the therapeutic plasmid which apoptotic activity is confirmed.

To use the hemolysin system we intend to construct a biobrick with HlyB and HlyD and 252 bp of the carboxy terminal region of HlyA, using primers in Silver Standard, Picture 1B. This 252 bp works as a signaling region enabling the genes fused to it to codify for a peptide capable of being recognized by hlyB and hlyD and be transported outside the cell (2,3).
This is the first biobrick designed to make E. coli secretes a protein using a transport system and can be used to a big range of targets helping to solve the problem of secretion in E. coli.
We will fuse to this biobrick another one with the lambda phage’s lysozyme without the stop codon. We hope this lysozyme with the signaling peptide will be secreted and outside the cell it will be able to kill and destroy all the Lactobacilli and Gram positive contaminants who dare to stay on our way.
This secretion system doesn’t works for all proteins and the only way to know it is by trial and error. So in parallel we created others killing mechanisms.
The Kamikaze System
The other mechanism consist in the production of a huge amount of lysozyme by the killing cell, this lysozyme in high concentrations will be able to attack the cell wall of E. coli passing trough the inner cell membrane. This will destroy the E. coli releasing lisozyme in the medium, that’s why we called it The Kamikaze System (4). The idea to use this system came from the observations with some E. coli strains used in our lab for heterologous expression, this strains have a basal expression of phage T4 lysozyme and even in low concentrations with minor stress the cell lysis.
To test this device we will use only biobricks already made, we will fuse a T7 promoter, BBa I7469, designed by the Cambridge 2007 team, to the T4-Endolysin, BBa K112806, designed by the UC Berkeley 2008 team.
The Colicin System
To improve our killing mechanism, giving to it more precision, we developed a third killing mechanism. The two killing mechanism cited before can be very effective and act to contaminants situated far away from the killing, but these system create"

Medal Criteria
We were in close contact and in a continuous dialogue with a lot of scientific experts and stakeholders associated with our project. This Integrated Human Practice shaped our project and helped us to gain a lot of expertise.
We improved the human ferritin , delivered by iGEM Calgary 2013, by mutating certain amino acid residues to change the affinity towards iron to an improved affinity for gold and silver.
We modeled to get an impression on the toxicity caused by metal ions to design our ROS reduction system based on this model. Furthermore, we modeled certain process parameters to improve our hardware.
During our project we were able to accumulate metal ions in Escherichia coli, while reducing the toxicity. We engineered ferritin to enable iron, silver and gold nanoparticle formation. Furthermore, we showed that nanoparticles could be used to print conductive circuits.
We submitted and characterized our copper importer CopD ( BBa_K2638002 ) to work as expected.
We collaborated with great iGEM teams, learned a lot through our mentoring of two teams and got a lot of feedback on our Outreach .
We carrefully evaluated if our work is responsible and good for the world in both: Our Outreach and Integrated Human Practice.
We successfully registered for the competition, had a great season and attended the Giant Jamboree.
We delivered a wiki, completed the judging form, delivered a poster and presented our results at the Giant Jamboree.
We attributed by listing all our great supporters who helped us having a great iGEM experience.
We successfully competed in the interlab study .

q2: the amount of heavy metal ions absorbed sby PSB
q3 the amount of heavy metal ions released by PSB.
Specific adsorption and repair processes at certain times our cooperative partner BNU-China has established detailed models.So the concentration of heavy metal ions in the soil. The adsorption kinetics is considered.The second stage kinetic adsorption equation is suitable for the control of the adsorption efficiency hand chemical mechanism.This is roughly in line with our plant and PSB adsorption mechanisms
qt：The adsorption quantity at the equilibrium moment of adsorption equilibrium (t)
qe：The amount of metal ions （e）on the adsorbent at the equilibrium moment of adsorption equilibrium.
So we can see that we have put in the soil of the PSB that we converted.The inhibition of superrich plant growth was reduced.To allow it to grow normally.The ion of heavy metals decreases faster than the non-input, the R value is lower, and the R value decreases faster.The growth of plants and the efficiency of plant adsorption play a important role.
It can be explained that our project is feasible and effective in helping plants to repair and control heavy metal pollution.
PSB-assisted phytoremediation dynamic system
Based on the data and information we provided, BNU-China helped us to construct a PSB-assisted phytoremediation dynamic system mathematical model for the implementation. The whole system was separated by three main processes——the phytoremediation process, the organic ptoduction process and the bingding of heavy metal ion with MBP secreted by modified Bacillus megaterium. The effect factors of the system are complex under lab condition not mention to physical circumstances which refers to the soil properties, the concentration of heavy metal ions, the population and equilibrium of bacteria, the degradation rate of protein and a series of chemical reaction. Although in this case, BNU-China helped us predict the feasibility of our project in almost perfect way. And according to the positive feedback done by them, our projected is worthy of further analysis and efforts in experiment and implementation. Thank you very much.
As the increasing addition of our engineered PSB, the population in soil could be seen soaring at the very beginning of stage in few hours. When it reaches at the peak of growth curve, the vitality of our chassis are in a steady increasing status that could be showed in the first row and right pic that the secretion of organic acid.

Collaborations Overview
We are a new iGEM team, located on the other side of the world. Hence, our goals for collaboration are different to that of many teams.
We want to become a part of this international community and so have spent our time this year building our networks. We have collaborated with Australian iGEM teams in an attempt to strengthen the network of teams in Oceania.
Kiwi’s have a view that we can solve problems with a bit of number 8 wire. This serves as a cultural metaphor that we work with the tools we have access to.
We hope that future Kiwi teams can build on the relationships we have made and put New Zealand on the map as a center of innovation in the world of student lead synthetic biology.
Fig1. shows some Number 8 wire, a New Zealand lexical reference. It serves as a metaphor for the way we at SECA NZ have aimed to form meaningful connections with iGEM teams around the world.
NTHU iGEM, Taiwan
This year we, SECA NZ, collaborated with the NTHU iGEM team in the exchange of international viewpoints and software. NTHU is developing an ingenious system to monitor and adjust the level of contaminants in irrigation drains using copper filters and watergates. The filter cleans the water, and a complex set of sensors monitors the output. If the level of contaminants exceeds the capacity of the filter, the water gate will reduce the flow to a manageable level. They are also investigating the water quality in aquaculture.
New Zealand’s economy is largely based on                 agriculture and fishery industries, and so as a team we participated in a questionnaire to assess our opinions on aquaculture and water quality in the agriculture industry.
Fig2. shows some of our collaboration with NTHU Taiwan.
This provided NTHU with both an international and consumer perspective on the issue.  Our own project focuses on the development of crop plants capable of surviving snap frosts. NTHU contributed to our project by graciously providing software and specifications on how to build a temperature sensor which would allow us to monitor the temperatures of cropping land.

During the 5-day experience, we finally got to know what InterLab is doing. Not surprised, we met some troubles in the lab, but after all the 5-day puzzled, the lab is completed and we found that pretty fulfilling."

Overview
What is MOSFET?
The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-e ffect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET) is a type of field-effect transistor (FET). It has an insulated gate, whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This capacity to change conductivity by varying the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. In an enhancement-mode MOSFET mode, voltage applied to the gate terminal increases the conductivity of the device. In depletion- mode transistors, voltage applied at the gate reduces the conductivity.
The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor in digital circuits. Millions of these transistors may be included in a memory chip or microprocessor.
Why are our cells also called MOSFET?
Inspired by the electronic Mosfet, we designed our project, Monitoring and Operating System Founded on Engineered T- cells, which isto be very similar to its electronic analogue Mosfet in many ways. Our Mosfet can be divided into two sub-systems, a signal detection system and a signal response system.
Signal detection
We use synthetic Notch (synNotch)[1]> as our signal detection receptor of the engineered T cell. When the recognition domain binds to its target antigen, it will release the effector domain (ED), which is is TEV protease.
Signal processing
We want to convert the extracellular analog signal into an intracellular digital signal . We use Tet operator (TetO) to achieve this goal. This part contains TetO, TEV protease from the ED of synNotch and Tet repressor (TetR) obtained from the 2017 Oxford University iGEM project. We can initially implement the filtering function by using these elements, but there is a problem of leakage because of TetO and TetR.  To solve the leakage problem, we introduced a recombinase into the system. The recombinase is capable of flipping the 5' end to the 3' end of the"
Duke,2015,Team:Duke#ParthTeam_-_-_TEXT.html," all the things related to the Boston trip.
In the beginning of the summer I knew barely anything about gene technology, let alone synthetic biology, so it has been amazing to learn a whole bunch of new things and actually getting to do stuff in the lab on our own.
One highlight of my summer was when we got our first sequencing results and we finally had concrete proof that we had actually managed to ligate pieces of DNA together. Before that we just had to have faith in ourselves and hope things were going the right way. Now I know why some people say that science is like a religion!
Music, puppies, travelling, a good cup of tea and sleeping in on a Sunday morning are my favourite things in the world.
Laura Laakso
Designer
University of Helsinki
I’m a fourth-year student majoring in Molecular Biosciences and minoring in Computer Science. I’m also interested in art and design. In our iGEM team my main responsibility has been designing things; both the genetic switch and our own visual appearance.
I’d have the required skills to work in the laboratory, too, but I ended up spending most of the summer either researching, drawing or coding. I learned a lot about designing genetic mechanisms and also an enormous amount of CSS tricks. It was amazing to see that it was actually possible to do all the things that interest me for the same project, even though they seem so far apart at first.
Sometimes I entirely lose the sense of time and place while focusing on something interesting. I might fixate on a drawing, a game, a problem, or even studying, and completely forget everything else for a while. This is often useful, but sometimes also troublesome.

A third-year Computer Science student with 2 years of Biotech background.
My main responsibility was programming various software tools to help research and lab work, as well as developing our website and wiki. I also racked up a surprising amount of lab hours considering the last time I worked in the lab was 3 years ago.
I also did a bunch of bioinformatics. I found myself playing around with Geneious a lot, making primers, analysing sequencing results and building things virtually before we assembled them in the lab.
The coolest thing during the summer was making the BioBrick Seeker and seeing what can be achieved by a group of students in a field that we barely knew anything about.

Strong evidence was provided, that both created fusion proteins of our bacterial two-hybrid system are expressed in the cell. Moreover, the positive control HA4 and SH2 are interacting with each other and the chosen DNA    binding domain cI of the phage 434 is binding at the specific binding site OR1 upstream of the promoter. The parts BBa_K2082221 with the functional HA4-rpoZ fusion protein, BBa_K2082231 with the functional SH2-cI fusion protein and    the reporter of the bacterial two-hybrid system had to be combined in one E. coli cell. However, the created HA4 mutations and the Gal4-RpoZ ( BBa_K2082226 ) as the negative control were tested together with BBa_K2082231. Even after a successful transformation with both plasmids no visible difference between the five approaches was observed.   Moreover, exchanging the binding site by the binding site of the lambda cI did not produce new results.
The use of the same pUC19-derived pMB1 origin of replication within pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 could cause problems, because E. coli is not able to"

Synthetic Peptides
Two of the previously described protein tags (SpyTag and Intein) can be used with synthetic peptides for covalent immobilization. The peptides can be bound to a matrix and interact with their specific tag, thereby forming a covalent bond. Afterwards, the matrix can be loaded onto columns in order to modify solutions passing it. The strong covalent interaction between tag and peptide is essential for systems, where the immobilized protein should not be detectable in the product solution.
The peptides consist of a variable and an invariable region. The variable region is specific for the reactivity of the peptide with its corresponding protein tag.
The synthetic intein consists of 6 amino acids (GVFVHN) and was for purposes of better steric accessibility extended at the C-terminus by the two amino acids G and A in that way generating the desired active GVFVHNGA peptide of the intein. This synthetic peptide interacts with the intein part fused to the protein residue and leads to an event similar to splicing. For a detailed mechanism visit the wiki-page concerning Protein-Tags .
The synthetic SpyTag consists of 13 amino acids. The sequence did not require additional modification since it was proven by Zakeri et al. in 2011 to be the best suitable one for our needs. The resulting functional sequence of the SpyTag is therefore AHIVMVDAYKPTK. The reactivity of this part is mediated by the aspartic acid at position 7, which forms an iso-peptide-bond with a corresponding lysine residue in the SpyCatcher.
The invariable region is designed for immobilization and detection"

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Human Practice#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," project. It can not be mentioned enough: Only with a profound understanding somebody can build his/her own opinion. And this is what we want to enable interested non-scientists to do. Therefore, in our opinion, it is not enough to give some information clearly put together for non-scientists. Because as we said, we want to be honest. And one can get the best and purest impression of our scientific work in directly reading the documentation of it. Of course, everybody is free to pick the information he/she is interested in from what we provide - but at least we want to give everybody the chance to get as much and as pure and honest information as possible.

Conclusions
Considering our experience, we want to encourage every scientist - and this also means every participant of the iGEM competition - in popularizing their work. We can assure you it is worth the effort!
First, it is not at all exhausting or boring to present science in a way so everybody can understand it. In fact, it is great fun. You can can invent little stories or look for fitting metaphers and thereby let your creative streak out. And you yourself will explore all the connections between the different parts of biological science anew, when you have to start your explanation at a very basic point and therefore go back to topics like bacterial life, restriction enzymes or viruses.
And the most important thing: The feedback you get is really positive. People are very interested in science - more than we thought when we startet the project - and our experience was that they acknowledge everybody who invests time to explain science to them in a way they can imagine and understand. The public wants to be integrated in science!
You can yourself contribute to the success of your science in communicating your work and thereby build healthy relations between science and public! The public will show their appreciation- by showing acceptance and understanding for your project and by that support your science.

Collaborations
As a communication system, the use of CryptoGErM requires     collaboration and so, to test our system, we asked the other iGEM     teams in the Netherlands to help us with this. However, we also    collaborated with iGEM teams abroad. This article describes all our    collaborations with the other iGEM teams.
Sending our message in spores to iGEM Wageningen and Eindhoven :
The idea of CryptoGErM is to send information integrated in the     sequence of DNA. Our system is using highly resistant spores in     which the DNA is stored. Spores are then transmitted to the     receiver who can get the DNA from them and therefore the stored     information as well.  We wanted to prove that this form of     information transmission works. Therefore we decided to cooperate     with two other iGEM teams from the Netherlands and send our     CryptoGErM spores with a secret message to Wageningen and Eindhoven . Read the accompanying letter here .     Follow this link to see how we constructed the message B. subtilis strain.
Figure 1. (A) Microscopy picture of the CryptoGErM      message spores aka B. subtilis spores. (B) Tubes that were send      via mail. (C) This map indicates how the CryptoGErM spores      traveled through the Netherlands.
We went through all the 6 steps of our project. The message was     encrypted with our program and converted to a DNA sequence. This     sequence was synthesized by IDT. When this synthesized DNA sequence     was obtained, we integrated the message sequence into the genome of Bacillus subtilis. Subsequently we sporulated B. subtilis and     spores were obtained. These spores together with primers were sent     to Wageningen and Eindhoven via mail under GMO conditions. Spores     and primers were in the mail from the 6th September till the 9th.     In this case we sent primers for PCR amplification of the message     because we assumed the other teams did not include a whole genome     sequencing in their finance plan. We sent this CryptoGErM protocol     along with the message"

Also we found out that an addition of copper does enhance the laccases activity, so we are going to do some measurements with copper concentrations from 0.1 mM to 0.5 mM in each sample. This seems like some great experiments for the start, so next we are going to order what we need to do the measurements.

Testing the competent cells by transformation of pUC19. The transformation did not work that good, so that we produced new ones.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases
We got the ordered strains from DSMZ . So we did PCR on Thermus thermophilus genomic DNA. First we dissolved some of the lyophilized powder in water and for opening the cells we boiled them for a few minutes. The primers we used were T.thermo_LAC_FW_T7 and T.thermo_LAC_RV_HIS to get the laccase with the same overhangs described in Monday April 30th . Finally with additional DMSO and GC-buffer we had a product of the GC-rich laccase.
Friday May 11th
Team Activity Tests: For some pre test and characterization for our future laccase activity standard we ordered laccase from Trametes versicolor. As well we had to order a substrate that the laccase could use to demonstrate its abilities. According to the literature ABTS is a well working substrate to characterize oxidizing enzym activity. So we ordered.
Team Database: Conceptual Design: In this phase of the design we try to find relations between the different tables and build a entity-relationship-model. This model helps to visualize the entities (our different tables) together with their attributes (the entries belonging to a table) and the relationship between these entities. The next figure shows a very easy E-R-Model.

In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.
Degradation tag is a useful part in synthetic biology. It can be attached to any protein and then help engineer controllable protein degradation. This year, to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K"

Pelleting of test tubes:
We pelleted 5 of the tubes at 8am, 11am, 2pm, 5pm and 8pm. 
Each tube took four cycles of centrifuging for 3 minutes and removing the supernatant, because they now contained 6ml and the Eppendorfs only hold 1.5ml. 
We took pictures of the pellets formed, but unfortunately none of them had developed a blue colour. 
This means that the experiment was inconclusive as to whether our detector is working. 
We also ran three control test tubes, each with only plasmid 2 bacteria and with no iron, which were pelleted at 8am, 2pm and 8pm. 
These all showed strong blue colours, which is what we expected from plasmid 2 in all cases.

Mrs Andrews removed the pellets from yesterday from the Eppendorf tubes with cotton buds and placed them in a grid for easy viewing., (see picture)

This marks the end of our iGEM lab work, as we have run out of time. We would like to be able to run more tests with different setups, but as the wiki freeze is today, we would be unable to share our results. As such, the project ends here. Thank you for reading."
