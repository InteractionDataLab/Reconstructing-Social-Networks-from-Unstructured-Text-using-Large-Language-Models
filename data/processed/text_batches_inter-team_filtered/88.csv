Addition of Magnesium ion to a PCR reactant mixture(error-prone condition)
As PCR proceeds, gene mutations occur and these genes are replicated. Affinity difference between inducer and promoter becomes clearer and the concentration at which transcription begins changes. By screening the replicated genes’ affinity, we can obtain a library, and by inserting a GFP gene near a promoter, degree of expression can be determined. Differentiate genes based on time of GFP expression, measure their affinity, and select desired bacterial species.
Testing: Upon contacting the desired cell OD, is the target gene expressed? (Inducers differ in the concentrations they recognize.)
2. Basic tool: wax synthesis
Should the wax synthesis directed toward the cell interior, exterior, within the media?
- Directing it towards the surface of the media will be the most convenient method. Following synthesis, wax will float on the media which we simply will pick up.
Involvement of wax esterase and EtOH?
- The problem is, wax esterase is a dimer, making it difficult to display. On the other hand, making the microorganism secrete FA is too complex a task. We then came up with the idea of flipping the FA transporter.  If that’s difficult, we can try storing and stacking wax as layers within the organism, or try producing alcohol.
Instead of supplying substrates manually, inducing the microorganism to synthesize its necessary compounds may be possible. In doing so, we should not interfere with the beta-oxidation pathway. Altering such crucial pathway may result in cell death.
Using Atfat is an option. (Important to note that the type of esterase used depends on whether target FAs are short or long)
3. FA absorption mechanism
Anaerobic Acinetobacter growth rate is too slow. Desired quantities of products are not synthesized.
Acinetobacter transport components may be applied to E.coli. May be useful if possible.

Judd_UK,2017,Team:Judd UK#Pages#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," quite a lot in our model. This was primarily because it was a study of protein synthesis in a cell-free system, which is exactly what our project is. However, we also considered other sources for each of our values and took these into account when we decided on our final values for our constants.
Did not check extensively the reliability of sources: Little time was spent evaluating the reliability of sources. Although we checked that the values we found were the values we were trying to find, we did not necessarily check whether the source was particularly reliable.
Only 1 member of the team was working on the model: By only having one person working on the project, we were unable to have a second opinion at every step. In this way, mistakes are significantly more likely to occur and having multiple team members working on the model would make it much more reliable.
We started quite late, meaning there was a lot of time pressure: Because our team had no experience in modelling, it took the team a while to get started on the model. All the work was therefore done in the course of about one month, by a highly inexperienced student. Although this could not have been avoided, it should still be stated.
With these limitations on our model, it would be improper to suggest our model is 100% accurate and that our conclusion is correct. However, we feel as though we have tried to account for as much as possible, and the parts we did not account for would not have a big effect on the model. The fact that our lab work supports this conclusion makes us even more confident that the model is accurate.
We wish to thank George Smith and Adam Jones from the City of London School for Boys iGEM team and Chun Ngai Au from the Oxford iGEM team for guidance, assistance and discussion for our model.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," material which can be attracted to magnetic fields (Jordan et al., 2010 & Wong et al., 1998). We were able to attain some general knowledge of magnetism in nano-scale material, including a basic understanding of blocking temperatures, superparamagnetism and magnetic moments, all magnetism-related measurements. But we are ill-equipped to model this system theoretically in terms of calculated forces. We also explored the possibility of alternative magnetic particles, just in case ferritin is too small to exhibit magnetic forces significant enough to move proteins.
Magnetosomes were found to be much larger, but inviable due to the complexity of their creation. The   cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) may also be an option, although there is currently little known about it and therefore further research into this topic is required. (Lohsse et al. 2011).
Because we also intend to scaffold transcription activator like effector (TALE) DNA-binding proteins to ferritin, we looked into fusions to both C- and N-terminals of ferritin. The N- and C- termini of ferritin subunits are present on the outside and inside of the nanoparticle respectively, and therefore N-terminal fusions are an obvious choice to ensure TALEs are present on the exterior of the nanoparticles (Dörner et al., 1985).
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
While we are unsure of exactly how ferritin will be used in our project, any capacity in which we use it requires isolating recombinant ferritin from E. coli. We investigated which terminus to locate purification tags (eg, His tags) on ferritin subunits. Ingrassia et al. (2006) found that small amino acid additions to the C-terminus of either heavy or light chain ferritin are not deleterious to its function. Thus, we are contemplating fusing proteins to the N-terminal of ferritin as discussed last week, and using the C-terminus for tags to isolate recombinant subunits.
We also contemplated methods for controlling expression in terms of proportions of H and L subunits in completed ferritin. This could influence iron dynamics of completed ferritin. Lee et al. (2002) overcame this issue by fusing the heavy and light chains together to ensure that completed nanoparticles have a 1:1 ratio of each subunit. We are trying to determine pitfalls of this expression strategy. Finally, we investigated methods for validating nanoparticle formation. Namely, we considered fluorescence spectroscopy as tested by Parker et al. ("

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
The general laboratory protocols of all labs at the University of Illinois prioritize both researcher and environmental safety. The Institute of Genomic Biology is secured by a proximity card system, minimizing any undesirable public exposure. These same precautions also keep the research environment isolated and free of non-laboratory standard entities. If there is ever any sort of hazardous incident, regardless of its level of permeation within or outside of biosafety areas, the University has campus wide alert measures already in place. This system, the Illini-Alert, is capable of informing the entire student and faculty body within seconds via SMS and e-mail.
That being said, our projects have no focus on toxins or dangerous reagents otherwise stated in our protocols, which are reagents present in most genetics labs operating under biosafety level 2 conditions. In regards to researcher safety, all team members and advisors have been trained and certified to work within closed-door biosafety level 2 labs. Although the organisms we worked with (E. Coli) are classified as biosafety level 1, our facilities operate under level 2 conditions.
The protein that our main project utilizes has an affinity for certain mRNA sequences and is able to inhibit processes as such. The containment, manipulation, and disposal of our samples and subjects are handled the same way as any other active biological agent. Following standard protocols and working in a biosafety level 2 lab, our procedures minimize environmental contact as well.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? Did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?

After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

Overview
Entrepreneurship has traditionally been defined as the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which typically begins as a small business, such as a startup company, offering a product, process or service for sale or hire.[1]
Today, our project, PANTIDE, has a complete idea and experience to prove its effect. First, we introduced the business model, which is designed for giving concise information of our project to the agricultural corporations or other potential customers. It consists of three parts including the problem, the solution, and the schedule, to explain why we want to choose this problem, how we solve them, and when we will launch our product. Second, we analyzed the future marketing to discuss three issues including the use of pesticide, organic agriculture, and technological agriculture. Next, we grasped the regulation of the manufacturing and using it in the real world to get a certificate from the government. Last but not least, we have listed the sponsors who added us financially.
Business Model
The Problem
As we mentioned in our wiki, more and more people nowadays start to pay attention to the influence of the chemical pesticide in our daily life. The trends of eating organic food is gradually increasing. However, the management cost and low yield are two major barricades that hinder the development of organic agriculture. Here are the two goals :
Accurate Agriculture
      Traditionally, the cost of the human labor and time is high that requires precise field monitor.
Reduce the Use of Chemical Pesticide
      Chemical pesticide causes lots of problems:
Environment Pollution
      According to the studies, there are over four million tons of chemical pesticide being sprayed in the world. It not only polluted 40% of river, but also contaminated soil. The pollution destroys the original environment.
Health
      The excessive use of chemical pesticide is harmful to our bodies such as lung failure, respiratory abnormality, quivering, cardiopalmus, and poor appetite.

Today  was quite BUSY! The number of tubes prepared for plasmid isolation raised up to  24! We had to divided them into two groups and perform isolation separately.  Gel for restriction analysis was a disaster! Only one sample seemed to be right,  whereas others were terribly wrong. Maybe the workload was too heavy to prevent  any mistake, or maybe the bacteria were so naughty not cooperating with us. Wu  advised us to decrease workload and perform ligation in a higher quality  standard. In the evening, Hu wanted to do another restriction analysis using  the same bacteria as morning's. We REALLY want to know why gel looked like  that. Fortunately, the bands were closer to Mr. Right, though several wrong  bands could be observed. Wang decided to give up glycerol stocks and reduce the  workload, hoping to make all things correct.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

1) Centrifuge the vial with bacterial cells for 5 minutes at 9000 rpm to form a pellet of cells at the bottom. REMEMBER TO BALANCE CENTRIFUGE! If you are using a previously frozen pellet, ignore this step.
2) Pour out the supernatant (the liquid surrounding the pellet) into a liquid waste container. Do this carefully so that the pellet remains at the bottom of the tube.
3) Add 250uL of Buffer P1 (KEPT IN THE FRIDGE-> PUT BACK IN THE FRIDGE) to the tube containing the pellet, then pipet up and down until the pellet is completely resuspended. Make sure beforehand that the P1 bottle’s top has a checkmark in the appropriate box (RNase). When you can no longer see any trace of the pellet, expel all liquid from the pipet back into the tube and proceed.
4) If the cells aren’t already in a microcentrifuge tube, transfer them to one now.
5) Add 250uL of Buffer P2.
6) With the lid closed flip the tube upside down, then back to normal, 4-6 times to mix. Wait 1-2 minutes before proceeding.
7) Add 350uL of Buffer N3, then mix again, flipping it 4-6 times.
8) Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm. REMEMBER TO BALANCE.

Science day at university
At the day of science of the University of Stuttgart we presented our project to the public. Our stand was hosted by Stuttgart Change Labs. Young and older people visited us, and we had some nice talks about our work. We put a lot of effort in explaining the topic in simple words to the audience. We tried to make them interested in our project in context of the field of synthetic biology. Thereby, we were also confronted with critical questions about genetical engineering, like harming the environment. We handled these questions by pointing out the advantages of synthetic biology e.g. the production of pharmaceuticals, nutrition and consumables. After our explanations the people were surprised about the potential of synthetic biology and seemed to leave our stand with another attitude towards biotechnology.
Summarizing, it was a pleasure to us to give the people an understanding of our project and the field of synthetic biology, despite the burning heat in the tent at this sunny day. In addition, we think that the visitors of our stand took along a positive impress about genetical engineering.

As part of finding inspiration, fundraising and exchanging with the world for spreading the word about iGEM and TAGC we also visited science fairs in Germany. At the Analytica in Munich we established new contacts to build up our iGEM labotory and we visited various booths. By this we gained knowledge of current developments and techniques in the industry.
In Stuttgart the t5 fair took place. Besides interacting and outreaching with different experts we could collect new ideas and suggestions for our project. Successful outreach and exchange were only small part we can add to our aquisitions of the last couple months."

Our results found that even without insurance coverage, Australians were able to afford insulin across more income percentiles than Americans. In Australia however, all residents are able to receive subsidised insulin. This takes all insulin prices down to just $AUD25 per month. In the USA by contrast however, you must be aligned with a certain insurance company which subsidises the insulin brand you require. Therefore, insurance premiums and rates must be paid in order to subsidise insulin. Due to the amount of variability in insurance premiums, no per month cost could be determined for US residents.
Below you will find an economic analysis of different countries around the world. To find out more about their Insulin market, and how governments or insurance plays a part in covering certain costs, click on the country's dot!

Developed Nation, High Expenditure with even Higher Prices
The United States is host to a highly regulated medical industry that relies upon the interplay of pharmaceutical corporations with insurance companies. Enormous effort and expense is required in order to gain marketing traction with the medical advisory boards that direct spending within the industry. While not technically corruption, this market inefficiency accounts for an enormous portion of the pharmaceutical cost equation - expenses that must be made up for through increased prices.  The Insulin Analogue/ Biosimilar market is just one example of how this artificial price can negatively affect patients.
Gabriella is allergic to the kind of insulin her insurer covers at a $25 out-of-pocket cost. She can only take Apidra, but her insurance only covers 25 percent of the price, leaving the family to pay hundreds of dollars a month they can't afford.[13]
Even considering the low minimum wage - $25 a vial is an affordable shelf price for Regular Human Insulin, so the USA gets a pass on this one. The NBC article also describes ‘black market’ trading of insulin vials, however this is just further evidence of market inefficiencies creating artificial price rises. Certain insurance companies will only cover certain insulin analogues, and consumers must turn to the internet to find an affordable alternative if an allergy prevents them from using the single subsidised brand. This has little in common with the true black-market insulin available on websites such as AliBaba which comes from anonymous suppliers and may be a sole lifeline for individuals in developing nations.
It is difficult to estimate the spillover effect of the USA’s bloated pharmaceutical industry on the global price of insulin"

FMT is referred as transplanting the flora of healthy human feces into the                         intestine of a patient, rebuilding the normal intestinal flora, and achieving the purpose of                         treating diseases inside and outside the intestine. However, FMT itself has a difficult choice                         of donors, long-term safety is not clear, patients with low acceptance and poor efficacy, thus,                         the efficacy of FMT for IBD is limited [30].
6. Our solution
This year, our team NEU_China_A try to use engineered bacteria to                         explore an inexpensive, safe and efficient way to deal with the dilemma in the intestinal tract                         of patients with IBD. See project design for details.

 ""Gene go!""
""Gene go!"" was held in Sichuan Science  and Technology Museum on June 17 by UESTC-China and UESTC-Software, which is an event of Education and Public  Engagement. We released information on the activities through the platform of SCSTM.  Within one day, we received registration forms from more than 300 families, reaching the maximum capacity  of the activity.
""Gene go!"" including five section, such as DIY classroom, ""Cellulose Go"" Show, Exploring the micro  world etc. We created an atmosphere of synthetic biology, telling them what is  iGEM and what we're doing for the world.
""Gene go!"" was appreciated by SCSTM and  a lot of parents, they both expected us to hold such a great event next year.
 DIY  Classroom
Making  a leaf vein bookmark
Based  on cellulose, which plays an important part in our project, we set up our first  course called""Making a leaf vein bookmark"". Through the process of making vein  bookmarks, the children can easily recognize the toughness of the veins and  learn about cellulose which plays an important role in it
Making  cell model with plasticine
The  second course we set up called ""Making cell model with plasticine"". We  introduced the cell model to children simply and took them making cell model  with plasticine. Under our careful guidance, the children succeeded in making  beautiful cell models. After class, the children said they were happy could  learn the structure of cell today.
 
 Exploring  the micro world
After finishing the course of ""Making cell model with  plasticine"", we led the children to observe the  real cells with microscopes. We also offer different types of slices, taking  them to operate the microscope and introduce related knowledge to them.
 
 ""Cellulose  Go"" Stage Play
We have adapted our project  ""Straw-Degrading Energy E.coli"" into a stage play called ""Cellulose Go"" to explain  our project. In the play, our protagonist ""Cell"

Ligations were set up overnight using NEB’s T4 ligase and transformed in DH5α E. coli cells . Colony PCR was performed to check ligations. Colonies picked for this protocol were streaked onto a LB-agar plate. Colonies picked from streaked plates and cultures were prepared for miniprepping . Minipreps were digested with SpeI and PstI to allow for the insertion of the part K2205011 directly after the PO promoter. The part K2205010 contained in pSB1C3, was digested using XbaI and PstI for BioBrick assembly. Ligations were set up overnight using NEB’s T4 ligase and transformed in DH5α E. coli cells . Colony PCR was performed to check ligations. Colonies picked for this protocol were streaked onto a LB-agar plate. Colonies picked from streaked plates and cultures were prepared for miniprepping . DNA samples were then sent off for sequencing to ensure that the constructs were correct. Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .
Conclusions and Future Work
Due to time constraints, we lacked the time to characterise these parts into the Sensynova platform within the lab. The parts BBa_K2205024 and BBa_K2205025 , the parts BBa_K274371 and BBa_K274381 respectively as processing units of the platform, were been submitted to the iGEM registry for future work and characterisation by future teams. The intermediate parts BBa_K2205027 and BBa_K2205028 , the parts BBa_K274371 and BBa_K274381 respectively resulted from the ligation to the first part of processing unit of the platform prior to the ligation to part of processing unit of the platform, were also submitted to the registry.

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," were grown at different temperatures in a thermo cycler for three hours, the cells were collected and O.D600 was measured. Fluorescence was also determined and compared to the non-transformed/wildtype or control strain. Fluorescence values in the different temperatures tested are very similar to the control and only slightly higher around optimal temperatures. This indicates a low expression of Bb3 in all cases. The green line represents the theoretical prediction of our model, which                    captures the shape of the temperature profile. Click here to see our model.
Material fatigue (2)
As described in the first parts of this section “The limits of E. coli”, the strain DH5α grows better under temperature cycling conditions ""thermal fatigue"" compared to the optimal growth temperature (37ºC), but the same effect was not observed for the strain XL1-Blue. Hence, we decided to check what was the effect of Biobrick expression in XL1-Blue (Fig 10).
Figure 10: Biobrick 1 expression under different temperatures, including temperature fluctuation (from 37ºC to 41ºC, every minute each) in a thermocycler. Controls were incubated at 37 and 41ºC. After an incubation period of 3 hours, O.D.600 alongside fluorescence was measured. The results show that the expression of the Biobrick is not affected by cycling temperatures. ANOVA test 95% shows no significant                   differences, as explained in the text.
No significant differences were found among treatments according to an ANOVA test for three groups and 16 replicas (F=1.682, p=0.200) at a 95% level of significance.
pH & Salinity (2)
Large proteins, including enzymes, are affected by pH. Usually, the catalytic properties of the enzymes are lost and metabolism is halted, which eventually leads to death. The pH range determined for E.coli optimal growth is 6 to 7, but does Biobrick expression affect this? The results of the experiment in which the pH of the medium was varied are displayed below. The results show that, as expected, Bb1 displays a higher fluorescence and is active regardless the pH value of the medium.
DH5α pH
The figure shows our experimental results compared to the prediction of our theoretical model . The model predicts that fluorescence is lowest at the pH with lowest growth; while it is mildly dependent on the pH from 6 to 8.

XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," 4ml LB tubes, which in turn were shacked at 220rpm at 30°C and 37 °C according to the plate where they were incubated. These tubes of strains were then induced using IPTG for W7, W8 and W9, and arabinose for W4, W5, and W6. J23119，which is one of the strongest component promoter, therefore, no need to be induced. These tubes were then shacked for another 8h before harvesting. The cell density were normalized to OD600 = 0.93, such that the centrifuged bacteria dot can be compared under UV irradiation. (Figure 1-Figure 3) The best-performed strains were further tested for fluorescence of EGFP using plate reader.
In order to avoid the noise of full cell, in which EGFP is covered by cell wall, the supernatant cell processing sonicate broken was used for the plate reader test. The supernatant were then serial diluted on a black 96-well plate where the fluorescents of EGFP were tested. (Figure 4) The emission ray of 480nm from the top the plate reader excited EGFP, which consequently attributed to the absorbance at about 580nm. (Figure 5)
3.3 Results and Discussion
As Figure 1-3 shows, W1 (J23119+A1 RNAT) which cultured at 37℃ is much brighter than at 30℃ and W7/8/9 (T7+A1/4U/U6), which cultured at 37℃ is a little brighter than at 30℃, which needs further research using plate reader. W2/3/4/5/6 doesn’t show conspicuous differences between 30℃ and 37℃. Due to the better results of A1 RNAT compared with others, W1/4/7 will continuously be disrupted by sonication and measured.

Safety in the Lab
Safety in INSA Toulouse
INSA Toulouse is a public engineer school in which several government research laboratories are present. Workers at INSA must follow the French rules concerning safety and environmental regulations. Most of these rules are presented in the manual  “ Manuel de sécurité en laboratoires ” (from the WHO), which allowed us to understand and apply safety rules when manipulating microorganisms and chemicals. In addition, daily use of the Deming wheel allowed us to improve the safety rules and keep them updated.
Concerning the laboratory
Personal protective equipment
We used conventional protection all along our daily manipulating. All experiments were perfomed with gloves and a conventional lab coat, protecting the worker and avoiding contaminations. We also wear glasses when needed (UV exposition, hot water manipulations, chemicals manipulation, etc.).
Biological and Chemical Waste
After a 1h30 training for chemical waste gesture and biological hazard, we learned how to use different trash containers as described in the picture. Biological waste, potentially containing viable microorganism, were autoclaved in a special bag, then discarded. Chemical wastes are grouped by categories and eliminated via the regular procedure for all chemicals of the INSA.

2. Overexpression of AQR1
The gene coding for the amino acid transporter AQR1 from S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-5D was added to Y. lipolytica as we could not find a homolog in the genome of Y. lipolytica. It was inserted to the genome of the strain JMY330, through the same mechanisms as the previous construct, after Gibson assembly with the vector JMP2563.
Figure 15. Construct for overexpression of AQR1 in Y. lipolytica.
The fragments for this construct was generated through PCR with the primers in Table 16. The gene AQR1 was amplified from genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-5D and the terminator tXPR2 was amplified from genomic DNA of Y. lipolytica JMY2900.

Concretely, we designed a fluid model and a solid model, where the solid model has taken spatial effects on relationships between populations and individuals into consideration. In the fluid model, we use Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to describe the behavior of the amount of different characters and molecules. In the solid model, however, we use Cellular Automaton (CA) to mimic effects of spatial factors. (See more at Fluid Model and Solid Model )
As is shown above, fluid model helped us a lot on experimental design. Besides, they can also be used to help us design our game---E.coli War! The game can be used to help us consider effects of some factors on population interactions. Besides, it can even help us realize the educational purpose of our project and make public know more about synthetic biology!
IX E.coli War
Our games are made on structure of html5.The videos below are two short videos of our Fluid E.coli War and solid E.coli War.  (Fig10: Videos)
See more details on Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War
After we designed our game preliminarily, we visited Beijing Perfect World Network Technology Co., Ltd (Perfect World), one of the largest game company in China, to learn more about the design of a game. The useful advice from the experts help us a lot in improving our E.coli War, making it more fun and easier for kids to play.
See more details at Visiting Perfect World
Afterwards, when children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (Fig.11) (See more details at Exhibition at National Museum , Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
(Fig.11 Children are playing E.coli War in CSTM!)
X Summary
In conclusion, we designed a very general system to study many complex relationships and also a useful model to describe this system. In the future, it will be convenient to investigate some interesting questions with regard to relationships between populations and individuals by using this system.
What’s more, we designed two interesting games--- Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War to make the public more interested in synthetic biology. Conversely, their finding of many interesting results and disciplines in the games could also be of great help to our research. By this way, we combine our project to the world perfectly.

That is, the fluorescence/OD for anaerobic growth of the sample was divided bye fluorescence/OD for the aerobic sample.  The same was done for a constitutive promoter expressing AFP. That way, a comparison could be made between constant expression of AFP in an anoxic environment and induced expression.
Oxygen Promoter J6
Oxygen Promoter D5
The results are that both promoters indeeed were inducible under anaerobic conditions.  The fold-change expression when switching from aerobic to anaerobic is significantly higher than the fold-change expression of the constitutive promoter.
Characterization of Old BioBrick parts
When designing our project, we were thinking about using the violacein pigment, BBa_K274002, in our genetic circuit. This part is supposed to be just the coding sequence.  Because the tube in the picture below contains only this part with no promoter added, there should be no expression of violacein.  However, as can be seen below, the violacein is present.  This could be caused by either an undocumented promoter within the part, or a non-insulated BioBrick vector with inefficient flanking transcriptional terminators.
Lux Promoter Characterization
Two Lux-inducible promoters that were already on the registry (K091107 and K091146) were characterized. Because these promoters require AHL and LuxR in order to activate, a construct was created that consisted of a Lux promoter followed by RFP, and a constitutive promoter followed by the LuxR gene.  LuxR was expected to be present in excess so that the limiting factor would be AHL.  The coding sequences for LuxR and RFP were preceded by the standard RBS B0034.
The AHL used was OC6-homoserine lactone.  It was added to samples in a 96-well plate in concentrations of 0, .1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000nM.
The results below show no trend in protein expression based on concentration of OC6-homoserine lactone.  More research is warranted to provide information about what are the best conditions for chemically inducing the Lux promoters.
Inconsistent Sequencing Results
Certain parts on the registry have reportedly had inconsistent sequencing results, or not enough information is available to say for certain that the actual part is what its creators think it is.  Below is a list of parts for which the Penn State iGEM team repeatedly received the same but inaccurate sequencing results.  These findings have been posted on each part's registry page"

Children could then write their own name on a DNA-strain to display the engineering nature of Synthetic Biology. Furthermore, by the microscopy of a hay brew and plants visitors gained insights into the life of the microcosms.
We were happy to see, that not only children but also many adults were excited about the change to educate themselves about biology.
Successful Outreach to Fight Fears
We used the occasion to discuss with people who were interested in the advancements in biological topics. With the help of our posters, we taught people about microbiology and especially synthetic biology. Talking about the concerns some people have with genetic engineering we were able to calm ill-fitted fears and awaken a more educated view on modern biology.  We immensely enjoyed this opportunity provided by the network that is ProLOEWE. The different perspectives and the vast enthusiasm we encountered gave us pause to think about societies' perception of science. By talking to people outside of the university and industry, we learned what the broader public is interested in, where concerns lie and how science ought to be presented in outreach campaigns to be understandable, emphasize safety and be fun at the same time. This way, we could adept parts of our project to respond to their questions and improve the way to present our iGEM Project.

School lecture at Stiftsschule St. Johann
Synthetic Biology is a rather young area in the field of science. Consequently, many people do not know what it is all about and probably associate negative impressions with it. For instance, many people are afraid of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and think that they are an evil. Often this fear is due to little knowledge about GMOs. To uncover misunderstanding and spread the idea of iGEM and Synthetic Biology in general, we decided to reach out to students at a local high school. In our talk we introduced the iGEM competition, Synthetic Biology and our project and visions to the pupils. More than 80 people from different classes participated and discussed about possibilities and risks of Synbio afterwards. It was amazing to see the enthusiasm of the students. We, as young scientists, also learned a lot by hearing different opinions and statements concerning Synthetic Biology which helped us to understand public concerns about Synthetic Biology. Interestingly, younger students had less fear of Synthetic Biology and GMOs than older students. We believe that media plays a crucial role in the assessment of GMO"

Price. We are looking for a material that is as cheap as possible, without sacrificing the necessary criteria.
Environmentally friendly. Considering the goal of this project being the creation of an environmentally friendly energy source, the ideal material would be as green as possible.
Interview with Flemming Christiansen
For the purpose of finding the necessary materials for our prototype, we contacted one of the leading plastic experts in Denmark, Flemming Christiansen , who acts as the market development manager of SP Moulding. He has been acting as a plastics consultant since his graduation as a master of science in Engineering, with a speciality in plastics. A meeting was quickly arranged for the purpose of confirming our criteria, the technical design, the material, and the possible price of creating the PowerLeaf.
In accordance with our established criteria, Mr. Christiansen suggested that we use the plastic known as Polycarbonate, specifically Lexon 103R-III Polycarbonate . Unfortunately, the material cannot fulfil the criteria on its own. He therefore suggested that we take a few liberties with it. In order to prevent UV degradation to the exposed parts, we will be adding certain additives to the surface. This increases the UV resistance of the device, without hindering the sunlight from reaching the bacteria.
During our conversations with Mr. Christiansen, we reached the topic of what to do in case of a breach. Should the container against all expectations be damaged, the environment will be exposed to the GMO inside. The solution we came up with was the possible implementation of a kill-switch in the inner compartment, making it vulnerable to sunlight. Should the bacteria of said unit be exposed to sunlight, they would perish. As the outer compartment would be dependent on the continued coexistence of the two units, the entire GMO system would be purged in case of a breach . To implement this feature, the inner chamber would be covered with Carbon Black, which has the ability to absorb sunlight, thus leaving the compartment itself in darkness.
The process of constructing our device would be through an extensive use of Injection Moulding, which is considered pricey equipment. The material is expensive at 4-5.5 USD per kg at orders above 1 metric ton, according to Mr. Christiansen, but its longevity and durability means it would not need to be replaced for a long time. Lastly, we discussed the reusability of Polycarbonate, which he assured us was of no concern, as the material could be reused and recycled with ease.

Plotted probabilities represent the raw cleavage site “C-score”, the signal peptide “S-score” and the combined cleavage site “Y-score”. C) ClustalW multiple  sequence alignment of the BM40, EGFR and Igκ signal peptide construct, depicting a gap for the EGFR-signal peptide construct compared to the newly designed ones, indicating smaller length of the 5'-UTR . For the Igκ and BM40 signal peptide constructs, a T7 promoter spacer as well as a Kozak sequence increase the distance between TATA-box and protein-coding region.
For all three signal peptides, the high S-score indicates high signal peptide functionality. For the Igκ signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 20 and 21 within the signal peptide is predicted. For the BM40 signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 17 and 18 is predicted, and for the EGFR signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 24 and 25 is predicted.
Quantification of signal-peptide mediated translocation via a secretion luciferase assay
For the quantification of signal peptide functionality via a luciferase assay, three constructs were created and tested - each containing one of three signal peptides (the EGFR signal peptide, the Igκ signal peptide or the BM40 signal peptide) and a nanoluciferase as well as a CMV promoter, a Strep-tag II for immunochemical detection and the hGH polyadenylation signal sequence. Not containing a transmembrane domain, the nanoluciferase fusion protein is being translocated into the ER and then secreted into the medium. Using a luciferase assay, one can quantifiy the amount of luminescence - and thus, proportionally, the amount of secreted luciferase - by measuring the conversion of luciferin into visible light and integrating it over a timespan of 5 s. Therefore, medium samples were taken every 12 h after transfection of cells and measured via the Promega NanoGlo® lucifer"

Summary
Fluorescence is commonly used as a quantifiable marker in synthetic biology procedures. Following the completion of a protocol, for example an assay test, samples are tested in a plate reader and the results analyzed.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform a Cell-free Toehold test; however, it can be adapted to perform alternative fluorescent tests as desired. The metering primitive dispenses accurate ratio volumes of various substances. These are pushed into the central well which matches the dimensions of a 96-well plate. The chip can then be read in a plate reader with the use of an adapted skirt.

Arsenic Reporter
Background and Previous Arsenic Sensors
Several arsenic biosensors have been developed that rely on the Escherichia coli R773 arsenic-resistance plasmid. The ars operon encodes an arsenic and antimony-specific membrane pump that confers resistance by expelling these toxic metals from the cell. Expression of the ars operon is regulated by the ArsR protein which inhibits transcription of the arsR operon in the absence of arsenic. However, when arsenic is present, it sequesters ArsR, allowing transcription of the arsR operon [1,2]. Previously, the University of Edinburgh's iGEM team developed a pH-based arsenic biosensor relying on the fusion of the ars promoter with a lactose degrading fermentation pathway. pH changes can be measured either with indicator solutions or with an electrode. While their biosensor was both sensitive and easy to use, its reliance on pH made it vulnerable to changes in phosphate and bicarbonate levels and required on-site testing [4]. Siegfried et al., 2012, have recently developed a whole-cell arsenic sensing test kit that relies on bioluminescence. Both these test-kits however, lack in their ability to deliver real-time data and require periodic testing.
Design and Construction of our Arsenic Sensor
To expedite the construction of our arsenic reporter system, we employed two existing BioBricks: BBa_J33201 (Edinburgh, 2006) to function as the arsenic sensor and to drive the production of BBa_K"

K542008 – Lumazine Synthase first, then fluorescent proteins (Sample 5)
Figure 1. Expression patterns of K542008 and controls
In every K542008 sample, regardless of treatment, lumazine synthase (16.6kDa) is expressed. This means that we are unable to control production of lumazine synthase as we had hoped. By altering the promoter, we hope to be able to control the production of lumazine synthase in order to evaluate how the expression patterns of lumazine synthase and arginine tagged proteins affect efficiency of co-localization of tagged proteins within the compartment.
The expression of the fluorescent proteins (each approximately 27kDa) can easily been seen in lanes 2 and 3. Although it is difficult to see fluorescent proteins in K542008 samples, fluorescence observed in FRET experiments suggests that protein is expressed.

We aimed to collect the methane gas from coal mines to the tanks which are filled with water. When the methane passes the legal percent that is 1%, according to our project, the gas is dissolved in water in tanks. Then, inside the tablets containing our bacteria and that are already present on the tanks the molecular process for conversion of methane to methanol begins.

Methane explosions:
Save the nature
Methane is one of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Methane is continuously released from coal mining, livestock, landfills and natural gases to the atmosphere. The accumulation of these greenhouse gases causes one of the greatest problems of Earth: global warming. Our project aims to prevent release of methane gas by the conversion of it to methanol in bacterial system in coal mines.
Greenhouse gases:
Process a new energy
After the conversion of methane to methanol, methanol can be used as a precursor of bio-fuel so that accumulated methanol can be recovered. Ethanol is used as biofuel, also; however, methanol is more cheaper to obtain and use as a biofuel. According to Dr. Robert Zubrin, Methanol is cheaper than ethanol. It can also be made from a broader variety of biomass material, as well as from coal and natural gas. And methanol is the safest motor fuel.(American enterprise, February 13th, 2006).
Cheap system
There are many systems used to prevent or minimize methane explosions. However, they are so expensive to use and none of them are based on a biological system. The biological system that we build contains a"

Symptoms
Pernicious anemia shows its effects mainly on three systems; blood, gastro-intestinal tract and nervous system. General weakness and abnormal fatique are observed as the most common symptoms that are observed in the patients diagnosed with pernicious anemia. Gastro-intestinal symptoms such as gastric ulcer are also common. Additionally, loss of weight, sore tongue, decayed teeth, poor appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pains and symptoms related with central nervous system may occur as a result of pernicious anemia. (4)
Treaments
Patient with pernicious anemia requires a life long treatment. Pernicious anemia usually treated via injecting vitamin B12 to patient’s body or by taking vitamine B12 as shots or pills. To keep vitamin B12 level in body constant, vitamin B12 injections are done in daily or weekly basis. In the case of pernicious anemia related with the intrinsic factor deficiency, this requires another special treatment procedure. Also, patients with pernicious anemia should be under a regular medical control to prevent the progress of the disease or prevent the possible side effects of the treatments. (5, 6)

High School Students
Tuesday, October 14th
On Oct 14 2014 Stefanie and Nadine visited a high school in Bern as a part of our human practice project. The girls had the chance to teach students at the age of 16-17 years. Through these lectures, we attempted to impart the basic principles of synthetic biology and encouraged the students to participate in a discussion of the concepts presented. In these discussions we tried to focus on risks to humans, health, the environment and the public. The structure of the lessons was really open for personal inputs from the side of the students. The topics discussed ranged from whether you should or should not express GFP in other organisms (the question of freewill came up), animal trials in research, GMO's in general to the production of artificial meat in bioreactors.
Furthermore former iGEM projects were quickly outlined and their possibilities and potential discussed. Thus, we increased the level of awareness of synthetic biology and simultaneously teach the students how to approach complex problems. Another aspect of our visit was to promote the studies of science in general. The students were encouraged to ask all questions that came to their minds.  This school visit belongs to the outreach aspect of our human practice project as it aims to share knowledge with the public.

Week 9 (20.08-24.08)
Finally we could set incubation of Bacillus subtilis 168 cultures. We prepared isolation of our parts on the pJET plasmid and construction of RBS+GFP+pSB1C3 (digestion, ligation, transformation. We also set another PCR on pCEP4 to get oriP. Isolation of plasmids from the previous day and preparing them for sequencing. We also digested pTG262 (EcoRI+PstI) and P+RBS+GFP, ligated and transformated them to TOP10. And... our first transformation of B. subtilis!!! Unfortunately, we weren’t successful in this procedure. Then we continued constructing our parts – promoter + RBS + GFP + pSB1K3 and RBS + LLO + pSB1C3.
Week 10 (27.08-31.08)
Overnight cultures of the transformants resembled growth. None of the transformants with the LLO construct formed colonies – no growth – something is wrong with our construct! We tried repetition of the whole procedure of preparing this construct and transformation.
Next step – reviving BioBricks (mammalian RBSes from the distribution) J63003 and K165002, transformation and inoculation. We prepared overnight cultures for minipreparation of plasmid DNA, after this - digestion of the mammalian RBSes, pSB1C3 and RBS+GFP+pSB1C3. Ligation of mammalian RBSes+RFP+pSB1C3, then transformation and inoculation. Transformants with LLO didn’t grow up. We ran control digestion of the LLO part and electrophoresis to check what’s wrong. We also set PCR for pCEP4 – to get oriP and prepare electrophoresis of the reaction products.

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

Oxford
On the 19th of June two of our team members; Taylor and Alex travelled to Oxford University to attend an event hosted by Synox, the oxford university society of synthetic biology.  At the event were a number of other Brittish iGEM teams and synthetic biologists.   The event consisted of a number of talks from alumni and businesses including a talk from the president of iGEM Randy Rettberg, were he spoke about the history and mission of iGEM.  There was a poster session in the afternoon that  gave the opportunity to meet other iGEM teams and find out about their project idea and share our experiences to far with out own project.
 
YSB 2.0
During the 1st and 2nd of September the University of Kent iGem team were invited to a conference in London, a gathering of iGem teams representing their universities at the young synthetic biologists meet. During this day we met and socialised with the other teams, setting up collaborations and presenting our projects to each other. There was time after our presentations for questions and answers and from this we were able to see what other people thought of our project and gain feedback on areas that could be improved or, that people enjoyed.
After the poster session there was a break, which gave us time to interact with other teams, this was helpful as we were able to exchange our queries and ideas, some teams were even working on similar parts to us and so were able to give advice on how to use the parts efficiently. Our hosts for the day, University College London also organised workshops that enabled us all to work on different areas of our project, these included sessions on public engagement and a bioinformatics workshop. The sessions were extremely useful and we were able to apply them to our projects to make improvements and enhance the scope of our project.
In the afternoon there was a poster presentation and Team Kent received a substantial amount of positive feedback, which reassured us that our project may actually be a viable alternative for the public. We took on board the concerns and issues that other team members raised to us and took these back home with us to ensure our project was as good as it could be.
Overall Kent iGem team had a brilliant day at YSB 2.0, we would like to thank University College London and the Wellcome Trust for hosting us and in particular Phillip Boeing for organising"

Chitin Synthase NodC
We set out to produce chitosan hydrogels that use chitin as a source material. Originally, this N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharide (chitin) is extracted chemically from crustacean shells under usage of a lot of chemicals, producing chitin oligosaccharides of unspecified length [1] . To reduce the usage of chemicals, one aim of this project was to produce chitin in E. coli by insertion of a chitin synthase (CHS) into this organism, using the BioBrick system [2] . The CHS can produce chitin in E. coli in an enviromentally friendly way. The enzyme that was employed in this project is the CHS NodC from the bacteria Rhizobium  leguminosarum. NodC is an N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase which catalyzes the formation of chitin tetramers and pentamers using activated N-acetylglucosamine monomers. In addition, NodC reliably produces short oligosaccharides of certain lengths which can further be processed in vitro [3] .
Introduction
Besides cellulose, chitin is the most common polysaccharide in nature. Chitin is composed of β(1,4) linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucose (N-acetylglucosamine, Figure 1). The polymer is a white, hard nitrogenous polysaccharide and is a component of fungi cell walls and of the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans, like crabs or shrimps [4] [5] .
Figure 1. Structure of Chitin. Chitin is one of the most common polymers in nature. It is composed of β(1,4) linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucose, which are acetylglucosamin monomers. The NAc stands for the acetamide group.
The extraction of chitin from crustaceans produces a lot of waste and uses a lot of chemicals. The waste of the seafood-processing industry, mostly the shells of crustaceans, contains"

For high school students
In an effort to broaden the accessibility of the iGEM competition to those who appeared to be currently underrepresented in the competition (e.g. disadvantaged students, females and Australian high school students), we approached a private high school in Victoria with the following aim:
To find a well-resourced, private high school to partner with an iGEM team (e.g. UoM) to field a team consisting of half private high school students/half underrepresented students – who would have their flights to Boston funded by fundraising done primarily by the private high school.
After extensive email & phone correspondence spanning several months, the school decided it was not currently in the position to go ahead with the iGEM team proposal due to upcoming infrastructure developments, though would be interested in fielding a team after these are completed (scheduled for 2016). Nonetheless, the school did encourage us that other APS schools would likely be interested in hearing about iGEM and our team concept.
Whilst we didn’t achieve our ultimate goal, this activity did raise awareness of the iGEM competition with all the key science staff members at the school which requested not to be named on this wiki (for further details please contact our team leader Sean).
Finally, we would encourage all Australian teams to work on the following goals:
improve iGEM's accessibility to those of disadvantaged backgrounds
increase female representation in science & iGEM
increase the participation of Australian/international high school students in the iGEM competition.
In addition to our negotiations with the private high school, we also aimed at widening the participation of high school students in the iGEM competition by collaborating with the University of Sydney on The Strange Nature Writing competition.
We spruiked the competition not only on our project flyers which described the iGEM competition, our project and the Strange Nature Writing Competition, but also through our development of a promotional video designed to be shown in high school assemblies as a way of promoting both iGEM and the Strange Nature Writing competition. Please see the video below:

Gel electrophoresis:
The image shows a 2% gel where a 100-1000bp marker was loaded together with FlhDC mut, Double terminator and Promoter+RBS. 5 ul sample and 5 ul loading dye was loaded.
The FlhDC mut lane shows 4 bands. The heaviest band is about 1000bp which consists with the FlhDC gene length. The three other bands are between 100 and 250bp which means they are too small to be FlhD  or FlhC fragments (ca. 400-500bp) and they are too big to be primers.
The FlhDC mut PCR samples were pooled and all of it was run on an extraction gel.

Groningen,2009,Team:Groningen#Brainstorm#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html,"? (How?)
Model interaction of relevant substances. This requires reaction formulas for all the substances with (known) reaction rates, as well as information on how the substance diffuses (unless it is assumed the model is ""well-mixed"").
Link to the world outside the cell and macroscopic effects, like cell density. Note the medium is usually well-known.
Create a kind of mind map of the processes involved to show how the model could be refined.
Formulate what aspects of the modelling results are essential. So, for example that some concentration rises as a result of the presence of a substance, or that the bacteria actually float. (Can we use mathematical topology as a criterium?)
This can be done using one of the following methods:
One ordinary differential equation per substance involved, reflecting the different reaction formulas and rates.
If the spatial distribution of substances needs to be taken into account partial differential equations can be used. This is probably not necessary when talking about large numbers of bacteria.
Stochastic modelling can be used if needed (if we deal with very low concentrations for example).
Questions:
What exactly is the role of a kinetic law in modelling a reaction?
A kinetic law is usually a generic equation describing the rate of a certain class of reactions in terms of the reactant concentrations and some constants. (For example the Michaelis-Menten equation .)
Purpose of Modelling
Descriptive, it can help describe the system.
As verification of the design.
Predictive, it can help predict results to aid in selecting physical parameters. (How many copies of a gene? What concentrations? etc.)
As tool in designing tests. What tests will give the best discrimination, etc.
Literature
See our literature list for a full overview of all literature. For our team members that are looking for books on the subject, have a look under code 605B (Bernoulliborg library, lower floor), as well as 605C/D/E (A and Z also exist but seem to be less interesting) and 610A (and possibly 625, 715).

Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"Z-leu and modeling indicated that CBZ-leu was the more secure form of protected leucine for our biocontainment system, we opted to use CBZ as our leucine protecting group.
Selection of cleavage enzyme
There are two enzymes that we investigated which are supposed to cleave the protecting group CBZ from leucine. The first is the penicillin G acylase enzyme, and the second is a CBZ-cleavage enzyme from Nanduri, et. al. We tested the penicillin G acylase by combining it with CBZ-Leu and incubating it for 7 days. Samples of cells were taken twice a day for the first 2 days, and once a day for the remaining 5 days. The penicillin G acylase appeared to cleave the CBZ over time, as seen in Figure 7. However, there were paradoxical increases in the ratio over time. Furthermore, penicillin G acylase is not specific to CBZ and can cleave other amides. In contrast, the second CBZ-cleavage enzyme was reported by Nanduri, et. al. to enantioselectively cleave CBZ. Considering in the vast number of different metabolites in a cell, we decided specificity is of utmost importance and therefore chose to use the second, more specific enzyme reported to cleave CBZ from Nanduri, et. al.
Testing of BioBrick
We constructed a BioBrick (BBa_K1879001) of the CBZ-cleavage enzyme using standard assembly. In order to test the CBZ-cleavage enzyme, we transformed BBa_K1879001 into JW5807-2 leucine auxotroph cells. These transformed cells were streaked on minimal media plates in three different conditions:
Negative control with minimal media agar only
Positive control of minimal media agar + leucine
Minimal media agar + CBZ-leu
Untransformed JW5807-2 cells were also streaked onto a minimal media agar + CBZ-leu plate. The plates were qualitatively assessed for growth. There was no growth on the negative control plate or the untransformed JW cells on CBZ-leu plate, growth on the positive control plate, and some growth on the CBZ-leu plate (Figure 8). The presence of growth of the transformed cells on the CBZ-leu plate but not on the negative control plate suggests the cleavage enzyme did cleave the CBZ protecting group from CBZ-leu.

Catalog Part
  This part provides users a way to browse all the BioBricks by several different classification approaches. We studied the categories of the BioBricks provided by the Registry, and divided the BioBricks in four parts, like “parts by type”,“ devices by type”, etc. In each section, there are more precise classifications. For example, in the “parts by type” section, there are many parts like “promoter”, “RBS” and so on; users can find the BioBricks that they want in this section. There are three parts under each section; they are “list”, “description” and “design”. List is where all the BioBricks are listed. Because sometimes the list can be very long, so there is a search function, by which users can find a specific BioBrick in the list. Description part is the general description of this type of BioBricks. Some types like promoter have a “design” part, which is a concise tutorial on how to design a BioBrick.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Beyond Basics_-_-_TEXT.html," In essence, it is a very good training for students to learn how to take over responsibilities and to work in and as a team. I strongly support the participation of students in the iGEM competition and it is great if they have the chance to travel to Boston and present their concept at the Giant Jamboree. There they will be exposed to other brilliant students all over the world which share common interests. Apart from this, the iGEM competition has a very positive role in terms of visibility for the nature science faculty of the RWTH Aachen University and even generated interest from companies.
What do You think: Can iGEM support the education of the students?
I would say that iGEM also has a very positive influence and shapes their personality to become leaders in research. Members of the iGEM team will get a totally different insight of lab work and research by developing own ideas and experience how challenging the realization on the molecular level can be. However, taking and learning from these frustrations enables students to grow by discovering and analyzing challenges as well as finally solving them totally on their own. The letter fosters their believes in own abilities and strengthens their personality and leadership skills to tackle important scientific questions in the future.
What makes iGEM special in comparison to other student programs and practical courses?
I think the most important part of iGEM is the aspect of self-organization in terms of selected topics and fundraising to support iGEM activities. The latter experiences makes iGEM outstanding and much more challenging than other student activities and internships in which research topics are usually provided by the supervisor.
How do You evaluate the complexity of the iGEM competition (financial support, organisation, and public relations)?
iGEM teams have more or less to act like a biotech start up company which has to develop and to market their own development to finance their challenging activities and thereby establishing their organization, public relations and fundraising. The complexity of the iGEM competition and the limited time for idea development makes iGEM a highly complex and challenging endeavor.
What do You think about this years iGEM team Aachen and its project ideas?
In one word: GREAT. Light switchable proteins are a very promising and challenging topic in biotechnology and in material science and will emerge in the future as a hot topic in national research agenda on bioeconomy in Germany.
Please name three terms that describe the iGEM teams in Aachen and their work?
The three terms that come directly to my mind to describe RWTH’s iGEM team Aachen are “international”, ”interdisciplinary” and ” innovative” (tr"
Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Lab Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," differential expression for the complex is given by:
Our model then simplifies to:
This is the same assumption made by previous teams.
Modelling Incomplete Repression
A recent study by Bikard et al.
found that maximal repression (on the order of 100 fold) was achieved when the promoter was targeted. However, targeting the promoter is not viable in this project since an essential promoter from elsewhere in the genome has been harnessed to produce the fluorescent promoter. Instead, we model the incomplete repression (ranging from 6-fold to 35-fold) observed when the off-promoter regions, specifically on the non-coding strand, are targeted.
There are two possible approaches for modelling the incomplete repression, each reflecting a different physical mechanism that allows leaky YFP expression. In the first mechanism, RNA polymerase is sometimes able to cleave the bound dCas9-sgRNA complex from the DNA. In the second mechanism, the complex binds inefficiently and is sometimes separated from the DNA, permitting transcription to continue.
Cleavage Mechanism
Inefficient Binding Mechanism
We assumed that the incomplete repression is accounted for by the first mechanism. This assumption was based on several studies
showing radically different repression rates if the complex targets the promoter, preventing transcription initiation, rather than targeting the DNA further downstream and impeding transcription elongation. The differences in the system behavior depending on whether or not RNA polymerase has the opportunity to bind suggest that the “cleavage” mechanism may more closely resemble the chemical reality.
Consequently, we modeled incomplete repression using a leaky expression term proportional to the expected YFP expression when the complex is saturated. The differential equation model was updated with a repression term dependent on the fold reduction FR and the initial concentration of YFP mRNA, Y0:
This equation was derived using two boundary conditions. Before repression, when the concentration of the complex is zero, YFP mRNA is produced at the rate expected from the sarA promoter, α. After repression has reached its steady state, the YFP mRNA production has been reduced by FR fold, to Y0/FR.
Parameter Finding
We turned to the literature to find parameters for our model, given in the Table below. We first looked for parameter values that had been measured in S. aureus. In cases where those could not be found, we next looked for ways to to estimate the parameters using other available data for S. aureus and finally searched for the parameters in other gram-positive bacteria. Aggregating parameters from many experiments across the literature is by nature a somewhat uncertain endeavor; those parameters about which we are very uncertain are marked"

Communicating Science
Crossing-over: Speed-dating with interested visitors in Freiburg. The statue of the mammoth represents the possible abilities of modern science and biology to change the present as we know it.
The project culminated in a weekend of theater plays and public talks all dedicated to synthetic biology and its impact on society.
We were invited to participate in a speed-dating like discussion with interested visitors. As part of so-called ""expert-teams"" we had members of our iGEM Team at several tables during this speed-dating discussion. For approximately one hour visitors could switch between the different tables and talk to experts from biology, philosophy, arts, theology and politics. Every eight minutes a gong announced the next round so that we had eight minutes to discuss our project and synthetic biology in general with a group of three to five interested visitors on our table. The interest of the visitors was focused on many different things, some wanted to know a lot about our project or our motivation to participate in iGEM, some were most interested in the iGEM Competition as such and some deeply discussed synthetic biology with us. Over all, during these conversations we got really good feedback concerning the DiaCHIP, even if some people did not approve the research on synthetic biology and genetic engineering in general. Anyways, the idea of our project and the possibility of a chip that could detect hundreds of diseases in one measurement sounded like a really good and promising idea to the visitors.
After this round of discussions a panel discussion with Prof. Dr. Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent (Philosophy, Université Paris Sorbonne) and Prof. Dr. Alfred Nordmann (Philosophy, TU Darmstadt) followed and gave a quite interesting insight into synthetic biology from a philosophical point of view. The motivation of research in synthetic biology was only one topic that was discussed and where they did not completely agree with one another.
During the event we did not only meet visitors of the public but also some members of the iGEM Teams Tübingen and Darmstadt, with whom we shared an interesting and motivating evening."

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," try strategies for implementation that would allow for sample DNA amplification or increased sensitivity.
Takeaway:
As a result, we engineered a second genetic circuit that relied on multimerized tandem-MBD proteins, which literature suggested have a higher binding affinity. We also agreed that it would be prudent to develop a MBD-based circuit and methodology for the clinical setting before expanding our use cases.
Dr. Ludmil Alexandrov, Bioengineering at UCSD, Moores Cancer Research Center
Although not directly related to work with epigenetics. Dr. Alexandrov is known for developing Alexandrov signatures, which are mutational signatures that serve as cancer indicators. He is also currently the head of an international project that is developing a comprehensive map of mutational signatures. He expressed great interest in our project and thought that it holds great promise. Although he was a little worried about the rigorous timeline for the project and the iGEM competition, he felt that advancing the use of epigenetic determinants as a cancer indicator was an important step and could have several ramifications down the road. Several factors that he thought we should consider included the capability for high-throughput analysis. Whether it be in a clinical setting or out in the field, it is always better to carry out multiplexed analysis . He also emphasized that for maximum approach, our workflow should be modular and that our circuit should be used for multiple types of cancer.
Takeaway:
Our conversation with Dr. Alexandrov allowed us to begin thinking about some of the bigger questions we were facing in our research, especially in its implementation. His emphasis on modularity really reverberated with us, and we decided that we needed to work on finding a disease that would serve as proof of concept.
Dr. Kang Zhang, Shiley Eye Institute and UCSD School of Medicine
Our second meeting with Dr. Zhang focused on deciding which cancer to focus on. Our team had narrowed down our choices to breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Dr. Zhang expressed interest in both, but said that identifying methylation markers in breast cancer could be quite difficult; his lab had been examining the problem, and found that the vast majority of putative markers often overlapped with uterine cancer and ovarian cancer, so this would be difficult given the time constraints. When we brought up the idea of identifying pan-cancer markers, he told us that although this was a good idea, it would not be very useful in diagnostics because the amount of clinical insight that could be generated would be very limited and researchers would be unable to synthesize a specific treatment. Instead, he confirmed that we should go forward with working on a single"

Today we ran the ara PCRs from yesterday on a gel and got a really good result, this product was then cleaned, cut with EcoRI and SpeI, cleaned again, then ligated with the pre-cut pSB1AT3 plasmid backbone.
Today we also did minipreps of 12 each of the sac and ara cultures... however unfortunately today the centrifuge we had been relying on broke, and therefore all three teams were forced to use one small centrifuge. This meant that the minipreps could end up being of poor quality due to waiting times for the centrifuge.
Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
In the last lab session, the Metal Sensing picked 12 colonies from a plate containing E. coli + cotC-GFP-smtA transformants and used them to inoculate 12 tubes containing LB + ampicillin - these wil be used for mini-preps today. In yesterday's session we also discovered that the attempts to transform E. coli with the arsR-cadA cadmium sensor failed, so on that same day we carried out a second attempt at transforming E. coli with this BioBrick.
Today's lab session will be focussed on carrying out the mini-preps for the 12 colonies of potential E. coli + cotC-GFP-smtA transformants and based on analysis, will determine whether midi-preps will follow or whether we need to reattempt another transformation (we would, of course, have to carry out another ligation reaction of the cotC"

Issues arise... We need a new team, as those who were previously on the 2016 UrbanTundra team are now on the UAlberta iGEM team. We are beginning to interview students from across Edmonton.
Recruitment April 2017
A new team has been formed, and we are ready to go! Our team is now composed of three high schools: Archbishop MacDonald, Harry Ainlay, and Old Scona Academic. Everyone has yet to meet one another, but we are hoping to hold an entire team meeting soon!
NDC Jamboree June 2017
Friendship! This is our first excursion as a team! We bonded as a group, and this experience has allowed us to recognize some issues with our presentation skills, our organization, and our project itself. We also learned more about one another during a midnight meeting and a Pho outing! Everyone is super excited and cannot wait for everything that is to come!
Media and Engineering Mayhem! July 2017
This month of July is filled with huge progress from two sections of our team: our outreach section with their fundraising and our engineering section with their hydroponics! We came out with a new segment to introduce our team members, called #HumansofUrbanTundra for our social media handles on Twitter , Instagram , and Facebook . Our media team's goal has also been established: create a bridge between the public and our team. Meanwhile, the engineering team is busy working on their hydroponics project! They're looking forward to seeing the growth of their test plants.
Bottle Drive and Silent Auction! August 2017
We were super successful with getting bottles for our bottle drive, with our first one raising over $1000! This could not have been possible without the support of not only our communities, but also the local businesses around the Edmonton area (who are all noted on our sponsor's page)! Thank you all! In addition, we also held our Summer SYNBIO event at the venue graciously donated by the Castle Downs YMCA. The three hour event was definitely a success, with science presentations and"

Finally, our MeetUp was so relevant that it appeared in the magazine of our university                         CONECTA, so all the professors and students hear about it. The note can be found in the                         following link.
Primer Meet-up iGEM LATAM
Tec-Chihuahua
A great number of the iGEM teams are formed by undergraduate students, being still students,                         difficulties may come up during this period of time. While developing our projects, the                         team Tec-Chihuahua and our team had some struggles. After a long time of working hard, but                         not having results, we discovered that our IDT parts did not work properly. At that moment                         we started to examine the problem, in order to find a solution together. We found out that                         our oligos were missing base pairs before the suffix and after the prefix, affecting the                         correct function of the restriction enzymes during ligation. Therefore, during a brainstorm                         between the two teams, Tec CEM decided to create specific primers for the suffix and                         prefix, which add this extra pairs when our parts are amplificated. So, we designed and                         studied the best protocol to implement them and sent the information with the primers to Tec-Chihuahua for them to continue with their amazing project. By this making, they                         achieved results for their project.
So a problem that both of our teams had was worked out together for us to develop our                         projects and succeed at the competition.
iGEM TEAM Bioluminati IIT Kanpur Part BBa_K1629002 and Survey
Our planet is begging for help and each day that goes by our ecological footprint grows                         bigger and the conditions of the environment get worse. Because of this, the Biolluminati                         Team from ITT Kanpur were working to eradicate all kinds of detergents from the ocean.                         Being conscious of this problem, when they asked for the previous iGEM TecCEM from 2015                         part (BBa_K1629002) the sdsA Alkyl sulfatase enzyme from Pseudomona, which is capable of                         degrading SDS, we were happy to share it with them.
Also, we had the pleasure of answering a survey they posted in the iGEM                         Teams/Collaborations page called“Survey to Combat Water Pollution”,"

AHUT_China & NAU-CHINA
(https://2016.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Collaborations)
On Sept.16th, we arranged the video conference with AHUT_China. In this conference, we introduced the project to each other and discussed about collaboration. Later, we went to AHUT on Sept.28th. Firstly, AHUT_China and NAU-CHINA exchanged the ideas about Synthetic Biology, including different understanding of Synthetic Biology, the potential benefit to human beings,etc. Then AHUT_China explained their project detailedly to us, and we gave some advice including:
1. Consider to optimize the path planning at the time of traffic congestion.
2. Use quaternary system to ternary or binnary system to improve the efficiency in solving comparatively short distances.
When, we learned that AHUT_China has the 3D printing technology, we let them know that our physical unit need to be printed. AHUT_China helped us to produce a practical model. It’s important to make our project working in practice.
NTHU_Taiwan & NAU-CHINA

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is important to see further than the results we wish to obtain. Luckily, we had the chance to talk about AdrenaYeast with an ethic expert who also has a background in transgenic studies. In fact, Jean-François Sénéchal is a teacher of ethical science in the Department of Philosophy at Laval University12.
In addition, in order to have an unbiased point of view on the subject, we decided to also ask the opinion of someone who had no or very little scientific knowledge. Therefore, we interviewed an undergraduate philosophy student, François Champagne-Tremblay, whom we thought could answer our questions about the safety of our project as well as our responsibility towards the public.
Our capacity to predict events is limited to our knowledge and we cannot predict all the possible consequences of our project. In the following sections we tried to answer all the questions raised by the people we interviewed as best as we could.
Meeting with the Ethic Teacher
We discussed several ethical aspects that shall be considered throughout the different stages of our project. The teacher brought to our attention the safety issues related to our project and our responsibilities towards the industry and the patients. For example, could there be any health risks? If our product is to be sold in drug stores, should it be labeled as a GMO derived medicine? If it is indicated, will people understand what it means?
The steps we intend to do by ourselves to prove the identity of our product
We must verify the identity and the purity of our product in order to confirm that we achieved the production of adrenaline. In addition, since adrenaline is synthesised biologically, unexpected chemical modifications may occur. Therefore, the adrenaline produced could be different from that expected. We planned to purify yeast-produced adrenaline by HPLC and to confirm its identity by mass spectrophotometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Potential Impacts for Health
As explained earlier, in Canada, any therapeutic agent developed by means of genetic engineering is regulated under the pre-market review and approval standards of Health Canada for new drugs. Therefore, the health risks should be minimal. However, for ethical considerations, we also listed every potential causes of chemical impurities, immunogenicity or lack of sterility, even including those that seemed impossible.
Introducing a new metabolic pathway into yeast cells could have major impacts on the other metabolic pathways and undesired products could be synthesized for instance. For any reason, our molecule could trigger allergic reactions in some patients. In addition, our final product could be harder to purify than when produced chemically. In order to sell our yeast-produced adrenaline, there would be a need for a serious"

POST 1 | A General Overview of Intellectual Property in Synthetic Biology: Part 1
Overview
If you’re here on this blog, you are either 1) very lost or 2) looking for some information on intellectual property in synthetic biology.  If you are here for the second reason, then welcome!  You have come to the right place!  Now begins a pseudo-entertaining journey into the realm of synthetic biology property rights.
Unfortunately, the best way to facilitate a discussion on intellectual property rights in synthetic biology is to first acquire an understanding of some key definitions (boo definitions!). Otherwise, we’ll end up halfway through a discussion on the ownership battle of the gene-editing system CRISPR without fully understanding something key like “property rights.”
Thus, before we begin diving into the more interesting discussions on patent law in the context of synthetic biology (which is way more interesting than it sounds, we promise) we need to establish a strong foundation in some definitions.  If you’re a whiz kid and you’re looking at this thinking “I already have my J.D. in Intellectual Property Law with a concentration in Biological Science, why am I reading this?” you can skip to the next post in our blog and ignore this introduction. If you’re reading this and are completely lost in what synthetic biology is and are wondering how you got here when you were googling a YouTube video of cats, please watch “Synthetic Biology Explained” (the link is here) and read the ‘About’ page on this blog. If you don’t currently know a lot about intellectual property and want to learn about it in a pseudo-entertaining way, read on to the next section!
The Definition of Intellectual Property (and Copyright and Trademark and Patent)
Before we jump into intellectual property, we should define the idea of property rights. Property rights grant a property owner exclusive authority to determine how a resource is"
Tsinghua,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Logo_-_-_TEXT.html," The fitness score of the last 50 generations.
The second graph in Figure 4 shows the highest score, lowest score and average score in each generation. We can see that the extreme values are relatively stable. The sequence which has the highest score can be seen as the best sequence that we found.
Simulated Annealing
To compare with GA, we output the scores of each generation.
Figure 5. The score variation.
Because of the parameters we gave, the probablity of accepting the new solution when the score becomes lower is relatively low.
Figure 6. The score of last 50 solutions.
Compared with genetic algorithm, we can see that simulated annealing has lower convergence rate and higher probability randomicity, which can be affected by the temperature, cooling velocity and coefficient that are set.

Simulation
System Model
Figure 7. The model of the report system.
We use the following formula to simulate the lac repressor system.
We use Michaelis-Menten equation to simulate the process.
Simulation Results
Figure 8. Simulation of the IPTG-lac repressor system.
We infer that the situation of TALE will be similar with IPTG. When TALE protein binds on the plasmid, the expression of lacI will be repressed. Consequently, the concentration of RFP will be increased. If no TALE proteins  are expressed, the concentration of RFP will be very low.
Figure 9. Situations that TALE successfully express and not express.
From the simulation, we can conclude that RFP can be a signal of whether our TALE has successfully expressed, moreover, the concentration of RFP, which shows as the fluorescence intensity, has positive correlation with the quantity of TALE protein.

1. Cancer introduction and treatment
Current situation
Cancer, also known as malignant neoplasm, is a disease caused by abnormal mechanism controlling cell growth and proliferation.  Apart from incontrollable growth, tumor cells invade surrounding normal tissues.  Cancer is a joint name for a broad class of malignant neoplasm.
Cancer cells not only reproduce unlimitedly, consuming large amount of nutrition in the patient's body, but also secrete many toxins, causing a series of symptoms.  Worst of all, these cells could transfer to the whole body through lymphatic metastasis, blood metastasis, and implantation metastasis, resulting in emaciation, weakness, anemia, inappetence, fever, and severe damage to viscera.  Patients will eventually die of organ failure.
Cancer affects human health seriously, posing a great threat on human life.  According to WHO, 12 million people were diagnosed with cancer globally every year.  And the number of patients dying from the disease is predicted to reach 17 million in 2030.  Therefore, cancer is considered the first cause of death.  Listed in the following are lists and discussions of several cancer therapies at present.
Specialized cancer therapies and the future direction of researches.
(1) Progress in chemotherapy
The main methods for curing cancer at present are chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Since Goodman et al. tried nitrogen mustard to cure lymphatic tumors in 1942, chemotherapy became common. Chemotherapy is to transport drugs to tumor surroundings using different administrations. Anti-cancer drugs nowadays are from diverse sources, and have different mechanisms. However, they share a common feature of low specifity. They kill certain amounts of normal cells while killing tumor cells, causing toxic side effects like alopecia, chromosome damage, and harm to urinary system.  These side effects of anti-cancer drugs greatly reduce the effects of clinical treatment. What are worse, researches revealed that cells can escape from chemotherapy. Cancer therapies at the present stage are lack of drugs possessing significant effects and less toxicity. Even the patient is diagnosed, he could hardly get effective treatments, not only placing heavy economic burdens upon numerous families, but also torturing patients both physically and mentally.
(2) Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses high-energy electromagnetic radiation to act"
