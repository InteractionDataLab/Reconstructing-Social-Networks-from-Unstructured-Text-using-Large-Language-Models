2.   Take BFP-Hydrophobin fusion protein standardization for instance
We use overlap PCR to get all the fusion protein. The overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (or OE-PCR) is a variant of  PCR . It is also referred to as Splicing by overlap extension / Splicing by overhang extension (SOE) PCR. To splice two DNA molecules, special primers are used at the ends that are to be joined, because of which a linker is added into BFP and hydrophobic protein. When PCR, to splice two DNA molecules, special primers are used at the ends that are to be joined. Once both DNA molecules are extended in such a manner, the overlapping complementary sequences introduced will serve as primers and the two sequences will be fused.
We can use this technique to combine A fragment and B fragment. In first cycle we use a couple of primers of A and the same to B to PCR. By this, we design a same length of base sequence. In second cycle, due to the homologous sequence, when adding the beginning primers and the final primers, A and B can be primers to each other. They extend to a combined fragment.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"The summative assessment will take the form of a mini iGEM project wherein the students will be assessed on three skills:
Presentation skills
Written skills
Practical skills
The students will have to use all they learned through the module, in the journal club, practical and lecture series to help them complete the project. The students will write up the practical project in the form of a short research article, including: abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion, conclusions and references. They will have to justify why they chose the BioBricks they did as well as show the implications of their findings and relate it to recent studies in the field. Despite having completed the project in groups, this will need to be done individually to avoid collusion and cheating.
The students will then have to present their findings to the rest of the students, judged by academics and industry guests.
The students will also have to create scientific poster and present it at a mini-jamboree. The assessment will be broken up thus:
Presentation - 20%
Poster session - 20%
Research article - 60%
Future Aims:
We aim to implement this module in the September 2017 curriculum for second year Biosciences, however in order to do this we need to keep liaising with academics in the Bioscience department and the Director of Education, Dr Mark Ramsdale. We want this module to inspire students to study further synthetic biology in the future, and give those who will apply for the Exeter iGEM team some experience of the competition so there isn’t such a steep learning curve to begin with. We hope this will make the laboratory work more efficient and the Biosciences students will be able to teach the students of other disciplines more easily, having been taught themselves by post doctoral researchers and potentially previous iGEM team members.
Desert Island... Science?
Desert Island... Science? Podcasts
As another part of our human practices, we wanted to focus on engaging the general public with all sciences but significantly, with synthetic biology. In particular, we have created 'Desert Island...Science?' based on the format of the popular 'Desert Island Discs' radio show. This asks guests to choose two songs; one book; one luxury item; and a piece of lab equipment to take with them to a desert island. We also speak with them about their thoughts on a range of scientific topics, including the future of synthetic biology; the importance of collaboration between different scientific disciplines; and the promotion of STEM fields to all members of the public.
The guests we chose represent a range of areas of expertise, including Prof. Richard"

""The greatest team the University of Michigan has produced since the Fab Five""
I'm Josh Abramson, one of the team's co-founders and the current president. Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan. Before leading the software team, I was on the Michigan lab team for 4 years as a member and 1 year as an advisor. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.
Hi, my name is Hy Doan and I am from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I am junior studying Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing/listening to jazz, exercising, and destroying friendships while playing Settlers of Catan (or any other board game). Along with school, I am in Groove Performance Group, an awesome percussion group, and I volunteer with Ready Set Start, teaching music workshops.
I am Graham, a senior at U of M, studying Molecular Biology and Computer Science. I enjoy fishing, hiking, and playing settlers of Catan. I wanted ProtoCat to be called ProtoDog but that wouldn't make any sense.
Hi, my name is Max Gittelman. I am a Junior studying Computer Science at U of M. I enjoy eating pizza at team meetings and allowing my younger twin brother to copy whatever I do. I fortunately am a dog person and highly recommended the name “Protodog” but the name was quickly struck down due to its non puniness. Also Graham steals jokes.
Hi, my name is Zachary Gittelman and I am a Junior studying Computer Science Engineering. I am from Miami, Florida and my interest in biotech has lead me to join the BioSoft team. Additionally, I am on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles team and I enjoy learning about AI, running, skiing, and mimicking my twin Max. And remember, if you’re not the first cat, you’re the last cat.

Figure 18. Diagnostic restriction digest for verification of pSB1A3+[AraC-pBAD]+mamOPXT. Two undigested plasmid samples were run on a 1% agarose gel along with two single digests using EcoRI and PstI respectively; single digest fragments show a base pair length consistent with the size of the entire plasmid (7492 bp) . A single double restriction digest (EcoRI and PstI) of the plasmid is also shown; the corresponding fragments were shown to have the expected base pair lengths of 5378 bp and 2114 bp. The results obtained from this diagnostic digest suggest that the desired plasmid has indeed been successfully purified and mamP/X/T genes have been successfully ligated to form the final construct.
Functional validation of BioBrick device
The formation of magnetosome compartments and thus the biomineralization of magnetite nanoparticles in E. coli has not been previously achieved. The in vivo construct pSB1A3+[AraC-pBAD]+MamOPXT  in conjunction with pEC86 (encoding cytochrome C maturation genes) was co-transformed into BL21 DE3 E. coli cells and then incubated in an inducing liquid growth medium containing ferric citrate to enable iron uptake into the cells. Following overnight incubation the transformants were imaged using Transmission Electron Microscopy.
This experiment informed whether MamO/P/X/T genes would enable magnetite biomineralization in E. coli without reconstruction the entire magnetosome compartment. The Mam genes present within the construct are the wild type; their membrane anchors have not been cleaved unlike those used for our parallel in vitro investigations. Magnetosome magnetite (Fe3O4) crystals have been described to have a typical length of 35-120 nm in diameter [1].
Figure19: Electron micrograph of E. coli cells containing pEC86 and BioBrick device encoding MamOPXT. Electron dense regions can be observed within the cells, in particular small spherical shapes in close proximity to the cell membranes (A,B,C) which appear to resemble magnetite nanoparticles. Diameters of these shapes are (A)120.4 nm; (B) 88.5 nm; (C) 165.8 nm as measured from the micrographs using image analysis software ImageJ.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", thus, applying BeeT at this time would provide a minimal amount of disturbance for beekeepers.
The advantage of administering BeeT during spring is that this is the period at which most of the Varroa mite population is present at larvae. By administering during this period we can ensure that BeeT is able to affect a large percentage of the Varroa mite population. Beekeepers also visit hives regularly during this period as they harvest honey in spring. Recent papers indicate that feeding of artificial bee bread during this period can have significant positive effects on honey bee health 6, 7 . For both sugar water and bee bread the ideal period for administering BeeT is during the spring due to the large difference in effectiveness between the two periods. In a future application of BeeT this can be given as a recommendation to beekeepers. This is a practice which can be easily adopted since beekeepers already visit hives regularly in the spring period. In particular, supplementing sugar water at this time is already an accepted practice among beekeepers.
The main difference between sugar water and bee bread is that a larger fraction of total in-hive BeeT is given to larvae for bee bread. This is not surprising as honey stores are primarily used to support energetic needs of worker bees 1 . As such only a small fraction is transported to larvae. On the other hand, the protein contained in bee bread is crucial for the development of larvae and, therefore is mainly given to larvae to support their growth 1 . Based on our results we expect that BeeT will be effective using sugar water but greater effectiveness can be accomplished by engineering BeeT for compatibility with bee bread.
Modeling Methods
We examined the effect of year round mite mortality by adding the following code to beehave:
which calculates the mortality of Varroa mites when they emerge from the brood cell (mortalityMites). In beehave the mortality of Varroa mites is encapsulated in the fecundity of female Varroa mites. This means that mortalityNoBeeT is zero. When the mite mortality ScalingVariable is large, the mortalityMites function approaches one.
The amount of Varroa mites emerging from a cell is calculated with the variable ‘healthyMitesInSingleCell’. Using a Poisson distribution, some of the Varroa mites emerging from the brood cell die. Both versions of the BeeT module only affect the Varroa mite population when Varroa mites emerge from a brood cell. This was done to reduce the chance of introducing bugs into the original beeh"

Until now, no manually curated model can be found in neither of these resources for the organism of interest: Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCC 33200). Consequently, suitable knock-out targets were based on a systemic analysis of genome-scale metabolic network models of related species by investigating the effect of virtual gene deletions on the biomass production.
Our lab team selected the knock-out candidates glucose 6 phosphate isomerase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The herein described in-silico analysis was able to confirm this choice. In addition, we found phosphoglucomutase to be a possible knock-out candidate. Within the limited time frame of this project and since only a model of a related species is available, the results found cannot be considered definite. In an optimal case, subsequent studies would be required that include the bottom-up reconstruction of the exact strain under study. Despite these restrictions, the analysis at hand yielded already promising results and has saved numerous try and error runs, hence significant amounts of labor time and material.
First steps
Inference of a model
A Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) requires a detailed model, a so-called bottom-up reconstruction of the organism of interest, to be available. Unfortunately, no curated or at least auto-generated model is currently available for the organism of interest, Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCC 33200). Since a large collection of models had been created as part of the path1models project (Büchel et al., 2013), we initially attempted to adopt an automatically created model from BioModels datbase entries of relates species (see table 1).

At the end, we held a discussion between the students and our team about antibiotic resistance, and their perception of the concern. We also asked how they would feel about using our engineered bacteria, and the response was positive, with most of the students saying that if their doctor recommended the treatment, they would be open to using it.

Further Considerations
Fungal Infections
“What about fungal infections?”
This question was asked following a talk we gave to Oxford alumni medical professionals. It was suggested that eliminating the bacterial population inside the urinary tract would increase the chance of the patient acquiring a fungal infection. Up to this point, we had not considered UTIs that are caused by fungi. The most common cause of fungal urinary infections are species of Candida. Infection with Candida usually occurs in patients with urinary catheters, typically after antibiotic therapy, although candidal and bacterial infections frequently occur simultaneously.  We then attended a talk by Dr. Haribabu Arthanari that discussed multidrug resistance in Candida, highlighting Candida as the second most common cause of fungal infection globally.
For a comprehensive treatment of UTIs, our solution also needs to target fungi. The most common species of Candida involved in infections, particularly in the urinary tract, is Candida albicans 3 . Unfortunately, according to a fungi specialist (Professor Neil Gow, University of Aberdeen), “there is no fungal equivalent to bacterial exotoxins”, so anything we use to sense fungal virulence must be a constitutive part of the fungal cell. Additionally, if we use a hyphal cell wall protein (as suggested by Professor Gow), this would only allow our bacteria to sense C. albicans.
If we were to use our current system and adapt it to target fungi, we would propose incorporating a system into our bacteria that senses hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1), a protein used for hyphal development and yeast adhesion to epithelial cells, which is only present when the Candida are virulent 4 . We would then use our chassis to produce an antifungal agent that would target biofilm formation as well as breaking down the virulent fungal cells. An example of such an antifungal agent is the Echinocandin class of antifungals. The problem with this is that it is very complicated to engineer bacteria to produce these agents, so a better solution for using our current system to target fungi as well as bacteria would"
ETH_Zurich,2008,Team:ETH Zurich#Wetlab#Switch Circuit_-_-_TEXT.html," thermocycler: 37C for 120min, 4C hold. Samples were purified with Qiagen Qiaquick PCR purification kit and electroporated into BL21 DE3 cells. Transformation into BL21 DE3 cells yielded numerous colonies. For each construct eight colonies were streaked out on LB-agar supplemented with kanamycin. In order to test the repressor strength we streaked each of these clones onto plates of progressively higher IPTG concentration and monitored the growth. As a control, the unmodified vector was streaked out on plates without, with 1mM IPTG and with 10mM IPTG and IPTG toxicity was assayed by streaking cells holding an empty pET28a vector onto a 10mM IPTG plate. While empty pET28a vector is apparently not toxic for cells even at 10mM IPTG, pET28a-RMF wild type vector prevents growth even at low concentrations of IPTG as expected. Although single colonies can be seen even at 10mM IPTG, it can be assumed that they originate from point mutations that either mutated the T7 gene, the promoter of T7 or RMF or the RMF gene. It is obvious that the great majority of cells is unviable even at 1mM IPTG and the colonies are expected to arise from single aberrations. With the mutated lacI IS as a major source of repressor we assumed that cells would be viable even at high IPTG concentration, since expression of RMF would be repressed by the mutated, IPTG-insensitive LacI IS. Indeed, cells grew normally up to an IPTG concentration of 10mM, which is 10- to 100-fold the concentration usually used for induction and, as can be seen in the corresponding figure, growth was even more pronounced at IPTG concentrations of 1mM or even 10mM compared to growth without induction. This behavior is difficult to explain. The LacI expression cassette used in the pET vector series (accession number: EF442785 ) appears to be controlled by the standard promoter TCACTGCCCGCTTTCCAGTCGGGAAACCTGTCGTGCCAGCTGCATTA taken from E. coli. This promoter is a weak, constitutive promoter, which does not appear to be regulated by IPTG, since it does not show sequence motifs reminiscent of the lac repressor binding site. It can be assumed that the population of lac repressors in the cell is dominated by the repressor mutant rather than by the wild type"

Specification
1. Our bacteria should survive and grow in mixed waste
In order for the bacteria to produce bioplastic from the mixed waste they first need to be able to use                    it as a carbon source
2. Our bacteria should secrete a functional polyurethane esterase
To recover the resources from polyurethane in the mixed waste, the enzymes should secrete in an active form.
3. Our bacteria should be able to tolerate mixed waste degradation products, such as ethylene glycol
The products of polyurethane degradation are toxic and so any bacteria growing with them must be able to survive to a concentration which will allow economical production of ethylene glycol. We have chosen a strain of E.coli-MG1655, which is resistant to ethylene glycol toxicity.
4. Our bacteria should produce P(3HB)
5. Our bacteria should produce P(3HB) from the mixed waste
PUR Degradation: Pathway ▼
Lignin degrading microbial enzymes are capable of degrading plastics. Some previous iGEM teams have exploited this ability. We have built on their work and extended the plastic degradation capabilities of the synthetic biology community by improving polyurethane (PUR) degradation, as this has not been successfully achieved before. We have identified 5 PUR-esterase enzymes from the literature that are capable of catalyzing the below reaction.
We have synthesised all of the genes in the below table and are testing them for expression in E.coli, secretion, activity and PUR degradation capabilities. Our ultimate design is to be able to control the relative levels of different enzymes in a waste-degrading bio-reactor, in order to adjust it to the composition of waste. We have, therefore, designed the expression constructs accordingly. Our models predict the degradation rate of polyurethane at the bioreactor scale.  .

i, Isa Isa, ""ice"", stands for the frozen state and possibilities that life could be. Since it's place is at the beginning and an underlying chronological order is always possible in interpretations like this, it's a starting point. Again, it could also be interpreted as the static evolutionary state of organisms before human intervention.
G,Gebo Gebo, ""(the exchange) of gift"", describes the cut-and-paste method iGEMers employ, and symbolises for the exchange of genes between organisms. It's a perfect translation, there isn't another letter in the whole futhark that can describe the deeds of bio-engineers better.
E,Ehwaz Ehwaz, ""the horse"", is the hopeful result iGEMers strive to achieve, the new biobrick, part, organism. Ehwaz means binding without sacrifice, a mutual advancement.[9] ""Horse"", its original meaning, symbolises for the donor organism; ``it's master'', is the chassis. Combining dualities, iGEMers hope they can work in harmony, and move along together as a new entity. Also, I found no other letter can better describes the property of the engineered organism like Ehwaz.
M,Mannaz Mannaz, ""mankind"", symbolises the social and ethical concerns of iGEM. It indicates that iGEM puts its deeds into the context of humanity. It does not want to be ``the blind scientist'', and it cares about the welfare of human, society"

Figure 2. Summary of all the genetic modifications planned in each organism.
Why different production organisms?
With the use of organisms that have different strengths when it comes to product synthesis, a more efficient system can be obtained. Thus the production organism can easily be exchanged depending on the desired product. The result is a highly modular system with a wide range of production capabilities. Furthermore, there are several disadvantages when working with cyanobacteria alone. One of them is their slower growth rate than most chemotrophs [9], making genetic engineering of them slower. Since a future expansion of the biosynthesis field certainly will require extensive genetic engineering, working with this organism is not ideal. Leaving the product synthesis to faster growing organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis will allow for faster implementation of new synthesis pathways.
Additionally the use of photosynthetic microorganisms allows us to avoid several of the ethical and social issues that results from the current use of plant based substrate causes. For more information on this check out the integrated human practices part of our wiki.
Escherichia coli
E. coli is one of the most frequently used gram-negative prokaryotes in research and has been a model organism since the beginning of modern microbiology. There are many advantages to use it as one of the production organisms due to the abundant research available on it. Furthermore, it has a short generation time and can be easily transformed with altered plasmids which make it very easy to clone [10]. As a production organism E. coli was chosen for its ability to produce both heterologous and recombinant proteins [11].
Bacillus subtilis
The Bacillus group of microorganisms, where B. subtilis being the most well known, are one of the most efficient and versatile groups of microorganisms at secreting proteins [12]. B. subtilis is mainly used on an industrial scale for production of enzymes that are used in a wide range of  applications such as medical care and laundry detergents [13]. Due to its wide usage in both industry and research, the B. subtilis genome is well annotated [14], facilitating further development of the organism for industrial use. Being a gram-positive bacteria, in contrast to E. coli which belongs to the gram-negative group, choosing B. subtilis will provide greater versatility to the project.

Introduction
In Japan, few people know about synthetic biology, so we decided to offer an opportunity to get closer to it . Following activities were not only for general public but also for high school students, who will lead the next generation of synthetic biology.
We also succeeded in introducing iGEM and synthetic biology to expert researchers as well as to young generation.We also made efforts for iGEM Japan. What we did is written in ""Activity for iGEM"".
To spread iGEM in general public
""EcoLightsOut""
We have developed an Android app. to introduce our project. This is a puzzle game which uses the counting system we created. In the project, the state of E. coli is changed by stimulus of signal molecules. In the game, players can stimulate the E. coli by touching it. E. coli are displayed in 3x3 or 5x5 grid shape. When you touch an E. coli in the game, the colors of the E. coli and four adjacent ones are changed. This behavior is analogy of diffusion of signal molecules. The goal is to turn all E. coli green.
Synthetic biology is not well-known and thought to be unfamiliar to ordinary people. To introduce synthetic biology into public, an easy entrance such as playing game is effective. We hope that"

Results
Phages are bacteria specific organisms, not harmful to humans and more specific than antibiotics. With Phactory it is possible to produce therapeutically relevant phages independent of the corresponding pathogen. This was done in our optimized home-made cell extract. With Phactory, we achieved a stable manufacturing process which produces phages with the titer and purity required for patient treatment.
Optimizing a Cell-Free Expression System
The first part of our project is the optimization of a cell-free expression system as a manufacturing platform for bacteriophages. For our purpose, it is necessary to produce a high-quality cell extract, in a reproducible and easy manner. We focused on achieving the following goals for our cell extract:
increasing the protein content
finding reproducible methods of quality control
producing cell-extract that allows phage assembly
Considering a possible commercial application of our product we decided to furthermore evaluate the potential for scaling up of our preparation protocol.
We chose to try several different approaches to achieve these goals:
testing cell cultivation in a bioreactor to enable upscaling
finding optimal lysis conditions that produce high-quality extract
scaling up of cell lysis
We found that:
bioreactor cultivation allows for upscaling of cell extract production
sonication and lysozyme improve the performance of cell extract
cultivation and extract preparation barely impact cell extract composition
lyophilization is a good choice for cell-extract storage
Bioreactor Cultivation Allows For Upscaling Of Cell Extract Production
Cultivating bacteria is the first step in cell extract preparation. The cell extract preparation protocol of Sun et al. 1 uses shaking flask cultivation for biomass production. It recommends cell harvest in the mid-log growth phase at OD 1.8-2.0 to produce high-quality cell extract. We recorded growth curves for shaking flask cultivation and bioreactor cultivation in a lab-scale bioreactor, to compare biomass production under different culture conditions.
Growth curves for cell cultivation in a shaking flask and a 2 L bioreactor. Growth curves were approximated by fitting a logistic function (line).
The growth curve from shaking flask cultivation revealed that"
Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," binding signal to an inactivated pathway (Figure 4A and 4B). Upon receptor methylation, the conformational change required to transduce the inactivation signal, is energetically less favorable, resulting in lower occurrence. Therefore, when the same amount of ligand is present, the level of pathway inactivation is lower than in the unmethylated receptor state. Since the Tar receptor has four acidic residues that can be methylated (Q295, E302, Q309, E491), there are in total sixteen different combinations of methylation states, each one resulting in a slightly different sensitivity (Figure 4C).
Figure 4: Chemotaxis-coupled BRET activity. (A) Represents a situation in which no ligand is present and where the chemotaxis pathway is active. In this case phosphorylated CheY and CheZ interact, inducing a BRET associated luminescence. (B) Represents a situation with a high concentration ligand present, leading to an inactivated pathway. BRET associated luminescence is eliminated. (C) The same concentration of ligand is present as in B. However, since the receptors are methylated, more ligand has to be added in order for the pathway to be inactivated. This results in less YFP luminescence and relatively more luciferase luminescence, resulting in light tending more to blue then to green
Application of methylation in our biosensor
The methylation of glutamine (Q) or glutamic acid (E) residues can be mimicked by mutating these residues to alanine (A) (Krembel et al. 2015). The different possible combinations of methylation mimicking alanine mutations yields a  wide range of potential sensitivities, which we predicted with our computational ODE-model . As a proof of concept, we chose three different methylation states:
The wild type state, the unmethylated Tar receptor (QEQE, most sensitive);
A Tar receptor with one mimicked methylation site (QEAE, average sensitivity, BBa_K2736108 );
Another Tar receptor with one mimicked methylation site(QEQA, least sensitive, BBa_K2736106 ).
The Tar receptor that we received from a collaboration with iGEM team Groningen was mutated using site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in E. coli strains UU1250 and VS181, which do not express any chemotaxis receptors. In addition, VS181 does not express the methyltransferases CheW and CheB, resulting in a fixed methylation state. The E"
Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#L johnsonii_-_-_TEXT.html,", L. johnsonii is used in poultry industry by reducing diseases caused by Escherichia coli. This can significantly reduce the usage of antibiotics.
L. johnsonii in our project
In our project we used the Lactobacillus johnsonii strain ATCC33200, purchased from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Microorganismen und Zellkulturen), because this strain is certified for its harmlessness. Handling Lactobacillus johnsonii in lab, however, was very difficult. Firstly, L. johnsonii didn’t grow very well on MRS plates. Therefore liquid cultures and glycerol stocks were mainly used for cultivation.  Secondly, growth was not reliable and if grown, bacteria left log phase  after 6 hours of incubation at 37°C and died rather quickly. For this reason, passaging and transformation experiments were only possible during a small window of time in the log-phase, not afterwards."

MadLab panel discussion - 7th February 2013
The first conference that the team attended was organised by the Manchester Digital Lab (MadLab). MadLab is a community project that organises events in many different disciplines, but the team was most interested in the DIY Bio event that we stumbled across. A panel discussion was held called ‘Local Bioeconomies’, themed around what synthetic biology can do, and public literacy of this subject. The panelists included; Asa Calow, DIY Biologist and Founder and Director of the MadLab in Manchester; John O'Shea, artist and creator of the world's first bio-engineered football; Philipp Boeing, UCL iGEM ‘11/‘12 and London Biohackers; and Rod Dillon, lecturer in biomedicine, School of Health and Medicine, Lancaster University.
After the panel discussion, the team mingled with the speakers and the other guests and got some useful feedback for our early project ideas, and also some valuable advice about how to successfully plan and execute an iGEM project in general. It was a really interesting event that properly kicked off our thinking into human practices. You can watch a video all about it below!
Future Perspectives in Synthetic Biology - 8th February 2013
The following day, 8th February, the team attended a conference hosted by the University of Manchester, titled “Future Perspectives in Synthetic Biology”. The guests and speakers in attendance were a mix of academics from within the university interested in biotechnology, and industry representatives from such companies as GlaxoSmithKline and Syngenta. We already had some project ideas in mind at this point, but the various talks by faculty staff and guest speakers proved very useful for narrowing down our search. We gave a very brief presentation to the guests, introducing the iGEM competition and what it entails.
Coffee and lunch breaks were used as networking opportunities! We presented a poster with more in-depth details"

Kent,2015,Team:Kent#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," if their outlook on subjects like renewable energy sources differed. The list of MEPs to target is mentioned below.
We then drafted a letter containing 10 questions we wanted to ask them. Some of the questions were specifically about our project and others were more general, to gauge their views on synthetic biology. The letters along with the questions were sent to MEPs both by post and via email.
Besides targeting UK MPs and MEPs, we were also interested in gathering feedback from international politicians. Doing so will allow us to gauge the opinions and the different policies supported by Politicians in different countries.
While we have been successful in interviewing Franco Panizza and Anneliese Dodds (an Italian Senator), the same was not true with most of the UK MPs or MEPs we contacted. We then learned about the website WriteToThem.com to contact politicians from our local area. Local politicians are more concerned about what happens in their constituency and are more experienced with handling public complaints instead of dealing with policy planning. Nevertheless, we realized that it was still worthwhile in engaging local politicians in order to start a dialogue with them, to update them on what is happening in our lab/university and to probe whether they have ever handled any public complaints that were concerned about the energy issue. To this end, we managed to interview Terry Westgate (a local councillor of Canterbury) and Anneliese Dodds, an MEP from the South East of England .
One incident which could support our rationale was the recent rejection of the solar farm construction in Chailey, UK, where Maria Caulfield (a UK MP) has successfully campaigned against the solar farm due to the objection raised by her local constituents. It is interesting to point out that, the locals are not against renewable energy per se, but they are concerned about the location of the solar farm claiming that it will affect the view of their area.
We have encountered the issue of lack of responses from the MPs, with three of them replying that due to strict Parliamentary protocol, they could only reply to people living in their constituent (i.e. those with postcodes of the area where the MP is in charge). The advantage of using WriteTothem.com was that it allowed us to enter a postcode and the local MPs in charge of the area will be shown. We also bypassed the issue of how to address a local MP in the letter as the template is already pre-set by the website and all we had to do was write the content of the letter.  As there are eleven of us in the team, it meant that we could collect different postcodes from everyone in order to contact politicians from few different constitu"

The Effect of Dilution Rate on Bioreactor Performance
Figure 4: Dilution Rate (D) vs. Bioreactor Performance
(See Figure 4) The higher the dilution rate, the better the performance. Above dilution rate D = 1 it slowly approaches an asymptote. We should not have a D that is too large because it is energy costly. Also, a larger D leads to faster deterioration of the bioreactor.
The Effect of Initial Metal Concentration on Bioreactor Performance
Figure 5: Initial Metal Concentration (Xu) vs. Bioreactor Performance
(See Figure 5) The higher the initial metal concentration within the bioreactor, the longer it takes to operate.
The Effect of Attachment Rate on Bioreactor Performance
Figure 6: Attachment Rate (α) vs. Bioreactor Performance
(See Figure 6) The higher the attachment rate (α), the better the performance of the system. It does approach an asymptote quite quickly though. This is because of the maximum carrying capacity, at some point, there is just no more available space on the E. coli surface to bind more particle, regardless of the attachment rate.
The Effect of Detachment Rate on Bioreactor Performance
Figure 7: Detachment Rate (β) vs. Bioreactor Performance
(See Figure 7) The lower the detachment rate (β), the better the performance of the system.
The Effect of Initial Cellular Population on Bioreactor Performance
Figure 8: Initial Cellular Population (Ni) vs. Bioreactor Performance
(See Figure 8) The higher the initial E. coli population (Ni), the better the system performs. After some Ni ≈ 1, it approaches an asymptote.

The numerical simulations above were all based on parameters values specific to cobalt removal from mining waste-water. If the E. coli are coupled with a binding mechanism that is not specific to cobalt, then this generic bioreactor can be used for a large variety of applications (one simply has to change α and β).

Restriction Digest of Extracted PCR product
Restriction digest was performed using EcoRI-HF (5’) and SpeI (3’) restriction enzymes.
NEB’s Double Digest Finder was invoked and it was determined that CutSmart Buffer would be used for the digest.
The buffer was completely defrosted and shaken before use.
There is a recommended digestion protocol on NEB Cloner. 50µL reaction mixtures were set up with component volumes as recommended, except for the DNA where all 30µL of the extraction mixture (in elution buffer) were used in the digest. There would be up to 50ng of DNA in each tube of extraction mixture (from the gel bands).
Incubation at 37℃ was also done for 2 hours (ThermoMixer program 3) instead of the recommended 5-15 minutes, with shaking at 300rpm.
Restriction Enzyme Digest of the iGEM HQ linearised pSB-1c3
125ng of pSB-1C3 was dissolved in 5mL Milli-Q water.
The digest was performed using the modified NEBCloner protocol.
* We did not add phosphatase because it is assumed that with different sticky ends the vector cannot religate
DNA ‘Cleanup’ using EZNA enzymatic reaction kit
Upon completion of restriction digest incubation, the gBlocks and the plasmid backbones were purified again using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit. PCR products and plasmid backbones need to be purified in order to remove remaining impurities including agarose gel and restriction enzymes. At the elution step, the gBlock inserts were eluted using 30µL elution buffer whereas the plasmid backbone was eluted using 50µL of it.
DNA Quantification using NanoDrop
1µL water and tissue were first used to clean the stage. A blank reading was made using 1µL of elution buffer, and 1µL of each sample was measured for concentration:

FUR system
Iron is an essential element in the development of E. coli, but it can also be toxic and E. coli can be killed, if iron is absorbed in high quantity. Using the ferric-uptake regulator protein (Fur), bacteria developed an advanced system to regulate their iron homeostasis.
FUR protein (Ferric Uptake Regulator)
The Fur protein acts a transcriptional repressor for more than 90 genes involved, in majority, in iron homeostasis1,2. It plays an important role in the control of the intracellular concentration of iron in E. coli.
Fur acts as an active repressor in presence of ferrous ion (Fe2+), its co-repressor. Then, Fe2+ binds to the Fur protein (one ferrous ion per subunit of Fur). This interaction leads to a structural modification and induces the dimerization of Fur and Fe2+. Then the homodimeric Fur-Fe2+ complex binds to the DNA on a Fur binding site and inhibits the mRNA transcription. In absence of Fe2+, a disinhibiting effect occurs and mRNA can be transcribed.
Figure 1: Regulation by the Fur transcriptional factor. In absence of iron mRNA can be transcribed. In presence of iron, Fur binds the DNA, on the Fur binding site and mRNA expression is inhibited.
Fur is found at a level of 5000 copies in E. coli during exponential growth and it can reach up to 10,000 copies in stationary phase. Note that this high number of Fur protein is essential to E. coli during its development. As explained previously, Fur regulates the expression of genes involved"

NTHU_Taiwan,2017,Team:NTHU Taiwan#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the principle of market competition, and it’s difficult to apply. In consequence, it’s tough to attract farmers to join the ranks of organic agriculture. According to farmers’ dictation, the reason why they want to transform is that the idea, interest, and stable economic ability.
[ Figure. 3.1-1 ] Visit organic beekeeper, owner from Ying Hsang farming resort. We try to realize the surrounding environment of an organic bee farm, hoping that our device could help better it.
[ Figure. 3.1-2 ] Visit A-Hsiung and A-Pu organic mushroom stand. Mushroom cultivation is a quality agriculture that every single drop of water matters. They need an extraordinary fine water monitor system, which is where we can cooperate with!
What we can do is to lower the threshold and the cost of an application so as to track for a long period and make transformation faster and easier. And this may attract many farmers to join the ranks of organic agriculture. Eventually, the farmers mentioned that it is hard to avoid contamination. As long as they use the water in the downstream of the river, it is impossible to get a license. Land in Taiwan is too small, so the farms are close to each other. Once there is a non-organic agriculture nearby, pesticide and fertilizer will pollute their own farm indirectly.
[   Figure. 3.1-3 ] We interviewed one of the famous organic farmer, Ron Chi farm’s owner in Hsinchu, who shared us many dilemmas that most organic farmers faced nowadays.
(2) Aquacultural base investigation
Through the visit to the fish farm, we understand more about seem-to-be-easy fish aquaculture, which is actually connected with a lot of techniques; aside from the application of new tech concepts, there are more experience heritage and mutual cooperation from neighborhood; for example, judging the typhoon’s impact on the fish farm from the path of typhoon, the fishermen should adopt different kinds of precaution measurements depending on whether the typhoon comes from the Pacific Ocean or the Philippine Sea, or they have to apply the concepts of food chains in order to shunt the water stream to different fish pools for water cleaning; it can increase the water cycle and decrease the water waste, and moreover avoid the pollution caused by water purification chemicals. These techniques cannot be learned from school education or textbooks; this kind of experience inheritance combines with the development new technology is what we aim to move forward on our traditional agriculture. It’s a pleasure for me to learn this much about various industries in this visit.

Kyoto,2011,Team:Kyoto#Capture_-_-_TEXT.html," convinced that a liquid medium is a feasible and simple way to capture insects. If E.coli can lure insects(drosophilas), it can capture them.
Ways to lure insects
There are different ways to lure insects: smell, pheromone, and light. Smell is a popular way to attract insects, as seen in some plants. For example, the Rafflesia attracts flies by it's distinctive odor like rotting flesh. Pheromone is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers social responses in members of the same species. It is effective in very low concentration, and there are some pheromones which have different functions: aggregation, alarm, territory, and so on. Light is also a way to lure some kinds of insects by appealing to their phototaxis. Moths and flies have phototaxis. A few species use light to lure insects: Cornitermes cumulansand and Arachnocampa use light to hunt insects.
In this study, we focus on using light as the method to lure insects (drosophilas) because of the following reasons:
Lighting is a visible action and we think that it is suitable for our purpose to create animal-like E. coli.
There is an available biobrick which has the function to emit light: BBa_K3225909 created by iGEM 2010 Cambridge Team.
2. Light as a method to lure drosophilas
Drosophila melanogaster
We chose Drosophila melanogaster as one of Carnivorous E. coli’s prey, and our model organism. D. melanogaster has a positive phototaxis, lives all over Japan, and they are small (the length of its body is only a few millimeters). Besides that, it is one of the popular model organisms and available for us.
Suitable wavelength of the light to lure drosophilas
Fig.3
According to the article [1] , drosophila melanogaster has a strong positive phototaxis to the light of wavelength shorter than 500nm.(Fig.3)
BBa_K325909, one of the biobricks created by iGEM 2010 Cambridge Team, is the lux operon from the Viblio fischeri which can be used as a L-arabinose --> blue light devise. There is a graph which shows the spectrum of light emitted by V. fischeri in 2010 Cambridge Team's WIKI(--> link ). The peak wavelength is about 500 nm and we can see that"

In order to enhance the specificities towards inducers, improvements were made based on the Brown’s tri-stable switch model in 2006. This year, three well-characterized repressible promoters are used: phlFp, tetp, and lacp. The whole construct is divided into three parts, and each contains one functional system with two protein coding sequences (CDS), creating an interconnected tri-stable toggle switch. Moreover, mathematical modelling is applied to predict and verify the consistency of the experimental results. At present, it is by far possible and practical to apply the switch in biosensing which could be achieved by developing a combinatorial circuit of promoters and CDS. With its advantageous characteristics, it is foreseeable that the switch could be applied in a wider spectrum of fields in the near future, for example, biocomputational system and diseases diagnostic.

Different weight functions will produce distinct, but formally equivalent HDMR expansions. There are two commonly used HDMR expansions: Cut- and RS(Random Sampling)-HDMR. Cut-HDMR expresses <math>f(x)</math> in reference to a specified cut point, while RS-HDMR depends on the average value of <math>f(x)</math> over the whole domain <math>\Omega</math> . We adopt RS-HDMR to do global sensitivity analysis. For RS-HDMR, we first rescale variables <math>x_{i}</math> such that <math>0<x_{i}<1</math> for all i. The output function <math>f(x)</math> is then defined in the unit hypercube

Evaluation of the high dimensional integrals in the RS-HDMR expansion is carried out by the Monte Carlo random sampling. Orthogonality conditions are used to obtain the above formulas.

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.

The forth model is market prediction model. We set up this model based on HP data from the survey, which makes our model more close to the truth.
Our four models have good portability, making it possible to use in other system to deal with production simulation, hairpin coupling and market prediction. On the other hand, the basic data is needed to initialize the models and get some necessary parameter, which is OK  either from paper or from wetLab.
Hardware Overview
Microfluidics
Microfluidics deals with the behaviour, precise control and manipulation of fluids that are geometrically constrained to a small, typically sub-millimeter, scale at which capillary penetration governs mass transport. This year, we designed a microfluidics-based biological application named “Christmas Tree” to be a platform of reaction to achieve concentration gradients automatically and save reacting time. Besides, we optimized the device to be detachable by by adding conical channels at the bottom of the reaction well, so that we can do parallel experiment by changing rows of well-plates with different OD values of bacteria. In addition,we can add pressure like voltage to control the velocity of the fluid and design various sizes of channel to achieve the concentration gradients we need through fluid simulation with application, ANSYS.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportFullIntroduction_-_-_TEXT.html," the question of governementality, the scientific decision making process and democratic experimentation have to be considered in our reflexion.
As evidenced by our emphasis on the words “look” and“regard”, ethics is mainly about observation, looking before assessing. Importantly, in order to judge a situation, one needs to have access to it. That “look” on scientific production can be the look of the scientific community, the look of the outsider, the look of the judge, etc. Building ethical tools is also about building that observation, that special way to look at scientific production. I intend to create a dialogue between the “look”, the “regard” and the “speech” as the next step of this ethical perspective. That way, speech has to be thought almost as “action”, referring to the performative utterance, allowing us to consider it also in a critical perspective, by observing what kind of power, tensions and strategies  are involved in a scientific debate that covers a multiplicity of social stakes.

Section 2
Introducing our project to other iGEM team
The poster showed the topic and proposes of our project. The project is using various colored E. coli to draw a world map. These bacteria could change their color when the temperature increases. Therefore, the color of world map will be changed as well, which could mimic the process of global warming. The poster also illustrated two creative ideas; one was RNA ribosome meter controlling the translation of chrome-proteins, another was genetic circuit which made protein expression ordered.  We displayed the poster and introduced the project to other iGEM teams. They were very surprised to the RNA ribosome meter and the design of genetic circuit. Also, they gave us many significant suggestions on completing the project and improving quality.
A gentleman from USTC said: ‘First, I consider that your ideas are amazing! You can stimulate the process of global warming by culturing bacteria on medium. That is so creative. Furthermore, although you are just doing art design, your team has too much work to realize it. In all, your project this year is excellent！I can give you a little advice. Your project could closely stimulate the global climate. Why not go and achieve the up-date data of global climate? Therefore, you can control the temperature to display more detail information. If so, your bacterial map will be closer to the real world.’
Communication with a gentleman from USTC team
A lady from China-Tongji said: ‘It is a great idea to let the bacteria change their color automatically in order to stimulate the process of global warming. This can directly encourage people to feel the influence of global warming. Also, it contains of many aspects and can mimic many phenomena such as sea-level rise and interaction between coastal and inland area. This design is really delicate.’
Communication with a lady from China-Tongji
A handsome guy from NYU-Shanghai said: ‘: I think your project is really cool! I think it different! You guys are a kind of art design, but you are also very scientific. We try to do something similar. We want to do something very (scientific) also very art! Every week, we are getting closer very art. But I think you guys are still vey scientific. It is really cool!

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then"
KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Law&Patents_-_-_TEXT.html," in an even broader aspect: a general code of conduct for scientists, but also about some specific activities pertaining to synthetic biology.
At the moment there are no hard laws or even concrete policies about synthetic biology, as no particular issues are foreseen. Safety issues are covered by current regulations on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Europe. There is a framework for both ‘contained use’ and ‘deliberate release’ of genetically modified organisms. The current point of view of the European commission is that there is no need to act specifically on synthetic biology and introduce new legislation at the EC level.
However, the field of synthetic biology is followed very closely and any potential risks that could appear with advanced and sophisticated synthetic biology are monitored as there may be a need to change or add some new regulations. The biosafety regulations all over Europe, but also across the world, in the context of GMO’s are based on the fact that a traditional organism is compared to a natural host organism and the further away you move from that traditional natural organism the harder it is to assess the possible new risks. Therefore it will be very hard to compare a completely new, synthetic organism to another organism and assess the risks. This is a potential risk that will have to be addressed by policy in the future. But at the moment the EC’s opinion is that the GMO framework is sufficient to cover synthetic biology.
Governance of synthetic biology
The EC funds research projects that look into the ethical, legal and social aspects of synthetic biology, and more generally funds activities that promote exchange of information about this field. For example two years ago they had a discussion on synthetic biology in a network that is called the NEC forum, the Forum of ‘National Ethics Council’s, a network funded by the EC. In this network the members of the National Ethics Councils of the member states come together to exchange information, opinions and best practices.
Last year, initiated by the European Commission, synthetic biology was also discussed at a global summit of Bioethical advisory bodies. This global summit is coordinated by WHO as the EC works closely together with WHO and UNESCO on exchanging information about this field proactively: scientific, legal, social and ethic aspects are here of importance. The purpose of promoting these activities is to stimulate the idea that the member states themselves can follow up on these activities as there is already an existing formal governance structure. However, it is the purpose that the member states act themselves on soft-law and other kinds of activities, as these issues need to be addressed on a national level. Furthermore a funding instrument called the ‘Mobilization and Mutual Learning Action Plan’ exists at the moment"

User Guide
It's important to understand the difference between the software darwin and the utility dwndiff. Over the summer, the team produced dwndiff, which is a command-line utility for producing what are called ""diff"" files suitable for use with genomic data. darwin, on the other hand, is the overall vision of the software team: to produce a solution for tracking changes to all sorts of genomic data. Given input files in FASTA, GenBank, or ApE format, the dwndiff utility can speedily produce output files which can be used with an external version control system much more easily. Examples of such version control systems include git, svn, and hg.
Using dwndiff is somewhat complex at first, but let's start with the most obvious solution: the ""help"" command:
$ dwndiff --help       Usage: dwndiff [OPTION...] FILE...       dwndiff is a command-line tool to format DNA sequences for use in version       control systems. It is intended to be used as a backend for version control       tools which act upon biological data. It defaults to 'format' mode, where it       formats a given DNA sequence (through stdin, or the given files) to a special       format, appending the '.vcsfmt' suffix. If given the '-c' option, however, it       will take two files, convert them to .vcsfmt format if necessary, and produce a       .vcscmp file which can be used in version control software.        -p, --preformat_loc=DIR    Location of pre-existing .vcsfmt files for given       input DNA       -w, --write                Write output to file(s) instead of stdout       -c, --compare              If two files given, produce unix diff-compatible       comparison .vcscmp file       -v, --verbose              Produce verbose output       -?, --help                 Give this help list       --usage                Give a short usage message       -V, --version              Print program version        Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional       for any corresponding short options.
Let's break this down into multiple cases:
Given a genomic file, convert it to a version-controllable format, which we call vcsfmt.
Given two vcsfmt, find the difference betweem them and produce a file to be put under version control, which we call vcsc"

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production"

Biomaterials
We attempted to produce a moldable & 3D printable bioplastic by transferring the acetylation machinery from Pseudomonas fluorescens into Gluconacetobacter hansenii.
Amberless Hell Cell
We worked to create hearty, radiation, heat, & cold resistant bacteria that exemplify codon security and can't transfer engineered genes into the environment.
Material Waterproofing
Our team biomimetically pursued novel wasp proteins and bacterial wax esters that prevent water absorbance without being toxic to the surrounding ecosystem.
Biodegradability
Though cellulose acetate is an inherently biodegradable material, our team undertook to actively degrade the biomaterial to streamline the process.
Cellulose Cross-Linker
We designed a system for both strengthening cellulose and attaching biosensors and other biological cells to cellulose surfaces.
Increasingly in recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (also known as RPAS – Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems – and UAS – Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems) have transitioned from being rare sightings to becoming a staple of the 21st century high-tech mainstream. Surveillance and military uses aside, UAVs have profound potential in areas ranging from medicinal and commercial delivery to agricultural monitoring and even space exploration; however, much of their potential remains untapped. The Stanford-Brown-Spelman iGEM team reached out to a number of scientists in a wide array of fields in regards to the future of UAVs, in search for the next-step looming advancement in the industry. The feedback pointed in a clear direction – the revolutionary creation of a biological UAV.
Our team took upon ourselves this task in order to create a biodegradable UAV that would push on the boundaries of science while remaining applicable and useful to the world. We started by designing molds which were fabricated to a fungal mycelial ""body"" that was then coated with bacterial generated microbial cellulose to create a robust, durable foundation, and then re-engineered the “Amberless Hell Cell” concept to endow our UAV with pandemonium-resistant super-cells"
Kyoto,2011,Team:Kyoto#Luminescence_-_-_TEXT.html," assay with Y-maze is reliable by experiment 1, and we intended to assay the phototaxis to the light emitted by E.coli. But unfortunately, we couldn't make strong and stable light; some of our E.coli lighted weakly and others didn't. Besides, our lighting E.coli lost its light soon.
Fig.10 : Our lighting E.coli and weak green LED

Fig.12 : This experiment were performed at weakgreen light. Vertical axis indicates the average number of flies.
Instead, we covered a green LED with black film and make it light as weak as our E.coli, and we assayed with the weak green LED by the Y-maze. Here is the result. Unfortunately, the significant difference was not observed. We think that it is because the intensity of the emitted light was too weak. However, as you can see, iGEM 2010 Cambridge team succeeded to make E.coli emit light and to reinforce the intensity of the light. We think that if our E.coli can emit brighter light like them, the assay will show the significant difference.

    Since synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field, three issues were taken into consideration when design TinkerCell. First, modeling techniques in biology are still at a developing stage; second, experimental techniques are constantly evolving, especially automation and directed evolution method; third, databases of biological components are still maturing.
    TinkerCell is designed with the anticipation that the future of synthetic biology will be an intricate interplay between a variety of experimental techniques, databases that store results from experiments, and mathematical models explaining different aspects of the experiments.
    It is too much to have many functions in TinkerCell from the start. So TinkerCell uses a flexible plug-in framework, which will allow others to contribute new functions to TinkerCell. The plug-ins can be written in C, C++, Python, or Octave. Other languages, e.g. Java, might also get added to this list.
    The basic idea behind ThinkerCell is to represent a diagram that is detailed enough so that it can be mapped to models or experimental understanding of the system. ThinkerCell enables that capability in software.
    The purpose of TinkerCell’s plugin interface is to welcome contributions from the community. Additionally, the TinkerCell source code is open-source (BSD) and the application itself is free of charge. All this is intend to make TinkerCell open to community.

Introduction to Quartz 2D
  Quartz 2D is an advanced, two-dimensional drawing engine available for iOS application development and to all Mac OS X application environments outside of the kernel. Quartz 2D provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output fidelity regardless of displaying or printing device. Quartz 2D is resolution- and device-independent; you don’t need to think about the final destination when you use the Quartz 2D application programming interface (API) for drawing.
  The Quartz 2D API is easy to use and provides access to powerful features such as transparency layers, path-based drawing, offscreen rendering, advanced color management, anti-aliased rendering, and PDF document creation, display, and parsing.
  The Quartz 2D API is part of the Core Graphics framework, so you may see Quartz referred to as Core Graphics or, simply, CG.

Therefore, opening up governance measures also means that compromises will have to be made and knowledge will be a matter of perennial brokerage (Zhang et al. 2011).
Furthermore, the problem of external accountability and the fragmentation of social authorities as governance challenges play a key role in the context of eroding trust. As science could not deliver certainty, the scientific authority of expertise had to be shared with other knowledge holders in society. The legitimacy of knowledge sources hence became a claim many could always partially deliver, leaving the knowledge landscape fragmented. External accountability, then, is directly connected to the cross-borderness of synthetic biology. It concerns bridging gaps with various ‘others’, namely between scientists and engineers, scientists and societal actors from civil society and business, and between scientists and the ill-defined ‘general public’. These are all ‘external’ actors which synthetic biologists are expected to forge ties with and target engagement initiatives at. The aim of this is to “feed information into one acting entity […], with all initiatives evolving around one central actor”, but if this would happen on an institutional level, information would be communicated to create mutual trust between the concerned institutional actors (Zhang 2011: 17, 20).
Regaining Trust in the Post-Traditional Society
Despite the unfavourable conditions of uncertainty in the public sphere, the crumbling scientific tradition remains an important focal point for the expectations of the reluctant and vigilant public. Therefore, as Giddens and Pierson (1998) argue, “[t]rust offers security in the face of future contingencies” (Giddens and Pierson 1998: 109), but in a post-traditional setting, experts are given the benefit of the doubt considering that they have not ceased in their attempts to provide certainty nonetheless (Beck 1999). With regard to the use of synthetic biology, the team also confirms that there is a problem of trust. They attribute this primarily to the lack of knowledge and familiarity with how synthetic biologists operate, and that this drives a misrepresented perception of the risk involved. The challenge, then, in terms of governance measures is to embrace trust and make it ‘active’ through the merits of “equality, discursiveness, reciprocity, [and] substantiation” (Beck 1999: 116). One of the ways this can be done, in other words finding a method to recuperate trust, is through public engagement (Stebbing 2009). From that perspective, it makes sense for iGEM to"

Cadmium Detector Project Overview
The surrounding areas of Duke Energy’s Buck Steam Station have unintentionally been affected with millions of tons of coal ash containing multiple toxic chemicals including Cadmium. The release of this ash has caused the water to become a health hazard with the potential to cause a wide range of symptoms: flu-like symptoms, kidney damage, fragile bones, and possibly death through prolonged exposure. To minimize the damage caused by Cadmium in water both locally and globally, our 2012 team created several heavy metal detectors, but in 2013 we decided to concentrate on the Cadmium detector. The detector responds to the presence of Cadmium with green fluorescence. In 2014, the team worked to increase the sensitivity levels of our detector. Our detector needed to be able to respond to Cadmium at low enough levels that the detection would be useful and the presence of cadmium would not already be apparent. This year, we completed the addition of the 2007 Cambridge team's sensitivity tuners to our detector. The sensitivity tuners amplify the signal received by the detector. At the end of last year, after adding the sensitivity tuners, we began to see indications of a peak at lower levels of Cadmium than we had previously thought. To define that peak, we used test points that were closer together. We discovered a peak of fluorescence and identified our detection points.
Cadmium Detector Construction
Methods
Starting Sensitivity Tests

The cell vector encapsulates the therapeutic plasmid inside its capsid because of the Cos sequence . Thus, it can deliver the therapeutic agent in the cells, which allows a supplementary precaution, in case of the interest vector is not inside the target organ.
Back to top
The cell vector deliverance in the target organ [1,2,8]
The cell vector has two actions phase, a latency phase and an expression and release phase. During the latency phase, called lysogenic cycle, the genome stays “inactive” and no cell vector is produced inside the tissue vector . Whereas, during the expression and release phase, called lytic cycle, the genome is transcribed and replicated, in order to produce the cell vectors.
However, the tissue vector is not the natural host of the cell vector. So, if we want to induce a latency phase, we have to cause it. The deliverance system introduced into the tissue vector is designed to induce this latency phase.
The cell vector plasmid of the deliverance control induces a lysogenic cycle of this one.
The lysogenic cycle is a phenomenon naturally present in the lambda phage, the cell vector. During this cycle, the viral genome is inserted into the bacterial genome as a prophage, where every transcription is repressed. Only the cI gene, responsible of the lysogenic cycle maintain, is expressed.
The cI fixation on the operators under the control of pR and pL promoters, inhibited the genes expression and allows the lysogeny maintain. cI inhibited also its own promoter, pRM, allowing an autoregulation of its transcription.
The phage is maintained under the lysogenic form as long as cI is expressed. In the case of the DVS , the expression of cI is not controlled by the pRM promoter, but induced by the repressible promoter LacP/O fused to the cI gene. If this one is not repressed, the gene expression is inhibited, as the lambda phage natural pathway.
But, as soon as the deliverance signal of the cell vector, the doxycyclin, is injected, the LacI repressor , synthesized by the tissue vector , represses the repressible promoter LacP/O . cI inhibited, the genes can be transcribed, and the cell vector synthesized.
System without doxycyclin:
System with doxycyclin:
As soon as the cell vector is synthesized and released, the cell vectors lyse the tissue vector . This is an advantage, because it allows the destruction of the potentially"

Metabolic activity: GFP
22.07.2013
In a similar way that the DAPI stained cells give an indication of metabolic activity by showing an increase in nuclei, GFP-transformed A. niger also give an indication of metabolic activity by giving an indication on whether transcription and translation occur.
Splitting up the domains
22.07.2013
Luckily, we got some help from Kal, a really nice guy who offered a lot of help. Several very useful websites he suggested could analyse the AA sequence and give some advice on where is the possible site to split the whole protein. We combined the analysis result with references, we finally got a clear idea (or at least we believe) about the boundary of the domains.
Week 7
July (15.07 - 21.07)
Working on the Wiki
19.07.2013
The design of the wiki is making good progress. Basic layout has been determined and we created icon to indicate different parts of the project.
Article searching
18.07.2013
Totally lost in how to divide each single domain in the lovB gene. By searching the articles, we could find information and experimental details about ACP, KS, MAT and CON domain. While for the others, still virgin land. KR seems to have two subdomains, what the hell~
Database design
16.07.2013
MySQL the world's most widely used open-source relational database management system. Now we will also check the possibility to use it as our method.
Week 6
July (08.07 - 14.07)
Lovastatin strategy
12.07.2013
Now that we have the general idea the details need to be worked out. Therefore we came up with a strategy to assemble the modules using compatible restriction enzymes. The strategy will enable us to assemble several modules and to have a stop codon at the end of the assembled gene without a frame shift. Also the general planning of the project was worked out this week.
Expanding the scope
12.07.2013
To expand the scope of the modeling and create a larger overlap with the secondary metabolite backbone enzyme database we have chosen to expand the number of models. A. oryzae and A. nidulans have been added to the scope of this project. Expansion of the modeling with these three additional Aspergilli allows for a comparative approach in which results can be compared.

NAU Campus Talk
Time：April.20, 2016
Location：Library of Nanjing Agricultural University
Our team held a Campus iGEM Talk in April to publicize iGEM and our project in the university. We had three lectures: 1) introduction to synthetic biology, 2) introduction to iGEM competition and 3) the process of our project and relative preliminary project planning.
We invited Sun Zhi, the leader of 2015 NAU_CHINA, and Yang Yang, the leader of experimental group of 2015 NAU_CHINA to the Campus Talk. They shared their understanding of synthetic biology and their experience of iGEM. Yang Yang said, she had turned her interests in doing experiments to a deep affection on that and she had established a life goal of becoming a scientific researcher in the future.
These talks are not only an access for more student to understanding synthetic biology, our team and the progress of our project, but also a story of exploring his/her own interests and establish his/her own life goal.
After the Campus Talk, we found that a lot of students are interested in our team, the iGEM competition and our project. So, we held in the university iGEM Campus Trials and took the opportunity to complete the recruitment of 2017 NAU_CHINA team members.
We provided training programs for experiment and modeling applicants, but they should study “Introduction to Synthetic Biology” by themselves. After that, experiment and modeling personnel were selected through written and experimental operations. As to the selection of outreach members, applicants need to provide their own detailed outreach experience. The applicants for cloud web production and graphic design need to complete web page design and graphic design within a given time on a given theme.
After a two-month selection, we were delighted to have recruited new members to the 2017 NAU_CHINA iGEM team and bring new blood to the team.

Membrane Accelerator
- PAH Degradation & DBT Desulfurization
State of the art
Natural biodegradation is a very slow process but indispensible in environment restoration. Previous synthetic scaffold system has been used to accelerate biosynthetic pathway. We are trying for the first time to recruit scaffold system to accelerate biodegradation pathway. It offered a new direction in the application of synthetic scaffold system.
Aims
To testify the feasibility of Membrane Accelerator in Biodegradation Pathway
To accelerate degradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH)
To accelerate desulfurization of Dibenzothiophene (DBT)
To show the superiority of membrane scaffold in organizing enzymes into two dimensional pattern
Achievements
a brand-new concept proposed to apply scaffold system in facilitating biodegradation pathway
2 well-studied biodegradation pathways selected, which could potentially benefit environment restoration
Biodegradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH)
Background
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which consist of two or more fused aromatic rings, are widespread in the environment and persist for a very long time. Some PAHs are toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic and therefore are health hazards. Efforts have been made to screen bacteria strains that could degrade PAH. Moreover, many researchers focused on studying the mechanism of PAH biodegradation. But the rate of natural biodegradation is relatively slow. We are trying to build a Membrane Accelerator to speed up proceeding rate of PAH biodegradation process. Naphthalene degradation pathway in Pseudomonas species is well studied and thus recruited in our project to build PAH-degrading Membrane Accelerator. This is the very first time that scaffold system has been applied in accelerating Biodegradation pathway.
Degradation Pathway
We recruited naphthalene degradation pathway in Pseudomonas species, which has been well characterized. Six crucial enzymes are involved in naphthalene"

Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Modeling#P2A_-_-_TEXT.html," a promoter induced by arabinose, marked by promoter 6 (see in figure 2). Promoter 6 is in a suppressed state until being induced by adding arabinose, and after the inhibition is relieved, signal molecule 3O12HSL will be generated extra. We can also analyze the differential equations describing dA1C2/dt, when adding arabinose during period from t1 to t2, dA1C2/dt contains an extra item arab?(t>t1)*(t
2). The parameter arab can reflect the rate of adding arabinose nonlinearly. Here we set arab=20，t1=80，t2=120 and simulation result is presented as follow.

Introduction: Science Fiction and Human Practices
Context and Narrative
As the summer weeks went by while we were working in the lab, we realized that we were beginning to adopt a tunnel vision mindset.  We became so focused on the various technical details of how to jump through the next hoop of the project that we lost sight of what this project meant to us and the potential that it had.
In order to get new perspective on this project, we decided to have a team workshop to discuss the potential implications of our project in the distant future. With the help of our Artist in Residence, Megan Daalder, we worked to create science fiction narratives based on potential applications of our project. Although slightly fantastic, the stories that came out of the workshop led to a very interesting discussion of the role of science in society on a broader level. Talking about future implications of scientific breakthroughs in a narrative context helps us to connect more personally to new technology and is fun way to discuss these topics that can lead to a deeper understanding.
Workshop Structure
We started by discussing scientific ""storytelling"" at many different levels. How is the story of synthetic biology told by iGEM teams? How do we tell the story of how a technology might work in the future in a grant proposal? How do we tell our scientific story in a lab report or scientific paper? Where does science fiction belong in these sorts of stories?
We were asked to imagine potential futuristic applications that might stem from the results of our project. We filled out templates for possible industrial and therapeutic advancements in the years 2025 and 2050 based on our project. Many of these were somewhat fanciful, bordering on science fiction, but they broadened the scope for thinking about the magnitude of impact that science has on society.
We then exchanged papers and read over each others' predictions. We chose the predictions that we found to be the most interesting, and took 15 minutes to write brief narratives about our chosen scenarios. We took turns sharing our short stories with the"

Light control
    As a cipher machine, it must have the ability to input information conveniently. Therefore, it is crucial to have a rapid and reliable input system. After research and discussion, we finally find the ideal solution: Light-switchable two-component systems (TCSs). These two systems are green-light system (CcaS-CcaR system) and red-light system (Cph8-OmpR system). Besides, our encrypted information is in binary form, this system could satisfy our input requirement. Following is a detailed description.
    In the green-light system, ccaS protein is fixed on the cell membrane. After combined with chromophore ho1 and pcyA, ccaS could absorb green light around 520nm wavelength long, and thus, its own phosphate group will transfer, resulting in the phosphorylation of ccaR, an intracellular protein. The ccaR then could activate the expression of PcpcG2 promoter. Using this system, optical signal can be used as input, and can be received by engineered E.coli. However, after being irradiated by red light around 650nm wavelength long, the phosphorylation transfer process (from ccaS to ccaR) will be inhibited.     Similar to the green-light system, in the red-light system, phosphate group is transferred from membrane protein Cph8 (also needs the combination with chromophore ho1 and pcyA) to intracellular protein PompC, activating PompC promoter. What’s more, this process can also be inhibited after being irradiated by red light around 650nm wavelength long. The difference is activation process is carried out in the dark. In order to make input more easily, we add"
Tsinghua-A,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html,"Esophageal cancer (ICD - 10: C15) is a common cancer in China. According to the international agency for research on cancer in 2008, the world cancer incidence and death report (Globocan 2008) estimated that 481600 cases of esophageal cancer in the world, China's 259200 cases, accounting for 53.82% of the world, global 406500 cases died during this period, the China of 211100 cases (51.92%).
In China, around the Taihang mountain area of Henan, Hebei and Shanxi provinces border region, especially in Linzhou, Anyang, and Huixian, esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rates are the highest in the world, high and low rates area arranged in concentric circles, only hundreds kilometers apart. This phenomenon is prompt environmental factors play an important role in esophageal cancer occurs. The lack of nutrient elements [vitamins such as riboflavin, etc.) and trace elements (such as zinc, etc.)] , nitrite, virus (HPV) and some toxins (such as mycotoxin) is considered to be important risk factors of the disease.
Diagnosis and Treatment
Preventive Tips
1. Eat less hot or irritant food, such as hot pot, pepper, etc. Long-term consumption of such food will result in esophageal mucosa injury.  If the stimulation last for some time, it may cause inflammation of the esophagus and esophageal cancer.
2. You must be chewed before swallowing the food and eat slowly so that food will be better digested, the poisonous substance will be neutralized and bacteria will be killed.
3. Maintain comprehensive nutrition intake, to prevent malnutrition. Because if we often avoid certain food, our human nutrition won’t reach the standard. Esophageal cancer maybe occur after the lack of protein and vitamin A, B.
4. Prevent carcinogens. While carcinogenic substances mainly nitrite, a lot of food contain this kind of material, such as vegetables or meat after curing, leftovers that remain overnight and  salt will generate into nitrite at high temperature. In addition, such as mildew grain, corn, peanuts contain large amounts of yellow aspergillus. Eating many moldy food will be very easy to cause the esophageal cancer.
In addition to developing healthy eating habits, we should be patient with poor swallowing or foreign body sensation and do gastroscopy as early as possible in order to find early esophageal cancer or precancerous lesions. Remember"
