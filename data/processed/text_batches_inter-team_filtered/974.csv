We have access to Fermentas FastDigest enzymes. XbaI, SpeI and PstI were used in pair to carry out double digest. In our preliminary trial, the following combinations were used:
SpeI and PstI on K118006/CrtB
XbaI and PstI on K118014/CrtI
XbaI and PstI on K152005/CrtEBIY
SpeI and PstI on R0011/Constitutive Promoter
First lane on the left was loaded with 2-log DNA ladder. Last lane on the right was loaded with undigested K152005/CrtEBIY as negative control.
In each case, 1 ug of DNA sample was used, with 1 ul of each enzymes, 2 ul of 10X FastDigest buffer, and appropriate amount of water to make up 20 ul final volume. The protocol suggested keeping at 37 oC for 5 minutes for fast digestion, then heat inactivation at 80 oC for 20 minutes to stop enzymatic reaction.
Restriction digestion products were loaded into agarose gel with GelGreen stain and run at 80 V (constant) for 45 minutes.

Promoter response to input concentration
The pBAD promoter currently used in the amplification system is sensitive to different concentrations of arabinose, although this effect could be considered limited, so this is probably not the best promoter to use to get a sequence of outputs at different concentrations [].
Codon Optimisation for B.Subtilis and E.Coli
A comparison table for codon usage in the two species was made. For each amino acid, a codon was classed as Low, Medium or High use depending on the relative occurence in the genome. The intention is to create an optimised table for both species. A more rigorous and possibly more generally useful approach is under development.
BioBricks
The MelA gene and natural rbs was added to the registry as a BioBrick part. This part will be constructed, ligated into a vector, and sent to the registry as soon as the primers arrive.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Nickel Affinity Chromatography. 12% SDS of Tn5 (expected size 53.3kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane clarified lysate, lane 3 cell debris, lane 4 flow through, lane 5 wash1, lane 6 wash2, lane 7 Elution 1, lane 8 Elution 2, lane 9 Elution 3, lane 10 Elution 4.
No Tn5 was observed in the lysate or the elution fraction. At first, we thought an error occurred during expression, however after thorough analysis we identified our mistake. There was a miss communication between stain construction and bioprocess as a result the plasmid was in the incorrect host organism. The Tn5 plasmid was still in DH5 alpha. Going forward, all transformation into expression host will be covered by the bioprocess team, to avoid this mistake in the future.

We identified the sustainability of antibiotics as an important issue to address.  This is primarily due to the health benefits they present when used effectively, however it is now becoming more apparent to the general public that they are being abused.
To investigate this use, we consulted the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (2016) commissioned by the UK Government and the World Health Organisation’s Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance (2014).  We found that the overuse of antibiotic has become widespread throughout the world, particularly in antibiotics.
To address the preservation of antibiotics for future use, we devised a new method for treating bacterial infections in animals, which would greatly reduce the need for antibiotics in agriculture.  We showed the plausibility of this new method via our Proof of Concept.
We identified public concerns over the safety of GMOs in the environment via our survey with 50% of respondents unaware GMOs must satisfy safety requirements before use and a further 12% of those who were aware of the requirements still considered GMOs unsafe.
To investigate these concerns, we consulted European legislation on the safety of GMOs and what requirements must be satisfied before they can be approved. To address these concerns, we ensured our bacteria could satisfy the requirements of GMOs.  Further educating the public on the extensive safety requirements were found to increase the response to GMOs.
We identified ethical concerns from the public via our survey and our visit to the Glasgow Science Centre where we displayed our project and hosted interactive experiments for children.
To further investigate these concerns, we hosted a joint debate with the Edinburgh Undergraduate iGEM team where our respective University Debating Unions tackled the issues of developing GMOs.  We found the largest concerns were related to crops, and how large corporations who could develop GM seeds would hold them ransom for inflated prices to make large profits.
There were no ways to address these concerns at the debate, however the winning argument was that ethical concerns over profitability of GMOs do not outweigh the number of lives saved due to the improved performance"

Lethbridge High School
For the 6th consecutive year, we collaborated with the Lethbridge High School iGEM team providing mentorship and assistance with wet lab work, while also working together on the educational aspects of our projects. The high school team worked on creating STEAM (Science Technology, Engineering, Art, Math)  related courses for the Alberta curriculum while the collegiate team designed Professional Development day workshops for teachers using our system as a teaching aide. We worked together on developing relevant questions to ask teaching staff during interviews and a member from both teams was present for each interview. Our team also had high school members read over our protocols developed for teachers and students to see if they understood the concepts or had suggestions for improvement. In terms of mentorship, collegiate team member Chris Isaac hosted a coding workshop for the high school team to teach them coding skills and web design, collegiate team member Taylor Sheahan assisted with wet lab work and collegiate team member Sydnee Calhoun acted as an advisor for the high school team.
Validation of BBa_K2481401
The goal of the Lethbridge High School team is to create environmentally friendly pigments in E. coli as an alternative to current production methods. Our team tested their melanin construct ( BBa_K2481401 ) to see if it could be produced using the PURExpess system, providing further characterization of their part. Production of melanin in a cell-free system provides a scalable and safe method for large-scale pigment production. In theory, our system would be able to produce pigment as well. Although, initial attempts at synthesizing Melanin in vitro have not been successful.
Florida State University
In 2015 and 2016 our team had the privilege of working with Dr. Cesar Rodriguez. Over those two years, he worked with us remotely from Florida as an advisor, giving us project guidance through numerous video conference calls and visits to Lethbridge. When we heard that he would be starting a brand new team this year out of Florida State University we jumped at the opportunity to collaborate with them. We have helped each other through continued mentorship and project guidance via video conference calls. FSU was also able to"

Second fictional scenario
This fictional scenario was created as an extreme case by using the    long-term stability of Bacillus subtilis spores.
One of the advantages of our system is that the spores can survive    for several years even if they are exposed to hard conditions. So far,    studies have shown that spores exhibit incredible longevity in a broad    range of environments on our planet. Actually, there are reports from    research groups that have recovered and revived spores from samples as    old as 105 years. This data shows the capability of our    system to store information for hundreds or thousands of years, even in    a hard-conditions environment.
This application seems promising in a near future, as we found out    after the interview we had at the Groninger Archives; Jan Jaap Hoogstins,    collection manager from the Groninger Archieven, explained us that now    most of the documents are being changed from analogous data storage to    digital data storage, and one of two most important things that a    storage system must fulfil is the durability, which means that the information    stored must be conserved for a long period of time.
Spores of Bacillus subtilis are a reliable    option since they have shown its long-term resistance.    Actually, in 2000, a spore-forming Bacillus strain was    isolated from a 250 million years old salt crystals. Moreover, DNA itself is a    more stable data storage medium when compared to magnetic and optical    medial, because it can remain intact for at least 700 000 years at    -4˚C. [3] Even in harsh    environments, DNA has a half-life of over 500 years. [4] Contrastly, current magnetic storers of    information have lasts at most 30 years. [5]
However, is the DNA that contains the encrypted information in bacteria able to mutate through this period of time?
A complete discussion about mutation in Bacillus subtilis spores can be found in the Modelling Section .
A complete movie has been successfully stored in DNA
Third fictional scenario
This fictional and extreme scenario provides an example of the    future applications of CryptoGErM based on the current files and    archives that have been stored successfully in DNA.
Currently, big companies such as Microsoft® have shown interest in the    storage of information in DNA. This gives us an idea that DNA storing    has started to become one of the most promising methods to store    information in the upcoming years. This is mainly given by the capacity of    storage that"

Main Goal
Natural cycles have always fascinated mankind, probably due to the mysterious mechanisms involved in them and the power they exert in our everyday life. Since the dawn of synthetic biology, engineering oscillatory systems has been a recurrent topic, being Ellowitz's represillator a classical example. Nevertheless, to date no iGEM team has accomplished the implementation of a robust oscillatory system. That will be our challenge for this year's iGEM project.
To reach our goal we designed a synthethic circuit that links to the endogenous circadian rhythm of Synechocystis PCC6803. As a proof of concept we are going to engineer the first light-rechargeable biological lamp: Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells that emit light only by night while recovering and producing the substrates in the day. We strongly believe this will serve as an enabling tool to any project requiring time control over a biological behaviour independently of the user's input.
Furthermore, the characterization of this chassis is a fundamental step to explore new systems with minimal inputs to replace E. coli, for example, in the biotechnological industry in order to achieve greener processes.

We gave out our booklets ""Shape and Sound"" in SUSTech. We called on ear caring and public awareness on hearing loss.
Approaching the Public
We designed a questionnaire on the internet (link: sojump ) and investigated about whether people know about iGEM, and their experiences related to hearing-impaired people. We collected about 500 answers and did data analysis shown as below.
Question 1: Have you ever communicated with hearing impaired people in your daily life?
Despite the large amount of hearing-impaired people shown in the statistical data, fewer people have communicated with people with hearing loss. The communication difficulties may make them never have chance to come into contact with normal people.
Question 2: Do you know how to use sign language to communicate with people?
We found that very few people can use sign language to communicate, even simplest words. The reason could be the lack of attention to hearing-impaired people, or the lack of sign language spreading itself. Whatever, popularize sign language is impending.
Question 3: Do you find it difficult to communicate with people with hearing difficulties?
For those who have communicated with hearing-impaired people, about 80% feel it difficult. Undoubtedly, this is the truth. To eliminate this trouble, on one hand, sign language should be popularized. On the other hand, hearing aids and cochlear implants and clinical therapies need to be improved and pervaded.
Question 4: If sign language classes is added in general education as optional courses, would you like to learn some simple sign language?
More than half of the people expressed their interests into sign language learning. Actually, most people hold their kind heart to treat people with inconvenience.
Question 5: Do you know iGEM? (before answering this questionnaire)
Actually, because our questionnaire was spread to the public, half of people investigated have not heard about iGEM before. We have the necessity to make more people know synthetic biology and know iGEM, for these really change our world.
Consultation
To obtain more information about the life of people with hearing impairment, we consulted specialists who work in various areas, as well as some relevant local charity or official associations. From the dimension of Policy, Law, Medication, Philanthropy and Research, we consulted lawyers and judges, doctors, professors and managers of several charity organizations. At the same time, we introduced our project and received suggestions to promote our project.
Law

Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Interviews#Policy Ethics Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," an internationally accepted standard for synthetic biology. His insights greatly informed  the creation of the policy proposal .
Jessica Tucker
We spoke with Jessica Tucker, the Director of Office of Biotechnology Activity at  the NIH, to discuss our proposed policy and to learn more about the NIH as an  institution. From our conversation, we learned that the NIH is not a regulatory agency, so  it would be unable to enact our proposed policy. She expressed that while the ideas in  our proposal were well thought-out and valid, it served more as a tool to enable  discussion and conversation rather than a full-fledged policy. In response to this point,  we decided to shift our focus away from submitting our proposal to a department for  approval. Rather, we redefined the goal of the proposal as fostering discussion about  synthetic biology regulation and biocontainment legislation.
While guidelines for genetic engineering do exist, they are at least forty years old  and do not fully account for new developments or issues in the field. The guidelines are  set in place to manage all laboratory practices regarding synthetic biology. With that in  mind, any change that would incorporate environmental release of an organism would  be drastic and unlikely.
After discussing our proposal and the NIH, Jessica Tucker offered some possible  organizations that we could contact to initiate discussions. Those organizations included  regulatory agencies such as the EPA and FDA, and while we had already considered  contacting them, Mrs. Tucker’s feedback encouraged us to pursue additional contacts.
Alan Pearson
To reinforce our policy proposal further, we contacted a member of the United  States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA  APHIS), Alan Pearson. We sent him our policy proposal for his review and he offered us  corrections and suggestions. The most significant advice he gave us was to avoid  assuming that a biocontainment device can be evaluated independently of the organism  in which it is instantiated because it can be caused by the organism itself or the  environment. We took this recommendation into consideration while making revisions to  our proposal.
Todd Kuiken
Earlier in the summer, we spoke to Dr. Lisa Lee, who suggested we contact the  Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars to learn more about how the  recommendations in the New Directions: the Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging  Technologies report were carried out. We were fortunate enough to speak to Dr. Todd  Kuiken, then an investigator at the Wilson Center and current co-chair of iGEM Human  Practices. Dr. Kuiken also works closely with community biolabs to ensure safety  protocols are followed within these labs, which align"

Last year, the iGEM UPMC 2017 team contacted Miss Yasmine Bellagha, a biology teacher in Maurice Genevoix High school in the city of Montrouge. This year, she wanted to organize the same practical course in one of her classes. She was very happy to hear about the iGEM competition. Her former students really liked this practical course last year.
The practical work took place in two sessions:
- First session: (4 hours – 10/08/2018)
- Second session: (2 hours – 10/16/2018):
We wanted to transmit some fundamental biology notions.  During these 2 sessions, three main educational interests were brought to the fore: - Initiation to microbiology: use of the microscope, discovery of culture media, dilution and spreading techniques and learning to work under sterile conditions.
- Approaching the genotype-phenotype relationship showed that the phenotype is directly linked to the genotype and that traits are transmitted from generation to generation.
- Studying the mutagenic effect of UV on yeasts proved that UV acts directly on DNA by introducing mutations (appearance of mutants, decrease in the number of clones, lethal effect).
This experience was very rewarding to us. The pupils really enjoyed the practical course and were very thankful. We are very grateful to Mrs Bellagha who did her best to provide anything we asked for to organize the practicals and she fully trusted us in our work with her students.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
When researching metal binding and interactions between metals and peptides, we realized that few teams or researchers focused on isolating the specific manner of interaction and determining the thermodynamic parameters pertaining to the affinity. We utilized a method called Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) to characterize this, and quantitively understand the specifics of how our rationally designed peptides and fusion proteins bound copper. The dual approach of understanding the molecular underpinnings of our filter in addition to more macroscopic effects (such as the Phen Green SK copper assay for bulk surface adsorption) allowed us to definitely conclude that our filter behaves according to our hypothesis and supports the claims pertaining to copper binding that we subsequently make What follows is a summary of how ITC (and QUARK ab initio modeling) was used in our study.
ITC Specifications
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; MicroCal iTC200) was employed to determine the association equilibrium constant (Ka), enthalpy (ΔH), and the number of ions bound per ligand (n). Ka describes the affinity of a ligand for its substrate, and we used it to quantitatively characterize the interaction between our peptide and copper [21]. All binding parameters for the test were within the specifications determined by the manufacturer. We used 10 mM, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer for testing because it does not cause metal ion interference, and has a stable pKa over a wide temperature and pH range. Experiments were conducted at pH 5.5 to prevent copper precipitation, and pre-made copper stock solutions of known concentration were used.
Peptides were prepared for ITC by dissolving lyophilized protein (powder) in MES buffer, and ITC experiments were run at 25°C and set to deliver 20, 0.5 – 1 µL injections of Cu at 150 second intervals. The metal solution in the syringe was titrated into the peptide solution in the cell,"

Raising Money and Awareness
Bake Sale
No one can resist fresh baking, and so we hosted a bake sale in the laboratory building to spread the word about Cystic Fibrosis and The Lung Ranger. We raised money for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, educated members of the University about Cystic Fibrosis and spread the word about the work we were doing. We also saw a bit of healthy competition between the Dundee iGEM Team, to see who would be crowned the ‘Star Baker’. It was a close call between Fatima's ‘Lung Ranger Oreo Cheesecake’, Gillian’s tasty traybakes and Dave’s delicate raspberry and chocolate bites...
Sponsored Runs
We had to work off the cake we’d got used to eating in the Division of Molecular Microbiology somehow. Various members of the team decided to run either a 10K or a Half Marathon to raise money for the CF Trust; the main National Charity in the UK, which supports people living with CF.
Overall we raised £787.15 (U.S. $1262.08) for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust through our runs and bake sales.

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.
Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.

When we left Hannover Monday morning, we decided to stop by in Bielefeld to meet the rest of their team. This way they, too, got to test our OD and fluorescence measurement device and we got to eat some delicious ribes cake :)
Five hours later, we left the Bielefeld team to eat some incredibly spicy pizza and continued our journey back home to Aachen. On the autobahn, we took the time to write down all experiences and things we learned to share them with our team in the coming days.
tl;dr: We had an awesome trip to the MakerFaire Hannover, presented our devices to hundreds of people and met the teams Braunschweig and Bielefeld.

Cambridge-JIC,2015,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"
High light intensity at emission wavelength reaches the CCD
High contrast on CCD: emission light intensity much higher than background levels
Minimal stray excitation light reaching the CCD
These are the features that we look for in the graphs that the script produces.
The Solution
For commercial microscopes, full filter sets are readily available. However, for the OpenScope, we had to source and pick the filters ourselves. Each filter is characterized by its transmission curve: the percentage of light it transmits at particular wavelengths. This information is available directly from the retailer or can be obtained by spectrophotometric analysis. However, the graphs themselves are not very helpful in choosing the best filters you need. A short python script was developed that helped us assess the expected performance of different filter combinations. By modeling the excitation and emission spectra as Gaussian distributions and analyzing the spectrophotometric data about each filter, we could predict and justify filter sets which worked and those that didn't. The script is included in the download (see below) and commented to explain exactly how it works. In short, it rescales the light intensity at all wavelengths after interaction with a filter with given specs (using simple multiplication). As an output, the program produces 4 plots, from which it is easy to visually assess the performance of the filter set.
The code in the package contains our worked GFP example. If you want to adapt the code for your own use simply swap the text files for files containing the specs of your filters, and make sure to change the excitation and emission peak wavelengths in the script.
download package
Note: To run the script you will have to install Python. If you do not already have it, installation instructions are available on the Python Wiki .
A Worked Example: GFP Filter Set
This is the output of the program for the filters used in OpenScope for imaging GFP:
Fig 1: The raw specifications of the filters
Fig 2: The excitation light (blue) reaching the sample: the LED spectrum scaled by the effect of it passing through the excitation filter and being reflected by the dichroic mirror. Note the high intensity peak at around 476nm, which is the excitation wavelength for the type of GFP we are imaging.
Fig. 3: The emission light (green) from the sample reaching the CCD: the approximated spectrum of emission (with its characteristic peak at around 512nm for GFP) scaled by the effect of light passing through the emission filter and the dichroic mirror. Note the high contrast (ratio of peak intensity to background intensity) - it is essential for successful imaging.

Figure 8. Differential expression level of the proteins quantified by iTRAQ mass spectrometry. Each of the 472 quantified proteins has been represented for each group of samples: WT (blue line), Bb1-expressing strain (green line), and e.a.p. (empty Amp plasmid)-carrying strain (red line). Proteins on the X axis ordered in decreasing confidence level.
As deduced in Figure 7, a very low number of proteins strongly changed their expression in the strains carrying Bb1 or the empty plasmid. Several statistical tests (FDR-corrected ANOVA, T-test, p-value-weighted analysis) were performed with these proteins, and only three of them proved to be significant in all the tests. These proteins were the GFP (only present in Bb1 strain), the β-lactamase (present in both Bb1 and ᴓ strains), and the chaperone protein DnaJ, which was particularly abundant in the strain expressing Bb1. The high expression of chaperone proteins was expected, since many molecules of GFP need to be properly folded in order to avoid the formation of inclusion bodies and cellular toxicity.                   From this experiment, we have to conclude that the expression of a simple Biobrick part such as a fluorescent protein in an E. coli cell does not alter the proteomic architecture of the chassis in a significant way. Therefore, Biobrick part 1 could be considered orthogonal with respect to chassis' parts.
4. Conclusions
Surprisingly, standard fluorimetry assays show an assymetric output of red and green fluorescent proteins in co-transformed cells.
Flow cytometry confirms this asymmetric activity and strongly suggests the co-existence of sub-populations of cells with different outputs. This asymmetry proved very reproducible among cultures, and matched the predictions of our theoretical model.
The activity of fluorescent proteins dramatically changes over time, reaching a peak when cells are in the stationary phase. Despite being under the control of the same promoter, GFP is expressed earlier than RFP. To the question “are two Biobricks orthogonal?” we thus suggest to add this other question: “when are they orthogonal?”
Proteomic analysis reveals the robustness of E. coli confronted to heterologous gene expression: only minor proteomic changes were found compared to the controls. An orthogonal relation between Biobrick part 1 and the proteomic architecture (chassis) is thus confirmed.

The gels that incubated overnight were transferred to new medium with roughly equal OD and then were induced for protein expression. After incubating again they were washed with water, pictured for red fluorescence and  then placed again in cell-free medium, adding EDTA to one R15 culture. EDTA should chelate the calcium and denature the Adhesin, causing the cells to detach from the gel. If Adhesin binding works as we hope it should make this gel less fluorescent than the R15 without EDTA. Pictures of the red fluorescence were taken.

Future work on the project will include extending the types of toxic organic molecules that it is capable of degrading to molecules that are metabolized by cells (Figure 1). These molecules include naphthene, anthracene, and fluorene, which can be further degraded to catechol. The ability to degrade these chemicals to catechol will complement the prototype kit and increase its effectiveness at tailings pond remediation. The current heavy metals we are able to target for decontamination are iron and cobalt. We will target additional metals by using in vitro evolution of the Mms6 enzyme to change its specificity for different heavy metals. In addition, optimization of the kit for different stages of tailings pond remediation can be performed. Kit optimization for different tailings pond stages and conditions will allow for universal use in a variety of tailings ponds found in every corner of the globe.

The ligation of nptIIBB with PtrpC was desalted, transformed into E. coli using electroporation, and plated.  Antibiotic stocks of geneticin and phosphinothricin were made at 100x concentration. G. lucidum cultures were inoculated with varying levels of antibiotic to test the strain's sensitivity for future selection purposes.
Today we worked with fungi! We applied different amounts of antibiotic to G. lucidum, to test the sensitivity of our strain of fungi.  In addition, cloning of pCg13Y was nearly completed.

Colony PCRs and cultures were completed to determine the success of cloning nptIIBB downstream of PtrpC.  Unfortunately, a gel revealed that the DNA fragments appeared at 0.6kb, shorter than the expected 1.4kb of a successful ligation. pC13Z and pAK13AD were miniprepped, but had to be thrown out due to contamination of our EB.  New cultures were made to be miniprepped again.  A glycerol stock of pC13Z was also made.
Cloning of nptIIBB in front of PtrpC was unsuccessful. Plasmids pC13Z and pAK13AD were prepped for cloning.

This week, drylab split up so members could focus on their strengths.   Rebecca and Sara began designing our feedback controller, with some much appreciated advice from the previous drylab team leader, Dan Levine.  Ritvik, Manny, and Mac began coming up with design considerations for the incubation chamber.  We were most concerned with size; too small and it wouldn't be useful, too big and it would be difficult to control any variables.  We eventually decided that a 1'x1'x2' chamber would probably be a good compromise.  Rebecca, Sara, Ritvik, and Mac also attended machine shop training this week.  In order to complete our training, we each had to construct a small aluminum lamp using a milling machine and a lathe.  Fortunately, everyone emerged from the training session one lamp richer, and with a full set of fingers on each hand"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"
Slovenia,2008,Team:Slovenia#Notebook#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"1 (CGSC #9586). As the mutant has no gene for the T7 RNA polymerase, we used the λDE3 Lysogenization Kit (Novagen) to integrate λDE3 prophage into the E. coli host cell chromosome. λDE3 is a recombinant phage carrying a cloned gene for T7 RNA polymerase under lacUV5 control.
We also used the bacterial ghost (BG) system as a novel vaccine delivery vehicle (kindly provided by Haas). BG are nonliving Gram-negative empty bacterial envelopes. They enhance immune responses against envelope-bound antigens, including mucosal immunity and T-cell activation. Further advantages of bacterial ghost vaccines are safety, simplicity of the production method and the fact that they can be stored and processed without the need for refrigeration. E. coli strain JW1908-1 were transformed with a BG plasmid, coding the lysis gene E under a temperature controlled promotor in order to lyse and empty the bacteria of their cytoplasmic contents. Controlled expression was induced at 42° C.
 
 
PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN MODIFIED BACTERIA
 
To show expression under control of the T7 promotor, we transformed E. coli JW1908-1 with a GFP construct in the pET19b vector. Bacteria were grown in LB medium. The addition of IPTG induced the expression of GFP, assessed by flourimetric measurements. The same experiment was used to prove GFP expression under control of the constitutively active tetR promotor.
 
 
LUCIFERASE REPORTER ASSAY
  
The dual luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the activation of TLR5 with flagellin and constructs that comprise citosolic signaling (TIR) domain of TLR3, TLR4 or TLR9.
For signalization studies reporter genes are used, that are composed of a promotor, which is activated upon TLR activation of interest and a gene coding for light-emitting enzymes. In our experiments firefly luciferase (fLuc) gene under control of NFκB or IFNβ inducible promotor was used as a reporter for TLR5, 4 and 9 or TLR3 activation, respectively. Apart from fLuc reporter and TLR constructs, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with another luciferase reporter (coding for Renilla luciferase) under constitutive CMV promotor control. Its activation-independent expression and specificity for a different"
WPI_Worcester,2016,Team:WPI Worcester#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"GFP plus mCherry reporters were recorded in Figure 2a and Figure 2b.
In Figure 2a, the ATG reporter seems to produce less green fluorescence than the positive control.  The amount of red fluorescence is similar in the positive control and the ATG reporter. It was also noted again that the same cells that showed high levels of green fluorescence also showed high levels of red fluorescence. To ensure that the high levels of RFP did not influence measurements of eGFP, when calculating green fluorescence, the value for green was divided by the fluorescence value of red.
Background fluorescence was also taken into account through the creation of a negative control. This negative control lacked an eGFP plasmid and was created from the same line of cells as the other samples. The averaged value of the green fluorescence of the negative control was subtracted from the other samples as a way to remove background fluorescence. The negative control cells under green and red fluorescence filters were recorded in Figure 3a and Figure 3b.
Figure 3a & 3b: ACG eGFP reporters, HEK293T cells, green/red fluorescence, 100X. The two images are of the same field.
In Figure 3a, the only visible cells show a very low level of GFP expression, while most cells cannot be seen. There is a visible difference between Figure 2a and Figure 3a, which suggests that the mutated start codon did have an effect on the translation of the eGFP.
The quantified data indicates relatively high efficiency in the ATG/ACG reporters. According to the microscopy data (Figure 4), the ATG reporter showed 70.57% of fluorescence compared to the positive control, while the ACG reporter only gave 4.21%. Therefore, the mutated start codon is proven to be able to produce the difference between the two versions of the reporter.
Figure 4: Efficiency of ATG/ACG reporters compared to positive control. Error bars represent standard error between normalized results from 3 biological replicates of the experiment. (Standard error <0.05)
The results were further validated using flow cytometry as part of the collaboration with BostonU Wetlab . The results show that the ATG reporter has a similar level of fluorescence compared to the positive control, while the ACG reporter shows much less (7.21%), similar to the microscopy results.
Figure 5: ATG/ACG reporters efficiency confirmation by flow cytometry. The difference between the wild type and mutant reporter is consistent with the microscopy data.

Week of 9/21/14 through 9/28/14
This week we are going to keep working on our assay of Beta-galactosidase activity. So far we have had two unsuccessful attempts at our run-through of it with intact cells. This week we started it a third and fourth time and had success! Our E. coli C turned to a red color along with our K1477014 part. Not only that, but our negative control stayed negative. Everything worked out perfectly except for the time elapsed to get these results. We expected it to take 12-14 hours for a color change to occur, but it ended up taking about 36 hours in one instance and a little over 48 hours in the last attempt. However we are still pleased to have achieved success (we are still fighting contamination.)
We also did two runs of this assay with chemically lysed cells. In the first run through, we got positive results. However, an inquiry led to the discovery that one of the chemicals used could potentially denature any enzymes present, and so we had to throw out that data. The second time we used an appropriate chemical, but had positive results on everything-including the negative control. We are now out of our required materials for chemically lysing cells.
Week of 9/14/14 through 9/20/14
This week we began our attempts on the Beta-galactosidase activity assay. We plan to run this assay three different ways. We will first complete it using intact cells, measuring the activity that is produce inside the cell. Then we will use chemically lysed cells. By lysing the cells in this way, we are ensuring a higher accuracy in regards to amount of cells being lysed. The chemicals will destroy the cell wall and the beta-gal complementation can occur in vitro.
Finally, we plan to bring the core idea of our research project together, and then we will run this assay using cells that have been lysed with bacteriophage.
In all of these, we will be using chlorophenol red (CPRG) as the substrate. This will cause a color change that ranges from yellow to dark red. We are using Top 10 E. coli cells as our negative control. These only produce one out of the two parts that make up the enzyme. We will be using E. coli C as our positive control. We are testing the"

Hi. I'm a third year bachelor Nanobiology student . The reason I joined iGEM was to get more practical experience. I learn a lot during my study programme, but I also wanted to learn how to use that knowledge. I am the Public Relations Manger of the team, but I also help a lot with the modelling and the lab work.
Anne Rodenburg
I'm a fourth year student, studying biological and medical laboratory studies. I joined the team to gain more practical experience, and insight in different subjects. Together with the entire team, I believe that we'll be able to set up a great project. I am the Fundraising and Budget Manager of the team.
Social activities
Besides all the hard work in the office and lab, we became friends and did a lot of activities with the team. It was a great experience to learn more about each other.
A team is not only about getting the work done, but also about trust and having fun. To work on our teamwork and spirit we did some team sports like beach volleyball and basketball. After intensive sporting we always enjoyed beers.
We also had beer time during the hottest day of the summer, when we took a day off and relaxed at the beach of Scheveningen. Additionally, we all enjoyed the free barbecue with drinks in company of the Netherlands’ very occasional sun after the business case.

The endo-beta-glucanase (bglS) will cleave internal 1,4 linkages adjacent to 1,3 linkages. A secretion system has been designed to release the enzymes from the bacteria. In future experiments, other enzyme-producing genes will be added to break down plant material further. Cellulase genes are first in line, as cellulose is the largest composition of cell wall. The 2008 Edinburgh team designed the genes required to break down cellulose into glucose. These are an exocellulase, an endocellulase, and a beta-glucosidase. Other enzymes required to fully degrade plant material would be added as well.
Overall, this project and the secretion system that it provides will be advantageous and beneficial to future iGEM teams as well as developing countries.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html,"ban. A kutatás-vezérelte 21. századi világban hitünk a bölcsek kövének  létezésében elhalványult. Még mindig kutatunk, nemcsak a hosszú és  egészséges életre keresünk megoldásokat, hanem a modernizáció során  kialakult ökológiai problémákra is. A múlttal ellentétben, úgy  gondoljuk, hogy nemcsak egyszerűen a természetben rejlő mágikus  összetevők után kell kutatnunk, hanem ezek által inspirálva új  eszközöket kell kifejlesztenünk válaszként a társadalmunk által  fektetett kihívásokra.
Tarts velünk egy utazásra, ahol megismerhetsz egy új molekulacsaládot,  amely forradalmasíthatja a mesterséges biologiát: a nem-riboszomális  peptid szintetázokat. Megtanítjuk hogyan aknázd ki az bennük rejlő  hatalmas lehetőségeket teljesen szintetikus, egyedi funkcióval ellátott  peptidek létrehozására, melyek alkalmasak lehetnek például az arany  újrahasznosítására elektronikai hulladékból.
Tégy egy próbát! Csatlakozz a kutatáshoz!

Nitrite
Nitrites are completely natural compounds that are parts of the natural nitrogen cycle and they are nitrates reduction products.
The nitrate ion is one of the principal azote sources for plants. Thus natural or synthetic commercial fertilizers contain a lot of these compounds and are largely used to increase crops yield from 30 to 50% (Stewart,2005).
High nitrate water concentration have detrimental effects on living organisms. In fact, nitrites are nitrates reduction products that are responsible for Blue Baby Syndrome. This syndrome can occur when nitrate level is above 100 mg/L (SNIDE) in groundwater.
Symptoms start from a cyanosis and if it is not treated on time, can cause cerebral lesions and death.

Most of the rules and strict safety thresholds about these compounds concern drinking water.

Heavy metals
Heavy metals are one of the most important family of pollutants. For our project, we chose to focus on two of them, lead and cadmium. All heavy metals exist in surface waters in colloidal, particulate, and dissolved phases.
The majority of lead in the environment comes from human activity such as burning fossil fuels, mining, and manufacturing. It is used in the production of batteries, ammunition, metal products etc... Because of health concerns, use of lead has been dramatically reduced in recent years.
Cadmium does not corrode easily and has many uses, including batteries, pigments, metal coatings, and plastics. Moreover, all soils and rocks, including coal and mineral fertilizers, contain some cadmium.
Living organisms require trace amounts of some heavy metals ("

Finding the minimum $r$,
$$\frac{dE_{total}}{dt} = 0$$ $$\frac{3k_B T}{Na^2} r - 3\frac{k_b T a^3 N^2}{2r^4} = 0$$ $$\frac{r}{Na^2} = \frac{a^3 N^2}{2r^4}$$ $$r^5 = \frac{1}{2}a^5N^3$$ $$\therefore r = (\frac{1}{2})^{\frac{1}{5}}aN^{\frac{3}{5}}$$
Substituting in values used in simulation ($N_{seg} = 100, a = 1$):
$$r = 2^{\frac{1}{5}}100^{\frac{3}{5}} \approx 13.8$$
This theoretical value is slightly larger than the simulated value. For the rest of the model, we shall use the empirical value. Since we used $a = 1$, we can use the relationship $r = 12.57 \times a$.
Defining the Model
Our overall goal is to model the reaction kinetics of a solution where enzymes are connected to the star peptide and compare it to the kinetics of when the enzymes are floating freely in the solution. In the diagram below, the colour dots represent different enzymes. Assume:
The concentrations of all enzymes and the star peptide are the same in both scenarios and are denoted by the constant $C$
The substrates for the enzymes are floating around freely, and their concentration is a non-limiting factor
Scenario A
For a given enzyme concentration of $C$ molar, the mean square displacement (the average length between each enzyme) is:
$$ \begin{align} C M &= C \frac{mol}{L}\\ &= 1000C \frac{mol}{m^3}\\ &= 6.022 \times 10^{26} C \frac{particles}{m^3}\\ \end{align} $$  $$ \begin{align} MSD &= (\frac{1}{\frac{particles}{m^3}})^{\frac{1}{3}}\\ &= (\frac{1}{6.022\times 10^{26"
NCTU_Formosa,2012,Team:NCTU Formosa#Project-sub5_-_-_TEXT.html,"anol requires combinations of biological events(production of xylanases, hydrolysis of the polysaccharides in the biomass, temperature controlling, and production of isobutanol) in one reactor. CBP has gained recognition as a potential breakthrough for low-cost biomass processing. So, if we incubate E.coli with this mechanism with our isobutanol-synthesis E.coli, we can cost down the expenses of enzyme purification. Finally, the reactor as a whole will be more like a biofuel production line!
Cellulose Degradation
Furthermore, we found another potential way on coverting cellulose into glucose by utilizing the Biobrick from 2008 and 2011 Edinburgh igem team. Edinburgh2008 iGEM team found out three Coding parts on cellulose degradation,cenA: BBa_K118023 (endoglucanase), cex: BBa_K118022 (exoglucanase), and bglX: BBa_K118028 (beta glucosidase). Edinburgh2011 iGEM team able to display bglX (a cryptic E.coli β-glucosidase gene) and the exoglucanase cex on cell surface. Therefore, through MUG assay and MUC assay, bglX and cex can be proven its effect. Because bglX is capable of degrading the substrate MUG, which has a β (1→4) bond, similar to that of cellobiose. So in the future work, we can use an INP-β-glucosidase fusion ( BBa_K523008 + BBa_K523004 ),which INP( BBa_K523008 , based on BBa_K265008 ), a carrier for displaying enzymes on cell surface, can be used to carry proteins to the cell surface, by constructing BBa_K523013 with a new β-glucosidase (bglX) BioBrick, BBa_K523002 .
Biofuel Industry
Figure 30.We hope to make an automatic control instrument in the future.
Next, we will focus on researching the reaction rate, intermediate, and by-products of mechanisms. For example, the retention time for producing a certain concentration of 2-ketoisovalerate per 300 ml culture medium under different processing parameters!
With the data, we can optimize the Eco-line economic justification; design the flow rate, vessel capacity, the driving equipment and instrumentation for totally auto-controlled system.  Thus, we can build a manufacturing automation technology to produce isobutanol inexhaustibly"

今回は2年生が研究室に立ち寄って、実際に大腸菌を見せてもらったようです。 実物を見るとさらにイメージがわくのではないでしょうか。（見てない人は別の機会にぜひ見せてもらいましょう） 3年生は学生実験などの事情で参加できませんでした。
今回は勉強会を兼ねてと考えていましたが、資料を配るだけになりました。読んできて、分からないところを質問する方式ということで。
事例研究については、予定に書いてある3人と川崎君がimperial 2007をレビューしました。 biobrickという話がまだ出ていないので、なかなか進めにくい状況かもしれません。
どんなことを、どのような方法で取り組んで、どのような結果になったのか、といったことを知ることを中心に話をしました。 事例研究をするということを中心にしたため、終わってから雑談が多かったのが残念です。 自然に企画案についてブレインストーミングできるようになれば進むのではないでしょうか。
2006,2007に出たすべてのプロジェクトについて一行程度でどのようなことをやったかということをまとめていくつもりです。

Our Concerns
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries.        One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation        of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle       vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that        A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by        spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin).        These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and        even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and        capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ic acid. Growth of Y. lipolytica is feasible on all. The results support the substrates screening experiments.
From PHPP investigation, we propose the “line of optimal”, the best combination of C source and O2 uptake rate to support optimal growth for each substrate. This line is the brightest line through the plot, it represents the optimal oxygen  uptake rate for the given substrate uptake rate, and vice versa.
It can be seen that Y. lipolytica grows best on simple sugars, like glucose and fructose, (Figure 1 and 2), indeed, the PHPPs for glucose and fructose are almost the same. Y. lipolytica can grow almost.anaerobically on simple sugars. Sugar substrates provide a stable PHPP, where there is a very large phase area, resisting substrate induced phenotypic change (Figure 5 and 6). We see large area on PHPP where O2 and sugar uptake rates affect the growth rate almost equally. A relatively small area where sugar level is low shows an decreased growth rate with increased O2 uptake. So if we want to keep the growth rate high, then we must not cross the line of optimality, beyond which we falls into the small region where O2 uptake rate is must be constrained by sugar uptake rate to keep growth high.
Glycerol shows higher requirement for O2 and glycerol balance, and lessened ability to grow anaerobically (Figure 3). We see a narrower area where growth rate is affected equally by O2 and glycerol. We have more phases than simple sugar PHPP, showing phenotypic changes are more easily induced by substrate changes, the phases near the axes shows if we have either glycerol or O2 to be too quickly uptaken, we lose growth rate (Figure7 and 11). Balance of glycerol and O2 is very important for optimal growth. Indeed, the line of optimality has a higher gradient than that for simple sugar.
Oleic acid shows very demanding media condition, where oleic acid uptake rate must be low, and O2 uptake rate must be high (Figure 4). We see a large infeasible region, and maximum growth rate in the total simulated conditions are about a half of the other C sources. However, this does means that for the PHPP regions where Carbon source is sparse, Oleic acid cna deliver a lot more growth than the other C sources, given we also have high O2 uptake rate. This property is promising and fits our vision of Yeastilizaiton, turning waste"

Single Cell ODE Model for the Recombination Module
1 Overview
The ﬁnal module in our construct is the Recombination module. In this module, we use Cre recombinase to separate the         origin of replication from the rest of the plasmid. Plasmids whose origin of replication has been recombined out         are referred to as ”knocked out” plasmids.
In our model, we seek to model the knockout eﬃciency after some set amount of time has elapsed since the introduction         of Cre recombinase into the cell culture, which we deﬁne as
. That is, it         is the proportion of plasmids whose origin of replication is knocked out from the original set of plasmids. Here, we         start the simulation with Cre being constitutively produced from the Time Delay module at the same concentration.
The system of reactions generally follow the analysis of Cre recombinase in [1] and can be visualized as in the diagram         below.
In the construct, there are two lox sites on the plasmid which ﬂank the origin of replication. When both lox sites         are bound to two Cre molecules, the plasmid (S) can undergo recombination where the plasmid is cut and separates         into two plasmids (P1, P2), in which one has the origin of replication and the other does not.
As shown in the diagram above, the binding of Cre to the lox sites can be in diﬀerent orders. Notably, the binding         of Cre to molecules to a lox site is cooperative, meaning that the binding of the second Cre to a lox site is made         more favorable when the ﬁrst Cre has already bound to that site.
Once there are four Cre molecules on the same plasmid, the Cre recombinase can catalyze a recombination reaction to         produce a recombined product"

As our project involves the use of dcas9 and sgrna, safety considerations needed to be made while designing our project.
Safety Report
Abstract
Endonucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9, though known for their potential in synthetic biology to result in double-stranded breaks in the DNA, allowing for efficient insertions of target mutations, harbour the danger of creating a gene drive which can affect and propagate in the wild-type strain species. We, uOttawa iGEM team, will demonstrate that despite using dCas9, our project does not consist of a gene drive.
Project description:
The goal of this project is to overcome the lack of transcription factors when designing genetic networks in yeast. We use dCas9 machinery (including gRNA) to assess the possibility of designing a NOR gate.
Guarantee of no release:
All project parts remain strictly in the laboratory. No substances are produced by our network. The successful construction of our network is be assessed by measuring fluorescence due to GFP using a flow cytometer. Undesired yeast strains are sterilized.
Safety of project:
The project is safe. Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is modified through basic transformations.
Unlike Cas9, dCas9, which is used in this project, has deficient endonuclease activity, because the protein domain conferring endonuclease activity is deleted from the full Cas9 protein. Thus, dCas9, cannot break double-stranded DNA, an otherwise essential step in the synthesis of a gene drive. In this experiment, dCas9 is used in combination with guide RNA to bind to a promoter site to regulate the expression of gene via steric hindrance.
Below are proofs from literature:
""We have shown recently in bacterial and human cells that the endonuclease domains of the Cas9 protein can be mutated to create a programmable RNA-dependent DNA binding protein (Qi et al., 2013). Targeting of catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) to the coding region of a gene can sterically block RNA polymerase binding or elongation, leading to dramatic suppression of transcription in bacteria.""
“Here, we show that dCas9 can be used as a modular RNA-guided platform to recruit different protein effectors to DNA in a highly specific manner in human cells and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both repressive and activating effectors can be fused"

The relevance of such a gene is outstanding for experiments conducted in harsh environmental conditions.
Temperature differences between the different colors cultures proven. We designed, constructed and tested a new device based on a system of thermocouples and light sensors, which allow us to study the temperature difference (closely related with albedo) between different color cultures. In addition, we used this device connected to an acquisition system controlled by our own software in order to store and plot the assays data. Finally we carried out several experiments which demonstrate that differences in the color of sunlight-exposed cultures produce differences in their temperature.
Self-maintained planetary incubator Red House device. We also designed, built and verified a new structure capable of protecting the culture placed inside of it from the external environmental conditions. We constructed a windmill to generate electric power from eolic energy. Energy generated this way is used to warm up the inside of our thermal isolation device in order to create an optimum growth temperature for the cultures. In addition, we added a several temperature sensors that allowed us to monitoring the temperature evolution. These temperature sensors and others, which allow us to measure the power generated, were connected to an acquisition system controlled by our own software in order to store and plot data, and control the incoming power.
We developed a dynamic model for simulating a terraforming proccess including our synthetic biology strategies. We integrated the behavior of the prionic switch as kernel of the terraforming process into the planetary model. We designed and programmed an informatic tool that allow us to visualize the entire proccess.
Regarding the Human Practice we have performed a comprehensive review on the ethical issues that the terraforming of Mars by means of synthetic biology raises and carried out comparative interviews with 10 scientists and religious leaders.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," a biofilm. If treated with antibiotics, the infectious bacteria will only be exposed to small concentrations of antibiotics and this will provide time to develop resistance. Under these circumstances, the prosthesis should be removed before given any form of treatment. We should be more retained with the use of antibiotics.
“Nature is smart. Humans have only been here for a few millenniums and microorganisms have been here for billions of years. It would be foolish to believe that we could outsmart nature in only 100 years.” - Hans Jørn Kolmos
Does the media highlight antibiotic resistance as a bigger problem than it actually is?
A documentary in danish television called: “When Penicillin doesn’t work anymore.” says that the resistance problem is huge. The documentary shows families experiencing MRSA, and how health care deal with the problem. We asked Mr. Kolmos if the media makes a bigger problem out of it, that it is?  He replied that: No, the documentary gave a realistic perspective of the problem.
Is there any possibility that we could face a dead end in functional antibiotics if we keep the distribution to this level?
Mr. Kolmos stated there is a potential risk for a multiresistant bacteria. If we kept using antibiotics like we do today, we could potentially get a resistant bacteria, that we could not kill with any of our antibiotic resources.
Are there any cases with patients that could not be treated because of an infection caused by multiresistant bacteria?
Mr. Kolmos told us that under the civil war in Libya, the country did not have the resources to treat all the wounded soldiers. Therefore some of them were sent to Denmark. As we treated them, we observed very odd sorts of infections that are not common in Denmark. There were bacterias with other types of resistance than the ones the doctors knew about. The worst were the Gram-negative, ESBL (Extented-Epectrum Beta-lactamase).
He also estimated 30 % of the population are carrier of S.aureus, of these 1-2 % are MRSA.  The resistance problem is not just a problem on the hospitals. It is also a part of  political debates.
Is there any precautions, the ordinary family can contribute with?
He told us that people could get checked if they were carrier of MRSA. S.aureus is often found in human nostrils, but if the patient got in contact with the MRSA bacteria, it could outperform the normal flora. The patient would now be a carrier. The MRSA bacteria can be killed by use of antibiotics, but an ordinary family should also"

Fluoride Sensitive Riboswitch (Part:BBa_K911003)
Riboswitch that is highly sensitive to the F- ion. It forms a rho-independent transcriptional terminator in low fluoride concentrations and this structure is removed in the presence of fluoride, allowing transcription. It is sensitive from about 10μM up to around 30mM. Above this concentration the levels of fluoride begin to become toxic and kill the cells. We have characterized this part in three different chassis: TOP10 e.coli, 168 strain bacillus subtilis and a strain of bacillus subtilis with its normal fluoride riboswitch, the crcB gene, knocked out (kindly provided by the Breaker lab in Yale). Results of Miller assays for these three chassis are also provided.

Greenhardtii Project
De aarde houdt constant zijn balans en ontvangt voortdurend biogeochemische cycli. De koolstofcyclus, dewelke hoofdzakelijk uit de interactie van fototrofe en heterotrofe organismen bestaat is bijzonder belangrijk. Fototrofe organismen verbruiken daarbij koolstofdioxide, heterotrofe organismen zetten daarentegen koolstofdioxide weer vrij. Jammer genoeg is dit evenwicht uit balans geraakt, fossiele brandstoffen worden verbrand en groene zones worden steeds kleiner waardoor steeds meer CO2 in de atmosfeer belandt.
Stijgende CO2-concentraties zorgen voor een globaal broeikaseffect, wat zorgt voor de opwarming van de aarde.  Enkele graden alleen zijn niet genoeg om de aarde uit zijn balans te trekken, doch bezorgen deze graden ernstige veranderingen in het ecosysteem en hydrogeologische fondsen. Het smelten van gletsjers, stijgende zeespiegel, droogte, overstromingen, dodelijke hittegolven, brand, uitdroging en andere verschrikkelijke gebeurtenissen zijn hier het gevolg van. Wij, het iGEM team UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB hebben dit probleem aangepakt en hebben een strategie ontwikkeld om CO2 op te vangen. We gebruikten en produceerde biomaterialen van economische en wetenschappelijke interesse.
Om ons project te vervolledigen hebben we twee stadia doorlopen. De eerste etappe bestaat uit twee transformaties in de groene algen Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, dewelke aan de ene kant een cyanobacterie enzym fructose-1,6 / sedoheptulose-1,7-bifosfatase, voor de"

As for quorum-sensing oscillator, luxI proteins could generate AHL from some substrates consisting of acyl-ACPs and Sadenosylmethionine (SAM). We assume that the amount of substrates is sufficient.
AHL(Acyl homoserine lactones) is a kind of auto-inducer, which could combine with luxR protein and activate the promoter. In addition, the lactonic ring of the AHL will be hydrolyzed once in presence of AiiA protein.
For transcription activation, we use Hill function to describe the rate of production.

In addition, many genes have a non-zero minimal expression level, namely basal expression level. It can be described by adding a term

is the translation rate. The degradation of mRNA is a much swifter process compared to protein, so we use parameter

According to the above processes，we can describe the genetic circuit by the following equations:

DDEs
Due to the time interval between expression of regulating protein and transcriptional activation by the luxR and AHL complex which depends on the past concentration of internal AHL, we decide to use DDEs model. Transcription, translation, and maturation rate of proteins are combined into a single time-delay parameter
. We modeled based on the paper “Rapid and tunable post-translational coupling of genetic circuits”.
The simulation is carried out using custom written software in MATLAB. We get the simulation result of oscillator, as shown in Figure 1.

Establishing Our Market
A significant market opportunity for a biosensor exists within the regulatory framework established by the Canadian government.  Spot checks are required routinely to ensure areas of the lakes and rivers in Alberta are not being affected by the waste effluent from the oil extraction process. To reach this market, we have developed a technology which provides distinct advantages compared to competitive technologies and have partnered with key industry players.
Our marketing segment of our project has been broken down into two key areas.  A Marketing Analysis to determine the size of the market opportunity that is available and a Marketing Plan to demonstrate our approach to market by engaging our end-users and developing our technology.
Marketing Analysis
Industry Description and Outlook
Figure 1: Overview of the oil extraction process.
The oil and gas market is vast; today's operations in the Alberta Oil Sands produce 1.5 million barrels per day, which is expected to double by 2020. In North America, this market’s growth and increased oil production volumes has led to large increases in the amount of contaminated water that is produced and stored by these operations. During the oil sands extraction processes, water is often used to separate out the oil from the sand. During this process, the water becomes contaminated with fine silts alongside many highly toxic chemicals, making it unsafe to return to the environment. The potential toxicity"

Postcard Exchange
From iGEM team Duesseldorf Cologne 2017 we were invited to participate in this year’s Postcard Exchange. Last year seven iGEM teams from Germany decided to join this Exchange and this year teams from all over Europe have joined! Since iGEM is not only about lab work but also about spreading the knowledge about synthetic biology into society, each team was asked to make a postcard depicting their project or more general a subject from synthetic biology. On the back of the postcard, a small informational text can also be found. This was a very easy and fun way to incorporate outreach into our project! Every team also received a batch of postcards from all the other participating teams. It was very interesting to see the postcards from the other teams and made us curious for the presentations at the Giant Jamboree.
Potsdam
With the iGEM team from Potsdam we had a Skype call, since their project showed some similarities to ours. In their first abstract, they were going to investigate two approaches for metabolic channeling, one of which included the usage of liquid liquid phase separation.
Excited about the fact that we found a project similar to ours, we decided to set up a Skype call. We talked about our projects and exchanged some ideas about Human Practices. Since the project of Potsdam is also more foundational, they also struggled somewhat with explaining it to people. They gave us the tip to work towards a good application, which makes it easier to explain it to people. Next to that, we also gave them some tips about working with the WIKI in HTML and CSS and they also set us up with a contact person for our model.
Waterloo
Additionally we answered a survey from the Waterloo iGEM team. This survey was about the customizability and price of current lab materials. It was aimed to see if 3D printing was a good solution to overcome financial problems which might limit teams in their performance.

If any molecule is a pigment, colour of said pigment is labelled next to the name of the molecule.
Escherichia coli has the genes necessary to synthesise farnesyl pyrophosphate, an intermediate molecule essential for the biosynthesis of β-carotene.  As can be seen in Figure 1, biosynthesis of β-carotene from farnesyl pyrophosphate requires 4 additional enzymes.  We have successfully assembled the biobrick K2151200 (Figure 2) containing the required enzymes and transformed this into E. coli.  As expected this has caused expression of Β-carotene hence the orange coloured pellets seen in Figure 3.
Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase, or crtE, catalyses a three-step reaction in which isopentenyl diphosphate is added to the product of the last step. In each step, the carbon chain is extended and a diphosphate group is lost. Phytoene synthase (crtB) then catalyses a two-step reaction that combines two GGPP molecules together and removes the diphosphate groups, creating phytoene. Phytoene desaturase (crtI) catalyses a four-step reaction to convert phytoene into lycopene. This involves adding multiple double bonds to the centre of the molecule by progressively oxidizing phytoene. Finally, lycopene β-cyclase (crtY) catalyses two rounds of cyclisation on lycopene and forms two cyclohexene-methyl groups on each end of the molecule.
Figure 2.  Assembly of β-carotene producing biobrick. All 4 genes required for biosynthesis of β-carotene in E. coli were first taken from existing biobricks: K118014 (RBS+crtE), K118006 (RBS+crtB), K118005 (RBS+crtI) and K118013 (RBS+crtY). These genes were assembled together by standard biobrick assembly, e.g. in (A) the crtB containing plasmid was cut at sites Spe1/Pst1 generating a vector.  The insert (B), was cut at Xba1/Pst1, allowing both to be ligated, creating a scar between the"

Summary
IGEM is an international competition that promotes the search for solutions of problems in the world using synthetic biology. While every team is working on their own projects in their local laboratories utilizing the biobricks provided by iGEM over the summer, they design new parts to add to the collection of biobricks at the end of the competiton. This makes every team part of a big community, that works togehter to promote the transparent and innovative developement of new tools for engineering biology. This community is not only about the collection of biobricks, but also about helping each other. Collaborations of individual teams are one of the most important aspects of iGEM, where teams help each other achieve their goals. This can be just by giving helpful advice or even doing experiments together. We collaborated intensively with the team of Marburg to determine the binding affinity of the EPSP synthases AroE and AroA to glyphosate.

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Project FUR_-_-_TEXT.html,". Note that this high number of Fur protein is essential to E. coli during its development. As explained previously, Fur regulates the expression of genes involved in iron absorption, and it avoids an over absorption of iron which could be really toxic and kill E. coli.
FUR binding site architecture
Figure 2: Consensus palindromic sequence of Fur binding site.
The Fur Binding site also named “Fur box” or “iron box” is localized between -35 and -10 site at the promoters of Fur-repressed genes. As shown in the Figure 2, the Fur binding site is composed of 19-base pair that are organized as a palindromic consensus sequence. It must be noted that this consensus sequence is not an exact sequence. Others sequences of Fur binding sites can be found into E. coli’s genome.
Often, Fur binding site is repeated (as shown in the Figures 3 and 4). It means that several homodimer of Fur-Fe2+ can bind among the DNA. Then Fur binding sites can be localized in a larger region than between -35 and -10 of the promoter region (defined previously). The affinity of these Fur binding site to Fur-Fe2+ is different. At first the complex Fur-Fe2+ binds to the 1st Fur binding site, which presents a higher affinity for its complex. Then, others Fur-Fe2+ bind to the following Fur binding sites which present a weaker affinity. A polymer of Fur protein is formed among the DNA which allows a stronger inhibition of the expression of the gene downstream these Fur binding sites.
Figure 3: Repeated Fur binding site sequences.
Figure 4: Repeated Fur binding site sequences on a double strand DNA.
Natural inverter system
It had been shown that Fur could be involved in a positive regulation of several genes of E. coli (fntA, bfr, acnA, fumA, sdh operon, sodB). In fact E. coli uses an inverter system mediated by a small RNA named RhyB.
RhyB is a 90 nucleotids long sRNA which is regulated by the Fur transcriptional factor, then it is expressed at low concentration of iron3.
Figure 5: Regulation by the Fur transcriptional and the RhyB sRNA, acting as an inverter. In absence of iron mRNA is binded by the RhyB and then it is degradated. In presence of iron, Fur binds the DNA, the RhyB expression is inhibited and the mRNA can be transcribed.

A conclusion from these results was that CrtEBI has expression leakage and the constitutive promoter can enhance the expression while the terminator can prevent the leakage for some extent. From our viewpoint, 2 factors are responsible for the significant color leakage together.
First of all, transcription factor-DNA interaction may result in this phenomenon. From the energy landscape for the TF Cro on the bacteriophage λDNA (Figure 6), it is obvious that many sites on the genome can have a strong interaction with TF. Maybe there are several such sites at the start of CrtEBI and CrtEBIY, or their upstream non-coding sequence.
Figure 6 Energy landscape for the TF Cro on the bacteriophage λDNA(Gerland et al., 2002). The landscape appears to be random, with different strength.
Secondly, the lycopene biosynthesis is an enzymatic reaction. Lycopene biosynthesis needs three enzymes which are GGPP synthase (produced by CrtE), phytoene synthase (produced by CrtB) and phytoene desaturase (produced by CrtI). All the Km values of these enzymes are showed in Table 1 (Takaya et al., 2003; Neudert et al., 1998; Raisig et al., 1996). From the Km value, it is obvious that a small amount leakage of enzyme will lead to a large amount of product.

However, with its reach decreased and the covering of the initial protein chelating sites, we concluded that such a conformation wouldn't bring much more chelating power to the protein.
Nickel chelation of folded His1-tag
Nickel chelation of folded His2-tag
As for the floating conformation however, we managed to verify a property found in the literature , which is that on a poly-Histidine tag, a nickel ion is chelated by the unprotoned nitrogen of the cycle of two histidines that are separated by a third  histidine. We also observed that through the folding of the tag around nickel ions so that histidines may chelate it, ketones groups were brought together, earning the ability to chelate an ion as well, and that the carboxyl group of its C-end was also able to chelate an ion. All in all, we determined that a floating tag should be able to chelate up to 5 extra nickel ions for the His1-tag, and 8 for the His2-tag.
Nickel chelation of floating His1-tag
Nickel chelation of floating His2-tag
For better understanding of the folding process, here's an outline of the chelation of a nickel ion (in the center) by a tag composed of three histidines.
""Then what is the point of tagging the original protein when it already chelates so much?"" are you going to ask me. The answer is quite simple : just for one protein, with only one His1-tag we can hope for a 25 % increase of its chelation power. Now remember that CsgA is only the subunit of a fiber that is composed of thousands of them; that one bacterium bears hundreds, maybe thousands of these fibers; and that a culture of such bacteria allows for a countless number of bacteria as well. It's easy to understand how an increase of 25% of efficiency of the elementary unit of the fiber is already quite something! Well, that's provided the floating conformation is the preferred one. But since the wet lab results seem to prove that His2-tagged CsgA chelates better than His1-tagged CsgA, which chelates as much as wildtype CsgA, from this we cannot really discriminate between one conformation or the other from our experimental data, though these results seem to lead towards the folded conformation, where"

Our mail to METU IGEM team
Dear Metu İGEM team,
With a great project comes a great responsibility of finding the best solution  to the safety issues we encounter and most oftenly, figuring the main safety areas that needs concentrating on can be pretty difficult. This year iGEM  has introduced strict rules and regulations for safety which is a clear  indication of how much effort and importance they are expecting us to show!
So, why dont we gather and see safety as a way to benefit eachother? Because not only will this open new doors for our future safety plans but will also increase the probability of reaching our aimed destinations. The Lyon jamborees is a great opportunity to form a platform where we can discuss our safety issues, what we have done to overcome them and the main parts that have challenged us the most.
After reading your abstract a few questions on the safety of your projects popped into our minds. If you are interested in forming a discussion platform, we would be delighted  receive your answers as this, on the day of the platform will enable your team to see how much progression was made with safety from today onwards.
We would be really grateful to read your questions on the safety of our project too J
iGEM cares about safety, so do we! Lets take a step together and make a change in how we handle this caseJ
Questions
1)      When you change the genetic information of bacteria in bees’ guts this may have the possibility of changing the genetic material of most bacterial flora. Have you thought about a possible solution to this?
2)      Will this change effect the bees honey production and so affect humans and animals health?
3)      How will you manage the amount of Coumaric Acid produced?
4)      Will coumaric acid affect plants which the bees’ touch?
Metu hope your project is going well. It's a pitty we couldn't make it to the national re-union in Istanbul but do hope you made the most of it :)

There is no cure for RA and the drugs usually used for its treatment are anti-inflammatory compounds with oral and/or parenteral administration. Because of this, the typically prescribed medications potentially have serious systemic side effects. Besides, biological characteristics of the joints make the drug delivery difficult when targeting sites, compromising the efficacy of the treatment.
IFN-β
The type I interferons (IFNs), IFN-β and various IFN-αs, are pleiotropic cytokines acting on a range of cell types and eliciting a diverse range of responses. For many years, IFN-β was thought to be a potential agent for the treatment of a variety of immune-mediated diseases (Vervoordeldonk et al., 2009). This molecule has N-glycosylation sites that increase stability and activity of molecule (Sommereyns & Michiels, 2006).
IFN-β has clear anti-inflammatory properties (Tak, 2004) and plays an important role in bone homeostasis (Takayanagi et al., 2002). Also, IFN-β has the ability to reduce the secretion of proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and prostaglandin E2, which are key players in the pathogenesis of RA (Coclet-Ninin et al., 1997; Smeets et al., 2000). In addition, IFN-β has antiangiogenic properties (McCarty et al., 2002), which could boost therapeutic effect in RA (Gerlag et al., 2001).
The notion that IFN-β treatment may reduce arthritis is supported by animal experiments. Several studies examining the effect of IFN-β in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice have been published (Treschow et al., 2005; van Holten et al., 2004; Triantaphyllopoulos et al., 1999; Tak et al., 1999).
Treatment of RA patients with IFN-β has been unsuccessful so far, presumably as a result of pharmacokinetic issues (van Holten et al., 2005). Novel approaches leading to constitutive IFN-β production at the site of inflammation may be required to induce clinical efficacy in patients.
Lack of better chassis
Nowadays, Synthetic Biology studies are limited"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," Splitting. Three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched for some template chain as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. In this case, the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. This is a drawback of our MoDeL language -- it does not support description of intra-molecular reactions. If A and C could react as different parts of the product, the reverse reactions would not be lost. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans for refinement of our MoDeL language.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," 0 corresponds to the dark state and 4095 the maximal intensity. Whereas measured intensity depends linearly on this value, the light intensity observed with naked eye (or bacterial light receptor), was logarithmically dependent on the intensity parameter. Thus, having equispaced intensity parameters for the LEDs led to biased distribution of light. To get equal difference in the LED intensities, we set the parameters linearly according to the log10 of the intensity parameter value. In other words, the intensity of the LED lights was proportional to the log10 of the intensity parameter.
Choosing the Correct Parameters
Cormack et al. (1996) reported the wavelengths of green fluorescent protein mutant 3 to be the following
Excitation wavelength: 501 nm
Emission wavelength: 511 nm
In addition Ashikawa et al. (2011) had used the following parameters in measuring GFP
Bandwidth: 12 nm
Measurement time: 500 ms
We tried measuring GFP using the parameters provided by Cormack et al., (1996) and Ashikawa et al. (2011), but we got strange results. We assumed that that this was because the excitation and emission wavelengths were so close to each other. Therefore we decided to change the excitation wavelength to 470 nm, as it seemed to be another peak of excitation for GFP mut 3 according to Cormack et al. (1996) ( ). For the same reason we also tried a narrower bandwidth of 5 nm, which is the other option available on Varioskan.
.: Excitation and emission spectra for wild type and mutant GFPs. (A) Excitation spectra (emission 540 nm). Excitation maxima: wt GFP 395 nm, GFP mut 1 488 nm, GFP mut 2 481 nm and GFP mut 3 501 nm. (B) Emission spectra (excitation 395 nm for wild type and 450 nm for mutant types). Emission maxima: wt GFP 508 nm, GFP mut 1 507 nm, GFP mut 2 507 nm and GFP mut 3 511 nm (Cormack et al. 1996).
In the end we settled for the following:
Excitation wavelength: 470 nm
Emission wavelength: 511 nm
Bandwidth: 5nm
Measurement time: 500 ms
With the chosen values we got sensible results and our blank samples gave practically zero emission.

Thursday, 6/20: Since I had played with the console on the Twitter development page the day before, I knew I was successfully obtaining data. However, it included a lot of retweets, but that’s an easy fix with an if/else statement. The main problem was that the results were not comprehensive. As a result, I determined to search via hashtags instead of just a general phrase. After that was resolved, I ran into another problem – realizing that I needed authentication in order to access Twitter’s data. Thus, the rest of my afternoon was spent on that problem.
At the theaters for Monsters University!
Friday, 6/21: The twitter search API continued to give me problems as I couldn’t, for the life of me, determine how to obtain authentication. While I did find a “step by step” process on the twitter development page, it was vague enough that many steps were confusing, and left me unsure of how to continue. Luckily, I was able to discuss this with a member of another lab (who does a lot of work with Twitter), and she showed me a piece of (public) code that should get me around this problem. Lastly, we met with Orit, who advised us to tackle the riskiest parts of our project first (ie: animation).
Week 5: June 24 - June 28
Monday, 6/24: After a wonderful Friday night at Framingham movie theater where the HCI lab bonded over TGI Fridays and Monsters University, we came into work on Monday pumped and ready to make progress. Unfortunately for me, everything was going swimmingly until I turned on my laptop to discover a giant, ugly distortion right smack in the middle third of my HP laptop screen. It was horrifying to say the least, but at least the screen wasn't cracked. Needless to say, I tried everything to fix the issue on my own, but ultimately I had to admit that this was not a software problem, but a hardware problem. Although not much progress was made today in terms of research, I'm glad to say that my laptop is on it's way to making (hopefully) a full recovery.
Tuesday, 6/25: Accomplishment of the day: we are now communicating with Twitter! After the struggle that was last week, I am happy to say that the script my friend showed me works like a charm! Once I read through the documentation, it turned out to be quite the efficient solution! And after running some"
