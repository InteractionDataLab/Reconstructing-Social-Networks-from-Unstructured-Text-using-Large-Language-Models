Scrombroid food poisoning is the 2nd prevalent food posioning among fish and its main cause is histamine. Histidine which exists in all fish turns into histamine by histidine decarboxylase at temperature above 16 degrees celcius. Histmine is also noteworthy as a substrate for the expression of alergic reactions.
The basic mechanism is using ""Band defect network"" that was introduced in 'Towards Logical Designs in Biology.' GFP expression is repressed at low levels of histamine but strongly expressed at above threshold level. By this way, we can tell if the fish is edible or not. We are using a well known circuit here, so it might be a nice try.
I thought about the ideas our team produced. I think Bacteria Array is fascinating. But as for the aroma producing bacteria, can the small amount of fragrance produced overwhelm the stink of rotting food?
From Cheolwon Choi, 20th of July
If there is a way, I want to develop a way to increase the survival rates of diesel producing bacterias. This idea is also good for raising funds if we succeed! Can we also make bio gasolines?

There is a molecule called Geosmin produced by microbes in water. It giveas the water a dirt flavor, an important factor for drinking water. We could build a bacteira that can sense geosmin and trap it, like the one Chiva university did on iGEM 2007.

As I was searching the text books, I thought of making a ""Bacteria Array,"" similar to DNA array. It can be built to sense specific substrates in a compound.

No matter what kind of software we will make, it is sure that one of the most important work is to find out the structure and functions of existing software. Preparing start from Athena and Tinkercell, two multi-function synthetic biological software. OMG!! these software are great! They can do not only some simulating works, but also other create job! Their GUI also performs well. It seems hard to beyond or even achieve them in simulating functions. We have to find other highlights.
Mar. 14, 2009
Be aware of SBML, a standard structured file contains a certain chemical/biological system. The support of SBML related functions in Athena; Tinkercell and other software convince me the necessity of providing these functions in our software. It means our output can supply a standard interface to others.

Pneumosensor Module Description
Overview
Pneumosensor primarily adopts the quorum sensing pathway components in Streptococcus pneumoniae to detect populations of S. pneumoniae. The main     advantage of this system is its detection specificity- the Gram-positive quorum sensing mechanism is incorporated into the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli to     eliminate possible cross-talk of the autoinducer molecule, competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) with native E. coli molecules.
There are two modules to our Pneumosensor- the Detection Module and the S. pneumoniae σx Promoters Module. The Detection Module comprises of the CSP     receptor ComD, its response regulator ComE and the promoter PcomCDE which is induced by phosphorylated ComE. The σx Promoters Module involves a     highly specific reporting system, whereby σx is associated with RNA polymerase and binds to promoters PcelA and PcomFA which     are specific to σx for activation. These promoters then drive the expression of GFP as a reporting system. Another protein, ComW, is expressed alongside the     σx as its stabilizer against proteolysis.
Detection Module
S. pneumoniae σx promoters Module
Detection Module Description
Figure 1. Detection Module Diagram
CSP released by S. pneumoniae is detected by its receptor ComD, which autophosphorylates at the expenditure of ATP. ComD~P then phosphorylates         ComE. ComE~P then induces the promoter PcomCDE, which drives the expression of GFP.
Transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, like many other species, depends on specialized state called competence.      Competence is achieved during the exponential growth stage of pneumococcal culture by the secretion of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), which is a 17-     residue long pheromone that is species-specific"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," accurate than gel filter (because the range of wavelengths allowed through can be made really small), but expensive. Dichroic filter is made of organic dyes and other chemicals. It absorbs light at certain wavelength. Again, it is more accurate than the coloured gel filter, but significantly more expensive. We looked more into interference filters and rough calculations show that if we want a wavelength of 609 nm to pass, the material in the middle of the filter will need to have an index of refraction (n) = 1.35 and the thickness would be 225.55555 nm. Possible materials include  10 percent glucose solution in water ( n = 1.3477), 20 percent glucose solution in water (n = 1.3635), Teflon ( n = 1.35 – 1.38), and ethanol (n = 1.361).
We wanted to commence testing as soon as possible and therefore have put in several purchase orders for products so we have our required materials.  After more research into light sensors and potential filters we were able to locate affordable and applicable materials that we will be able to use to build our device.  Firstly we bought an Arduino Uno microcontroller for the team as the one we have currently been programming belongs to a member of our modelling sub-team. We also ordered an educational kit for Arduino Uno that includes instruction manuals and materials as well as useful parts for the construction of our future circuits such as resistors, capacitors, sensors, and LED lights.  Additionally we have purchased a Parallax ColorPAL-Color and Light Sensor instead of a simple light sensor as we came to the realization that it would be difficult with only one sensor to differentiate between multiple diseases if all of them use RFP as the reporter. Initially, our idea was to excite RFP with yellow light (or UV light is another option) and detect the emitted light (609 nm wavelength) using a light sensor and a filter. However, if the reporters indicating the presence of different diseases were that of different colours, then a colour sensor would be able to directly differentiate between them. We also ordered two temperature sensors so we can keep our device at constant ideal temperature dictated by the requirements of isothermal PCR and an 3W LED light if we need to excite the RFP. Our team is planning on formally drafting an initial design of the device after the meeting with our microfluidics expert to determine the features that this technology could impact the appearance and logistics of our project.  We found an bandpass filter  that allows light of wavelengths between 604 and 616 nm"

As one of the thousands of possible applications, we are trying to construct a metamorphosizing image using E. coli 'ink' that differ not in color but the 'timing' at which they are a certain color (fig2). Over time, parts of images (or characters) are getting visible one by one, making animated message/ picture. If the coloration process proceeds to completion, the message is obscured. Only when the message is observed at the correct timing during the coloration process is any useful information obtained. Such a system should be useful for communication security: we can convey our message to only those that know the exact moment they should take a look. After a while, the message is gone and cannot be retrieved.
Project Design
Fig. 3 System design
We designed a switching consortium that works like a water clock ( Water clock-wikipedia.en ). Here is how it works (Fig 3).
1. Sender cells slowly generate signal molecules at a constant rate. The signal molecules are non-degradable (or virtually so in a reasonable time scale) so they get accumulated (linearly) over time.
2. Receivers detect the signal molecules and then activate the genetic switch to the on state, but only when the signal concentration reaches the switching threshold of a receiver. Receivers are activated by different signaling molecules at different rates. In this way, the entire system behaves like a delay switch sequence.
3. Either by changing the receiver sensitivity or rate of signal accumulation, one can freely control the delay length of the individual switches. Using switches with various times-of-delay, one can sequentially activate many different cellular functions.
Signaling System
In this project, we use acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs), signaling molecules used for quorum sensing in gram negative bacteria. Senders express LuxI or similar enzymes, which catalyze the production of AHLs, under the control of a constitutive (Tet) promoter. Each cell thus generates AHL more or less at a constant rate. AHL can freely permeate cell membranes and are detected by neighboring cells. Receivers constitutively express LuxR proteins (or a similar ortholog), the protein that detects AHL concentrations. When AHLs bind LuxR proteins, the AHL-LuxR complex activates the Lux promoter. The threshold [AHL] at which switching occurs is determined by the affinity of AHL for the particulr LuxR ortholog.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Latex_-_-_TEXT.html," a variety of polyisoprene polymer forms, natural rubber is largely composed of cis-1,4-polyisoprene, which is a polymer of isoprene units joined at the first and fourth carbon by a double bond.  In order to produce the cis-1,4-polyisoprene polymer, rubber trees such as H. brasiliensis employ cis-prenyltransferase enzymes (also commonly referred to as rubber transferases) to link individual isoprene monomers into a polymer.  The monomer used primarily in a cis-1,4-polyisoprene chain is isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), which is also the isomer of its more reactive counterpart, dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP).  In order to initialize chain elongation, prenyltransferase enzymes begin single DMAPP molecule and iteratively add IPP onto the chain, allowing for extension of the polymer.  However, to be enzymatically active, cis-prenyltransferase enzymes require a magnesium(II) supplement and small rubber particle protein (SRPP) coenzyme that serve as activators.[14] Without a magnesium (II)  supplement and SRPPs, prenyltransferases are incapable of polymer chain extension.  Therefore, in order to polymerize rubber chains, the key xenogeneic components our host organism will need include (1) prenyltransferases, (2) IPP substrate, (3) DMAPP substrate, (4) a magnesium(II) supplement (such as MgSO4), and (5) small rubber particle protein coenzymes.
DXS synthase optimization
Although IPP and DMAPP could be supplied to the cell by a media supplement, a more appealing and system incorporated approach is to produce both compounds within the host organism using only glucose.  Since IPP and DMAPP are endogenous to many species, we identified the two IPP biosynthesis pathways: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP/DOXP) pathway.  While pathways generate IPP and DMAPP from ; however, only the MEP/DOXP pathway is endogenous in E. coli.[15] Through a six step process, the MEP/DOXP pathway converts molecules of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) into IPP and DMAPP (Figure 1).  While incorporating the MVA pathway into E. coli would further enhance IPP and DMAPP output, we opted for optimizing the MEP/DOXP pathway to minimize the step"

For some of the uncut plasmids, not enough sample was put into the well, so they are hard to see.  For all the fluorescent proteins, the enzymes EcoRI and SpeI were used and thus the lower bands on the gel were removed.  The RBS's were cut with SpeI and PstI and the higher bands were removed.
Because we were running out of RBS plasmids and the promoter I14033, I used the frozen glycerol stock of our transformed cells to plate and grow overnight for plasmid preps over the weekend.
WEEK 4: 6/27-7/1/2011
After a week of plasmid preps and restriction digest, we had the stock of DNA to start ligated and putting together our composite parts or ""devices"".  I am on the ""bottoms up"" team in that we will be building devices from the bottom up, starting with combining the fluorescent protein and terminator, then add an RBS and promoter.
6/27:  Some members of the wet lab were having problems with ligation, so we looked at our formula for calculating the amount of insert and backbone DNA needed.  The ratio of insert to backbone should be about 2-6 to 1 and ratio of base pairs has to be factored in such that
Nanogram (ng)of inserts = (ng of vector x size of insert)/size of the vector x (insert : vector molar ratio)
Using this formula and a 6:1 ratio of insert to backbone, I performed a ligation of RFP, ECFP, EYFP, and BFP with terminator.  Instead of running the reaction for an hour at 16 C, I had the ligation run at room temperature for 30 minutes and then heat inactivated the reaction at 65 C for 10 minutes.  Following the ligation protocol, I did a transformation of the ligated mixture into competent cells.
6/28:  The plates from yesterday's ligation/transformation did not grow anything.  This is increasing"

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," those of the shuttle vectors.  Once colony PCR has been run, one then runs the products on a gel to determine if bands appear at the predicted lengths, indicating whether 1) PCR was successful and whether 2) the transformation was successful.  If the bands match up with expectations, one then sends both the PCR product and the original primers to a sequencing company to sequence the part.
Have to check to see whether the URA, LEU, and TRP (and HIS) genes are in close proximity to each other in the yeast genome.
We found some primers that, while not listed on all of the vector maps, are indeed present on pRS304*, pRS305, and pRS306 flanking the multiple cloning site, and thus the inserted part.  Originally we considered simply using these .  Instead, we consider it.  However, this will only work if the sequence of the vectors are different from each other.  Another consideration to keep in mind is that for extremely large expected PCR products (greater than 5 kbp?)
Checked the replates from two days ago.  All had wonderfully isolated colonies.  Gorgeous streaks.  These transformations were:
Double:
Z0277 + pRS306
nullA + Z0637
nullA + Z0739.
Single:
Z0411 on ZaZar
Z0412 on ZaZar
pRS304* on LaLar
Z0421 on LaLar
Triple:
Z0412 + LexA - tag + DD25
Z0421 + pRS305 + Z0637
Browsing through the fridge, it was discovered that the following parts will require replating as well:
nullR (Z0411) + pRS306 (contaminated, requires trp-, ura-)
ZifA (Z0267) + LexA rpt (DD25), not enough isolated colonies, could be useful in the place of nullA + LexA rpt
LexA (Z0279) + LexA rpt (DD25) (contaminated, requires leu-, ura-)
GliA (Z0277) + GliA rpt (Z0739), an old plate that will be used in the future for testing (requires leu-, ura-)
ZifA (Z0267) + ZifA rpt (Z0637), an old plate that will be used in the future for testing (requires leu-, ura-)

ABACUS:
ABACUS is a submodule of team USTC-Software-2016's project. ABACUS is firstly developed by professor Liu Haiyan, to enlarge the functions of Biopano. The de novo design of amino acid sequence to fold into desired structures is a way to reach a more thorough understanding of how amino acid sequences encode protein structures and to supply methods for protein engineering. To overcome limitations in current computational models, they developed a comprehensive statistical energy function for protein design with a new general strategy and verify that it can complement and rival current well-established models. They established an experimental approach which can be used to efficiently assess or improve the foldability of designed proteins. To prove it, they report four de novo proteins for different targets, all experimentally verified to the well-folded, solved solution structures for two being excellent agreement with respective design targets.

Yi WU
Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.
Xiaohan HU
More detail please!
Xiaohan is a junior majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics at UCAS.
Taking apart in iGEM and working with so many outstanding teammates were some interesting attempts for her. At least she knows how to keep calm now.
She was responsible for the artistic design of the project.
She has a bunch of seemingly unrelated hobbies in her daily life, such as debating, painting and literature. What she wants to do further is to make all these hobbies be related.

Chemical competent cells
Ingredients:
LB media
TSS buffer
Before starting the procedure, be sure to:
Pre-chill 1mL Eppendorf tubes
Pre-chill TSS buffer
Pre-chill Falcon tubes
During the procedure:
Work under flame at all times.
Grow a 5mL overnight culture of cells in LB media.
In the morning, dilute this culture by at least 1/100 into a 50mL of fresh LB media in a 200mL conical flask.
Incubate them at 37°C.
Monitor growth of the cells every 30 minutes by measuring OD at 600nm (OD600) by filling up 750 µL of culture into cuvette.  Use LB medium as blank.
Once the cells are ready at OD600 = 0.2-0.5, harvest the cells to prepare for chemical transformation.
Split the culture into 50mL Falcon tubes and incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4°C.
Cells should be kept on ice wherever possible.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm and 4°C.
Remove the supernatant. Pipette out any remaining media.
Re-suspend in pre-chilled TSS buffer. The volume of TSS to use is 10% of the culture volume (i.e 25mL culture = 2.5mL of TSS to be added) that you spun down.
You may need to vortex gently to fully re-suspend the culture, keep an eye out for small cell aggregates even after the pellet is completely off the wall.
Add 100µL aliquots to your chilled 1mL Eppendorf tubes and store at -80°C.

Every year, a small number of students from the Lower Saxony region has the chance to be part of the Life Science Lab in Hanover. They get the opportunity to form teams by themselves and work on different science projects. Examples include DNA extraction from roses and ELISA tests for the Zika-virus.  We decided that this is a good platform to present our project and talk about science. We prepared a 3-hour long workshop, including a presentation about the different methods we often use in the lab, like cloning or immunostaining. We tried to explain the function and structure of TALE’s to the students and what impacts they could have in all subfields of science, like medicine or plant breeding for example. We also spoke about ethical aspects of synthetic biology, our motivation to study science and different aspects about the studies. For example the structure and the amount of learning and practical works. We hope to see some of them at the university later.
Postcards
In cooperation with seven other German iGEM Teams in 2016 (Bielefeld, Aachen, Tübingen, Göttingen, Darmstadt, Düsseldorf, Erlangen) we decided to start a postcard action to clear up prejudices most people have against synthetic biology. The idea stemmed from the iGEM team in Aachen. We decide to design a postcard about the usage of pork blood in the insulin industry and how the quantity of pig slaughter can be reduced by using synthetically produced insulin. We sent some postcards to the other teams and received their postcards in return. We then distributed the cards on the streets, in bars, and around our university. In this way, we got in contact with people and talked about the positive aspects and struggles of synthetic biology. We also hoped to get rid of the fear that synthetic biology is dangerous and can damage the world.
Ethical lesson
A large part of science is the ethical questions that need to be answered every time one starts a new project. So we decided to talk about the ethical aspects of"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", so the growth of bacteria with BBa_K2764003 is similar to the rest. Then, after T=2, the amount of AlkL is enough to give a toxic effect, such that the effect of cell growth inhibition is favored over the effect of cell growth boost, hence, there is negative growth observed for bacteria with BBa_K2764003.
Given the extremes of cell growth inhibition and cell growth boost exhibited by bacteria with BBa_K2764003 and bacteria with BBa_K2764001 respectively, it is not unreasonable for bacteria with BBa_K2764002, which has medium promoter strength, to have cell growth between the other two. This also supports the push-and-pull hypothesis that suggests bacteria with BBa_K2764002 is able to offset some of the toxic effect of AlkL by importing fatty acids, but to a much lesser extent than bacteria with BBa_K2764001, resulting in stunted growth compared with the control. However, near T=8, it can be seen that growth of bacteria with BBa_K2764002 is almost the same of that of the control. This further supports the hypothesis that cell growth is slowly favored as more fatty acids are imported by AlkL over time into the cell to boost growth.
In conclusion, it can be said that AlkL certainly has an effect on host cell growth. It is proven to exhibit toxicity by its inhibition of host cell growth, as shown by the first half of the graph. However, it may also aid the growth of the host cell, as shown by the second half of the graph.

All values are integers as the Gillespie algorithm works with discrete numbers of molecules. The values were chosen based on a stable equilibrium found by letting the model run a simulation of the inherent system over 450 minutes with different starting values.
Ranging from 1-350 molecules per minute, the implemented expression rates of RelE and RelB in the model might seem too high, as the rates in the inherit system is effectively around 80-100 for RelB and 2-5 for RelE. However, the possibility of placing the relE and relB genes under regulation of controllable promoters makes the high total production values reasonable.
When the inherent toxin-antitoxin system is activated under starvation, 40-70 molecules of free RelE are found in each cell, making it reasonable to believe that the cells enter dormancy when a few tens of free RelE copies are present. This result obtained from the model is in agreement with literature Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297

Therefore, the part is characterized. The fusion protein will be expressed and worked like expected. The DNA binding domain is binding at the designed OR1 binding region upstream of the promoter. Also an interaction of SH2 and HA4 was approved. But the most important aspect, the SH2-cI fusion protein is a functional part of the bacterial two-hybrid system and is able to activate the reporter gene in vivo in interplay with the HA4-RpoZ fusion protein.  We created a part for the iGEM community to create a possibility of in vivo selection through a transcriptional activation bacterial two-hybrid system.
Achievements
Our part will be expressed
Successful interaction between our SH2 domain with the HA4 domain of the HA4-RpoZ protein!
The DNA binding domain cI successfully binds at the 434 OR1 binding site!
We achieved a functional bacterial two-hybrid system with this part.
Together with BBa_K2082221 we offer the iGEM community a functional system for in vivo selection!"

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that"

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
To amplify the ligation products Tn5-Linker-dxCas9 and dxCas9-Lin-Tn5 a High Fidelity PCR was performed and the result was run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4 μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
The PCR reaction on the ligation products resulted in the expected sizes of the dxCas9-Linker-Tn5 (5655 bp) Tn5-Linker-dxCas9 (5660 bp) coding sequence in large amounts of DNA. However, there is also one other band of DNA present, indicating an off-target amplicon generated during the PCR.

UCL:Beta-Amyloid Degradation
When we heard UCL's project was to degrade beta-amyloid plaques we were interested to see the results. Beta-amyloid is a component of amyloid plaques which are a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. It turns out that proteinase K does not only break down PLA, but also degrades beta-amyloid plaques. We built a degradation model to help the UCL team with their beta-amyloid degradation assays. The model, a MATLAB based extension called Simbiology, provides information about how efficient MMP-9 enzyme can degrade beta-amyloid plaques, which is informative for wetlab work.

We met the team from St.Paul's School when we went to the Young Synthetic Biology event. We were impressed by their project of the previous year and got chatting to them. As school students they were keen to see some university labs and todiscuss their project further, so we invited them for a tour of the facilities at Imperial. We hope the tour was enjoyable and that the tips we gave to them come in useful this year.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," The N- and C-terminal regions of the FliC are important for filament formation (Klein, 2012), which are the D0 and D1 domain in Figure 8. The D3 domain is a central region of the Flic which plays no role in filament formation. Additionally, when FliC proteins are in the polymeric state, the D3 domain can be exposed on to the surface. Therefore, we can replace the central region of flagellin by other proteins without disturbing self-assembly. If we fuse the enzyme and FliC, we can obtain a filamentous material with high surface density of catalytic sites.
Figure 9 Construction of the FliC fusion protein. (A) Arrangement of flagellin subunits within the flagellar filament.
D3 domain is exposed on to the surface. (B) The Cα backbone trace of flagellin C protein and eGFP.
eGFP replaces D3 domain in the recombinant protein. eGFP can also be replaced by other enzymes.
The N- and C- terminal of the flagellin C protein are D0 and D1 domain, which play an essential role in flagellin polymerization.
(Source: Klein, Ágnes, et al. ""A polymerizable GFP variant."" Protein Engineering Design & Selection Peds, 2012)
Why flagellar filament?
Flagellar filament is a quite stable material which only depolymerizes in extreme conditions such as pH lower than 2.0 or extremely high temperatures (Klein, 2015). Additionally, the polymerization of flagellar filament is operable in vitro, and we can simply add different concentrations of precipitants to control the nucleation and elongation process of flagellin monomers. So far, the successful expression of FliC-enzyme fusion proteins has been well documented, so we can make further efforts on exploring the possibility of yeast surface display system by using flagellar filament. Furthermore, considering biosafety issue, we choose Flagellin protein which origin from E. coli K-12. Because E. coli K-12 is a commonly used strain in lab and the FliC protein of its flagellin does not have antigenicity.
What we plan to do with flagellar filament?
Due to the stability of flagellar filaments, our MonKeYeast armed with flagellar filament is qualified to play a role in industry.
We believe that its greatest value lies in whole-cell multiple Biocatalysts. So we try to build extracellular metabolic pathways, coordinated with intracellular metabolic pathways,"

Feasibility of our project
    (1) This year we are interested in the application of optogenetic tools, and we desire to use them as our switch to redirect the metabolic flux. But whether optogenetic tools could be used as an ideal switch should be questioned. To verify that optogenetic tools can function as a probable switch, we consulted our primary PI Professor Liang, who majors in switches and their application in synthetic biology, before we started the experiment. Professor Liang listed several switches that commonly used in synthetic biology such as quorum sensing, their functions, characters as well as usage. He emphasized that an element tool in synthetic biology must be measured several characters before being applied as an ideal switch. Firstly, a switch must have the ability to both active and repress the expression of the target gene, and the change between activation and repression should be fast enough and reversible. Besides, a switch should be stable at a relatively wide range of the concentration of inducers, and it should be easy to operate the switch. Professor Liang also helped us evaluate whether optogenetic tools are capable of being a switch to regulate a genetic circuit. He told us optogenetic tools were highly suitable for a switch for their precise spatiotemporal resolution and precise dynamic control.
    (2) After certificating that optogenetics is capable for being an ideal switch, we began to take the compatibility of optogenetics and metabolic engineering into consideration. To explore the further utilization of optogenetics in metabolic engineering, we invited Yang Yi, the professor of East China University of Science and Technology to illuminate us the potential advantages of light-induced system compared with chemical-induced system. According to Professor Yang, such chemical-induced systems as Lac operon are not compatible with non-model host such as cyanobacteria, which are considered as competent candidates to produce biofuel and biomaterial through photosynthesize. Conventionally reported bacterial gene expression systems are based on the induction by specific chemicals, such as isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and metal ions, which are"

Nordic iGEM Conference
In June this year we, the iGEM Stockholm team, hosted a Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC), a meet-up for all Nordic iGEM teams. Around 80 people from different teams in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland attended. It was a three day conference with two workshops (Unsolved Ethics and Speculative Design of Synthetic Biology) with the purpose to encourage everyone to think and work on other aspects of their iGEM projects. We also organized a mini-Jamboree, where the requirements set by iGEM Headquarters were in focus, as well as social activities to get to know each other. This meet-up gave the teams an opportunity to get a feel of the big iGEM competition, refine their projects and seek collaborations with other teams, creating a platform to connect students with their peers in an international setting.
The teams  that attended the conference are listed below.

Workshops
Ever wondered how the future of biotechnology will look like? Or how synthetic biology could be used as a weapon of mass destruction, and for that reason why we should keep it safe?
Ethics
As part of the Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC), we organized a small workshop called “Unsolved Ethics”. This one-hour workshop served to highlight ethical issues that may arise in synthetic biology, principles underlying these issues and how are they currently handled in society. The workshop was also made to stimulate ethical thinking which was one of the key goals of our Human Practices work. By acknowledging and discussing current ethical issues, the participants were given the chance to identify possible issues that could arise from their own projects and also receive professional feedback on points that they have come up with.
The workshop was mainly conducted by Marko Ahteensuu, a Collegium Researcher at the University of Turku, Finland, who specializes in ethics in biosecurity"

The Lung Ranger project has resulted in the construction of a device (the L.A.S.S.O.) intended to be used initially by healthcare workers (and potentially in the longer term by cystic fibrosis patients themselves). Therefore, the team felt that it was essential to implement a short list of well-considered safety protocols to ensure that: 1. Users do not come into direct contact with microorganisms, genetically modified or otherwise
2. Genetically modified microorganisms do not come into contact with wild-type microorganisms which could result in horizontal gene-transfer 3. Genetically modified organisms are disposed of safely This has resulted in the design and prototyping of a set of components and practices to be utilised in the first instance by trained medical staff in the context of home-vis"

These regulations stated that for any bodies of freshwater, the advisory limits are 235 CFU/100 ml for E.coli (Kinzelman). The standards for common water quality are that recreational water cannot test positive for more than 1000 colonies per 100ml (The Law Dictionary). In Canada, before water can be re-used, it must go through treatments to eliminate pathogens or particles. Under ideal conditions, the efficiency of the pathogen removal system is measured in effluents. This accounts for the amount of waste water being treated for the removal of pathogens. By the guidelines issued by Environment Canada, fecal coliforms in effluents are 400 CFU per 100 ml (Shannon). It is at these concentrations which can be harmful to human populations. With the use of our biosensor we would be able to test any water sources to see if pathogens were present. Our biosensor is both portable and efficient, which would allow for finding the source of an outbreak much easier.
What if the E.coli strain mutated or the E.coli was undetectable?
What are the chances of a mutation occurring or what should be done if a mutation occurs?
Currently there is a controversial hypothesis that although E.coli can be detected it is viable but its non-culturable (Bogosian). This topic pertains to our biosensor because there could be pathogens present in water, This would affect the timeline of an outbreak as well as infect more people with contaminated water. This poses as a public health issue because of the developing nations who do not have the equipment or technology for this kind of situation. It has been shown that although this is health risk, it has only contributed to 22 deaths and 104 total cases in the last seventy years (Bogosian). It has been shown that although the E.coli is present, the cells actually die off based on their living conditions. A study was conducted to determine if changes in cell populations were due to cell death or to the cells maturing into the non-culturable state (Bogosian). This proved to be very useful because the study tested what kinds of environment the E.coli cells would either reject their populations or thrive to cause an outbreak. The results were that E.coli cells will not thrive in these environments (Bogosian). This proves that when an E.coli outbreak occurs it will be because the cells are in an ideal environment where they are able to grow readily. Although E.coli can be present in water does not mean an outbreak will occur. Our"

TAS_Taipei,2017,Team:TAS Taipei#Experimental Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," the sticky and slimy extracellular components of biofilm and not on the bacteria itself. When we fixed and imaged the biofilm + AuNP sample by SEM (figure 3-6), we could see NPs in EPS areas. This was consistent with our idea that NPs are being trapped in the EPS layer of biofilms; therefore, we want to produce biofilm easily and efficiently.
Figure 3-6 SEM Image showing AuNPs trapped by biofilm. A biofilm+AuNP sample was fixed with GA. Some EPS is preserved (red) and AuNPs (white) seemed to aggregate and adhere onto the EPS. SEM Imaging: Justin Y.
How Is Biofilm Production Regulated?
Figure 3-7 Two curli operons—csgBA and csgDEFG—direct biofilm synthesis. Figure: Justin Y.
In E. coli, biofilm synthesis is mainly mediated through two curli operons (Barnhart & Chapman 2006). Curli fibers facilitate cell-surface and cell-cell adhesion, biofilm synthesis, and are the main protein components of the EPS (Reichhardt et al. 2015, Barnhart & Chapman 2006). The operons (csgBA and csgDEFG) control the expression of six proteins essential to biofilm formation (figure 3-7). CsgA and CsgB are curli monomers which can polymerize to form curli fibers; CsgD is an activator of csgBA transcription (figure 3-7). CsgE, CsgF, and CsgG help export CsgA and CsgB out of the cell. The operon csgDEFG can be activated by the protein OmpR, and the subsequent expression of all six proteins increase biofilm formation (Barnhart & Chapman 2006).
Construct Design
Three constructs were built to upregulate curli production by overexpressing CsgD, OmpR234 (a mutant form of OmpR which is constitutively active), or both. We acquired all parts from the iGEM distribution kit: a strong promoter and strong RBS combination (BBa_K880005) to maximize protein production, strong RBS (BBa_B0034), csgD (BBa_K805015), ompR234 (BBa_K342003), and a double terminator (BBa_B0015) to end transcription.

Waynesville High School STEM Expo
Waynesville, Missouri is a rural town about fourty-five minutes away from Rolla that has put together a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) exposition for its high school students.  The Student Design and Experiential Learning Center (SDELC) sends team representatives to this event to talk about their experiences as a design team member at Missouri S&T and to display their projects for interested high school students.  Our team has participated in this event as a way to interest young minds in the biological sciences.
Engineers’ Week at St. Louis Science Center
The SDELC also sends design team representatives to the St. Louis Science Center each year during the center’s Engineers’ Week.  For iGEM, we bring information about our project to teach young children that are visiting the center about synthetic biology.  We also show them colored or glowing bacteria to teach them about gene expression.
Missouri S&T Homecoming Weekend
The SDELC is highly involved in alumni events in order to encourage Missouri S&T alumni to get involved in the student design teams.  As one of the SDLEC’s newest design teams and also as the only biological sciences design team, alumni have been very excited to learn about our team.  On the Friday of Homecoming weekend, which is held in mid-October each year, the alumni are treated to the Silver & Gold Reception, where they can mingle with other alumni and interact with the design teams.  At this event, our team has brought our project information to share with alumni and tell them how to get involved with our team.  The next day, the SDELC hosts an Open House for alumni who have contributed to SDELC fundraising efforts.  Our team has attended this event to build awareness about our team to the alumni of our school and this year we showed them the plans for our new lab that will be built in the center.
Campus Recruitment and Outreach Events
To help grow our organization’s presence on campus, we have attended new student organizational resource fairs and we have given talks in introductory and mid-level biological science classes.  It is because of these campus recruitment efforts that we have grown as a team and have established ourselves as active participants in the S&T student community.

In the mutant strain, the relative fluorescence increases 202% in comparison to the basal level.  This occurs over a narrow concentration range, which reflects the sensitivity of the two-component signaling system.  This sensitivity is critical for our system to be able to function as a low-concentration detector.
mCherry
Pcat_luxR_Plux_mCherry_luxI
Determine the quantitative expression of mcherry under the promoter Plux with and without Vibrio fischeri AHL synthase(LuxI)
Objective
We aspire to determine the kinetics of the promoter Plux (using the reporter gene mcherry), and whether or not the presence of the gene luxI enhances its signal.
Description
In this experiment, varying concentrations of 3o6c-AHL (3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone) are to be added to a culture of E. coli K-12 Top 10, expressing mcherry, a red fluorescent protein, under the promoter Plux. The bacteria were engineered to contain a plasmid with the gate Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry-LuxI.
In this experiment we will compere Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry-LuxI and Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry in order to determine whether or not the presence of AHL synthase (LuxI) causes signal enhancement.
Pcat is a constitutive promoter- therefore, luxR is expressed in excess in the bacteria, creating a dimer with the added AHL. This dimer binds to the Plux promoter, resulting in expression of mcherry, and fluorescence (emission peak: 608nm) which is to be measured using a plate-reader.
Materials and Method:
E. coli strains :
K-12 Top 10 containing the gate Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry-LuxI  (meant to check whether we have enhancement or not)
K-12 Top 10 containing the gate Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry (no AHL enhancement bacteria)
K-12 Top 10 containing the gate Plux-mcherry (luxR negative control)
Top 10 containing Plac-RFP (positive control)

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#ProteinGAN_-_-_TEXT.html," different areas of importance across the entire sequence. There are 64 such filters in ProteinGAN and ReactionGAN implementations.
Figure 9: Source: (Zhang et al., 2018)
Spectrum normalization
One of the biggest issue then implementing GAN is the stability of the training. In practise a lot of GAN implementations suffer from diminishing (very small) or exploding (enormously big) gradients. In both cases GANs are not capable to learn patterns in data successfully. To mitigate this issue,  spectrum normalization technique  (Miyato et al., 2018) was used. It is regularization method to constrain the Lipschitz constant of the weights. It has been shown that it works successfully even for a large and complex datasets such as ImageNet (Brock, Donahue and Simonyan, 2018).
Mode collapse
Given original GAN formulation, there is nothing to prevent generator from generating a single, very realistic example to fool the discriminator. Such scenario is known as mode collapse. It happens when generator learns to ignore the input (random numbers). Logically, it is an efficient way for generator to start generating examples that could fool discriminator. However, it is not desirable behaviour and it eventually cripples the training as discriminator can easily remember generated examples. While working with proteins, we observed that this issue is even more severe in comparison to images. In scientific community, a lot of different approaches were proposed to address the mode collapse issue: Unrolled GAN (Metz et al., 2017), Dual Discriminator (Nguyen et al., 2017), Mini batch Discriminator (Salimans et al., 2016) to name a few. We preferred Mini Batch Discriminator approach due to its simplicity and minimal overhead. Mini Batch Discriminator works an extra layer in the network that computes the standard deviation across the batch of examples (batch contains only real, or only fake sequences). If the batch contains a small variety of examples standard deviation will be low and discriminator will be able to use this information to lower the final score for each example in the batch. ProteinGAN follows the approach proposed by authors of Progressively growing GAN (Karras et al., 2018).

A big part of our project have been to cover  some of the ethical aspect regarding our project and indeed the general use of synthetic biology. If you are more interested in our ethical work, please go to Ethics .
The use of laboratory animals is a grey area ethical speaking. We did a survey regarding the use of antibodies and test animals. People from different continents have answered this survey. It shows that people in general are a bit ambivalent about the use of laboratory animals. However, the majority would like if the animals in the antibody production could be substituted with an alternative, such as E. coli. To see the full analysis of the survey, go to survey .

Level 1 cells had not grown enough so left again for another night.
Level0 p19 and LucX5 had white colonies, so they were picked and grown in broth overnight.
Checked plates from previous day: batch #4 of competent cells still grew on Cl plates, meaning they have developed Cl resistance (we’ve now thrown them away), and the 35S registry part plates failed to grow colonies
Re-did the level 1 reaction (cloning 35S, XVE and NosT into A1 plasmid): digested the plasmid, then added ligase - left at 16 degrees for 4 hours, then left at 4 degrees O/N
Started a culture of competent cells (from competent cell batch #3) to make competent cells up tomorrow
Made fresh stocks of everything needed to make competent cells because of contamination from last time (MgCl2, CaCl2, H2O, 100mM CaCl2 15% Glycerol, 800ml LB broth

In this part of modeling work, we mainly center on constructing some crucial circuits in our regulating network, including the light responding upstreams and downstream movement control mechanisms, as well as some middle wares.
The aim of these construction work is to know about the how the messaging delivering system work as a whole, how does the different signals effect each other in the final output level.
Introduction
We've constructed several modeling skeleton in Matlab Simbiology Package, they are:
DgrA/DgrB Circuit in regulating the flagellum movement
HfiA/HfsJ Circuit in regulating the genesis of composing substances holdfast.
The DNA Inverse Circuit which may change the direction in which promoter works.
Light Sensors including Blue, Red and Green.

Introduction
In this model, our aim is to verify that according to use of a recombinase, we can control the relative expressing level of two different kind of Protein.
This is a small picture illustrating its basic condition:
Equations
$ \frac{d(repressor)}{dt} = \frac{K_{repressor} - Vm_{rep} \cdot DNA^n_{rep}}{Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep}} - K_{bind}\cdot lac\cdot repressor$
$ \frac{d(DNA)}{dt} = -\frac{Vm_{rep}\cdot DNA^n_{rep}}{Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep}}$
$ \frac{d([repressor-DNA])}{dt} = \frac{Vm_{rep}\cdot DNA^n_{rep}}{Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep}}$
$ \frac{d([lac-repressor])}{dt} = K_{bind}\cdot lac\cdot repressor$
$ \frac{d(recombinase)}{dt} = K_{recom}\cdot DNA$

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html,", transcription is promoted or repressed.
The steps of working out the input function (which describes the rate of transcription as a function of the inducer concentration) of a gene are finding the concentration of active repressor (that unbound to the inducer, in this case, arabinose) and then finding the effect of that repressor on transcription.
We have taken araC to act as a repressor in these models, although as mentioned, it has dual activity, remaining on the DNA after arabinose binding to promote transcription.
Binding of repressor to site on DNA
First, working out the probability of the DNA site being occupied or free in the presence of a concentration of transcription factor. The equation describing the reversible DNA-Factor complex [DnX] formation is given below. Note that more than one molecule of repressor, the number here is given by n.
k_1 is the forward rate constant, k_2 is for the reverse reaction.
The probability of the DNA site being free of the repressor is given by [D]/[D_t] where D_t is the total amount of free DNA binding site available. Assuming a pseudo steady state where [Dnx] is stable, so that d[DnX]/dt = 0, and including the constraint that
allows the probability of finding a DNA site free of the repressor to be found by simple substitution and rearrangement of the rate equation below.
This gives the repressor dependent input function of the gene:
The constant K_d is effectively the nth root of k_2/k_1, as can be found by following through the derivations.
Sequestering of the repressor AraC by binding to arabinose
Again, a similar approach is taken as in enzyme kinetics. Effectively, all of the above derivation is followed but this time the amount of active repressor, X*, is found.  This assumes that the amount of AraC repressor bound to arabinose is in pseudo steady state. The total effect of the two repressing systems becomes that of an activator and in effect the detail could be hidden to have a simple activated transcription model. This approach would be the best to pursue in characterising the activator systems.
The Phage Activator Systems
Including the pBAD promoter as described above, an additional level of complication needs to be taken account of with the phage activator systems. Here the activator promotes transcription, so the input function for the gene under the activator controlled promoter is found from the probability that the DNA binding site is occupied. This is [DnX"

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#Cholera - Detection#Winterexp#Period2#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," KP April Today we purified the plasmids and got them ready to be sequenced. We used Dr. Grose’s spectrophotometer. We learned how to analyze the graph in order to know if we just have DNA or if there is something else in our mixture after the purification process. The bump of our graph was right over 260, so we know that we successfully purified our plasmids! The only object of concern, is the fact that we had a very low concentration of plasmids. The instructions in the kit advised 1-3 mL of E. coli potion for high copy DNA. We used 1 mL, so next time we will try 2-3 mL to see if we can get a higher concentration. We are unsure if we did something wrong, if there is something wrong with the kit, or if we just need to use more of the E. coli overnight potion. I need to become more familiar with the sequence of our plasmid, and we need to find out why our E.coli doesn’t glow. When I understand the plasmid sequence, hopefully we can know what is missing or defective in our E. coli that keeps it from glowing.
-CH Set up mini prep from the overnight culture. Followed the instructions found in the instruction manual for the kit. The two samples we did gave us concentrations of 24ug/ul and 16ug/ulw which was low. Next time we need to pellet more than  1ml of saturated culture for the initial step. Also we could have done the ethanol  wash spin down for longer.  Submitted 2 samples for sequencing using the more concentrated mini prep and primers IG11 and IG12.

- KP Today we made a plan of exactly what we need to do in the next week and coming months. Our biggest priority at this time is sequencing the plasmid from last years iGEM team. I was reading in the iGEM registry, and I saw that there is a pIG78 A and B. We tried A, but we haven’t tried B. On Monday we will try to transfer B into E. Coli and see if B works better than A. Next week our goal is to completely sequence the plasmid to see if something is missing or incorrect. I also need to do more research to understand better what last years team did and also the specifics of how we are going to set up our phage and how we are going to induce the lytic cycle in the presence of cholera.

June 22, 2018 The final decision
Some applications were simply rejected for a lack of feasibility, such as the scabies detection system (no proper biomarkers available). Furthermore, we had realized that the use of GMOs in the body would bring undesired safety hazards. For this reason, we eliminated the bone healing and kidney regeneration applications from our list. Thanks to our ethical analysis, we had realized that applications relevant to the Western world would be preferable over Third World applications from a justice point of view. This issue made us prefer the wound infections application over needleless vaccines and malaria sensors. Finally, the application must be feasible, as it would not be the initial focus of our laboratory work (this is the gel-adhesin system). As several teams had already been working on skin infections or related subjects (e.g. burn wounds) and several antibacterial proteins (bacteriocins) had been described in the literature, the skin infections topic met this requirement. A final important criterium was that the use of living GMOs must be beneficial compared to existing solutions in order to justify the use of living bacteria. We believed we could meet this requirement in two ways: firstly, by developing a secretable bacteriocin, we eliminate the need for (expensive) protein purification. Secondly, the use of living systems enables the relatively straight-forward integration of sensing and secretion.
III. Shaping the design
Once we had decided to focus on wound healing, there were many new questions to be answered by the Human Practices team. How to offer patients suffering from infected wounds the best possible treatment? Is there indeed a need for a new treatment? What requirements does our material need to fulfill? What are the medical details of the wounds? Which bacteria do we need to kill? To collect answers to these questions and many more, we contacted several experts and stakeholders.
July 3, 2018. Plasmacure
In our search for existing and future wound treatments, we came across Plasmacure.                         Plasmacure is a start-up aiming to cure chronic wounds, especially diabetic wounds,                         with plasma (fourth phase of matter). They developed a small machine producing                         plasma which can be connected to a disposable plaster. The plaster is applied to                         the wound. During a one-minute treatment, the wound is exposed to plasma. This                         should be enough to kill all bacteria and fungi on the wound. This treatment is                         repeated ten times. The product is still under development, but the first small                         clinical trial showed"

Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#PCInterface_-_-_TEXT.html," there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
Activities
The event began on Friday the 14th in the afternoon with the main course. In it, after the reception of the attendees we gave way to a series of very interesting expert presentations. We were able to count on the attendance of the following personalities
Victor de Lorenzo
He is one of the Spanish most relevant researchers in the Synthetic Biology field. He work in the National Biotechnology Center (CNB) a part of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations (CSIC). His laboratory is specialized in solving environmental issues using genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida. He gave us an interesting talk about ""Synthetic Biology in the rescue of the planet Earth"".
Saul Ares
He is a researcher of the CNB too. His work is central in the mathematical modeling of Synthetic Biology systems. He has also collaborated with previous iGEM teams. His presentation talked about ""How do cyanobacteria count to ten"".
Krzysztof Wabnik
He is a Young Investigator Researcher of the Center for Biotechnology and Plant Genomics (CBGP) at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). The group he is leading uses multilevel computer model simulations, synthetic biology experiments and microfluidics. The name of his presentation was: ""Combining computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand the dynamics of plant hormone signaling circuits"".
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
After the talks a social event was held in which the attending teams could relax having dinner in the center of Madrid with one of the most typical activities here: go out for tapas.
The second day was inaugurated with a visit to the university to show the facilities where our team works and it was explained which procedures are used in each of the sections that were visited.
Subsequently, the presentations of the projects were made. A simulation of the presentation was carried out as it should be done in Boston, to learn how to take the time and try to correct the excesses or lack of time in each section that was exposed.
In the afternoon there was a tour around Madrid, where the most iconic places of the city were shown. And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet up"

These few super shedders are important factors to pre-harvest contamination as the source of 80% of O157:H7 strains isolated from beef carcasses are from the high cattle density and rapid turnover environment of the processing plant and transport trailers, not the original feedlot (Arthur, 2009).
We also met with and discussed E. coli markers with Dr. Glen Armstrong, professor and head of the Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Infectious Diseases at the University of Calgary. Dr. Armstrong suggested that we implement multiple TALEs to target different markers to identify E. coli serotypes.
Primers containing the target sequences of TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ), TALE B( BBa_K782006 ), and variations of the target sequences (with point mutations in different positions) were used to perform a PCR on RFP generator ( BBa_J04450 ); the product of the PCR would be the target sequence of the TALE and a part of the RFP gene which is 660 base paris (figures 1, 2 and 3). The PCR products were purified and digested with XbaI and PstI and inserted into  a vector; RFP generator was also digested with XbaI and PstI to prepare the vector.
IPTG inducible promoter with RBS ( BBa_J04500 ) was transformed with competent cells and plated on Amp and Chlor.

Subsequently, a overnight cultures of the colonies were made and a plasmid purification was performed. Digestion of the purified plasmids with NotI and running the products on the gel produced the expected results (figure 4).  TALE A"

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Policies_-_-_TEXT.html,". Kaebnick’s work allowed us to think about synthetic biology as a broad enabling technologically with many applications, rather than a technology for a particular purpose [8]. Thinking about synthetic biology as an emerging technology has many ramifications for public policy making. As there are many opportunities for innovation in synthetic biology, the best approach to emerging biotechnology policy making is with transparency and broad public input, similar to other technologies such as the internet and artificial intelligence [7].
The questions and insights we gained from Dr. Kaebnick’s work are relevant to our project because they show that we need to clearly articulate the values and viewpoints of hydroponic farmers, users, and consumers. While it may be difficult to reconcile these viewpoints, it is our obligation and our desire to facilitate discussion between people from all backgrounds. This is the impetus for much of our outreach, as well as our collaboration with Stony Brook to produce a survey assessing the underlying attitudes of synthetic biology across New York state. Our ultimate aim is to understand perceptions and knowledge of synthetic biology. A true understanding of another’s opinion and basis results in deeper, more productive conversation.
END USERS
We developed our design through the guidance of our end users. We received feedback from over 40 interviews with hydroponic growers, suppliers, plant biologists, and oxidative stress researchers. This information allowed us to develop a robust system that addressed the most pressing issues hydroponic growers had. See Practices for more information about our integrated feedback. As we spoke with them, we realized that a common theme was that growers had a common problem: they faced incredibly high operating costs with low profit margins. Furthermore, many were shuttering their doors due to crop underperformance or even total failure. We needed a way to address this issue - and OxyPonics does just that by boosting crop performance and yield while keeping capital costs to a minimum.
SAFETY AND RISK ASSESSMENT
We recognize that there is public concern about the danger of introducing mutant bacteria to consumer produce. However, we assert that Oxyponics is a legitimate and safe additive to any deep water hydroponic farm hoping to increase crop size and yield.
Our team believes there is little to no risk to adding genetically engineered E. coli to the hydroponic setup for two reasons. First, the bacteria are enclosed in dialysis tubing that allows water and molecules to flow freely, but not the bacteria themselves. Thus, there is no danger of the bacteria leaving the hydroponic facility or being ingested by any consumer. Second, all produce is processed and sanitized before being sold at market and/or eaten."

Electron microscopy is an imaging technique that can acquire images with resolutions far above the optical limit due to the small wavelength of electrons (Nellist, 2011) . An electron gun forms an electron beam which is focused and accelerated by magnetic lenses. When the electrons reach the sample,                                  the electrons that are scattered at a high angle are used to image the sample (Figure 1). We hope that Wageningen is happy with the nice pictures!

Fluorophore spectrum
The emission spectrum of our fluorophore expressing cells was kindly measured by                                 the Wageningen team in a plate reader. As their plate reader has a narrower bandwidth,                                 the emission spectrum was nicely visible starting a few nanometers from the                                 excitation wavelength. Thanks to the help of Wageningen,                                 we were able to show that our newly developed BioBricks mVenus and mCerulean are successfully fluorescent!
The recorded spectra are shown in Figure 2 and 3. More information can be found in the results page .

Pasteur
At the European meetup in Paris we met the team of Pasteur from Paris, who were also using the enzyme silicatein. We discussed our projects and agreed on helping each other. When                                  we returned from Paris we had a nice Skype call with Pasteur on silicatein. Pasteur helped us by providing us with documentation and information on the characteriztion of polysilicate.                                  We helped Pasteur by explaining them about our methods and we recommended them a kit they could use to determine the enzyme kinetics of silicatein. For our collaboration they gave us a badge. You can also read about our collaboration on their wiki .
Surveys
We filled in surveys for a lot of iGEM teams, we hope that by filling in these surveys we helped them with their projects.

From figures 2-5,   and the data it can be deducted that especially the global alignment score is an important factor in distinguishing gene doping DNA. Therefore, we recommend to further optimize the weights starting with relatively higher global alignment weights.
We challenged our method at the Hackathon , where participants believed that the optimal doping strategy would be to design sequences on the boundary between doping sequences and other DNA. It will nevertheless be hard for doping creators to design further sequences that go undetected by our tool, given that the protein should still be functional as well.
Within the team we also had a competition to beat the algorithm by doping sequence design. Many of us submitted a sequence and the algorithm was able to distinguish more than 80% of them as gene doping. Additionally, the input of any other natural DNA than EPO has always been classified as such. All in all, the algorithm has a great predictive power. The extending database will in the future only even extend this power, which makes us confident that gene doping can in this way rightly be distinguished.
Further Applications
The early stage diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia has been a big challenge. Frontotemporal dementia has been associated with splicing defects in gene FTDP-17 ( Buee et al., 2000 ), resulting in mRNA coding for disfunctional proteins. Our tool can be extended to classify the mRNA sequences and thereby may provide many patients with an early stage diagnosis.
2. gRNA Array Minimization Tool
The second software tool we made can be linked to the first one and also used independently. It is a gRNA generation tool with a unique functionality: it generates all possible gRNA’s at a single position, including all codon substituted versions (figure 6).
Figure 6. Principle of gRNA generation at a single position for all codon substitutions. A target region is identified on a DNA sequence. This sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence to identify regions with little codon substitutions possible. The region of least possible gRNAs is identified and the gRNA’s are generated.
This is very useful for catching gene dopers, since they might change the codons in their doping gene to avoid"

HIT-Harbin,2014,Team:HIT-Harbin#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," ProMoT. The models reflect several problems:
a)The influence the metabolism system has on our genetic circuit is quite small. We have built up some models for corresponding reactions by Hill Equation. It turns out that their results are similar to others. So the models given by Law of Mass Action will not deviate too much from the reality.
b)The period of time to achieve homeostasis: 25h with memory system; 38h without memory system;
c)After adding memory system, the time for GFP to be steady become significantly shorter. Meanwhile, after eliminating dioxin, GFP produced by device without memory system will attenuate to 50%. But for those devices with memory system, the attenuation of GFP will be less than 10%.
d)Memory system has a process of positive feedback. Thus, just a trace of leakage of promoters can cause a lot of GFP being transcribed and end up interfering the result. That’s the reason why we add in insulating parts.
Section Ⅱ: Differential Equation Model for Supplementary Circuit
Originally, we intended to keep on utilizing Prof. Mario’s software to model for our supplementary project. However, it is limited by the processing capacity of computers. As is shown in the previous models, our device can neglect the metabolism system of yeast. Hence, we turn to the approach of differential equation.
a)Relevant Parameters
b) Assumptions
1)All the reactions follow the Law of Mass Action
2)Adjacent genes have the same speed of transcription
3)Terminator and LexA have no leakage
4)All of LexA-CYC1 are equivalent
5)All LexA regulatory factors degrade naturally
c) Model Simplification
One significant parameter of “sensor” is the response time. So the negligible biochemical reaction period in traditional systematic biologic model need to be taken into consideration.
1)Is the time of synthesis of mRNA negligible?
2)Is the time of synthesis of GFP/LexA negligible?
3)Can the concentration of dioxin+LexADBD be approximated as the concentration of pure dioxin?
1) The influence from the time of synthesis of mRNA
Suppose the concentration of mRNA is cmr, the synthesis rate is s, and the half life of mRNA is T. Then we have:
Solving the differential equation, we can obtain the result:
According to the statistics from bionumbers, mRNA’s half life is around 2mins, while its synthesis time is less than 5s. There’s no harm to assume that mRNA’s synthesis rate is 0"

Introduction
Synthetic biology is currently one of the most rapidly developing fields in science. Recent advancements, particularly in genetic engineering, allow us to tackle major societal challenges. Gene engineering is even being applied to humans, with the use of gene therapy. Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent among others severe genetic disorders.  However, major concerns are raised about the misuse of gene editing techniques, particularly for human enhancement . Gene doping,  the misuse of gene therapy to enhance athletes’ performances, is one example. To promote responsible use of synthetic biology and to help eliminate gene doping from sport, we developed a complete gene doping detection method: ADOPE, the Advanced Detection of Performance Enhancement (figure 1).
Figure 1. The fusion protein consisting of Tn5 transposase and dxCas9.
ADOPE is based on targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), reducing the amount of data generated with NGS and effectively identifying gene doping DNA. We accomplished this by creating an innovative fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ) used in rapid library preparation required for sequencing . Our fusion protein consists of a cleavage deficient nuclease specific dxCas9 and a Tn5 transposase. The dxCas9 part loaded with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) will interact with the specific target DNA sequence via complementary matching between sgRNA and target DNA. Whereas the Tn5 part will integrate two small DNA molecules (adapters) required for nanopore sequencing. Thus, the fusion protein is capable of performing dxCas9 guided adapter ligation for targeted sequencing library preparation, allowing us to identify gene doping in blood samples with our method ADOPE.
ADOPE
We designed ADOPE to detect gene doping in blood samples by targeting the most striking difference between the natural and gene doping DNA, namely the exon-exon junctions that only exist in doping DNA ( Beiter et al., 2011 ). ADOPE consists of four main steps: sample preparation , prescreening , library preparation and sequencing .

Blood samples are commonly taken from athletes during regular doping tests. We used these blood samples to extract DNA from serum or the buffycoat"

Fluorescent ATP-Aptamer testing
To test  if the signal of the fluorescent aptamer could be specifically shut off in absence of the ATP target - the aptamer linked to fluorescein,  and the quencher fragment were hybridized in SSC 1X at 40°C for 20 min. That’s what we call the detection device. After a purification step, here’s the testing procedure:
Material:
The fluorescent detection device, dryed or in solution, 2.5 nmol is fine.
An 96 well plate, in black plastic.
Some PBS freshly made, pH = 7.1
ATP and GTP
Method:
Make a series of dilutions of ATP in PBS, we recommend to go from 10 mM to 1 µM. Store it on ice to prevent degradation.
Put 50 µL of each ATP dilutions per well, make triplicates. Don’t forget controls with plain PBS and a 10 mM GTP solution.
Dissolve the DNA in the appropriate volume of PBS, and quickly add 50 µL of this solution to each well with ATP or control solutions.
Measure fluorescence with a plate reader within 5 min to prevent bleaching.
Use the collected data !

EMSA are complicated experiments, with a lot of parameters to be adjusted.  Follow these general guidelines to adjust critical parameters (Temperature, pH, voltage, ionic composition).
Material:
An Aptamer and its proteic target.
TBE buffer 10X pH = 8.3
Folding buffer, according to the aptamer’s characteristics, often SSC 1X. Binding buffer (refer to the aptamer’s description for their compositions).
A native PAGE gel (12.5% Acrylamide, TBE 1X final, ions if needed for the interaction measured (Often Mg2+ or K+))
Method:
Dissolve the aptamer in the folding buffer, make sure to have a final concentration at least ten times lower than the expected Kd. Denature it at 99°C, then fold it 20 min at 42°C. Cool gently.
Make serials dilutions of target protein in the binding buffer.
Gently mix 16 µL of proteins with 4 µL of the folded aptamer. Let it stand for 20 min at room temperature.
Add loading dye and load 15 µL of the mixture in each well.

All experiments were carried out in 96-well microtiter plate format for 10 h. This kinetic data-sets were also used for parameter-fitting in our modeling approach .
We found an about 60-fold reduced basal GFP expression and an increased signal-to-noise ratio of about 6-fold when using our riboregulator construct, as compared to a non-regulated reference RBS (B0034) . These results are summarized in figure 2. The BioBrick conform module was confirmed to show no loss-of-funtion due to EcoRI and XbaI site removal. Interestingly the sensitivity towards the inducer was reduced (see figure 3). Is interesting to speculate if small changes in the sequences flanking the riboregulator could be used as a way to switch the response curve.
Figure 3 Improved signal-to-noise ratio and decreased basal GFP expression (leakiness) due to the use of a riboregulator in combination with a quorum-sensing module. The fluorescence per OD600 is shown for the LuxR-system with a complete riboregulator over an inducer-range of 10-13 M to 10-5 M (dashed, light blue). An incomplete riboregulator without the trans-activator shows the expected reduced sensitivity towards the inducer (dark blue). As a reference, a system with a non-regulated RBS (BBa_B0034) is shown (light blue). Data points are mean values of triplicate measurements in 96-well microtiter plates 200 min after induction ± standard deviation.

Procedure
Transforming E.coli with BBa_J33206
Preparing the BioBrick
The BioBrick BBa_J33206 is found in the spring distributions in plate 1 and in well 9D. Following recommendations given on the Parts Registry website, 15µl of distilled sterile water was added. The mixture of water and dehydrated DNA was then mixed using the pipette before being placed into an Eppendorf tube. The Eppendorf tube was then transferred to the -20°C freezer.
Carrying out the transformation
To carry out the transformation of DH5α E.coli cells, Phil Aldridge’s protocol for heat shock transformation was used. All the steps were followed except for:
Step 5 – The cells were left in the ice for 15 minutes instead of the 30 minutes suggested on the protocol page. 15 minutes is actually sufficient time.
This is the summary of the steps for this transformation:
The premade competent DH5α E.coli cells were transferred from the -80°C freezer and into an ice bucket. In the meantime, the water bath was switched on and set to 45°C.
Once a quick vortex was given, 5µl of the BBa_J33206 BioBrick was added to the solution. The Eppendorf tube containing the cells was then placed in the ice bucket for 15 minutes.
Once 30 minutes had elapsed, the tubes were introduced to the 45°C water bath for strictly 50 seconds before being returned to the ice for 2 minutes.
0.9ml of LB was then added to the Eppendorf tube and left to grow in the 37°C incubator for 60 minutes.
Plating out the ‘transformed’ bacteria
After the transformation steps had been accomplished, 200µl of the LB solution containing E.coli cells was then spread onto 1 plate containing LB + ampicillin. The plasmid to which the BioBrick BBa_J33206 is attached, the pSB1A2 plasmid, confers ampicillin resistance so a selection pressure of ampicillin should be applied. The plate was then labelled and stored in the 37°C incubator.

First, we added the ADH1 promoter at the beginning of the sequence. The ADH1 promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, which is used for protein expression in yeast. Originally the ADH1 promoter regulates the expression of the Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1 enzyme in S. cerevisiae. This version of the promoter is a shortened one and it is not inhibited by ethanol.  Secondly, we added a histidine tag for purification of the prepared protein and finally added the ADH1 terminator for more effective expression.

Meet the Team!
The Queen’s iGEM team consists of eighteen undergraduate students from a variety of different disciplines including biology, biochemistry, life sciences, engineering and computing. All of our team members share a passion for synthetic biology and a desire to participate in student-led research and expand their knowledge of the work done in this innovative field. Due to the multidisciplinary expertise of all our members, each student on the team has contributed their own unique experiences and skills to our 2018 research project.
Students
Elisha Krauss (Director)
Elisha is the current QGEM Director, and he just graduated from Life Sciences, specializing      in Biomedical Sciences with a thesis in Neuroscience! He is starting his Masters at McGill      University in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience, where he will develop novel viral vectors      for optogenetics. He enjoys travelling (backpacking and road-trips) and dogs. He recently just      got back from a three-week trip to Europe! He backpacked in London, Glasgow, Paris, Berlin, and      Prague. In his free time this summer, he hopes to learn French and study for the GRE. He has a      long-haired dachshund named Harley.

FUNDRAISING THROUGH BAKESALES
In order to successfully carry out the wetlab experiments and fund other aspects of the iGEM project, nearly $100 000 needed to be raised. Strategic marketing efforts combined with fundraising initiatives.
While most of the funds are expected from corporate sponsors, the marketing team has also organized events such as bake sales to raise additional money. Over the course of the summer, we held four bake sales where the team members baked delicious treats such as samosas, spring rolls, cupcakes, muffins and sold them at the O’Brien Health Science Centre. When our peers, professors and staff of the Health Science Centre came to our sale, we had the opportunity tell them about iGEM and our efforts of building a synthetic biology community in Alberta. We also gave out our monthly newsletters at the event. We raised over $1 500.00 just in bake sales. The team is planning another final sale on Tuesday, October 27th, 2009, the week of the iGEM Jamboree. We are hopeful that we will raise over $500 dollar net profit from it. These fundraising activities and events are being carried out immediately while the team is looking ahead towards more efficient and effective investment plans.
Here are a couple photos from our bakesales:

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," of property is material and could be compared to land ownership.
At the contrary, the living are seen as “nobody's property”, good of their own (even if we can possess them), or, thinking about species, something close to a patrimony, and in every case, deeply inalienable. The question of alienability of the patrimony brings them close that particular good as national territories (In France, the inalienability of the national territory was in question during the religious war).
That patrimonial status of the living is also what seems to support environmental discourses to defend it. We do not defend in the same way an item of property as we defend a species about to become extinct. In the first case, we are defending something because it is our good, in the second case, we defend it because a moral value makes that extinction unacceptable to our eyes.
Environmental ethics enlightens us with the concept of “intrinsic value” of the living, as distinguished from what could be an “instrumental value”. That distinction permits us to consider nature not only as a resource, or a means, but also as a end. That way, we have to respect the Kantian maxim, already enlarged. Kant, in the Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals argues fact that every good action has not only a means, but also an end (Kant 1785). With the concept of intrinsic value, environmental ethics permits us to apply that maxim to the living, and assure its inalienability. Nature is an end in itself.
But, what about species built by synthetic biology? The science could, by new production and forms of exchange, call into question that inalienability of the living. The case of Venter's patent is an example of the perspective of a living-good, from its abstract conception, even before its material realization. The form of property applied here is not a material ownership anymore, like the farmer and his or her herd. Because of the invention, the design, it is an intellectual property. Intellectual property, applied to the living-good, upsets totally two sets of elements: our representation of the living and the form of our exchange. Living will be, from that point, able to be qualified as both natural and artificial. It won't be necessarily “given” but could also be constructed, designed. In that second case, it is so attached to intellectual property and will be submit to the forms of exchange of the intellectual goods. But, as we will see later, it will also permit to critics to use the arguments of the opensource and free software movements"
