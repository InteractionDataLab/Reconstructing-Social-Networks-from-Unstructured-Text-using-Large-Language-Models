Collaborations
CollaborationWe got a lot through our iGEM journey, and one of the best and most valuable among them was our cooperation with other iGEM team. In this win-win process, we exchanged our ideas, inspired creativity, and even helped each other to run experiments. Collaboration With iGEM Team BGIC China Team BGIC China>>Us Team BGIC China were working on a programmable and open-source Next Generation Bio-Chip (NGBC) which allows user with knowledge in synthetic biology to easily re-program and re-construct it in order to make new bio-chips with different functions. They based their NGBC on E. coli S30 Extract System for Circular DNA(Promega), the same with ours. They also utilized enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) as one of their reporter gene. So they helped us to test whether S30 system was qualified as a platform for translation of enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ). Here is their result.
Figure: The blue liquid in the small eppendorf is the S30 system with gene circuit coding enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) and its substrates, X-gal, after hours of reaction. It qualitatively proved that our S30 cell-free system works well.
We also tested this with a different reporter gene, luciferase. Check our results in the “Proof of Concept” section of our wiki.
SFLS>>Team BGIC China We helped Team BGIC China by constructing plasmid pfadr for them. Plasmid pfadr is already in the parts collection and is modified to be responsive to fatty acid. Here are some of the results we got in the process.
Figure 1: the Nanodrop results of plasmid extraction
Figure 2: the PCR result
We have really close relationship with Team BGIC China, because we share the same laboratory with them and received training on the cloning cycled together. We also shared a great part of cloning materials in the beginning of our experiment because our materials haven’t arrived yet. We always had great communication about our projects and on our testing experiments, since our projects are based on the same technology platform-cell-free system.

What is MiniMos?
The miniMos transposon is used to carry transgenes into the C. elegansgenome by the means of inserting a transgene into a modified Mos1 element (miniMos). The miniMos transposon can carry the inserted transgene (together with a selection marker) into the genome where insertions are generated directly by injecting worms. It will take approximately 1 week to get the result. The insertion site is random and can be identified by inverse PCR on the strain.
The miniMos system contains 4 vectors——transposon with target gene, transposase, mcherry and peer-1 markers. Transposon needs transposase to cut and paste in the genome. mcherry and peer-1 are two negative selecter that can help to select the target strains.
The method has some advantages: 1)The insertion frequency and fidelity is high. 2)The exact insertion site can be determined. 3)Large transgenes can be inserted. 4)The miniMos element is active in C. elegans. 5)Transgenes are expressed in the germline at high frequency.
How to get the worms?
As a classic model organism, C. elegans has many advantages.It is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system. Research has explored the neural and molecular mechanisms that control several behaviors of C. elegans, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, mechanotransduction, learning, memory, and mating behaviour. Therefore, C. elegans is a suitable model organism which we can easily manipulate and observe. In our program, we aim to change the physical behaviour of C. elegans by using the two specific optogenetic traits. Through microinjection and selection, we are able"

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," it turned out that they were actually quite easy going so we had nothing to worry about. Cigdem began asking us many questions as soon as we met to prepare for our conversation. Once she was ready, our interview began and everything was broadcasted live.
At first we were asked about the iGEM competition to give the audience an idea about what it actually is for. iGEM might be well known among scientific faculty members and science students at our university but students in other fields of study are usually not familiar with the term.
After the quick introduction to the competition we started explaining synthetic biology in more detail - which is a quite unknown expression as well - and gave examples of what we’re actually dealing with next to our research, such as sponsoring, meetings with experts, modeling and spreading the world about synthetic biology. This was a perfect transition to our past and upcoming outreach projects that Salima quickly presented. We invited all fellow students to come. Our interviewer was quite happy to know that those events were also for non-scientist without any knowledge in synthetic biology.
Next we had to answer why we joined the iGEM team and mentioned practical experience, our own project and exponential
growth
eeh learning curves as our motivation.
This led to our current project - the co-culture consisting of three organisms. We tried to explain our plan in a way that was also understandable for people who didn’t know much about biology. Cigdem asked whenever something was too complicated which gave us a great sense as to what might be hard to understand when you’re not dealing with it everyday and every night. Before the interview ended we were once again allowed to advertise our upcoming lecture series talks on the radio.
All in all it was a very interesting experience to talk in front of people you can’t see which gives you a rather odd feeling. We learned how to describe a complex project to people with little knowledge about specific mechanisms and were able to reach people beyond our usually scientifically interested audience.
V-Bio Karl-von-Frisch Award Ceremony
Every year the VBIO - an association to promote biology -  awards excellent high school graduates in Biology a prize. Just like the previous year the iGEM team Duesseldorf helped to welcome the students and gave a talk about the iGEM competition in general and their project.
Four members of our team took the train on June 26 and arrived at noon at the BioMedizinZentrum (BMZ) in Dortmund. After meeting Professor Susanne Bickel and the organiser, we helped them distribute badges to the students in order to mark them as guests. Some cakes"

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," dependency on others which has aroused wide concern in economic and politic matters. The                  director also mentioned that they find bioethanol production as very strategic in the means of providing supply security for                  our country which could be enhanced by our project. Thus, we also discussed increasing bioethanol factories as an effective                  and fertile solution, in Turkey to decrease our dependence.
As we discussed how in some states of US, 10 % bioethanol use in fuels are mandatory whereas in our country only 3% is; we                  asked Mr. Can what could be done in order to increase the percentage. The answer came right away; he told us that we should                  be careful not to, in many ways, minimize the fields designated for agriculture as we raised awareness of the topic. We gave                  it some thought and came up with the idea of specifying the fields based on how they will be used. He also mentioned that Sun                  and wind energy catch on more as in bioethanol production, logistical problems occur more often and better technology is needed.                  This pointed the craving for our project in our country.
Another concern of ours was that after the cotton harvesting season, farmers burn the straws which were not collected on time.                  Such occurrence harms the soil and further affects the next seeds. We additionally suggested if we could support the collection of                  the straws by reducing the fuel prices for the farmer. Therefore we asked Mr. Can what can be done to best fulfill our goal. He told                  us that the bioethanol producing factories only work for specific seasons. Although the answer did not provide a solution to our                  concern, it highlighted how our project can serve as a long-term working and cheap alternative.
Mr. Can believed that our project is on point considering the dependence of Turkey to foreign countries; when it comes to energy                  sources. He, furthermore, told us that if something like our project were to become widely used, it could help to maintain a good                  economy energy-wise and a good source of power. Before our meeting was over, Oğuz Can gave us advice on how to educate other people                  about biofuels and raise awareness and told us he would be supporting us with our work.
Visiting Turkey’s biggest Bioethanol Biorefinery
Since our project mainly focuses on bioethanol production, we wanted to know how the process is carried out for industrial purposes.                  We visited the local producer of ethanol, Konya Çumra Integrated Facilities and tried to gather information about the process. There,                  we were given a thorough tour of the facility and were able to ask questions regarding"

The Curios Little Story about a Curios Little Being
All the statistics show that it is the level of knowledge regarding GMOs that constitutes   people's attitude towards GMOs. Actually, this mechanism is quite natural and concern many   other instances. The less we know about a certain thing, the more we fear it, and if the road is   paved with fear, then irrational attitudes will be the offspring of irrational arguments. Our   mission is not to convert anyone's opinion concerning GMO, but to make people talk about it.   A GMO itself is not right or wrong, the existence of an organism cannot be wrong, it is how   we decide to use it that can be ethically discussed.   is the way to make sure that whatever opinion one might have, it is built on a solid foundation.   But how do we even start. People can be very hardheaded. Why are they hardheaded?   The have been shaped, twisted and turned by the circumstances of life and are in no way   what so ever in a place where such complicated issues  as GMOs can prioritized"

The plasmid backbones were cut from the gel and frozen in epindorfs, to be purified and phosphatase treated next week.
A colony PCR was done on the UV+pSB1C3 coloines 2, 4, and 6 using VF2 and VR primers and program 500. these were then purified and nanodropped. Colony 2: 63.9ng/μL, colony 4: 74.9ng/μL, and colony 6: 64.4ng/μL. A 1 in 30 dilution of each was made, 10μL of that taken, along with 2.5μL water, and 2.5μL 10uM primer to send out for sequencing by GeneWiz.
6/30/14
Designed primers for various promoters and reporters found in the 2014 iGem plates.
I took 1μL of UV+pACYC184 and 1μL GFP+pBR322 and put each into 200μL of water. This was vortexed and then 20μL of it used for PCR. Each one was set up in two PCR tubes, one which got the pBR322 sequencing primers and one which got the pACYC184 sequencing primers. This was to check if the two epindorfs had been mislabeled. PCR program #130 was run, and then 5μL of product was run on a gel which showed that they had indeed been mislabeled. They were put into new epindorfs with the correct labels.
With that PCR program, I also did two colony PCRs of HSP+pACYC184 colonies 1 and 3. This was to send out for sequencing. We ran 5μL of the product on the gel, because last time we PCRed them, we got a lot of different bands, so we wanted to run it on a gel and gel purify the band that contained our desired piece. This time, again we saw a lot of bands, but I threw out the gel accidentally. So, instead of sending PCR products to genewiz for sequencing, we're going to send the whole plasmid once we midi prep it from the colonies.
I purified the gel fragments that had the input and output backbones that had been cut with KpnI and XhoI, following ""PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Protocol"

Colony PCR
Experimentor : Liz Geum
Aim : To amplify the region between VF2 and VR to confirm the presence of 3kb insert in the vector.
Results : 20 white colonies were picked after GFP screening. All colonies showed small bands of ~200 base pairs, and no 3kb band was present. We decided to further test these colonies by restriction digest analysis; additional 10 white colonies from the plate were inoculated in LB/Chlor overnight cultures.

Restriction digest analysis of miniprep plasmids
Experimentor : Liz Geum
Aim : To digest the miniprep plasmids with XbaI and PstI to check for presence of 3kb insert as well as directionality. If band is present at 3kb, it indicates that our insert is present in the right direction. If the insert went in the wrong direction, then it will only show a 5kb linearized band as only PstI cutsite will be cut.
Results : All 10 plasmids showed a linearized band at 2kb region. This likely indicates that all plasmids are empty self-ligated vectors.

Renilla Luciferase assay in three plasmids system
Three recombinant plasmids were generated and transiently transfected into a human bladder cancer cell line T24.
To test the working efficiency of our orthogonal system, we devided the cells into two groups. One has Ack in the culture medium and another does not.
Luciferase assays were performed using luminometer. Since Ack is essential for our system, we speculated that Renilla Luciferase(Rluc), the output gene in the circuits can be selectively expressed in Experiment group with Ack. As shown in Fig. 1, the activity of Renilla Luciferase(RLUC) varied widely between the two groups, and the circuit only demonstrated significant activity in the experimental group as expected. Therefore, our orthogonal system is verified to be in good condition and can work efficiently.
Luciferase assay in two plasmids system
hTERT and hUPII promoters are cancer specific promoter and bladder specific promoter, respectively. By combining the two promoters into the design, we supposed that the constructed circuits have the ability to selectively identify bladder cancer cells, in which telomerase and uroplakins are both expressed.
To test this hypothesis, we used the luciferase reporter gene as the output of the circuit and tested the luciferase activity in HFC, which is short for human fiber epithelial cell, Hela, a cervical carcinoma cell line and 5637, a bladder cancer cell line. Also, we reconstructed our system in two plasmids to test if two plasmids system can perform higher efficiency.
The result (Fig.2) shows that the activity of LUC in 5637 with Ack was about two times as high as that in 5637 without Ack and three times as high as that in Hela, while it could not be measured in HFC. We can learn from this result that this system is perfectly safe for normal cells, with no luciferase being detected in HFC. However, compared with three plasmids system, whose RLUC activity of experimental group is about 7 times as high as that of control group, the working efficiency of our orthogonal system in two plasmids is much lower. So we had better construct"

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) stem from a set of fundamental concepts: the designation of physicochemical constraints on reaction networks, a mathematically-derived representation of cell objectives (e.g. growth and maintenance) and a genome-wide scope of metabolism (Lewis, Nagarajan and Palsson, 2012). Constraints in biochemical networks serve to generate accurate representation of the system. The main constraining factors are: substrate and enzyme availability, mass and charge balances and thermodynamics. Two critical assumptions of this type of model is that mass and energy are conserved and that the system is in steady-state (i.e. there is no internal accumulation of metabolites).
The constraints of a network are represented mathematically by a matrix delineated by coefficients representing the stoichiometries of metabolites in each reaction. For example, a coefficient of -1 indicates one molecule of the reactant is consumed in the corresponding reaction, a coefficient of 1 conversely signifies the production of one molecule and a coefficient of 0 indicates a metabolite that does not participate in the reaction. This along with constraints regarding the maximal and minimal fluxes of reactions demarcate a solution space of feasible distributions that satisfy the designated constraints, representing possible states of the microbial network.
We further define the reconstructed model with a statement of the cell or microorganism's objectives: in most cases, that would be the urge to grow as much as possible! There have been other disputed goals that the cell may wish to achieve such as the minimization of energy use (i.e. ATP storage). These objective functions are added onto the GEM to refine the possible states that are attained by the cell in the context of the goal (García Sánchez and Torres Sáez, 2014). For example, a biomass function (Feist and Palsson, 2010), a pseudo-reaction constructed to describe the rate and proportion at which precursors for biosynthesis of crucial components (e.g. amino acids) are made, can be used to predict the specific growth rate of the cell. These functions can then be maximized or minimized using optimization (e.g. linear programming).
Linear programming is a mathematical optimization method used to find the maximum or minimum of a mathematical model wherein the requirements are defined by linear relationships. The main algorithm that employs this technique - and is a staple in GEM analysis - is the flux balance analysis (FBA). In FBA, the objective function and environmental constraints (e.g. different carbon sources, available oxygen levels, etc.) are defined and the system is solved using linear programming (Orth, Thiele"

Device conception
Having listed the features our device must display, we started thinking about its design to contain our synthetic biology system. We went over the technical specifications one by one and we tried to find the most suitable solution.
To provide a proof of concept of the feasibility of our product, we first made a prototype. This prototype has been designed to treat 5 liters of water in a single use. It will be necessary in the future to increase the treatment capacity to meet the water needs of cholera-affected villages.

Conclusion
GMMs containment
Our synthetic biology system must be confined in a compartment that prevents modified microorganisms from spreading in water and in Nature. So we first thought up a sachet containing our sensor Vibrio harveyi and our killer-effector Pichia Pastoris. This sachet will also contain nutrients to allow microorganism to survive and fulfill their function.
Sachet containing our synthetic biology system composed of V. harveyi and P. pastoris with nutrient medium (Solidworks modeling)
Containment materials
(1) In order to ensure the feasibility of the system and the functional specifications, it is necessary to allow exchanges of CAI-1 molecules and antimicrobial peptides through the sachet. Water must also diffuse in order to rehydrate the freeze-dried microorganisms.
(2) However, GMMs must remain inside the sachet in order to avoid spreading in Nature and ingestion by the users.
(3) To ensure optimum confinement, the chosen material must be strong and must not appear fragile.
(4) Finally, we must find the best cost while also considering the environmental aspect. Materials with a low impact on the environment and recyclable would be ideal.
The solution we chose is a material with pores such as a membrane with an appropriate cut-off threshold.

Table. 1 Shows the top three tracks that were most popular among the participating teams in 10 years
We found that in 2009-2018, iGEM's participating teams were more concerned with the four aspects of ‘Environment’, ‘Foundational Research’, ‘Health & Medicine’, and ‘New applications’. This implies that environmental pollution and health care are still the most popular issues in the world of synthetic biology.
It is worth noting that compared with 2009, the choice of track in 2018 was more diversified, and the track of ‘Art & Design’ and other humanities and social sciences has also received attention.
Figure. 4A
Figure. 4B
Figures. 4A and Figures. 4B show the academic background of the participants
We obtained information on the participants’ academic background by analyzing the wiki of each team. It should be noted that since many teams do not introduce the academic background of the team members, we were not able to record the subject information of each individual.
Judging from the information we recorded, the number of players participating each year has gradually increased. Among them, members from Biology & Health Science accounted for the majority, followed by Multidisciplinary and Computer & Engineering. Furthermore, compared to 2007, the academic background of the contestants in 2016 was more diverse. Other than this, in addition to members of other natural sciences from mathematics, physics, chemistry, environment, etc., every year there are also members from the social sciences and humanities. We believe that iGEM is playing an increasingly important role in promoting multidisciplinary communication and promoting engineering in the field of synthetic biology.

Talking to high school students
One of our team members, Guo Fuyu, went to Hutian Middle School in Huaihua, Hunan Province. He introduced systems and synthetic biology to the students and helped them with biology in high school as well. In our view, it is of fundamental significance to provide as much middle school students in second-tier cities in China as possible with access to frontier science, since quality education is definitely as important as examination-oriented education.

According to a survey at Peking University,"
ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," If the patient is also resistant to glucocorticoid, we add imuran(AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine(6-MP). Note that patients with severe lesions should use intravenous corticosteroid, and for nonresponder , we consider to use intravenous cyclosporine or to operate, which remove the whole colon and rectal mucous membrane. Some foreign countries use infliximab or adalimumab to induce and maintain remission. But this treatment is not widely used in our country.
Crohn's disease(CD) may involve the whole digestive tract, any place from oral cavity to crissum, typically at the terminal of small intestine, which is ileum and ileocecus. It is an inflammation covered the whole layer. The general pathology of CD is fissuring ulcers and changes in mucus pattern, which will make intestinal tract become narrow and induce the formation of internal/external fistula, characterized by bellyache, fever, abdominal mass and hematochezia/ melaena. We mainly use glucocorticoid to induce remission, supplemented with 5-ASA preparation. To maintain the remission, we mainly use AZA or 6-MP. If it is difficult for glucocorticoid to induce remission, we can try the methotrexate(MTX), cyclosporine(CsA) and infliximab. The latter applies more but there exists the primary/secondary drug resistance problems.
Ulcerative colitis is less difficult to treat relatively. Patients with poor therapeutic effect can choose to have a operation, which is considered to be a radical cure of disease. ( Of course, not every patient in our country will accept the fistulization at the end of ileum. However, PORCH operation is not spread widely currently. ) Patients who have had ulcerative colitis over 10 years has an increased risk of colon cancer. It is more difficult to treat Crohn's disease, because recurrence tendency always exists throughout one's life. Operation can only deal with the problem that intestinal tract become narrow, get block or bleeding. What’s more, it often brings up anastomotic recurrence, thus we mainly consider medicine as a treatment. However, many CD patients require to undergo surgery once or twice all their life, facing the risk of short bowel syndrome.
Actually I think that particular case is not the key point, and learning some common sense about the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.

Occasionally dispersal can occur in other ways; for example, in B. subtilis, fluctuations in certain amino acid levels over the course of the cell cycle can result in dispersal, and it’s been suggested that similar mechanisms could exist in other bacteria (Kostakioti et al. 2013).
In 2014, Heisig et al. found that an antifreeze glycoprotein from ticks, IAFGP, and a peptide derived from that protein, could inhibit the formation of S. aureus biofilms in a variety of in vitro and in vivo scenarios. Figure 1C from the study, below, shows the results of an in vitro biofilm inhibition assay, performed by staining with Safranin.
The current research suggests that the anti-virulent properties of IAFGP are based on structural elements of the protein that allow it to bind to microbes and disrupt biofilm formation (Heisig et al. 2014), however, very little is known about this, and only one study has been completed. More research is needed to find out whether other antifreeze proteins exhibit the same effect.
Antifreeze Proteins
Water crystallizes as it freezes, forming sharp structures capable of lysing cells. Organisms which regularly encounter subzero conditions have evolved a number of methods to prevent cell lysis from ice crystallization, including the production of antifreeze proteins. Antifreeze proteins, or AFPs, are a class of polypeptides with the unique property of binding and shaping ice crystals, preventing their growth into relatively large cell-lysing structures and allowing organism survival in colder environments (Davies and Sykes, 1997).
Over the past decade, scientists have discovered and isolated a variety of AFPs from different organisms. Five different classifications of antifreeze proteins have been discovered in fish: Type I, Type II, Type III, Type IV, and antifreeze glycoproteins, or AFGPs. Type I AFPs are long, single alpha-helices that exist as 3-5 kDa monomers. Within Type I, there are two subgroups that bind to different planes of ice; the repetitive Type I AFPs have clearly defined repeats of alanine and aspartate or threonine while the nonrepetitive Type I AFPs are amphipathic with lysine and arginine side chains (Davies and Sykes, 1997). Type II AFPs are 12-"

In addition, transformants from the co-transformation of pIW357 and pIW501 were screened for URA3 integration through gap-check colony PCR (Figure 15). The observed shift in band size between non-pIW501 transformants and pIW357/pIW501 co-transformants corresponds to the 1700 bp size of the URA3 promoter+CDS+terminator sequence that is present on pIW501.

DESCRIPTION
Figure 15: Gap-check colony PCR of URA3 integration in the PEX10 locus of the Y. lipolytica PO1fΔKu70 strain. The used gap-check primers anneal slightly upstream and downstream of the 1 kb PEX10 upstream and downstream flanking regions, respectively. This allows for a direct comparison of the amplicon size between a control transformant and a transformant which should contain the insert in the same PCR reaction. Although only 3 screened co-transformation transformants are depicted in this Figure, an efficiency of 100% was achieved (12/12). Forward primer: TGAGCGAAACGTCATCTACG. Reverse primer: AGCAGTGAAAAGTCGGGCTA.

DESCRIPTION
The pIW501 is linearized prior to transformation in order to increase HR efficiency and in order to reduce the amount of false positive transformants (a gene cannot be expressed from a linear DNA fragment). However, growth was also observed when solely the linearized pIW501 is transformed into Y. lipolytica PO1fΔKu70, indicating that CRISPR-Cas9 DSB induction is not necessarily required for the integration of an auxotrophic marker gene. We did not have time to compare the efficiencies of co-transformation of pIW357 and pIW501 as compared to solely pIW501 transformation. However, it has been shown previously that co-transformation with a CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid increases the HR efficiency 12 . We thus hypothesize that the integration of the URA3 gene was facilitated by pIW357. We also did not have time to test the integration of a non-marker gene (which would still allow for an easily selectable phenotype such as GFP or lacZ). This"

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," People feel that they can contribute to a more sustainable future and are positive about generating their own electricity, thereby being self-sufficient. Initially, the investment is high, but eventually pays for itself. The heightened demand for solar panels allows for upscaling, which again results in lower prices.
Economics + Energy markets
In the Dutch economy, the use of more solar panels provides for a larger share of the national energy demand and the Netherlands is less dependent on other countries when it comes to oil and gas for some applications. However, the transition from fossil fuels to electricity for cars, trucks and planes is initiated rather late, from 2040 on, when solar panels are more common, more research into efficient batteries has been carried out and, more importantly, petroleum prices are rising. While the shift towards bio-based materials is not yet complete, dependency on oil-providing countries is a fact, which is the case up to 2050. Consumers pay more for their gas and electricity, and public transport prices go up. As a lot of materials are based on petroleum, many products become more expensive. Plastics, drugs and other organic components are all synthesised from crude oil, so new ways need to be found to obtain these valuable products from a bio-based resource.
Politics + Globalization
Governments try to reduce the amount of fossil fuels used, and strive to reach a fully bio-based economy that is sustainable and green. This is why political parties emphasise the importance of research. Worldwide research is more important than ever before, as people try to get away from the power of oil countries. The concentration of fossil fuels in certain countries leads to wealth in those areas, but conflicts might arise if prices increase too drastically. The Dutch government is interested in how other countries manage their energy and new developments on electricity generation are followed closely. Governments try to work together to find a solution for the energy problem, and new agreements are made on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. All countries strive to be self-sustainable and green, as long as it does not interfere with their economy. However, in most of the cases, the shift towards a bio-based economy requires a lot of investments, which is why it has been postponed so long already. By the year 2040, it is seen that indeed the later the shift is made, the more expensive it becomes, as the energy resources required to build new installations are getting more and more costly. Also travelling by car and plane is getting more and more expensive as long as it is based on petroleum, and shipping costs increase. Governments realise that it is about time to make the transition to renewables."

The leading idea behind our Ecoli.PROM team was to put in touch students with different curricula, ways to approach scientific problems and favour ideas exchange. These students, pushed by their common desire for new experiences, decided to participate in this exciting competition to discover a new research field and to expand their interest for synthetic biology. Responding to the call of Professor Silvio Cavalcanti, they constituted the Bologna iGEM team, finally composed of students from Biotechnology, Electronics Engineering and Biomedical Engineering faculties.

ECM Lab
The Igem2008 Bologna team worked in the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Engineering for the Study of Bionanosystems (ECM lab). The lab research is focused on the application of bionanotechnology. IGEM students found here the main tools to carry out the project. Libraries, study rooms and computer rooms were also available to gather brainstorming, Internet searches and any activity related to the project.

Our University
The origins of the University of Bologna are ancient: its foundation dates back to the year 1088, as it was conventionally established in the last century by a group of historians led by the Italian Nobel Laureate, Giosuè Carducci. Important scholars, writers, philosophers and poets such as Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarch, Guido Guinizelli, Cino da Pistoia, Cecco d'Ascoli, Re Enzo, Salimbene da Parma and Coluccio Salutati spent periods of study in Bologna during their life. At the moment the university counts 23 faculty, houses about 100000 students and has didactical head-quarters in Reggio Emilia and Imola and four scientific poles in Romagna, respectively in Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena and Rimini. In addition afford a school of excellence, the Collegio Superiore and a detached head-quarter in Buenos Aires.
In Cesena , the birth of a university centre was probably connected to the foundation of the Collegio dei Giuristi (College of Jurists), which was a concession of Pope Julius II in 1504, but"

jacarandasmile@163.com
Cry10Aa is cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis BRC-LLP29. It shows specific toxicity to Culex and Aedes by bioassay. The Cry protein is consisted of three functional domains. Domain I is a seven α-helices bundle. It can insert itself into a membrane by using its hydrophobic helices α4 and α5 to insert into the phospholipid bilayer. The pore formation occurs on its α3 helix. Domain II and domain III are two β-sheets which are involved in the receptor interactions. Domain II contains extremely variable loops, which are the binding site of the receptor. Domain III has the function of stabilizing the toxin. Cyt proteins have a single α-β domain which do not bind to receptors but can directly insert into the cell membrane and then form a pore causing cell death. Although Cry and Cyt proteins are two big families of δ-endotoxins, they are far related.Cyt1 and Cyt2 are two types of Cyt proteins found in Bti.. Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple steps. At the beginning in mosquitoes' gut, the crystalline inclusions are cleaved at the disulfide bond to release the Cry pre-toxin. Then the soluble proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins, or known as receptors on the membrane. The binding process takes two step. Firstly, the monomeric Cry toxin binds to cadherin, resulting in the formation of pre-pore oligomer.

Meeting other teams
iGEM UGent
It is always a pleasure to collaborate with our compatriots. Indeed, both of our teams were very pleased with this collaboration. We tried to review each other work as much as possible and one week before the Jamboree, we also met in order to discuss each other presentations and posters.
Finally after this incredible adventure, we plan to organise a conference on synthetic biology, here in Belgium. This would be the perfect opportunity to fill in Belgian students about what is iGEM and how this contest brings so much hopes to synthetic biology.
Aalto-Helsinki
One member of our team (Pierre-Antoine) spent his second semester (January-May 2016) in Helsinki for an exchange. He made the most of it by contacting the Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team to organize a meeting with them. It was rewarding for both teams as they could discuss about ideas and organization in general.
Meeting other scientists
One conference from the UCL research institute ‘ISV’ which stands for Institut des Sciences de la Vie (Life Science Institute)  was dedicated to our iGEM project under the theme ‘Our First Scientific Adventure’. It was presented by Antoine Godeaux and Joaquin Guzman on the 7th of October 2016 .
Meeting other students
Short presentations about iGEM and our project were organized before or during the break of several courses at the University. The purpose was to inform and draw the attention of students to iGEM and synthetic biology.
Meeting our sponsors
One of our Sponsor provided us with Corn Syrup (See Homemade product ) used for our test of selection for our leaky porins. We could also work with them in order to analyze the different products through chromatographic analysis.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

WashU_StLouis,2016,Team:WashU StLouis#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," idea of the environmental consequences of nitrate fertilizer runoff in the Midwest. We explained that the Nitrogen Project aimed to eliminate fertilizer use altogether. Contrary to how we thought she’d respond, Carlson stated that fertilizer was not the battle to fight. Nitrates leak from the soil regardless of fertilizer use and, instead, we should work to plant cover crops to soak up the excess.
This had a very strong impact on our direction for the project. If nitrogen-fixing plants won’t have the world-changing impacts we believe, were there other problems we could tackle with research that fit within the bounds of the nitrogen project? What other applications weren’t we considering?
After our conversation with Carlson, we took a closer look at the cellular conditions necessary for nitrogenase function. While we were still motivated to work on the Nitrogen Project, our scope was now adjusted. Perhaps we could make a cell that would improve nitrogenase’s function, but avoid the laborious task of actually inserting nitrogenase’s genes. We thought that a cell with the perfect conditions for nitrogenase could also be used with other recombinant proteins – we’d just have to select the right conditions to improve.
While our new project still fit into the scope of the Nitrogen Project and we continued to understand the impact of nitrate runoff in the agricultural regions around St. Louis, we also began to consider other applications of our research. We contacted companies that use synthetic biology for more industrial purposes, and asked them to comment on how our “supercharged” cells could be practically utilized.
Nitrate Runoff and the Midwest
To begin our education on nitrate runoff, we began with faculty within WashU in St. Louis. At first, we requested time with Ray Ehrhardt, a professional engineer with a position in the department of Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering. Ray’s experience lay in devising water filtration and management systems. Nitrate runoff, he said, is excruciatingly difficult to filter out on a large scale. Nitrate runoff has well documented side effects including algal blooms and “blue baby syndrome” in children, but can only be removed via energy intensive processes like distillation or reverse osmosis filtration. Water contamination from agriculture, he said, is best dealt with upstream of filtration. Otherwise, the aqueous pollution becomes very costly to remove. Mr. Erhardt had several contacts in the St. Louis area, and suggested we reach out to other regional authorities.
We contacted the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board, the governing body encouraging sustainable farming practices in our area. They invited us to one of their monthly board meetings"
Marburg,2015,Team:Marburg#iGeneration_-_-_TEXT.html," chance to visit our laboratory and learn some basics about synthetic biology. We hence invited high school students from Blista, a school for visually impaired students in Marburg. We gave them a lecture about the different features of bacteria and how we can make use of them in the age of Synthetic Biology. They were really interested in what they could do in a biological laboratory. So, we showed them a typical day of our work including the preparation of over-night cultures, streaking out bacteria on LB-agar plates and smelling of different bacteria and yeast strains, and microscopy of fluorescent cells to give them the best possible experience. The students also brought a so-called optophone with them, which distinguishes between brighter and darker light inputs and converts them into different tone pitches. With this optophone, the students examined populations on plates and could hear the difference between a colony and the agar plate. At the end, we discussed our project ideas and further application possibilities of synthetic biology.
Figure 3: Sharing a day in the laboratory with students from the Blista was a whole new experience for us, too.
Seniors
Many other teams have done similar Human Practices projects before but we wanted to cover all generations. Seniors are also a very important group of our society because of the demographic change which is effecting nearly every country in the world.  The reasons causing population aging don’t have only disadvantages, e.g. older people are able to live independently to a much greater extent than a few decades ago. Many seniors are also still able to make a living through their own labor. That’s why they have to be remembered as a very important group in terms of elections, essentially determining the policy and political decisions of many countries. To make an optimal decision, a fundamental knowledge is of great importance. For these reasons, we visited seniors who keep an active lifestyle to give them an introduction to Biology and tell them about modern biotechnology and applications of GMOs as many of them haven’t even heard of DNA in their school time.
Figure 4: For easier explanations of the general structure of DNA, we used a self-built model.
Public Engagement
At the end of August, the prime minister of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, visited the center of synthetic microbiology (SYNMIKRO) and the Max-Planck Institute where our iGEM laboratory is located. We used this opportunity to present our project to him and to raise the popularity of iGEM in the government and the non-scientific population. He liked our project ideas and was impressed by the combination of science and public engagement in the iGEM competition."

Irina and Nadine selected the 2 plasmid backbones we will use: J23019 and J61002 (check the parts registry). They have 2 different origin of replication sites and should both have 15-20 copy numbers. Interesting also, they both contain RFP and pTet. We already have them in the freezers, now let's focus on primers design!
Wednesday, 8 June 2011
Lilia and Douglas miniprep'ed the cultures containing the lysis cassette, and sent the plasmids for sequencing.
Three colonies were miniprep'ed: two containing the T4 variant, one containing the lambda variant. This yielded solutions with plasmid concentrations of 221.9 ng/µl for T4 colony 1, 225.5 ng/µl for T4 colony 2, and 57.0 ng/µl for lambda colony.  Only T4 colony 1 was sent for sequencing, using the primer solutions prepared on 31 May 2011 . Results should be in on Friday.

Sequencing results from Microsynth for the lysis cassette (Biobrick K112808) have arrived. The sequence is entirely covered by the seven reactions, and all but a few bases match. As far as I can tell, this biobrick is valid! (Doug)

Minnesota,2015,Team:Minnesota#Software#PyMOL360_-_-_TEXT.html," been shown to excrete proteins at a rate of approximately five times that of S. cerevisiae with higher qualitative value as well. Recombinant human insulin has been produced in P. pastoris, but the harvesting and processing procedures are long, complex, and would be greatly simplified through the application of the BioBrick system. P. pastoris is already utilized by the Chinese for various industrial tasks, lending more promise to it as our choice, as industrial application would require very little change to our system.
• What are some risks associated with this design?
      Our system poses a hopeful future for diabetes sufferers, but, as with any medical breakthrough there are some risks to be aware of.  Although the risk of allergy or rejection will be reduced, there may still be adverse side effects that we cannot foresee despite careful testing in the laboratory, until the synthetically secreted protein is actually trial tested in humans.  Although great caution can be taken to solidify the safety of our synthetic system, unpredictable mutations may still occur that, again, cannot be foreseen until human trials are conducted.  The proposal of human trials alone poses a dilemma for ethical reasons.
PCSK1
• What is PCSK1?
      PCSK1 encodes for preprotein convertase type I, which is regarded as the most important enzyme in the first step of insulin processing in humans. Since our model organism P. pastoris lacks this enzyme it is hypothesized that its addition will increase efficiency of Insulin over the lineage.
Methods
   Insulin and PCSK1 Open Reading Frame Design Sequences for insulin and its chaperone PCSK1 were obtained through NCBI. Both insulin and PCSK1 were codon optimized for expression in P. pastoris using the online Codon Optimization tool from IDT. The BioBrick consensus sequence was added to both insulin and PCSK1 in preparation for cloning into the shipping vector. Restriction sites that were incompatible with the BioBrick standard, as well as our Pichia pastoris expression system pMNBB were eliminated by altering single nucleotides while maintaining the proper amino acid sequence. Both genes were synthesized by IDT. Insulin was obtained as one 333 bp fragment, while the longer PCSK1 was split into three, roughly 750 bp fragments.
   Fragments for insulin and PCSK1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Insulin was cloned into the shipping vector. The three PCSK1 fragments were joined into the the full 2300 bp product using overlap extension PCR. The full PCSK1 product was cloned into"

Lecture in the school-- To spread iGEM and get more students on board with us!
December 8, 2016.
Our team arranged a recruitment talk to the students, which appealed to a mountain of students fond of                         Synthetic biology from the School of Astronautics, the school of Automation, and the School of Mechatronics                         and Engineering and so on.
Laboratory---To offer more students access to the biology laboratory!
December 11, 2016.
We organized nearly 40 students to visit our lab and introduced all sorts of instruments to them at length.                         The students are differentiated by various majors--Automation Engineering, Electronic Information                         Science and Technology, Chemistry and so on. There is no escaping the fact that students from other                         majors, constitute a large proportion of our team rather than those majoring in Biology.
Council discussion
December 20, 2016.
We had a discussion on our project's basis and innovation with leaders and teachers from our Life Science                         Academy. Meanwhile, we asked them for the project’s novelty and environmental friendliness. Leaders                         and teachers put forward the significance of innovation, inspiring us to create new things during                         the project process and create new ideas. In addition, we got suggestions on the safety and environmental                         protection during our experiments.

Random things
She really doesn't understand why the Gibson Assembly for ACEB contruct did not work out. It should at least have the same number of colonies as the negative control, how can it have no colony at all!!! The Gibson Assembly mix certainly  affected the DNA fragments in some way... Is it possible that a gene is toxic to its native strain? Also, for BBa_J176171!! She confirmed that the linear plasmid is stable at 50°C but why can't it assemble with complementary sequences engineered in GFP? Can we really trust the sequence of this part? If this is heat sensitive, how can we confirm its sequence?

This is necessary because pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag would not be able to be transformed into the same cells with pSB1C3-PhaCAB, since it is not possible to double transform a cell with two of the same plasmid backbones. Digest confirmation with NotI-Hf showed that the ligation was successful and pSB1A3-Phasin-HlyA Tag that can be transformed into BL21(DE3) alongside pSB1C3-PhaCAB had been obtained.
Week 21 (September 18 - September 22, 2017)
We had used up most of the registry pSB1C3-PhaCAB from Imperial College and double transformations with what was left last week had failed. We decided to isolate a fresh sample of pSB1C3-PhaCAB from the cells that Jacob had been working with earlier in the summer. This new pSB1C3-PhaCAB and pET29B-SP1 was transformed into chemically competent BL21(DE3). Also, the pSB1C3-PhaCAB and pSB1A3-Phasin-HlyA Tag were transformed into chemically competent BL21(DE3). However, these transformations all failed and we decided to move forward with a new method of double transforming, in which chemically competent BL21(DE3) were transformed with pSB1C3-PhaCAB alone. Then, these cells were made competent and next week we will attempt to transform either pSB1A3-Phasin-HlyA Tag or pET29B-SP1 into the chemically competent BL21(DE3)(+pSB1C3-PhaCAB).
Week 22 (September 25 - September 29, 2017)
Two attempts of transforming chemically competent BL21(DE3)(+pSB1C3-PhaCAB) with either pSB1A3-phasin or pET29B-SP1 were made this week, however, both attempts failed and the cells were not successfully transformed.

Austin_UTexas,2016,Team:Austin UTexas#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," protein on the operon is produced and activates segments downstream of the operon on the CadBA receptors. The CadC protein is pH sensitive to an external pH 5.5 and below, as well as lysine dependent. A point mutation on codon 265, in which argenine is converted to cystine, causes the CadC protein to become lysine independent (Kuper and Jung, 2005).
Despite several attempts, we have been unable to grow the modified CadC operon on pSB1C3 in E. coli suggesting some form of cell toxicity.  Specifically, all plasmids isolated have contained additional point mutations that appear to inactivate the expression of CadC.  Due to this apparent toxicity, no data regarding the lysine-independent CadC could be collected. Alternative acidic range pH sensor candidates have been identified and are discussed below.
P-atp2
The P-atp2 promoter, native to the bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum is reportedly induced at pH 7, to pH 9 ( BIT-China-2015 and BBa_K1675021 ). Utilizing the blue chromoprotein ( BBa_K592009 ), a test was designed in which a plasmid containing the P-atp2 promoter with the blue chromoprotein was grown alongside an E. coli line that contained a plasmid with just the blue chromoprotein. We expected to see constant blue chromoprotein production in the control series (those that lacked P-atp2) and a visual increase in blue chromoprotein as the pH was raised from 6 to 9 in the cells that contained the P-atp2 construct. The construct utilized as a control can be found on the iGEM registry BBa_K2097001 as as in figure 4.
However, as seen in figure 5, no clear change in color expression appears in the experimental trials, suggesting a lack of sensitivity of the P-atp2 promoter.

REACHING OUT TO GENERAL PUBLIC
Reaching out to general public, we were faced with two greater problems: public ignorance  concerning synthetic biology and the negative attitude about GMOs.  Explaining our project to friends and family, we realized that people are mostly completely unaware  of what synthetic biology even is, let alone anything more specific, which is understandable.  Humanities and social sciences relate closely and noticeably to our everyday life, and are therefore  more integrated into the general education of citizens of Slovenia. Understanding science, however,  especially something as peculiar to the general public as synthetic biology is, often requires very  specific knowledge that is thought at universities but is less easily accessible otherwise. For instance,  the news on national television covers topics such as politics, international relations and culture  every evening, but science is not often mentioned. Besides just the problem of being unaware, this  minimal representation of science also means it is often not founded well, which affects the future of  our nation more than we might realize.  Moreover, people who are more aware of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, often have a  rather unfavorable attitude towards it, mostly focusing on the potentially negative sides of it, but are  usually unaware of the positive sides, such as production of insulin, artemisinin and other drugs that  were made much more affordable and safe precisely by the use of genetic engineering.  For these two reasons we have decided one of our main priorities would be firstly introducing  synthetic biology to society and secondly addressing the public concerns regarding it.
TRADITIONAL MEDIA
We realized that the way to reach the most people would be by traditional media: newspapers,  television, radio and internet platforms. Therefore, we have contacted and invited reporters and"

September - October
These months we tried to synthesize our TALEs after clone the parts, but still there are 2 parts that not amplified yet (6A and 12E). We don’t have BsmBI restriction enzyme to Golden Gate Assembly but we found that EcoRI has the same restriction site as BsmBI. We substituted the BsmBI with EcoRI and  the parts successfully inserted into pSB1C3 (3200 bp).

Host of iGEM Singapore 2018 Meet Up
Picture: Teams from NUS Singapore-Sci, NUS Singapore-A and NTU-Singapore gathering for a photo session over a pizza break in the SPS lounge (June 2018).
While both the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have sent multiple teams to participate in iGEM over the years, most of the interactions have been informal and ad hoc. For the first time in 2018, Singapore has three iGEM teams participating in this year's competition. The three teams that will be representing Singapore this year are: NTU-Singapore, NUS Singapore-A (NUSGEM) and the last being ourselves.
As part of the networking and to foster collaboration, the NUS Singapore-Science iGEM team initiated and hosted an iGEM Singapore 2018 meet-up on June 2018. We invited the teams NUSGEM and NTU-Singapore to come over and mingle with our team over light refreshment. After some friendly chat over pizza kindly provided by NUSGEM, we got down to a serious discussion during which we discussed about our projects and possible areas of collaboration in human practices, modelling as well as wet lab. While the vastly different projects we have committed ourselves to made modelling and wet lab collaborations difficult, some possible collaborations were suggested in the human practices side.
All in all, this iGEM Singapore meet-up allowed all of us to get a sense of what the other teams' projects were about, and have a fruitful discussion on areas where we could help each"

Waste Management
Waste produced by a fermentation process are composed of dead cells and co-fermentation products such as CO2 (gas) and organic compounds. There are many ways to eliminate these products: incineration, if dangerous products such as adrenaline23 remain; bioconversion of organic waste24; and irradiation or pasteurization to kill remaining living cells25.
Economic Impacts
The most important benefits of synthetic biology are related to health, energy and the environment. Nevertheless, investments in synthetic biology can also bring economic benefits. For example, direct activities related to research and development and the potential commercialization of successful technologies are likely to create new jobs and improve the economy, thereby improving the overall quality of life of the population. In addition, these potential economic benefits can be particularly useful for communities in developing countries, where health, access to resources and economic stability are closely linked.
Furthermore, it is essential to assess the competitiveness of synthetic biology in relation to other existing industries (e.g. chemically synthesized products). In our case, adrenaline synthesis is currently made chemically. If the biosynthesis of adrenaline is proven to be less expensive, more environmentally friendly and more easily accessible in terms of equipment, it could, in this case, disrupt the current sector. In addition, it could disrupt monopolies by creating smaller businesses. It could also mean that adrenaline, an essential medicine, would be more available in developing countries. However, if our technology was taken by a large enterprise, it would bring us back to the same problems associated with a monopoly.
Impacts on Society
Overconsumption is an important issue to consider when talking about drugs. Medicines should never be used for recreational purposes, but still, there will always be someone, somewhere who wants it for that reason. As mentioned previously, adrenaline is a deadly compound and it should not be used by someone who does not need it. However one might see the opportunity to use this drug in the context of the black market. Indeed, adrenaline can be used by drug users to treat overdoses of other drugs such as heroin.
Ethically speaking, can creating the abundance of a product lead to its abuse? In our case, we would not tend to think so mostly since the purchase of adrenaline requires a prescription. However, one must wonder if it could be used by people who do not need it for medical purposes, like adepts of extreme sports who consider themselves “adrenaline addicts”.
On another note, the metabolic pathway of adrenaline includes the intermediate dopamine"

Genspace Collaboration
A huge part of iGEM is working with other teams to further the research of both parties.  This is exactly what we did when we collaborated with the 2015 genspace igem team.  One of the major obstacles in research today is the high price of new lab equipment.  Often times, an expensive device is needed to carry out a one time procedure.  Buying the device makes no sense, but you still need to use it.  We circumvented this by sharing equipment between our two teams.  The Genspace iGEM team came to Cooper Union in early August.  They had several samples of DNA whose concentrations they needed to determine.  To help them achieve this, we showed them how to use our Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer.  This device measures the absorbance of a small volume of liquid and then calculates the concentration of nucleic acid present in the sample.  After a brief tutorial, they were quickly able to measure the concentrations of all of their samples.  To repay this favor, the Genspace igem team helped us by lending us their vacuum oven.  This device was necessary in the protocol for the silanization of glass slides.  In order for our DNA synthesizer to work, the DNA must bond to a glass slide so that it is not lost in the wash steps.  This was done previously by forming a disulfide bond between the DNA oligonucleotide and the glass.  To test this ourselves, we ordered sulfonated oligonucleotides and made silanized glass slides.  Genspace’s vacuum oven was useful because the glass slides need to be kept in an anhydrous environment for part of the procedure.  With the vacuum oven, we completed this protocol and were able to yield results on the effectiveness of bonding DNA to glass slides.

Possible Project Ideas
Diary: Week 1
During week 1 the team decided on a rough project outline which involves producing a protein microcompartment found in Salmonella in E.coli. Bacterial microcompartments (BMC’s) are protein organelles found within bacteria. The physiological function of these compartments is to promote specific metabolic processes by colocalising enzymes with subtrates and also cofactors. After expressing the microcompartment in E.coli we will attempt to target different proteins to the compartment which may have a bioremediation function for example. Ideas on what could be targeted to the compartment as well as a name for the project are still under discussion.
The team was given a health and safety briefing and before starting in the labs attended a several tutorials on basic microbiology and molecular biology. The rest of the week was spent learning different laboratory techniques such as miniprep, transformations, isolating chromosomal DNA, PCR and restriction digests which will be critical for our project. Although this was largely successful some of the team did not get the desired result from their PCR’s (Jane and Brian) better luck next time. Towards the end of the week we had a group meeting and discussion to establish a cloning strategy and also to design the primers needed for our gene of interest. Our computer team spent a large amount of the week designing our website which is now up and running.
Fail of the Week = Jane’s PCR
Diary: Week 2
Week 2 saw the team begin the iGEM project. It began by performing mini-preps to extract the plasmid pUNI-PROM from our E.coli strain. A restriction digest was then performed as well as adding an Antarctic phosphatase to prevent our plasmids rejoining. Our plasmids are now ready to be incorporated with our genes of interest. While waiting for the primers to arrive our team divided into groups to work on a project outline and description as well as the health and safety issues of the project.
Primers finally arrived. PCR’s were performed and our genes of interest were successfully incorporated into our vector through ligation and stratoclean steps. Our clones were left to grow in LB Amp medium so that we can perform Quick change on"

There had been lots of challenges during the project, but for me, getting to tackle those challenges has been the best part of iGEM by far. This experience has made me certain that in the future, I definitely want to keep pushing myself and not settle for the easiest route if there’s another option that allows me to keep learning new, interesting things!

Molecular Biosciences at the University of Helsinki
I have been doing research and working in the lab, producing the degradation enzyme - it has been a summer of making growth media and gels and much more. Other than that, I worked on our presentations and the project video.
I heard about iGEM at a time when I was looking for innovative research projects. Moreover, the opportunity to work in a trendy field like synthetic biology and that too in a student-led team seemed too good to miss so I went ahead and applied! Easily the best decision I have taken this year.
During the long hours spent in the lab I have learnt much about time management and planning. I am more confident in my practical skills now and I acquired a newfound enthusiasm for facing challenges. The meetups during the summer have shown me first-hand the importance of networking and collaborations.
Jami Valorinta
Mathematics at the University of Helsinki
In the team I’ve mostly been doing everything related to computers. In the beginning of the summer, I updated our website at aaltohelsinki.com. Then a lot of time went into the server-side programming of the CollabSeeker. After that, I was responsible for coding WikiFire+ for the wiki team, while also helping out with the front-end development. As a math major, I was also pretty deeply involved with the modelling and computer simulations. And I was even let into the lab a few times! It was nice to try my hand at plating and other common lab procedures.
Spring 2016. I saw a poster in the hallway of Kumpula, the natural sciences campus of the University of Helsinki. It was advertising a synthetic biology competition I had never heard about. At the time I didn’t have a very clear idea what synthetic biology even was, but the poster was calling for mathematicians with programming experience, and I was looking for something challenging to do during the summer, so I decided to apply to this “iGEM”.
During the summer, I’ve solidified my programming skills, learned the process of mathematical modelling from the ground up, tried my hand at lab work, and gotten a little taste of real research work. That’s not"
NWPU,2016,Team:NWPU#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Protein Scaffold
   In the case of Blue Leaf, a system in which multiple enzymes catalyze the reaction, the efficiency of the coordinated reaction between the enzymes determines the efficiency of the overall catalytic reaction.
   We know that complex enzyme reaction often has a problem that the products of the last enzyme cannot be timely and competely transported to the next enzyme, making the overall reaction efficiency low due to the location of different enzymes in the space far apart.
   In order to improve the efficiency of the multi-enzyme reaction system, Self-assembly Protein Scaffold was used. The Self-assembly Protein Scaffold has several adjacent binding sites. Microscopically, it could automatically assemble the fusion protein with the corresponding Dockerin, making different enzymes next to each other. From the macroscopic point of view, it can improve the local enzyme concentration and substrate concentration, thereby enhancing the multi-enzyme reaction system. [4]
   We improved the scaffold protein on the basis of the IGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team[5] and used it in our designed pathway-from formaldehyde to D-xylulose. The scaffold protein consists of the following components:
Figue 3, Synthetic protein scaffolds improve the efficiency of multi - enzyme reaction.
   The first part, Cohesins and Dockerins. Cohesins and Dockerins were the major components of protein scaffolds, each with a reactive group that recognizes each other and mosaics. Cohesins were expressed on the scaffold, while Dockerins co-expressed with the target enzyme to form a fusion protein. In this way, the target protein could be anchored firmly to the scaffold.
   The second part, Linker. There is a linker between adjacent cohesin, and it is the linker’s length that determines the adjacent enzyme’s distance and influences the passing on of intermediates between co-located enzymes. Therefore, the linker’s length is a main influence of multi-enzyme system’s reaction efficiency.
   The third part, CBM protein. CBM could specifically bind to the cellulose, so that the enzyme-scaffold complex could be sedimented by centrifugal force. With this function we could easily purified pure enzyme-scaffold complex.
   Based on a registered cohesin(BBa_K1830004) submitted byiGEM15_Concordia’s, we isolated the cohesin module of this part from the linker, which makes following team could adjust linker’s length according to their requirement when they use this cohesin. Besides, we applied this part in our scaffold protein(BBa_K2155012)"

2. sfGFP collection
We submitted this part of super folder GFP (sfGFP) with a strong promoter J23116. Under this expression system, a very bright blue-green fluorescence will be observed after 6 hours of incubation. Its excited wavelength is close to the UV light. We commonly manipulate it by using the UV in super clean bench. The fluorescence is strong enough to be observed by naked eyes. For this reason, sfGFP is always used as reporter gene under the plasmid construction.
This plasmid can be used as a vector. After ligation, it is easy to pick up the single colony without blue-green fluorescence.
On the other part we submitted mutated sfGFP (msfGFP). It has one base-pair difference with the original sfGFP on its 165th site. We changed the base pair from AT to GC by using whole plasmid mutagenesis to remove KpnI restriction site. We kindly hope the little effort can bring convenience to the following iGEMers.
In addition, we also constructed the sfGFP expression system with a terminator following the coding sequence. While the two groups (with and without terminator) showed no significant difference in our experience. We hope these parts can be provided as comparable experimental groups to quantify the efficiency of bacterial terminators.

the problem
Worldwide, there is a staggering amount of plastic produced and used both industrially and commercially. In 2015, 56 million tonnes of plastic was produced worldwide; although some of this is recycled or the energy from the plastic is utilized, much of it enters landfills. While plastic offers desirable properties for use, such as durability and plasticity, it is these properties that also make it a problematic material; it is almost undegradable. This results in landfills clogged with plastic materials, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which contain high levels of aromatics that decrease their degradability.
Specifically in NZ, despite our green image, we are not exempt from this plastic plague. Plastic waste contributes to 8% of NZ waste. Plastic is lightweight and has space-filling properties, which allow it to fill 20% of NZ’s landfill space (252,000 tonnes per year), with difficult to degrade plastics such as PET contributing to up to 15% of this. To combat this, and other waste related problems (such as the expected doubling of waste entering NZ’s landfills within ten years), the NZ councils have enacted a zero-waste policy; to progressively achieve zero-waste status by 2040.
Our team’s aim was to aid this policy (as well as the global plastic plague) by producing a strain of E. coli that produces enzymes which degrade PET.
our solution
The bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis uses two enzymes to break PET down into Terephthatlic Acid (TPA) and Ethylene Glycol (EG): PETase and MHETase respectively (Yoshida et al., 2016). It is here that we took inspiration for our project; to create biobricks for PETase and MHETase that, when inserted into an E. coli vector, could produce viable, purifiable proteins, that are secreted from the cell, or can be obtained through lysing the E. coli.. Given time, effort, and perhaps a little luck, we could purify and find the 3D structure of these PET degrading enzymes, which would allow us to characterise them, and potentially refine and improve the mechanism of PET degradation for commercial use.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

Background of Application
According to the 2017 report of the International Diabetes Federation, there are 425 million                         people with diabetes in the world; in China, the number of people with diabetes is about 110                         million, and the number of people with hypertension is about 230 million. The patient population                         is extremely large. This type of population is the main patient group of hidden chronic kidney                         disease. If chronic kidney disease cannot be detected and treated early, it may eventually lead                         to uremia, with a mortality rate of up to 90%, and timely early diagnosis may bring about 70%                         reversal rate. Therefore, early screening for chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes                         and hypertension is of great significance.
The incidence of chronic kidney disease can be divided into five stages. The symptoms of patients in stage I and stage II are not obvious. By the third stage, the patient showed more obvious symptoms, and at this time, the kidneys had suffered more serious damage. Due to the concealment of chronic kidney disease in the first and second stages, many patients cannot go to the hospital for medical examination in time. When the patients with chronic kidney disease have reached the third stage of chronic kidney disease, the treatment effect will be far less than the first and second stages. In addition, going to the hospital for physical examination is also inconvenient, which also makes some patients unable to consciously go to the hospital for physical examination. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a portable tool for early detection of chronic kidney disease, to help potential patients with chronic kidney disease such as diabetes and hypertension to detect their physical condition at home in real time, and to provide early warning for the development of the first and second stages of chronic kidney disease.
Principle of Design
We selected β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) as an indicator of early detection of                         chronic kidney disease, because β2-MG has an abnormally elevated concentration in the                         first and second stages of development of chronic kidney disease (for detailed information of                         β2-MG please refer to our project section). We designed a visualized liquid crystal                         urine protein detector Dr. Familict whose detection principle is based on our liquid crystal                         detection experiment. In Dr. Familict, the liquid crystals are vertically aligned under the                         action of the DMOAP inducer, and the polarized light incident on the polarizing plate thereon                         passes through the liquid crystal to make the image inside the box black; when there is an                         excessive amount of β2-M"

Synbio is just a S-Din away!
SYSU-Software 2017
Overview
S-Din (Search engine and Design platform for inspiration with Network analysis) is an integrated Search Engine and Design Platform, developped specifically for Synthetic Biology. Due to the exponential growth of published researches, many of them have never been fully exploited of their values. S-Din has been designed to integrate searching and designing seamlessly, finding exactly what users need and enabling users to edit simultaneously. What's more exciting about S-Din is that tree of words and various analyses were developed to inspire the user to generate a better idea. A simulation model was developed to help ensure the robustness of user’s design and wet-lab validation was conducted to validate its reliability. Our Github repo can be access from here .

Our needs
Our saxitoxin biosensor is based on an AMP biosensor that joins an AMP aptamer domain and a DNAzyme domain by a few bases, called linkers. These linkers are extremely important for the biosensor to success since they are responsible for the correct folding of a functional 3D structure. A functional 3D structure includes a correct sequestration of the catalytic domain when there's no ligand present, and the most important feature of these type of biosensors: the free energy released when the aptamer binds to the ligand must be close enough to the free energy needed to separate the linker from the DNAzyme domain (un-sequestration) and let it catalyze the REDOX reaction.
The problem
Designing the linker region for the Aptazyme is a very difficult task. We could even say that it is impossible for a human to design proper linkers without computer help in a reasonable time. That's why we needed an automated process that could help us with our linker region design.
The solution
Heidelberg's 2015 team, with their project ""CATCH IT IF YOU CAN"", developed a software called JAWS (Joining Aptamers Without Selection) that basically automated the random process of selecting DNA bases that accomplish all the requirements mentioned above (see more at https://2015.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/software/jaws). We used this software to model our linker region, joining the saxitoxin Aptamer with the DNAzyme domain. JAWS gave us 4 linker regions that satisfied the requirements with high probability.
Above are shown the sequences provided by JAWS, bold letters are the linkers modeled the software.
Did it work?
Apart from the linkers modeled by JAWS, we designed a linker ourselves. For this, we analyzed the linker used in the AMP aptazyme biosensor and we simply changed the bases of the linker that hybridized with the AMP aptamer domain, for bases that should hybridize with the saxitoxin aptamer domain. We contrasted the performance of the saxitoxin aptazymes with our likers versus the aptazymes with the linkers provided by JAWS. The results indicated that the models made by the software"

Fig.5 For the toxin protein MazF, we concluded that the influence of strong RBS is more evident.
Fig.6 For the toxin protein HokD, the replacement of RBS will influence the expression of hokD. The weaker RBS B0031 leads to lower expression of toxin protein HokD.
We tested the lethal efficiency of HokD and MazF under different RBS. Compared with the positive control (pSB1C3 empty vector), the three experimental groups showed obvious difference. For MazF, the strong RBS B0034 was proved to have highest lethal efficiency. For HokD, the weak RBS B0031 was proved to have the lowest lethal efficiency.
4. sgRNA targeting genome of strains with no NHEJ repair system
To test the effects of Cas9 and targeting sgRNA, we separately constructed two plasmids containing sgRNA and Cas9 protein. We co-transformed the two plasmids into E.coli TOP10, and added 10mM arabinose to induce the expression of Cas9. In order to validate the effect of Cas9 and sgRNA, we did quantitative analysis of colony formation after induction to confirm CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated DSB in E.coli TOP10.
Fig.7 experimental procedure
The cells were diluted 102–104 fold and plated onto agar plates containing AmpR and CmR. The results showed that the control group with no induction was growing better than the testing group when both of them were diluted 103 fold, which means the DSB did have the lethal effect and can be used as a candidate for killer device.

Recombination
Aim
Considering the factor of the potential deficiency of executor killer due to the completely lost of plasmids and the number of ""in-promoters"" will affect our system, we decide to integrate the killer device into the genome. This group mainly provided a tool for genome integration. The insertion fragment is our testing device, including the expression cassette of rfp and killer gene. With this recombination system, we can get the upgraded type of our P-SLACKiller.
Results
1. Coupled CRISPR/Cas9 system with λ-Red recombineering to integrate the donor fragments, but we haven’t finished the second plasmid construction
2. Tried the traditional lambda Red recombination and successfully inserted four testing devices into the genome, locus of LacI.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth

Following the insights we gained through our interviews we further cooperated with the BLISTA to make a Day in the Laboratory available for every visually impaired student and not just a few selected few. Find below, how we prepared for these two laboratory days and what means we undertook to encourage more visually impaired people to become interested in Science and decide on biology or chemistry as their study subject.
Recap: Learning with Visual Impairment
To understand the educational methods used for addressing the visually impaired, we visited the Carl-Strehl Highschool. We took part in their science classes and later teamed up with teachers to explore the various tactile representations they use to convey complex scientific phenomena and processes.
Figure 1: Our team member Benjamin self-testing his blind orientation capabilities.
Some of us experienced the difficulty of orientating in a room or understand a simple picture merely by its raised outline without your eyesight. This blindfolded self-test also taught us, that the design of raised models of something we normally would make a flat picture of, is far from easy. We tried to grasp the context of a single picture only by its convex outlines. And we miserably failed to identify the simple drawing of an elephant. Now imagine how difficult complex scientific processes, like cloning or charge transfers, could be conveyed just by touch. As an additional hurdle, perspective cannot be used in these tactile graphics. For a blind person, there are no clues to indicate depth, removing this normally useful feature.
We learned that small class size, one-on-one interactions, and teamwork amongst students with differing levels of eyesight were more effective than constant professional support. Furniture is arranged sensibly to improve acoustics and safe maneuverability. To simplify navigation, all rooms are based in part on the same layout. Everything was designed to ensure the highest autonomy possible for the students.
Smart tools also play an important role in the classroom. Students have personalized laptops and take pictures of chalkboards or presentations with their smartphones to be able to zoom in to magn"

User Research
This summer, the HCI lab was able to work extensively with users to create the suite of software tools that altogether improved efficiency and collaboration in a wet-lab environment.  We used a user-centered design (UCD) process in designing our tools as well in creating our outreach program.  To create tools that the most satisfactory for our users, we reached out to many different potential users, from experts in the field of synthetic biology, to users in industry and also the academia, as well as the next generation of synthetic biologists.  We took each and every one of our interviews, conferences, brainstorms, and discussions very seriously, and paid extensive attention to the feedback given us by biologists.  Through this, we were able to improve the software programs over the summer and make our designs more intuitive, educational, and enjoyable for all our users.

Basic Wet-Lab Training with Natalie Kuldell at MIT
At the beginning of the summer, the entire computational team went to receive an introductory wet-lab training at MIT.  We were given an extensive introduction into the human practice concerns of the iGEM competition, and also reminded of the nuances of working in an interdisciplinary research field such as synthetic biology, which stands at the crossroads between bioengineering, computer science, and cellular biology.  We were able to participate first-hand on a project based on the Eau d’Coli lab (a previous iGEM project).  Through this experience, our team realized that several factors could strongly affect the success or failure of a synthetic biology experiment: labeling equipment properly, meticulously following clearly written instructions, and communicating with other team members.  We learned a lot about the technical difficulties of working in a laboratory environment, and realized that many safety concerns could potentially arise while working with biological organisms and chemicals, safety concerns that are"

Suncor Oil Sands Tour
We are in Fort McMurray today and tomorrow to look at oil sands and its been an interesting day, here are the things I learned today:
1. How economics play a role in oil sands (if the amount per barrel is under 50-60, it will be difficult to make a profit) 2. We looked at mines today and the heavy machine that comes behind the scenes to get everything done. 3. Learned a lot about geology today  4. Finally, we were able to see many statues and many marked places.
In general, it was a lot of fun. I anticipate that tomorrow will be just as fun, Will update more tomorrow

What I remember Fort Mcmurray Day 1
We went on a tour of the Suncore Mine . The mine covered a large area . One side of the river was the refinery and the other side contained most of the mine. The trucks and giant shovels had created an artificial canyon.

We did more protoplasts according to the Protoplastation and Tranformation protocol , they were stored at -80°C.
10/8/2018
Small bricks: We wanted to test difference rice with sawdust. From earlier test (7/8) it seemed that 50% rice and 75% rice gave the best bricks. These ratios will be used with different kinds of rice. White rice, granulated rice, porridge rice, grounded porridge rice were used and one tray was with 50% and another was with 75%. See detailed notebook for Friday 10/8 for schematic of the trays. Incubated at 28°C dark.
Death test: Test from 3/8 showed no signs of mycelia growth.
Test from 8/8 showed signs of growth, although not mycelial. Plates put back in incubator for further inspection later. It seems like we are good with the baking. This means that the bricks that needed further drying should be dead as well - especially because they have had even longer in the oven than these tests.
Drylab Overview
6/8/2018
It was decided today that we are going to pick up the mycelium growth simulations, but approaching it differently than the previous attempt involving hidden markov models. It started out with a discussion about how a mycelium develops over time and discussing parameters based on experimental measurements, such as branching frequency and branching extension rates. Work was begun on two complementary growth models: a detailed micro growth model with a focus on hyphal growth and a meso growth model based on a system of partial differential equations describing the change in biomass density as a function of time, nutrients, space and species characteristics.
Nicolai and Lau collaborated in the sense that the brick design was finalized and Lau started simulating structures constructed using the brick design. Mathias and Nicolai tried to get a hold on the DTU Byg technician who could teach us to use their material properties machines. But he was still not available even though his schedule said otherwise. The first preliminary test was done using the “home built” hydraulic press. It initially showed a rough link between dryness and toughness. The more dry samples were generally more resistant to compression. 2 different kinds of foams were also tested to see if they were comparable to the material properties of the fungi. They were not, since they were actually tougher.

Stability
Escherichia coli is the lab rat of the bacterial world. We have performed the most complete characterization of the stability of E. coli in order to both confirm its optimality as a chassis for Synthetic Biology, and to determine the behavior of Biobricks under sub-optimal environmental conditions. We have subjected wild type strains to a range of stressful conditions (see just below ""the limits of E. coli"") and measured how our Biobricks behaved.
List of protocols here
1 . The Limits of E.coli
Temperature
E.coli is a fully studied and characterized bacterium. The optimal growth of this species is 37-38ºC with continuous agitation (200 r.p.m.) but out of this range                the growth slows down. First of all, we measured the growth of E.coli at temperatures ranging from 30 to 50ºC. To achieve our goal, we used a                fully original technique: instead of an incubator, we used a thermal cycler programmed to display a gradient of temperatures.
This proved a very easy and reproductible way of very precisely incubating at increasing temperatures small (PCR tubes) bacterial cultures.
The results obtained are shown below:
Figure 1: Growth of E. coli strains DH5α (left) and XL1-Blue (right) under different temperatures (30ºC-50ºC) set in a thermal cycler. The two strains display clearly different temperature profiles.
Conclusion
Is E. coli stable at a wide range of temperatures? Yes it is! We have detected some variations between the two strains. For example, DH5α resists low temperatures better than XL1-Blue, but both grow at a very large range of non-optimal temperatures.
Material fatigue (1)
Our modeling sub-team suggested an original idea. Is there something similar to material fatigue in biology? For example, how would an E.coli culture behave if subjected to a temperature fluctuation? We carried out some experiments with our thermal cycler by cycling the temperature of the medium every minute (37-41ºC) for 3h and maintaining controls at fixed"

Modeled Kill Switches
(a) BNU China 2014
The kill switch of BNU China’s iGEM team in 2014 [6] was chosen to be modeled. Topologically, it is a simple cascade of repressing units. We investigated                 the involved biological processes further and updated the network’s topology accordingly to resemble the biological structure correctly. This includes                 dimerization and complex formations through higher order reactions. The network topology given by BNU China 2014 and our reworked topology based on a                 deeper understanding is shown in figure 2.
Figure 2. (a) BNU China and (b) our more detailed rework that includes biologically relevant processes.
The inducer is IPTG and controls the toxin protein MazF. We introduce the dimerization of LacI and CI such that the dimers interact with the promoters.                 Furthermore, we modeled the repression through IPTG by a reversible second order reaction.
With these adaptations, the ODE system of BNU China’s iGEM team 2014 is a 10 dimensional vector that requires 23 constant parameters \(k\). The parameters                 have been chosen to be in accordance with biological processes. Amongst"
ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#expresults_-_-_TEXT.html,"gulators were intended for tight control of integrases . However, to have an easily quantifiable and proportional output, we initially used GFP as our riboregulated goi and measured the output fluorescence with a Tecan plate reader . This approach is described below in the figure 1.
Figure 2 Characterization of the riboregulator system. First, a defined amount of the incoming signal molecule 3OC6-HSL binds to LuxR. After dimerization, the complex binds to its corresponding promoter pLux. Both, the trans-activator(taR12y) and the cis-repressor (crR12y) together with superfolder green fluorecent protein (sfGFP), are under control of pLux. Upon induction with LuxR/3OC6-HSL, both are transcribed simultaneously and the taR12y (key symbol) opens up the crR12y sequence (lock) in front of the sfGFP mRNA. This enables translation and sfGFP production (left-hand side). Low transcription (leakiness) gives only small concentrations of mRNA, as a result 'lock' (cis-repressor) and 'key' (trans-activator) structures do not encounter each other and the translation is not enabled (right-hand side).
The first set of experiments was conducted with cells transformed with two different pPaB plasmids. These plasmids contained either the pBR322 origin (pMB1) or the p15A origin, yielding  a stable two-plasmid system with about 15-20 copies per plasmid and cell (medium-copy).  Furthermore the published riboregulator sequence includes two forbidden restriction sites (EcoRI and XbaI), since the sites removal   could affect the folding or functionality of the part, the original sequences were used as a control.  After characterizing the original part the restriction sites were removed by two different approaches: a) multiple site-directed mutagenesis, b) blunting and ligation (Klenow and T4 DNA polymerase). The new Biobrick compatible riboregulator was tested to confirm that no severe loss-of-function occurred due to the site-removal. In a third step, the construct was transferred into the pSB1C3 backbone (pMB1 origin, high copy number of 100-300) to be in line with the BioBrick Standard . Below, you can find the corresponding graphs in figure 2 and figure3, respectively. Future characterization of these constructs should allow us to explore the leakiness dependence on pl"

Kinetic Parameter Model on Methyl Salicylate
When we introduce new genes and pathways into our bacterium, several questions arise like for example: Does it influence its metabolism or growth rate? To answer this question we performed a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) which can be found here .
Another important question could be: How much methyl salycilate (MeS) will be produced in the end? This question can be answered using the Kinetic Parameter Model, described on this page. By modelling the pathway leading to MeS we can get a good estimation of the average MeS production. Apart from that we can also take a closer look at the pathway and find the rate"

PUR Esterase enzyme activity
Cell lysate assay
Since the PUR Esterases were not secreted, initially the cells were lysed to obtain crude cell extracts in order to test whether the enzymes are active. The Western Blot results showed that the constructs EstCS2 BBa_K1149002 , PueB BBa_K1149004 and PulA BBa_K1149006 were being expressed. The cultures expressing these three constructs were grown, lysed by sonication and utilised in a colourimetric assay with the substrate analog para-Nitrophenyl butyrate. The data shows that PUR Esterase EstCS2 BBa_K1149002 is definitely active.
para-Nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NP) is commonly used to indicate an enzyme’s esterase activity. The enzyme cleaves the ester bond and releases the 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), thus causing a colour change from colourless to yellow and an increased absorbance at wavelength 405 nm.
para-Nitrophenyl butyrate is cleaved by Esterases to release 4-Nitrophenol. This is accompanied by an increase in absorbance at 405 nm. Figure adapted from TU Darmstadt 2012 iGEM
The assay was run in the Eppendorf BioSpectrometer was used to automatically read the absorbance of the reaction mixture every 30 seconds. The concentration of 4-Nitrophenol produced from the reaction was calculated using the Beer-Lambert Law; the extinction coefficient of 4-NP is 18,000 M-1 cm-1 at 405 nm.
The results below show the concentration of 4-NP produced by the three different PUR esterases and compare them to the Empty Vector and Substrate alone as negative controls.
