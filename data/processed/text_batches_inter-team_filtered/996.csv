Goettingen,2013,Team:Goettingen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," RFP needs for fluorophore maturation could not have been available during log phase, since the cells consume the oxygen for enhanced cell growth. This possibility underlines the advantage of promoter characterization via transcript levels over promoter characterization via fluorophores. Still, fluorophore-depended characterization might be useful during stationary phase.
By qRT-PCR we were able to observe a tendency for the strength of the different promoters, though the exact fold changes did not seem to be reproducible. This lack of reproducibility might have resulted from the clones which differed in age. While the clones from replicate 1 were from the first transformation of the Biobrick vectors, the clones from replicate 2 originated from a new re-transformation of the plasmids. In general, our results suggested that Promoter 1 was the weakest, followed by Promoter 2, which was slightly stronger. Most interestingly, in E. coli DH5α, Promoter 3 seemed to be even stronger than Promoter 4, though it was shown to be weaker than promoter 4 before. However, our observations regarding Promoter 4 are difficult to interpret. First, this promoter led to contradicting results regarding the rfp fold changes during stationary phase, while the plate reader results independent of the clone indicated that it is weaker than Promoter 3. Second, qRT-PCR replicate 2 suggested that it is almost as weak as Promoter 4, which is in contrast to all other results obtained for this promoter. There are two possible explanations: (a) An experimental mistake resulted in insignificant fold changes; (b) Promoter 4 is subject to a complex regulation depending on the exact growth conditions. Considering this, it has to be noted that it is difficult to harvest the cells for RNA preparation at exactly the same OD600nm. Hence, we took the samples for all strains at the same time when they had reached the approximate OD600nm we were interested in. Since none of the two explanations could be ruled out, further characterization is necessary to obtain a more detailed view of the promoters and their regulation under different growth conditions. All in all, our results showed that it is useful to apply several methods for characterization. Taking the majority of the results of the three methods into account, we suggest that the order of the promoter activity in E. coli DH5α grown in LBAmp is as follows: Promoter 1 BBa_J23117 < Promoter 2 BBa_J23116 < Promoter 4 BBa_J23118 < Promoter 3 BBa_J23110 .

If you ask her for help with the interlab, wet lab or even                      human practices, she never waves away. And when you introduce an idea to her, she always laughs                      friendly in the beginning. We never understood, if it was a good sign or bad.

Lina is just helpless at keeping secrets from anyone and that makes her a perfect candidate for                      taking care of our budget. Unfortunately, she is the worst partner in crime at the same time.                      Despite that you can find out many piquant stories of her life, if you asked her like grim                      death. That might be a dark hint how her nickname „Johnny“ came along. Sometimes she also went                      missing for a few days. We used to call her numerous times and check local police reports until                      we understood that she simply likes to get away to the seaside.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," talk a little bit about how aware people are in the [United] States or western countries in general in contrast to developing countries for example? So is there a difference in the awareness of chlamydia?
Dr. Courtright:
Since I haven’t lived in America for so long it’s kind of hard to making a comment about here, but generally speaking there is not a lot of awareness about trachoma or chlamydia. I think most people are focused when they think about health care in developing countries it comes back to the “biggies” like Malaria, HIV, AIDS and TB. Chlamydia and trachoma don’t pop up on the radar screen. I always found it interesting in a lot of developing countries early on because there was money a long time ago focused on trachoma as a blinding condition that in many countries you’d ask them “What is your leading cause of blindness?” and they’d say “trachoma” and you go on “That is actually not true”. That is often because there was advocacy of identification of trachoma as a cause of blindness and for implementation of programs. I think there’s a much greater understanding of where trachoma fits in terms of causes of blindness in developing countries. But in industrialized countries I think there is very little understanding, […] I don’t think it deserves a huge amount of pressure for advocacy within the developed world. Simply because it is not the leading cause of blindness, it doesn’t kill people. I mean it’s probably speaking against my own better interests saying it’s not going to draw huge donor dollars and probably shouldn’t, because it’s not as big of a problem as many of the other health conditions that exist in these places.
Daniel C.:
Actually I was expecting you to say the opposite, because you were living in Africa for so long and we always imagine that maybe in the Western countries it is just underrepresented and in African countries it still affects people. […] And it’s easy to treat, but it just doesn’t have much attention.
Dr. Courtright:
When you say it is easy to treat: the technology is there yes, but when we say easy to treat I think many people in the industrialized world will get that a lot of what makes it difficult to treat is not the technology it’s the management systems and the health care systems that would support getting treated. Part of the reason why a tools such as you are developing has value is that the amounts of support it would need from within a health system, that are often rather weak, is going to be minimal.

Re-transformations 07/10/08
We retransformed P17, P26, P26, P42, P78, P88 from both the 2007 and 2008 registries. We made the following changes to the iGEM transformation protocol:
Heat shock for 30s
Incubate for 90min in 250 μL SOC medium
Prewarm plates
In addition to the biobrick samples we also ran Amp and Carb positive controls (pUC19) and Carb and Kan negative controls (mock transformations).
07/11/08 Results
The Carb negative control had about 25 colonies and the Kan negative control was blank. Both of the Amp and Carb positive controls had lawns of bacteria. P26 2007 had 13 colonies and P26 2008 had 1 colony (both Amp plates we poured ourselves). P38+45 and P39+45 both had many colonies, but these were not fluorescent as expected (these were both on Carb plates but there were many more colonies than on the Carb negative control).
We made liquid cultures of all the successful transformations in LB Amp.
P88 failed to grow. However, the P17 and P42 plates had 1/2 colonies after another 24h. These plates were saved.

We talked to UPitt iGEM, and they noted that due to technical concerns they were not confident about          the validity of their first set of measurements (Figure 7). When we looked at the unblinded data from the first set of measurements,          we noted that they had a similarly high level of B0064 expression. Future experiments are needed to determine whether that is an          artifact of a common procedural error in cell free systems, or is representative of a novel result in a cell free system.
Figure 5: Unblinded graph of UPitt iGEM’s measurements of our RBS library in the S30 cell free system. Their data          is in line with both existing measurements, as well as our measurements.

Figure 6B: Time course measurements of Team Alverno’s characterization of our RBS library in the TX-TL cell free system.
Our RBS characterization highlights the importance of rigorous characterization, especially in the context of our          Circuit Control Toolbox. To be able to use RBSs to tune the amplitude of any given transfer function, you need to be          sure that you can apply your characterization to a given situation. For example, using our RBS characterization it          becomes clear that it is important to consider both the system you are working in as well as the number of mRNA          transcripts created. Someone trying to use B0035 for high expression of a protein under the control of a weak          constitutive promoter needs to be aware that B0035 is only the strongest relative RBS when there are a large number          of copies of mRNA. Keeping this in mind, it is now possible to use our characterization to tune the amplitude and          relative max of various transfer functions. Using RiboJ to remove 5’ untranslated regions, and keeping in mind the          various limitations of any set of characterizations, our characterization of this will be of use in the Circuit Control          Toolbox, and for teams at large.

A study on the political, economic, social and legal issues of air pollution.
When we chose our topic in January 2017, we were in the middle of the French presidential campaign and many of the political platforms were mentioning the topic of pollution. One of the candidates had even directly targeted the endocrine-disruptors.
Once our subject was chosen and the project had begun, our law students, decided to make a report on air pollution and especially on how it affected our society in several aspects. Therefore, they decided to try to explain the political, economic, judicial and social issues when dealing with air pollution.
For this report, we have met with some major players in the French fight against air pollution such as associations but also people working for the French administration such as mayors’ and minister’s counselors (those meetings were described in the last paragraph).
With our project aether, we hope to give a technical solution against air pollution, but we think that technical means cannot do it all. We believe that each and every one should understand what are the main issues related to air pollution. Thus, we designed a report that you can read here:
The Particulate Matter Hunt
Finally, after our investigations and meetings, we returned to the general public to share our expertise on the issues of air pollution.
On September 16th, 2017, we organized an unseen event to raise awareness about the growing issue of air pollution and the stakes of our project. This event: a treasure hunt in the streets of Paris to educate and alert the participants in a fun way to the problem of air pollution and show them how synthetic biology could be a solution to fight this issue.
The hunt was organized as follows: at each stop, the players had to find a clue to solve a riddle, then they had to take part in an activity or a game around a specific theme, held at a booth. Completing a step allowed the participants to receive a clue to the location of the next stage. The main idea was to create ​​an event accessible to a wide range of participants: adults, children, families and people with reduced mobility, to inform and educate the players in a fun way.

Mathematical model
Q1: The general mathematical model seems to cope with two nodes coupling together at most. How about more than two nodes?
A1: In current version, we allow more than two nodes reaction function as user-defined form which requires the users to input themselves. Actually, it is easy to add more than two nodes form reaction functions in the model. But the computation time and RAM space will become bad. For the next version, we will change our data structure to accommodate more types but more efficient.
Input
Q1: The input box and steps for users is a little complicated and even have some small requirements for the users to be capable of transform rate equations to differential equations. It has confused me a little.
A1: So far, this input box is perhaps the simplest one after discussing a lot with our USTC wet team. By proposing many possible solutions, they chose this one. After the publishing of current version, we hope feedback from users can help improve the next version.
Algorithm
Q1: Can this software run faster and faster?
A1: Firstly, in our software, we choose and modify these best optimization algorithms carefully by comparing with possible optimization algorithm. How to improve the efficiency of optimization algorithm is an open problem in computer science and mathematics. Collaboration with experts in this field is needed.
Secondly, the speed is quite dependent on the performance of computer. We test these programs separately on Linux system in our high performance workstation. The result is fairly better than the test on our personal computer.
Thirdly, to improve the algorithm performance, parallel computing is a better choice. For this reason, the algorithms we adopt are parallel in nature and extension to parallel algorithm is possible. In the future, we will rewrite our software this form.
Q2: Can this software run more and more precise?
A2: The imprecision is largely caused by Local minimum and initial value dependence. Similar as above, these are also open problems. For we adopt Monte Carlo sampling in our algorithm, the results may vary time to time due to the randomness nature. It also remains a problem for us to solve in the future. We will make effort to modify existing algorithms or even create new one.
Output
Q1: Is it better to export a graph following SBGN standard?
A1: Currently, we are working on it. The basic"

--Tuesday 6/14/11--
Today we tested out error-prone PCR on the LacI promoter.  We are adding MnCl2 to a few of the tubes and changing the nucleotide concentrations in other tubes.   We want to test out some different screening techniques for a rapid hunt.  Characterizing thousands, possibly tens of thousands of promoter mutants is quite a daunting task and we want to make it as easy as possible.  We are looking to using a fluorescent cell sorter on campus which could narrow down a few good candidates for more rigorous testing.
We began work on the actual wiki with some code that I (Tim) wrote over the weekend.  It works perfectly in an unrestricted webpage but once I put it in iGEM's wiki, it doesn't work.  We'll have to figure this out.
We cultured all parts and digested to check on a gel .  All parts checked out.  Sent out all hydrated parts to get sequenced.
We ligated mutants into screening plasmid to see if our error-prone PCRs had visible mutants.
Additionally, we rehydrated and transformed part C0080 (araC regulatory protein) as we had forgotten to rehydrate it on Monday.
--Wednesday 6/15/11--
Today we ordered primers for mutagenesis of LacI promoter, cI promoter and tet promoter.  They didn't have adequate overhangs on the forward primer which could make it difficult or possibly impossible to digest in order to put in a screening plasmid.  We also ordered primers to replace RBS (Bba_B0032) in Bba_E0240 to Bba_B0034.  Glycerol stocks were made of our hydrated parts.  We sent all of our parts in to get sequenced to avoid problems we've had in the past with incorrect things from the Registry.   We miniprepped and digested the parts that were cultured in order to do a rough check on a gel"

As GMOs are the heart of our project, we wanted to have the public's opinion about the use of Genetically Modified Organisms.  First of all, we asked them about their knowledge on the subject.  As expected, some but not all of them had a poorly defined vision and were quite skeptical.  After a clear explanation of our work, they became more sensitive and aware of the GMO definition and more optimistic about it. Obviously, for biosafety and ethical reasons we had already chosen to only use purified components coming from genetically modified organisms such as pheromones from E.coli and chitinase from Beauveria bassiana.  Thus no GMOs will be released in the environment.
However, we had considered using Beauveria bassiana (a non-harmful fungus currently used in agriculture) in a trap that will spread out across the room thanks to incoming and outgoing bed bugs or directly in the room for a faster result. That was actually the critical point of our project, that’s why the public's point of view was very important.  We were really satisfied with the answers.  More than 70% accepted the release of a fungus in their house. However, almost 60% would prefer to have the fungus stay inside a trap even if it takes longer to eliminate the infestation.  Finally, thanks to this survey, we have chosen to focus on a trap that combines the presence of a fungus with purified chitinase and pheronomes for a more effective solution that is the key criteria for the general public."

During the course of our iGEM project, we have developed three tools which we would like to share with the iGEM community. The first is an online tool which translates any given text in ASCII format into DNA, which we extended from a tool made by iGEM Aberdeen 2014 . The second is a gRNA generation tool that takes into account codon substitutions by generating gRNA’s for all possible DNA sequences given an amino acid sequence. The third is a toolkit for holding a bioethics workshop, which we have developed with advice from Mr Virgil Rerimassie and the tool he co-developed: the iGEMers guide to the future.
Barcoding Tool
We developed an iGEM barcoding tool by improving upon an existing iGEM DNA translation tool developed by iGEM Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 . Our purpose for this is to enable sample multiplexing by barcoding DNA samples. This tool is very versatile however and can possibly of use to other iGEM teams. The tool can be found here .
gRNA generation tool
We developed a gRNA generation tool that is able to generate all possible gRNA’s at a given position, including all possibilities for codon substitutions. It does this by searching for an overlap between regions that the user is interested in, positions where a PAM sequences are found and regions with very little possible codon substitutions. Our purpose for this is to exclude codon substitution as a way to circumvent our detection method. It can also be useful for any other application that deals with high amounts of synonymous mutations in the gene they want to find. A more detailed explanation of the functioning of the tool can be found here and the code here .

Efficiency measures the extent to which a given method is able to remove phosphorus out of water. Chemical precipitation usually achieves total phosphorus removal down to 0.3 mg/l (Tanyi, 2006). As such, it is the only viable phosphorus removal method for sensitive water areas, which have exceedingly strict legal limits. EBPR is able to reduce total phosphorus levels to 0.5-1 mg/l, which is sufficient for most of the Canadian WWTPs’ needs. Phosphostore which involves the use of bacterial microcompartments, can achieve results slightly better than EBPR method yet significantly worse than chemical precipitation.
Predictability Both EBPR and Phosphostore are harder to predict and model compared to chemical precipitation as they depend on live organisms. Chemical precipitation methods rely on predicting chemistry and as such can be predicted very consistently whereas both biological methods rely on predicting complex biological interactions. The increased number of variables inherent in the EBPR and Phosphostore processes prevents them from ever being as predictable as chemical methods. Current EBPR methods incorporate the use of phosphate accumulating organisms which cannot be cultured in isolation. As such, EBPR has proven to be difficult to model and is often temperamental in practice (Sathasivan, 2009). This can lead to unexpected phosphate releases in the effluent. Hence, synthetic biology approaches such as Phosphostore are better suited because it applies mathematical modelling to predict the behaviour of an organism that has been tuned for a specific purpose. At the moment, Phosphostore employs Escherichia coli, a model bacterial organism that has been studied extensively in the past decades, as a chassis for the system. As an example of predictability, we have modelled an operon for our system that controls and regulates the expression of microcompartments within the cell. Our model has shown that the operon successfully down-regulates microcompartment formation under a certain phosphate concentration. Thus, future work would allow prediction of our system for different specific purposes.
Sludge Production Volume Chemical precipitation produces the most sludge as the process is based on adding more chemicals into the mixed liquor. EBPR and Phosphostore result in very similar sludge production volume. Higher sludge production is usually undesired by the WWTPs (Yuansong Wei, 2003) as it requires them to dump the waste somewhere, which is why, as a general rule, the higher sludge"

Project Overview
One goal of synthetic biology is to understand the exciting biological phenomenon by reconstructing the systems that have the similar behavior to the native. The design of networks are always challenging to the biologists as the desired phenotype is the only hint for the design. And after the design is finished in mind, there is still a gap in realizing it in experiments.The choices of reactors, the stability of the system are still important in the wet experiments. Here we are trying to escape the biologists from the design nightmare, employing the computer instead of the human brain to do the design process.
Goal
Work Flow
The ultimate goal of our program is to assist the experimentalists to design the plasmid that works as the requirement. For example, if an oscillation behavior is the requirement as the input of the software, then the output in our imagination is a DNA sequence which works as an oscillator in E.coli or other specific organisms. It is only an imagination that we have a long way to go. Then the first goal is to make a network work stably. Generally, the desired phenotype is the input of the software, and, optionally, the restrictions extracted from the other experiments or conditions can be the input simultaneously. And the output is a list of networks that have similar phenotypes approximating to the requirement, along with the kinetic parameters and robustness evaluation.
Work Flow
The three-layer optimization is expected during the whole design process: (1) the optimization of parameters in a fixed mathematic model, (2) the selection of interaction forms in a fixed topology, (3) the comparison and screening of different topologies. And during the optimization of the parameters, there are two score functions considered. One is the RMSD(root mean square deviation) between the phenotype of the designed network and the requirement, and the other is the sensitivity of each parameter. As the cell system is noisy, the networks are hard to realize in experiments if some parameters are too sensitive to uncertainties. So the parameters' sensitivities are working as a filter to get rid of the networks that works not stably enough. After the three-layer's optimization and comparison, a list of the best selected networks will output as the final solutions.
Platform
GUI Sample
A user-friendly network-design platform is realized in our software with C# for the experimentalists. The interface is shown in Figure2"

This then gives     interpolated values for any point within the domain. Note that     the resulting function is not linear, but quadratic since it contains the term     $x \cdot y$.
Synthesis
The diffusion, production and degradation of AHL and leucine are    described by the PDEs (4). At the same time, the random movement,    chemotaxis and intercellular    interactions of cell types A and B are captured by    the stochastic equation of motion (11). Translating the spatial distribution of     cells type A into a density field to feed into the PDE module can be    accomplished by using kernel density estimation (16). Finally, the agents    can request concentrations and gradients at arbitrary positions from the    PDE module using    bilinear interpolation (B3.3). Taken together, these equations describe the    individual modules, as well as the two-way information transfer in between them,    and thus they fully define our hybrid model. A graphical summary is shown in    Figure 10.
Figure 12
Graphical summary of hybrid model. Click to enlarge.
Implementation
Agent-Based Module
In this paragraph, we will discuss the implementation of   the agent-based module. First, the problem of computing   pairwise interactions is discussed and a nearest-neighbor   algorithm is introduced to reduce the computation time.   Then, the choice of timestep is considered   with regards to the cell-cell interaction scheme. Finally,   the boundary conditions for agents are defined and explained.
Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm
The cell-cell interactions have already been fully described   in the paragraphs above. However, solving the equation of   motion of an agent in its current form (11) requires the   computation of the force due to every other agent. If we   take N to be the number of agents, that means $N*(N-1)$   amount of force computations are executed in total and   therefore the computation time grows as $O(N^2)$. To put   this in perspective, if we simulate a thousand agents, the   amount of interactions adds up to one million. This   puts a heavy computational load on the model which can be   reduced greatly by using better algorithms. The crucial   observation here is that the force is zero when the   distance between two cells is larger than   $2\cdot r_{cutoff"

We collaborated with Dr. Daly's group at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences who sent us frozen pellets of cultures they had grown. Our adviser Russell prepared Illumina and PacBio sequencing libraries from DNA isolated from these pellets.

For those antibiotics, many alternatives still exist in the unlikely case                             of resistance developed due to research work. Nevertheless, we asked professor Van Hest about the                             possibilities of replacing the commonly used antibiotic resistances with a dependence on artificial                             amino acids. He said that, albeit not yet used, dependence on artificial amino acids as a selection                             mechanism may be even more reliable than antibiotic resistance. The reason is that bacteria tend to get                             rid of genes that are temporarily unused, e.g. in the absence of antibiotics. As genes related to                             artificial amino acid dependence generally encode for essential proteins, they do not run this risk.
In conclusion, our project offers a solution to the treatment of infections caused by antibiotic                             resistant bacteria. We already reflected on ways to prevent resistance against our own bacteriocins.                             Finally, we explored how we as scientists may limit the use of antibiotics in R&D to prevent the                             development of additional resistance.
Working with Staphylococcus aureus
Problem: S. aureus is a pathogenic BSL2 species. How do we prevent unsafe situations for team members while testing our bacteriocin?
Experts: PAMM
Solution: Collaborate with PAMM to use their well-equipped laboratories and expertise on working with these dangerous bacteria.
More information
Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic species. It is one of the most important infections-causing                             bacteria in humans and it is easily transmitted through human contact and via the air (3,4) . The                             pathogenicity of S. aureus requires us to take preventive measures before handling it. As we did not have                             access to the ML2 lab facilities required for use of S. aureus, we contacted our partner PAMM for help.                             They performed the experiments with S. aureus for us. As a recognized diagnostic laboratory, they work                             with S. aureus on a regular base and know which precautions to take.

Data Analysis
For each data set, the maximum normalised fluorescence rate was taken. This is the measurement used to calculate Relative Promoter Units, and by extention, RNA Polymerase per second (PoPS). These data were plotted for each cell type against concentration of arabinose:
The most important graphs above are those for GFP in cells 40 (pBAD) and 91 (amplifier). These are effectively the input and output for the amplifier device. One can see that the pBAD curve has no real increase until at least 10μM, whereas an equivalent large increase for the amplifier starts at about 1μM. Very low level transcription can be seen to be amplified. The amplified graph (91) starts to drop off at high concentrations: this may be due to toxicity.
Next, in order to remove the effect of pBAD, the gain (ratio output/input) at each concentration was calculated:
This graph shows that the amplifier has steady gain at low concentrations. The point at ""0.01"" is actually that for zero, showing the basal amplification. What is interesting in this graph is that the gain drops off, well before the reduction of expression for cells 91. This is because cells 40 start to rise here.
Finally, in order to fully abstract the behaviour of the amplifier device from arabinose concentration, the output signal was plotted directly against the input signal:
A linear device would have a straight line here. Instead we observe a rapid increase in output at a low range of input, followed by a plateau, then a decrease at higher input. There is scope for the device to be used in both discrete and continuous applications.

Public Engagement & Collaboration
As a student of the top normal university of China, we felt obligated to contribute to the popularization and education of the advanced idea of synthetic biology and iGEM. Thus, we took advantage of the education-related resources we possessed, and did a lot of meaningful and experimental educational works. We designed a systematic four-week introductory courses with the help of professors who owned original comprehension on the methodology of teaching. We launched this course system in a series of schools, expecting to stimulate their interests in synthetic biology. As for the selecting and breeding process for the next generation of team BNU-China, we've developed a whole new and well-paced program with a step-by-step handbook. We shared the handbook with future iGEMers from Chongqing University and helped them to prepare for 2018 iGEM competition. What's more, We created an animated figure as a desktop assistant system based on our projects and basic knowledge and information on synthetic biology and iGEM. Lastly, we reviewed the history and experiences of our team, and we set up our own websites and printed posters to exhibit our achievements.
Introductory Courses
In September 2017, with the hope to accumulate experiences and explore the methodology of synthetic biology propagation, we launched the systematic four-week introductory course program at Bayi High School as a meaningful attempt on in-depth teaching of the principles of synthetic biology towards average high school students. The course system covers the 101 introduction on synthetic biology together with some example of its application adapted according to the knowledge base of high school students and a brief lecture on iGEM and our project. To guarantee the quality of the courses, we practiced, rehearsed and revised for several rounds. To make sure that the involved school, students and their parents fully consented with the course series and were willing to participate actively, we handed out well-adapted formal consent forms , which we believe to be a fair template for future references. The courses were liked by most of the students, and there were heated discussion among the teachers and students.

Collaborative Learning
During the brainstorm sessions a MSc student in Educational studies, Amalia Ephrat, has recorded the way this team came to their final topic Snifferomyces! The team helped her to study the collaborative learning activities between students with different international backgrounds within the learning context of the University. The main focus of her research is the collaborative process in the iGEM group and the efficacy of the interventions of the supervisors to support the collaborative process in a culturally diverse group of students.
When students of diverse backgrounds participate in a project where collaborative learning is important, the cultural differences can pose a series of challenges to the group processes. This is a well-known challenge for many Dutch universities, which makes it a relevant topic for educational research to investigate the means for intervention and the effects of those interventions on collaborative learning processes and outcomes.
Her plan is to improve collaborative learning amongst students of different backgrounds, by designing research and conduct measurement during the brainstorming phase of the project. Her research shall consist of qualitative exploratory methods using observational methods and interviews and quantitative research using several questionnaires, including collaborative skills, empathy and intercultural conflict management.

After choosing the inhibition method, we started to find a ROS sensor with low sensitivity to                         ROS, since we hoped the sensor would only work under high level of ROS. But it didn’t exist,                         the only thing we could find in literature was protein Yap1, a basic leucine zipper (bZip)                         transcription factor from yeast. [9]
Fig. 4 How dose Yap1 work
Yap1 can sense the cytoplasmic H2O2 produced in mitochondria, which is a                         kind of signal meaning cells were at a high oxidant condition through an intramolecular                         disulfide bond generation. There two methionine closed to each other locates on the surface of                         protein, so when the ROS concentration increases significantly, the two thiol would be oxidized                         and generate an intramolecular disulfide bond generation leading change of protein structure.                         Then it will entry the nucleus to active some antioxidants enzymes transcription. Yap1 responds                         rapidly to cytoplasmic H2O2 due to a enzyme, Gpx3 (Orp1), a kind of                         catalase which can identify hydrogen peroxide efficiently, through the transformation of                         intermolecular disulfide bond. [10]
Fig. 5 gene circuit of Feedback part
Thus instead of using a sensor that is less sensitive to ROS, we tried to find some weak                         downstream promoters so that the ligated dCas9 protein would only have significant inhibitory                         effect when ROS accumulation is forcing yeast into death.
Output
As a ROS detector, our system should not only sense the intracellular ROS content, but be able                         to output signal, so that we know what happen exactly in the little tiny cells.                         Time to select a signal output substance. Like what we mentioned in description , we considered glutathione, which could sense ROS in vivo, but could not output, so it’s                         incompetent. Chemical fluorescent probe was not good enough either since its toxicity and long                         processing time, we preferred to find something existing in intracellular environment as a                         signal output. Eventually we found roGFP2---a kind of green fluorescent protein sensitive to                         redox in the Registry.
Fig. 6 How roGFP works.
The process of roGFP sensing ROS is similar to Yap1. RoGFP is a variant of GFP. Compared with                         the later one, roGFP has 8 amino acid mutations. Point of its sensitivity of redox states is                         two Mets which locate in the surface of protein. Once the"

Bistability in B.subtilis
The Sin (Sporulation Inhibition) operon
The Sin (Sporulation Inhibition) operon can be used as a stochastic switch. It is a natural bistable switch.
File:SinOperon.jpg
During normal conditions, SinR is expressed constitutively by P3 and keeps its concentration at a constant level repressing promoter 1. When transcription of promoter1 is activated by phosphorylated Spo0A, both sinI and sinR are expressed from promoter 1. SinI inactivates SinR by forming a complex with sinR upregulating both proteins from promoter1. This cross repression, inhibition of SinR by SinI and  the transcriptional represion of sinI by SinR, forms the basis of the bistability. While the positive feedback in the production of SinI enhances the bistability, it also causes increase in sinR levels because of the expression from promoter 1 hence causing oscillations.[1]
The Sin operon controls the early stages of sporulation and has a key role to control the sporulation without disturbing its regulation. The threshold of this switch to progress into sporulation can be controlled by varying some parameters, hence providing population heterogeneity.  Tight binding of SinR to the first promoter region  with fewer sinR molecules increases this heterogeneity. By mutating the first promoter, the binding affinity of sinR the promoter can be increased.   With variations on SinI:SinR interaction strength,  transcription rate of sinR from the third promoter and the expression rate of SinR, dynamics of the system can be altered.[1] SinR and SinI can be used to regulate the heavy metal sequestration.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," that perfect matches will have a ΔΔGCas9:gRNA value of 0, while mismatches will have a positive ΔΔGCas9:gRNA value. However, many perfect matches had positive ΔΔGCas9:gRNA values, and some mismatches had negative ones, leading to imperfect identification of the on-target site. We solved this problem in the same way as the Salis lab – by calculating the average mismatch free energy for the C. reinhardtii genome using the given data set (yielding a value of 0.9039 kcal/mol), and simply using this value for ΔΔGCas9:gRNA for all duplex mismatches, and a value of 0 for all duplex matches.
Graph 1
88 740 target sites should yield 88 747 differential equations (5 for Cas9:gRNA active complex formation, 88 740 for the cleavage/repair of each site, and 2 for the evolution of Ntotal[on-target site] and NGOI). This can be simplified by assuming that there is 0 binding probability if ΔGtarget is greater than 0, however, this only narrows it down to 29 146 target sites – still too many for MATLAB to deal with in any reasonable amount of time.
Graph 2
The final simplification in our model stems from the Salis lab’s observation that 87% of significant Cas9 binding activity occurs at target sites with at most 1 mismatch in the first 8 nucleotides proximal to the PAM. Only 84 of the aforementioned 29 146 sites in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome meet this specification, and so we made the simplification of only considering these 84 sites (including the on-target site) with individual differential equations. While the other sites may not have significant binding activity by themselves, the activities of all of them together are likely to make a noticeable impact on the system. However, as their binding rates are likely to be small (particularly in early time periods such as those considered in our model, where there is still a multitude of on-target DNA sites which Cas9 is attracted to far more strongly), we were able to make the simplification of combining all of their action together into one differential equation, representing the average cleavage rate of a site with more than 1 mismatch in the first 8 PAM-proximal nucleotides.

Tyrosinase (produces melanin)
Nina: In the “normal“ skin melanocytes are present and secrete out melanin molecules which enter the keratocytes, resulting in color in the skin. In “vitiligo“ skin melanocytes are missing at some areas, thus no melanin production takes place at these patches that keratocytes can take up and result in skin color, instead one gets white patches. Note! Ignore albinism and piebaldism.
Nina: I scanned this picture from the book: Vitiligo Problems and solutions by Torello Lotti and Jana Hercogová. It is good in the way that is presents the relationship between keratinocytes and melanocytes. They are in close contact and have ""communicate"" with each other via molecules. In addition, it is shown here that melanocytes are like neronal cell with dendrite, from which they secrete molecules, such as melanin, to the keratinocytes. When melanocytes will be removed as in the vitiligo disease, they won't be able to secrete any necessary molecules to the keratinocytes such as melnin, which gives skin color.

Fluorescence Readings
Fig. 1: Procedure for moving fluorescent cultures forwards. The cultures were moved forward a maximum of 10 days, which is ~125 generations.  At the end of Day 1, the each culture has had ~35 generations of growth, each day after this adds an additional 10 generations.
After we transformed the plasmids into E. coli, we were almost ready to begin the propagation phase of our stability experiment.
First, we streaked transformed cells for each plasmid onto LB/CAM plates and let them incubate overnight. The next day, we selected a number of independent colonies that were still fluorescing for each plasmid. Then, we placed the colony in 5 mL of LB/CAM media and grew each overnight in the shaker at 37° C and 215 RPM. We refer to these cultures as 'Day 1'. The next day, we began the propagation phase of our experiment.
Moving forward, each day we retrieved the overnight cultures from the shaker. We used 5 μl to start a fresh 5 mL culture with LB/CAM media, which was then grown overnight. Next, we measured fluorescence using a 96 well plate reader by pipetting 200μL from each culture and into a well on a 96-well plate. Finally, the day's cultures were placed in the cold room for storage. This process was repeated until either fluorescence was lost or ten days had past.
After the propagation phase, we sequenced the final cultures and compared this sequence to the original to determine which mutations had dominated the cultures.

Results and Discussion
The plasmids created had a great amount of variance in their stability and longevity over the course of the experiment depending on the fluorescent protein that was used in the plasmid.
Plasmids that bore the SYFP2 gene tended to be unstable. Strains with SYFP2 gene frequently broke down within three days, going from very high fluorescence to no observed fluorescence. Furthermore, some samples of SYFP2 lost functionality after merely a day, showing the SYFP2 gene is very unstable across generations. The SYFP2 plasmids most often accumulated IS (insertion sequence"

The above figure means that we want to produce spermidine after a certain time we add arabinose which can reduce the activity of Cre. Then the number of times of flip will decrease and we can expect to get more genes in state ‘B’ we want.  Below is the reaction we add to achieve the idea. Here

Compare the result of the model with feed forward with the previous one without feed forward, we can easily find that: 1. The peak of the Cre distribution is narrower in the model with a feed forward part and the number of times of flip decreases a lot. 2. In the stable state that the number of genes in every state does not change any more, more genes have flipped from state ‘A’ to state ‘B’ in the model with a feed forward part. And this result is better than the previous one since we want the system to finally change from the ‘AND’ gate to the ‘OR’ gate which means it is better to have more genes in state ‘B’.
Stability analysis:
We then compare the stability of the system with feed forward with the previous one without feed forward by observing their phase trajectories and we can get the following result. System without feed forward:
System with feed forward:
Both phase trajectories of the two systems go straight to a point which illustrate that both systems reach to the stable state rapidly. But if we observe carefully, we can see some fluctuations in the Figure 4.8 and almost no fluctuation in Figure 4.9 from which we can get the conclusion that the system with feed forward is more stable than the one without feed"

Conclution
    We studied for a time before doing interlab, and spent one-two day preparing experimental materials, such as preparing E. coli DH5α and several culture media. After full preparation, we started the experiment. In the first experiment, our antibiotics failed, causing too much bacteria to colonize the plate.The second time we had a problem with the competent cells, so the bacteria did not grow after the plate was painted.The third time, we reprepared the competent cells and replaced the antibiotics, and the experiment went well.
1. The final concentration of chloramphenicol is not clearly defined in the experimental protocol. Although we have made the experiment proceed smoothly based on experience, we believe that accurate antibiotic dosage requirements are still necessary;
2. Regarding the use of the plate reader: although there are some descriptions in the experimental protocol that explain the experimental design and a simple explanation of the plate reader, we used the plate reader incorrectly at the beginning of the experiment, leading to a invalid data. So we still expect more instructions on the setup and use of the plate reader;
3. Regarding the preservation of competent cells: we have transferred the competent cells position between buildings due to the change of the laboratory position, which took about 10 minutes. And in the transformation experiment, the competent cells stayed outside for too long. These improper storage of competent cells made the bacteria grow very unsatisfactorily after plating. Therefore, the preservation of competent cells is very important.

Basic Parts
Four Basic parts were built this year.
(1) BBa_K2244004
Coding region of mheI, a functional gene encoding a carbendazim (Methyl-1H-Benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate, or MBC) hydrolyzing esterase that degrades MBC pesticide.
(2) BBa_K2244005
Coding region of LEV1, a conjugated gene encoding a fusion protein LexA-VVD.
(3) BBa_K2244006
Regulatory sequence ColE promoter, which contains a SOS operator sequence for the binding of LexA protein.
(4) BBa_K2244003
A signal peptide and a coding region of opdA. This is an improved part of BBa_K215090 (iGEM Washington 2009), which contains a functional gene (opdA) that encodes organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) to degrade organophosphate pesticides. In order to develop live cell biocatalysts, we fused a TorA signal peptide of E. coli Tat translocase to the N-terminal of opdA to facilitate the protein exportation to periplasmic space of E.coli.
Composite Parts
Three Composite Parts were built this year.
(1) BBa_K2244009
A Light-repressed gene expression device (LightOFF system). LEV1 repressor binds to operator sequence of ColE promoter thus halts the transcription of reporter gene mCherry
(2) BBa_K2244011
A heterologous proteins exportation component. Once the lightOFF system is activated by light repression, opdA hydrolase is produced and exported to the periplasmic space of E. coli cells.
(3) BBa_K2244010
A light-regulated biosafety device adapted from the lightOFF system. Once the lightOFF system is activated by light repression, supernova is produced and accumulated in the cells. Subsequent light illumination leads to release of ROS from supernova and causes cell apoptosis.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," strategy, the break-even pricing is the approach that will better determine our final price. Therefore, after designing Biotic Blue and determining its costs, we will set the price at which it will break even, and finally, we will convince buyers of our product’s value. We aim to gain a long-term relationship with our customers; thus, our model will not be based on one initial payment but instead on smaller payments over time set by their demands.
Place: initially, we will be operating in Sweden, and our strategy to make Biotic Blue available to customers will rely on personalized interaction, employees specially trained to demonstrate Biotic Blue value to potential buyers.
Promotion: personal selling will be an essential advertising channel for us. In addition, we will establish our brand by actively using digital marketing and social media platforms. Engagement of future buyers will be possible by associating the brand with a desirable benefit, which is to achieve cleaner water.
Funding Strategy
Financial support becomes crucial to succeed in the industry and helps out when needing the resources to maintain our position in the market. Our financial strategy is based on the bootstrapping method. We will be using internal financial sources (personal savings, loans and investments from family and friends) as well as public support (student grants and university support).
This way, we will be able to maintain control over all decisions by not sharing ownership between investors. This method will eventually attract Angel Investors (AI) who will perceive us as self-confident entrepreneurs. On the other side, the reason we are not considering Venture Capital (VC) funding is that VC firms are mainly driven by technology and product attractiveness, which means that this kind of funding is more focused on advanced projects. They also tend to be very selective and often demands exclusivity (Lecture A Mohammadi 26 Jan 2018), therefore, this option will be studied in the future. We will also consider a possible application to the Water Innovation Accelerator program run by the non-profit organization WIN.
We are happy to say we were greatly funded by two of the most renowned universities in Stockholm, Karolinska Institutet (KI) and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. In addition, we also received support from the following sources: KI Innovation Office and student grants from Medicinska Föreningen union at KI and KTH Opportunities Fund.
We joined, as one of the first members, the Open Innovation platform HelloScience created by Novozymes. The platform offers microgrants up to 1000 $ USD and aims to encourage collaboration between students and incubators, so our early stage product can come to life ["

3) The biobrick ligation products were used to transform K12 cells and were plated appropriately. The successful amino acid-antibiotic cassettes were also transformed into EPI300, DH5a, and BL21 cells with the appropriate recombineering plasmid, and plated. To date, all the tet resistance strains have been plated, as well as Mehul's Amp resistant strain. The kanamycin resistant strains remain recalcitrant, perhaps due to, again, the inconsistent performance of the kanamycin plates.
It should be noted that several of the transformations sparked during the electroporation procedure. Some success has been reported with sparked cultures, so they were plated anyways.

It should be noted that when a ligation has been done, it does not mean that it was successful. We will not know until we see growth on the plates and a cPCR of the colonies has been done. Even then, it would be useful to have it sequenced.

Title： Revealing Shared and Distinct Network Organizations of Arabidopsis Immune Responses by Integrative Analysis
Xiaobao Dong* and Ziding Zhang
State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China
Speaker (Email: x.b.dong@c au.edu.cn)
Abstract: Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) are two main forms of plant immune response to counter pathogen invasion. Up to now, genome-wide regulatory network organization principles leading to quantitative differences between PTI and ETI remain elusive. We combined an advanced
machine learning method and modular network analysis to systematically characterize the organization principles of Arabidopsis PTI and ETI. We report our major findings from three network resolutions. At a single network node/edge level, we ranked important genes and gene interactions for immune response and successfully identified many known immune regulators for PTI and ETI, respectively. Topological analysis showed that important gene interactions tend to link network modules. At a subnetwork level, we identified a subnetwork shared by PTI and ETI, which covers 1159 genes and 1289 interactions. In addition to being enriched with interactions linking network modules, it is also a hotspot attacked by pathogen effectors. The subnetwork likely represents a core component to coordinate multiple biological processes in the transition from development to defense. Finally, we constructed modular"

Fatih_Turkey,2011,Team:Fatih Turkey#anti-lps.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"). Our  interest in determining the crystal structure of LALF arose from its potential  in designing molecules that would have therapeutic properties in humans. It has  been proposed that LALF has sequence similarity with ct-lactalbumin, a protein  that binds LPS in vitro (Aketagawa et al., 1986).
 
     LALF recognizes the lipid A portion of  individual soluble LPS molecules (Warren et al., 1992), which are obtained  below the critical micellar concentration. The simplest molecules that bind  lipid A with high affinity are the polymyxin family of antibiotics; these are  positively charged amphipathic cyclic oligopeptides linked to a single fatty  acid (Morrison and Jacobs, 1976).

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html," genome, but they used a gene cassette much smaller than ours will be (Wong et al., 2017). Schwartz et al. (2017) identified five loci within the Y. lipolytica genome with a high rate of integration via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (Schwartz et al., 2017). They found that gene disruption in these regions did not affect the growth rate of Y. lipolytica, which made us consider using them to integrate our genes of interest.
Gene integration via CRISPR could cause gene drive, which occurs when a particular set of genes spreads rapidly throughout the population of an organism (Noble et al., 2018). The use of gene drive violates the iGEM competition rules, so we will not use it in this project. To avoid gene drive, our mentor, Dr. David Bernick, suggested that we use microinjection of the Cas9 protein. However, micropipettes cannot penetrate the cell wall of Y. lipolytica, which makes this technique unusable (Riveline and Nurse, 2009). The authors of Riveline and Nurse (2009) offered an alternative method that employs microfabricated channels to hold individual yeast cells while a piezoelectric unit shears them (Riveline and Nurse, 2009). With the limited timeframe of our project, this option seemed too complex, so we abandoned CRISPR/Cas9 as our method of gene integration.
We also considered using homologous recombination (HR) to integrate our genes of interest. HR requires that our gene cassette be flanked by 1 kilobase (kb) regions homologous with a location in the Y. lipolytica genome. When a double-strand break naturally occurs within the cell, the cell can repair the break using homologous pieces, known as homology arms (HAs). HAs neighboring our genes of interest will signal the cell to repair the break and integrate our genes into the genome. Although HR is a great option for genomic integration, Y. lipolytica performs NHEJ more often than HR. In a typical strain of Y. lipolytica, using HR dramatically increases the time needed for our genes of interest to incorporate into the genome. Fortunately, Verbeke et al. (2013) showed that HR rates in Y. lipolytica increased by 56% when they knocked out the KU70 gene (Verbeke et al., 2013). The KU70 gene regulates the NHEJ pathway in Y."

In addition to protecting information through the non-disclosure agreement, the two parties may want to both protect themselves and place concrete limits and boundaries on the relationship through an array of different agreements, including material transfer agreements and patent licensing agreements. Material transfer agreements can be beneficial in setting the specific terms and conditions by which either party may transfer their product or research materials/results while setting the boundaries on the rights of the receiving party. The agreement attached as Exhibit B represents a sample material transfer agreement with short explanations and suggestions that may hopefully provide a working understanding of such an agreement. A patent licensing agreement typically grants the right to one party to use the invention or method protected under a patent owned by the other party. Often times, the research conducted through these relationships is entirely dependent on material or methods that are owned exclusively by one party. Thus, the patent licensing agreement provides the core tool that enables such research. The agreement attached as Exhibit C represents a sample material transfer agreement with short explanations and suggestions that may hopefully provide a working understanding of such an agreement.
Case study 3
Currently, there does not exist a close relationship between Santa Clara University’s iGEM team and Anaerobe Systems and there has been very little recent contact between the students and the CEO, Mike Cox.  The Santa Clara University iGEM team has been involved in pursuing an independent project in order to solve a problem that is encountered by many scientists and other companies.  Therefore, the Santa Clara University iGEM team’s strategy has not been in danger of infringing upon any of Anaerobe System’s intellectual property rights due to the limited amount of interaction. Anaerobe System’s strategy of adding a large amount of base to neutralize acid is something that many biotech companies do and Santa Clara’s attempt to create a new system to find a solution to this problem does not constitute any kind of infringement.
Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for many student groups to be in a similar situation characterized by limited contact with a biotech company.  Under these circumstances, the possibility always exists that the students may be infringing upon the intellectual property rights owned by the company.
Although the costs associated with patent litigation can be very high, the ramifications for an infringer can be severe.  When an infringer loses a patent case, that party can sometimes become, in effect, a licensee and may be required to pay a reasonable royalty for any future sales derived from the patented product, method, or technology.  Furthermore, a court may issue a post-trial injunction, which is an order for the infringer to stop infr"

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

Design Process
Overview
To have a successful software tool, as designers it is our responsibility to cater to the needs of the user.  Throughout our projects, we applied a user-centered design (UCD) process in both our MS Surface and web-based tools as well as in our outreach program.  In UCD, user input is extremely crucial throughout all the stages of the design process.  The goal of UCD is to create tools that enhance the current intuitive behaviors and practices of the users instead of forcing users to change behaviors to adapt to our software. Thus, extensive attention is given to the feedback and opinions of our potential users- synthetic biologists- and improvements in the designs are made in each iteration of our software design to address the questions and problems brought up by our users each time.
Design Process
The user-centered design process we followed this year can be divided into four different steps:  analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation.  Following, we describe the key activities we employed in each stage.
Analysis
In the analysis phase we visited a variety of potential users for our software to understand the users’ profiles: their needs, requirements, and visions for the software we are to develop. In this phase there is also a lot of background research on competitive products, and start envisioning potential scenarios in which the synthetic biologists might use our software practically.
Observed users: MIT iGEM team , BU iGEM team , introductory biology students from Wellesley College, MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound Program high school participants .
We conducted focus groups and interviews with experts in the field of synthetic biology and biosafety, including from pharmaceutical companies such as Agilent Technologies or Sirtris Phamaceuticals.
In addition, the entire computational team participated first-hand in a synthetic biology experiment inspired by a previous iGEM project , to familiarize ourselves with the wet-lab environment and to understand some of the common safety precautions and lab managerial techniques biologists use while carrying out experiments.

These include the basic components required to build each device.  The cartridge is designed to be made of a durable injectable molding plastic holding the water sample solution in a volume of approximately 1 mL giving the cuvette dimensions of about 20 mm x 50 mm x 10 mm each.  A one-way valve will ensure the sample is contained within the device, and the capsule will contain a twist tube based cap which will dispense bleach once the cartridge has been finished being used.  This will be used as one of our safety features of the device to ensure containment and no release of our organism into the environment
The device has a similar design made out of molded plastic that is rugged and durable to be able to be used in the field. The basic design incorporates a heat source to ensure the electrodes of the cartridges are at a consistent temperature, a potentiostat to do the electrochemical detection, and electronic systems for handling the data that is collected. The LED lights will be used as external indicators to the user if the test was successful or if it should be repeated.
Manufacturing Cost Analysis and Development Timeline
Once a lab-scale prototype has been optimized, we will move our product forward into a manufacturing development phase.  To accomplish this task, we will partner with industrialization not-for-profit organizations and government programs that specialize in prototype up-scale and optimization.  An overview of the cost estimations that have been made for one round of prototype development are below:
Figure 2: Cost of a development cycle to begin developing our prototype onwards to a full product.
These numbers were determined by estimating the cost of each component of the project and the cost associated with batch producing 100 cartridges.  To produce our final product several rounds of prototype and product development will have to be undergone to ensure the production of an effective product.   It is estimated that our product development will require at least five rounds of prototype development cycles as compared to other similar products in this industry.  Overall we have estimated the cost of these five rounds will be in the range of $225,000 to $275,000 depending on changes that are made to the technology through the development cycle.
Each round of prototype development will require a series of steps to design and simulate the prototype, design the molding and plastic casings for each device, assemble each component individually, and then integrate the components into the finalized system. An overview of this process and the time associated with each step is listed below:
This development plan assumes an approximate 2 month development cycle.  This will require approximately one year to fully develop"

A highly energetic azide reacts with an alkyne enabling a selective reaction that links these reactive groups to one another via a dipolar cycloaddition (Fig. 1). However this reaction requires a lot of activation energy.
Zhang2005
Without catalyst the reaction is slow and results in a 1,4, 1,5 triazole regioisomer. To increase the reaction rate and to avoid this byproduct it is necessary to add copper as a catalyst. Copper (Cu(I)) proofed to be a suitable catalyst that rapidly yields a 1,2,3 triazole heterocycle.

This shows that the feedback has a minimal influence on the system to create different subpopulations. Also when there is no negative feedback in the system, we found more parameter sets that give  a high amount of GFP (see Figures 4 and 5).
Figure 4. In this graph you see the amounts of GFP we got from the different parameter sets for the system without negative feedback.  Most of the parameter sets give a low GFP response, but a few give high ones. Those we use for further analysis.
Figure 5. In this graph you see the amounts of GFP we got from the different parameter sets for the  system with negative feedback. Most of the parameter sets give a low GFP response, but a  few give high ones. Those we use for further analysis.
The figures are simulated with the parameter sets obtained from the quorum sensing model. We are using  the parameter sets that give the best response according to the confidence intervals  (see Method section). In the presence and absence of negative feedback, the system behaves similarly by assuming the production rate of luxR and the formation rate of the complex are different in each cell. The quorum sensing system can simulate different responses with the same cells and different parameters, if we could control the LuxR production rate. However, we could not envision a method of doing this experimentally.  We aim to make cells that are genetically identical but still can respond differently. Therefore, we designed another system that could help us create this response downstream of the quorum sensing mechanism.  The two systems were tested in the lab parallel with the modeling.
Why Include a Subpopulation System?
Since the quorum sensing mechanism could not provide the subpopulations we desired using genetically identical cells, we created a system that could act downstream of quorum signalling  to provide the response we needed. Population-wide Cry toxin overexpression is likely to kill all E. coli cells in the first moment of toxin expression. Since this would only affect one of the subpopulations, the second subpopulation would be able to initiate a new growth phase after death of the toxin-producing cells. The critical requirement for this is that cells respond at different times to the quorum stimuli despite being genetically identical. A small part of the population that acts differently from the rest of the population is called a subpopulation. The subpopulation system consist of two genes; the first encodes for the protein that inhibits the systems expression, the other encodes for the corresponding activation protein of the system. The 434 cI inactivates the λ"

These will definitely have lower efficiency than the other plates, and will be ready a day later, but will hopefully yield at least a few colonies.  Put into incubator around 6:30 pm along with a control plate that was triple dropout supplemented with tryptophan in the same manner.
Planning to run a test of activator parts on Friday.  Will build the test of our repressors into Test #2 instead. Thus, we have decided to make the following transformations for Test #2:
1. pRS304* added to the pRS305 + pRS306 strain in W3031a
2.
Transformations:
Note that we have received the specified parts from Smolke.  This includes a plate of the W3031_alpha strain that has GAL2 knockout, as well as the plasmid that contains the G418 gene.  Now it will be necessary to order primers for the GAL2 gene (the sequences for the primers were also provided by Smolke) so that we can make a PCR product using the G418 as template to create the proper knockout DNA.  We can then apply this.  We will also need to order G418 for growing all of our new strain of GAL2 knockouts
-Put transformation plates in the 37C incubator at 2:15AM after finishing all my laundry.

Not critical:
Make activator test media:
SD-Leu-Ura with glucose
SD-Leu-Ura with galactose
(autoclave w/o sugar @ 20mL below final vol, then add filter sterilized sugar)
Order primers for Gal2ko
Order oligos & SacI (or borrow enzyme from wessel)to make sticky ends to get constitutive TEF promoter
and/or
Redo PCR
Plan further ligations with any successful ligations in mind
 
Grow overnight miniprep cultures of parts for all yeast transformations
and/or if there is enough"

NAWI-Graz,2016,Team:NAWI-Graz#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," less than €2,-  Even our forefathers did kind of genetic engineering. For sure they did not use our methods, but they always cultivated the best and biggest plants for the next year crops, as well as, mixed different plants to create something new and probably better.
NMS St. Leonhard
On May 3 we got the chance to visit a “New Middle School” (NMS) in Graz. We were talking about iGEM and Synthetic Biology in all grades (from 1st to 4th). For this reason, we separated in two groups of 2/3 and visited 2 classes at a time. The lesson started with a small introduction to synthetic biology and genetic engineering, in a child-appropriate manner. We compared DNA and genes to a recipe and tried to keep it as simple as possible. The kids were very attentive and curious. Some of them also had an impressive knowledge about the topic. They asked us questions about Genetic Fingerprinting and inheritance.  After the theoretical part, we did our DNA extraction from strawberries again. The enthusiasm was huge and some kids told us they wish to become biologists, like we are. It was an awesome experience and we will never forget the excitement in the kid’s eyes.
Spritzerstand
After bringing the subject closer to the general public at “Lange Nacht der Forschung” and to kids by teaching at NMS, we tried to figure out the best way to get our university and especially students from all departments involved. It did not take long and we came up with the idea of a “Spritzerstand” on June 16. Spritzer is very popular among young people here in Austria, as it is wine mixed with sparkling water. We also added some flavour like raspberry and elder. Around the “Spritzerstand” we placed posters and further information about our project. The students were very curious and interested in what we are doing. It was a great success and it had exactly the effect we wanted because people were spending hours talking, drinking and discussing science!
Sturmstand
After the great success of our “Spritzerstand” in summer, we thought about doing a similar thing in fall. In Austria it is very popular to drink must, grape juice during fermentation. Especially in fall must in combination with sweet chestnuts is a lovely thing. For this reason, we planned a must event (like the spritzer event) on October 18. It is a great chance for us to present the results of our project to fellow students and to continue spreading the idea of iGEM among young people.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". Carl Johan also thought that the use of a spectrophotometer or a plate reader should be considered since it would allow the amount of cells that turn red to be measured. If it would be possible, the plating of the cells would be avoided. It would however be more expensive. An advantage of using a plate is the ease of analysis since it does not require additional instrumentation.
Consulting with Prof. Per Sunnerhagen
To learn more about the mating process and the ADE2 gene and how it affects the colour of the cells, an email conversation with Prof. Per Sunnerhagen at University of Gothenburg was initiated.
He explained that he did not believe oxygen limitation to be a problem since the mating process is not particularly oxygen demanding. Additionally, he mentioned the possibility to see the difference in colour of the cells, in liquid media, if the cell density is high enough. He was not aware of the ability of a spectrophotometer to detect the red colour but gave the advice that ADE2 mutants accumulates a polymer of aminoimidazoleribotide which generates a red-orange fluorescent that can easily be seen in a microscope. That ADE2 mutant fluorescence could be helpful both for designing the prototype but also in the lab, where it might be difficult to distinguish the red colour in a colony if only a few of the cells are stained.
Contact with PExA
In addition to consulting experts, the Swedish market was researched since all inputs are beneficial when developing a suitable screening strategy and prototype for the project. The goal was to find companies and professionals working within the field that could aid in modifying and improving the idea. One company that the iGEM team came in contact with was PExA (Particles in Exhaled Air). The company works with sampling small particles from exhaled air.
Founded in 2014, PExA is a company that have created a new method to collect particles from the lungs. The company divides the method into two big parts, sampling and analysis of particles. The sampling device is non-invasive and easy to use. The patient exhales repeatedly into a mouthpiece connected to the machine and the exhaled particles are then collected on a membrane. Each sample usually consists of ~20% proteins and ~80% phospholipids, which are used for analysis. The machine is today involved in different research projects for example the search for new biomarkers for early detection of lung diseases.
Since they are experts in the area of breath analysis and sampling correlated to sickness, a contact was established with PExA and a study visit was scheduled. The aim of"

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Introductory Lab Sessions (30th June - 27th July)
To train up the members of our team who hadn't experienced lab work before, and to sharpen the skills of the team members who had, our advisers planned a period of introductory lab sessions. These experiments were based around growing cell cultures and making E.coli cells competent whilst making us aware of important lab principles such as handling of equipment, aseptic technique, lab etiquette, etc. Please see calendar below:

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Denmonstrate.html_-_-_TEXT.html," communicated with the iGEM team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We learned that they detected colorectal cancer through the nitric oxide inducible promoter PyeaR, and at that time we were having trouble using nitric oxide to drive PnorV to transcribe our reporter. So, we also tested the effect of PyeaR (BBa_K381001) in the Distribution Kit (Figure 3).
We also tested the response of BBa_K381001 to NO in the Distribution Kit (Figure 3).
We transformed the plasmid containing BBa_K381001 into DH5α, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to OD = 0.4. Then we took half as control and the other half added SNP aqueous solution and induced at 37 ℃ for 6 h. Then we detected the fluorescence using a microplate reader and a fluorescence microscope (Figure 4). We can see that PyeaR can also be effectively activated by NO with almost no leakage. In the future, we will compare the performance of PyeaR and PnorV in depth.
Histogram of GFP fluorescence: LB control, without SNP, with 100μM SNP. B, GFP fluorescence image from top to bottom: without SNP, with 100μM SNP.
In conclusion, we have confirmed that the NO sensor in E. coli we built capable of responding to chemically produced nitric oxide in vitro. And we believe that as a naturally NO response mechanism in E. coli, the NO sensor we construct will also work in vivo.

2 Transport and Production
At the beginning of the experiment, we directly constructed the plasmids of YebF-IL10 and YebF-myrosinase, but the effect of extracellular detection was not satisfactory. During the participation in CCiC, iGEMer suggested that we first start from testing the performance of the secretory tag YebF, so we constructed the plasmid YebF-GFP shown in Figure 5A. To express IL10 and myrosinase, we constructed plasmids IL10-flag and myrosinase-his as shown in Figure 5B and Figure 5C.

So, while the solution exists and is unique according to the Lax-Milgram theorem, if $\lambda\neq\mu$, we have found it and \[ \forall(z,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2,~G(z,t)~=~\left(\frac{\mu(1-z)-(\mu-\lambda z)e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}{\lambda(1-z)-(\mu-\lambda z)e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}\right)^{N_0} \quad(\star)\] and for all time $t$, $P_N(t)$ is the coefficient before $z^N$ in the previous expression.
Coefficient of Variation $\star\star$
In this small part, we will just try to have an idea of the influence of the value of $\lambda$ and $\mu$ on the probability. To do that, we calculate the mean and the variance of population size. Actually, while we consider a discrete probability, \[ m(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{n p_n(t)} = \ldots = N_0 e^{(\lambda-\mu)t} \] and by a similar calcul, if $\lambda\neq\mu$, \[ V(t) = N_0\frac{\lambda+\mu}{\lambda-\mu}e^{(\lambda-\mu)t}(e^{(\lambda-\mu)t}-1) \]
Unlike $m(t)$, $V(t)$ depend not only on the difference between the birth and the death rates, but also on their absolute magnitudes. This is what we should expect, because predictions about the future size of a population will be less precise if birth and death occur in rapid succession than if they occur only occasionally.
We define the coefficient of variation $\displaystyle CV(t)~:=~\frac{\sqrt{V(t)}}{m(t)}$ which qualify the variation of the system and we will study the effect of the relative values of $\lambda$ and $\mu$. \[ \begin{array}{rcl}    \forall\lambda\neq\mu,~\forall t, CV(t) &=& {\displaystyle\sqrt"

Abstract
Every year plastic industry produces 40 billion tons of PET. Unintentionally, a large amount of this PET finds its way into the ocean in consequence of inappropriate waste disposal or detachment of plastic in apparel in washing machines. Degradation of plastics on the beaches results due to surface embrittlement and micro cracking, yielding micro particles that are carried into water"

Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.  Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

TALEs
Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are naturally occurring proteins that bind to DNA. These proteins are found in Xanthomonas species, a plant pathogen, and originally serve as a pathogenic factor. However recently we have discovered the modular property of TALEs which make them particularly amenable to genetic engineering and customization.
We have engineered a TALE that binds to the shiga toxin II gene, Stx2 in E. coli and other entero-haemorrhagic bacteria.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,") cells was largely increased after this procedure. The depicted SEM image shows two BAP-receptor transfected MEXi cells which have a cluster of magnetic streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads at their cellular interface. At the border of the cells the superimposed fluorescence image of these cells shows red fluorescence located at the periphery of the cells indicating the presence of mRuby3 fluorescent protein at the cellular membrane. The green fluorescence is caused by biotinylated eGFP that was used for other preparations on the same microscopic slide and came into contact with these cells when the suspension cells were sedimented on the microscopic slide by centrifugation. Although for a reliable conclusion one would have to evaluate several such images this figure already gives a valuable evidence that the BAP-receptor is present on the cells (although perhaps at lower levels) and can bind to strepavidin that was conjugated to the beads.
Procaryotic receptor constructs
Design of an autotransporter construct for bacterial surface display
Besides the design of biotinylated and biotin-binding receptors for eukaryotic cells, we also wanted to apply our biotINK approach for prokaryotic cells. For this purpose, we designed an autotransporter device that is able to present biotinylated or biotin-binding protein domains on the surface of E. coli. Constructs for bacterial surface display are hereby already well known in the field of protein engineering of therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies. There, they are used to screen libraries of different antibodies concerning their affinity towards a given therapeutic target.
We based our design on the autotransporter EspP [4] .
The autotransporter system itself is established and functional (see Fig. A [5] ), and here we ""bricked"" it down into RFC[10] and RFC[25] BioBricks. At first we tested different inducible bacterial promoter systems (e.g. ""TetR repressed GFP""; BBa_K577893 ) that are available in the parts registry, but when we saw that two of the available systems did not work in our own hands, we decided to built the system on our own. We used the Tet-Repressor generator that was available on the distribution plates ( BBa_I739001 ) as we believe that it is very important for the standardization in SynBio to use available parts. Downstream of this repressor generator we designed and fused a BioBrick ( BBa_K2170141 ) that encodes a double Tet-Operator (Tet-Repressor binding site together"

Because of the time limit no statistically significant values could be gained and the achieved data is not shown.  Further experiments have to be conducted to determine the RFP interference (e.g. using a counting chamber) and in case of the separation assay one should probably refrain from utilizing RFP expressing strains.

#2 - Speed Improvement
The goal of our group was to enhance the motility of E. coli in order to allow them to reach their targets more efficiently in later applications. This also results in a a faster selection of our Homing Coli and quick generation of results. The BioBricks we designed are therefore primarily directed at flagellum efficiency or number. We selected five different genes that were tested along our project in different strains. E. coli strain BL21 was used as our main object of research because this is a typical lab-strain and therefore usually not very motile. Our goal was to find a way to accelerate BL21 E. coli by transforming them with our constructs. Here is an overview of the genes we tested and the corresponding results.

Riboregulator
In bacteria, several factors affect translation initiation, including ribosomal recognition of the mRNA’s RBS and the start codon (AUG). Recognizing the importance of RNA interactions between the ribosome and RBS, and based on work on endogenous riboregulators, Isaacs et al. [ 8 ] sought to regulate bacterial gene expression by interfering with ribosomal docking at the RBS. From the outset, their objective was to create a modular post transcriptional regulation system that could be integrated into biological networks and implemented with any promoter or gene.
Figure 10. taRNA/RBS (riboregulator) regulated expression of protein 3. Genes 1 and 2 are on the conjugative plasmid present in all cells. S1: signal molecule. Gene 3 is present on the SDP. RBS: ribosome binding site. Cr: piece of RNA strand in front of RBS that is complementary to RBS. taRNA: trans-activating RNA, could also be small interference RNA, as long as it is complementary to cr. Product 3: Could be either GFP/luciferase (for testing) or endonuclease.
Either gene 1 or gene 2 is constitutively expressed (never both!) where the other is inducible. In the picture, gene 2 is constitutive and gene 1 is inducible by signal molecule S1. Gene 2 expresses constitutively the crRNA, on which the cr part of the RNA binds the RBS directly after transcription, causing RBS to be blocked for the ribosome and therefore blocks the RNA from translation. When the promoter of gene 1 is induced by S1, it produces the taRNA molecule which is complementary to the cr part of the crRNA. When the taRNA binds the crRNA it opens the RBS, which makes the crRNA ready for translation. The resulting product (the green folded protein 2) can then induce gene 3 to produce end-product"

The first term in each equation is a diffusion term. Diffusion smooths out edges of an initial condition, eventually  it leads to an even distribution.  The initial condition in the diffusion simulation is rectangular the illustrate the   smoothing. Another important part of the two first equations which model bacteria density is the logistic growth term.  The video which visualizes logistic growth starts with a Gaussian distributed initial condition, which is more realistic   then the rectangular initial condition used in the diffusion term simulation.
The most important term is the chemotaxis term $\bigtriangledown (P(B,H,R) \bigtriangledown R)$. It is simulated in conjuction  with diffusion. The evening out of the diffusion term leads to acceptable solutions throughout a wider parameter range.  However, the result shown in the video is not satisfactory. No chemicals are"

Reactions and Mechanism
1.Mechanism
The model for enzyme action, first suggested by Brown and Henri but later established more thoroughly Michaelis and Menten, suggests the binding of free enzyme to the substrate forming a enzyme-substrate(ES) complex. This complex undergoes a transformation, releasing product and free enzyme. The free enzyme is then available for another round of binding to new substrate.
In the single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions, the mechanism is often written as:
And the Michaelis-Menten equation is:
(2) Kinetics of multi substrates enzyme catalyzed reactions
We apply two mechanisms of kinetics of multi substrates enzyme catalyzed reactions to our modeling section, one is Theorell-Chance bi-bi (T-C bi-bi), the other is Ping-pong bi-bi.
Sequential bi-bi reaction means that all substrates must bind to the enzyme before any reaction takes place. Now we take two substrates as an example. In sequential bi-bi reaction, a ternary complex is formed when both substrates bind to the enzyme. But the complex is not steady and two products release after new covalent bonds are formed and old covalent bonds are broken in the complex.
Sequential bi-bi reaction can be random or ordered. The random sequential bi-bi means that any substrate can bind first to the enzyme and any product can release first. The ordered sequential bi-bi means that the substrates bind to the enzyme and the products release in a specific order.
T-C bi-bi reaction is a kind of the ordered sequential bi-bi reactions. Now we take two substrates as an example again. The characteristic of T-C bi-bi is that two products can release in a flash because of the extreme instability of the ternary complex. The allosteric process is not obvious.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," shocked the DH5alpha with the hot water bath in Dr. Griffitts lab instead of the one in ours. We hope to harvest the plasmid on Friday.
3/29/13
CH 3/29/2013 More discussion of where our project is going. Redid the transformation with help from Jordan. RESULT: No contamination issues. The transformation rate was very high. Two colonies were streaked to singles and grown up in overnight cultures (LB Amp) in preparation for a mini prep.
KK March 29, 2013 Bad news: our transformations were infected by who knows what type of bacteria. It wasn’t the LB, because the solution was clear on wednesday and was clear today as well. The tips were autoclaved. We think the plates we used may not have been completely sterile. So today we did the transformation again with 1 microliter plasmid and 50 microliters of DH5alpha. It is about the last of the plasmid we have to use. Jordan supervised the transformation to ensure it went well. He made a few new plates of LB-AMP just today so he’s confident they are sterile. NOTE: during the transformaiton we again had issues with the temperature of the hot-shock plate. The reading was 42 degrees C but our thermometer showed that the true temperature was lower. We increased the temperature of the hot plate to 46 degrees and the thermometer read the correct temperature for the protocol. So, there was no error in our procedure today. Jordan plated the E.Coli on two plates, each plate with a different volume of E.Coli, because he didn’t know how dilute the plasmid was in solution.
On Monday we will present a 30 minute report on how our research is going. I’m going to research over the weekend the bacteriophage Lambda. We won’t be able to use T4 or T7 in our cholera activated E.Coli construct because neither is a lysogenic phage. Both are lytic :( that only means that we won’t be able to unite our project to the other group’s project so seamlessly.
GREAT NEWS: Dr. Reidl of the University of Graz returned our correspondence and is going to be extremely generous with us. He will send us his K139 cholera phage that we asked for AND biofilm-producing cholera AND more, including a o-antigen knockout strain of cholera that Reidl’s lab engineered. Exciting!

Thought and inspiration
(Read more) There are some amazing thought experiments. We assumed many results for our projects and considered the future of mix-reality cell. These thought experiments revealed why we want to design such a new life form. And they also pushed us to discover life's mysteries. Our ideas may be a little crazy, but these ideas all are our understandings for life science.
