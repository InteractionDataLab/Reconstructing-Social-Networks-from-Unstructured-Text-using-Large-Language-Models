This interface displays a visual of their chip with controls to open or close valves, set a dispense rate for any given dispenser, or increment the dispensed liquid volume one unit of resolution at a time with only the click of a button. Through this page, a user may change the preset specs of each servo-syringe combination if he or she decides to change their setup. The control feature may be used to control any device using hardware formatted for use in Neptune regardless of the current project being designed to enable quick control adaption to different project environments. It is also through the control page that the user will establish connection to the arduino so that commands may be sent to pumps to operate valves and dispensers.
3DuF Integration | Becca Wolf
3DuF is a microfluidic design CAD tool which is part of a project led by Josh Lippai (see mentor section below for further details). We decided to leverage the JSON visualization features which 3DuF has to offer in Neptune to display a visual of the user’s chip for intuitive interaction with valves and dispensers on their microfluidic device in Neptune’s Control user interface. 3DuF is integrated into Neptune’s front end operation to this end. 3DuF’s version upkeep within Neptune is designed to handle the primitive features which are used in chip design bu Fluigi (see mentor section below) outputs.
Neptune-Arduino Integration | Johan Ospina & Becca Wolf
Neptune can be used to operate the valves and dispensers of a microfluidic chip through an Arduino Mega. In order to be able to send commands to the arduino to be interpreted and acted upon by firmware, Neptune opens a serial communication connection with the port the arduino is connected to. This is done quite simply by the user through the Control page and is as simple as selecting the port and pushing the “Connect” button. Neptune will then send commands specified by the user in the Control page to the arduino through UART.
Firmware-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf
The way in which Neptune communicates to the Arduino Mega which powers the control of the microfluidic chip is standardized throughout the Neptune UI-firmware interaction. Commands are sent to the arduino through the Neptune Control page in the form of an 8-digit code where the first 4 digits indicate the index of the pin on the arduino which the servo-syringe combination is connected to, and the last 4 digits indicate a PWM value which indicates the position which the servo should rotate"

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!

Network Elements
SmoColi can be divided into different network elements: the major sub-networks being a sensor, a band-pass filter and a quorum sensing mechanism.
Cigarette smoke contains a lot of different toxic and carcinogenic components. In nature there are many sensors for such components, mostly to induce their degradation. One is the acetaldehyde system in aspergillus nidulans: the activator AlcR binds to its operator site if acetaldehyde is present [1] . Another one is the xylene sensing system in Pseudomonas putida [2] working as an activator. Since our system is constructed in a modular fashion an can be coupled with any sensor, an arabinose sensing system was established as a proof of principle. We combined a smoke-sensitive band-pass filter with GFP output with a quorum-sensing based mechanism alarming the user at high smoke levels by expressing RFP.

They will tell you that your package must adhere to IATA regulations, but according to section 3.6.2.2.3.1 of IATA’s Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) manual (and according to section 8.1 of ANVISA’s Manual for Shipment of Biological Materials), exempt biological materials do not need to adhere to any specific shipping package regulations. The package regulations they claim are necessary basically consists of: two layers of leak-proof packaging, with an outer layer of a sturdy material such as a cardboard box. Although it isn’t necessary, we recommend following these guidelines just for good measure, specially since the shipping materials iGEM provides already meet the criteria (leak-proof layer 1: the sealed plate; leak-proof layer 2: the ziplock bag; sturdy layer: the cardboard box)."
Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," encoded by Ena1 [1,2]. Knocking this gene out is the first big step to avert the efflux      of sodium out of the cell. Ena1 is crucial for the cell´s sodium efflux ability[3]. Therefore, the cell gets sensitive for salty media, because it loses a big amount of its natural capability      for salt tolerance [4,3].
- The H+/Na+ antiporter, encoded by the Nha1 gene can extrude Na+, Li+ and K+ using the proton gradient over the plasma membrane [5,6]. The Nha1 gene knockout should have a similar effect to      the Ena1 knockout, denying the efflux of ions out of the cell.
Fig.4: yeast cell with ENA1 and NHA1 knocked out
- Through overexpression of natural yeast Na+, K+/H+ exchanger we aim to strengthen and accelerate the ion- influx from the cytosol into intracellular compartments like the vacuole.      The protein encoded by the NHX1 gene in S. cerevisiae naturally transports sodium into prevacuolar compartments [7,8]. The VNX1- antiporter exchanges Na+ and K+ with H+ from the vacuole      and is located in the vacuolar membrane [9].
Fig.5: yeast cell with ENA1 and NHA1 knocked out and VNX1 und NHX1 overexpressed.
As previously stated, we want to sequestrate ions using the native salt response of our cells. In order to support and reinforce this system, we introduced parts of the salt-tolerance      mechanism of Arabidopsis Thaliana.
- In Arabidopsis thaliana, the proton electrochemical gradient across the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) is partially generated by a vacuolar membrane bound H+-pyrophosphatase, which      is only encoded by a single gene, AVP1 [10]. The expression in yeast elevates the translocation of protons into the cellular vacuole [8]. This increased proton-influx in general leads      to a higher ion accumulation through H+-syn- and antiporters [11–13].
Fig.6: yeast cell with ENA1 and NHA1 knocked out and VNX1 und NHX1 overexpressed.AVP1 is integrated into the vacuolar membrane and increases the proton gradient over the membrane.
- In Arabidopsis thaliana the Na+/H+ antiporter AtNHX1 mediates the import of not only Na+, but also K+"

This complex then becomes a translation factor to Plux promoter and expression of downstream ccdB gene is activated. Accumulation of ccdB protein result in subsequent suicide. Therefore, when the population size of E. coli rises pass the threshold level, ccdB proteins are induced by AHL to restrict the population size.

A,B Device
A (Low-temperature control system)
J23101+RBS(BBa_k115002)+tetR+terminator
The theoretical switching temperature of RBS BBa_k115002 was designed by Team TUDelft in 2008 is 37°C. Thus, our thermosensing device A can be induced at this temperature. (The switching temperature can be modified by changing RBS according to different conditions.) While being cultured above 37°C, BBa_k115002 is supposed to be induced. Once swiched on, tetR will inhibit the corresponding promoter, pTet, which enables us to regulate the expression of cry gene and quorum sensing gene devices. In the mosquito-infested areas below 37°C, device A will not work after spreading, resulting in the production of cry proteins, AHL, and LuxR proteins.
B (Cry weapon system)
pTet+RBS+cry+RBS+GFP+terminator
The ""crystal protein producing device"", B, works below37°C and produces the crystal protein. It can be repressed by the aforementioned thermosensing device A. Low-temperature  control system A. In order to  test the function of A and pTet, we constructed B with GFP (green fluorescence  protein) gene behinds cry gene. With  the expression of green fluorescence protein, the function of A and promoter  pTet can be verified.

Another consideration was the effect of the cry protein on E. coli production.  Accumulation of these proteins may affect their growth, therefore, we use the tetR  gene, followed with a 37°C induced RBS, as inhibitor for the cry gene expression. At the incubation temperature of 37°C, the RBS activates and tetR inhibit Ptet, which then inhibits the expression of cry gene. Only after we spread the E. coli to wriggler infested areas, temperatures drop below 37°C and Ptet inhibition is released, resulting in cry protein production.                          The next consideration was how to effectively control our E. coli population. To address population"

EtnR1 and EtnR2 are the only genes of unknown function in the well-characterised ethylene metabolism operon.
The regulation of the genes responsible for ethylene degradation is also unknown. This may suggest that EtnR1 and EtnR2 are involved in regulating this process.
EtnR1 and EtnR2 are highly conserved across ethylene-oxidising Mycobacterium.
All other ethylene-oxidising mycobacterial strains such as Mycobacterium rhodesiae NBB3, rhodesiae JS60 and tusciae JS617 contain homologues of EtnR1 and EtnR2 in similar positions in alkene monooxygenase clusters, that have highly conserved residues:

These EtnR1 and EtnR2 homologues all share >70% amino acid identity. Homologues in bacteria that do not oxidise ethylene, on the other hand, only share ~50% or less amino acid identity. Furthermore, Mycobacterium strains that do not oxidise ethylene lack any homologues of EtnR1 and EtnR2.
Two-component regulatory systems are commonly used in bacterial gene regulation.
Typically, this involves a membrane-bound histidine protein kinase (which we suspect to be EtnR2), which responds to environmental stimuli by autophosphorylating and self-activation, before phosphorylating a response regulator protein (Stock et al. 2000). This activates the response regulator (which we suspect to be EtnR"

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," receding significance of nation states on a economic and social level.
Uncertainty: ""A situation in which, given current knowledge, there are multiple possible future outcomes"" (Gross 2010: 3).
Upstream:""Public participation before significant research and development has taken place and before establishment of firm public attitudes or social representations about an issue"" (Pidgeon and Rogers-Hayden 2007: 191)
Conceptual Framework: The Governance Challenges of Synthetic Biology
What is often characteristic of new and emerging technologies and their associated governance measures is that they show a higher degree of scientific uncertainty, and appear to cross various borders. This is what Zhang et al. (2011) have pointed out to be especially true for synthetic biology as it puts an even stronger emphasis on these governance challenges for modern science. The main reasons for this is that, on the one hand, the uncertainty comes from the lack of predictability and awareness of increasing 'non-knowing' with regard to the technology, and on the other hand, the 'cross-borderness' related to various interconnecting aspects of synthetic biology (Zhang et al 2011).
At the core of assessing synthetic biology as a discipline which involves scientific uncertainty is the premise that this new and emerging technology is still at the beginning stage of trying to understand how things actually work and how they will affect society. This is a factor that needs to be taken into account since it implies that talking about synthetic biology in terms of risk is still something that is out of reach as risks are about having the necessary knowledge and tools to actually determine how great the risk is. To do this for synthetic biology cannot yet be done with full certainty considering that its scientific practices possess certain properties that make the calculability of risks considerably more difficult. Making a prediction of how a synthetic microorganism would behave does not become more manageable even if a new genetic circuit and its parts are well understood. Unforeseen and unintended consequences to health and the environment thus go broader than the concept of risk which cannot even be controlled by research institutions with considerable legitimacy. The issue of governance for synthetic biology therefore is more about ""regulating the implications of uncertainty, ignorance and indeterminacy"", rather than regulating what can be known through risk management assessments (Zhang et al. 2011: 8-9).
The uncertainty challenge becomes even greater when synthetic biology is discussed in terms of dual-use implications, where a civilian use of the technology can be translated into military ends. In the life sciences, risk as such already poses a difficult question as self-replicating qualities of biological systems mean that it becomes"
UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," The flasks were incubated at 28°C at 100rpm for 64 hours. Growth was observed by OD 600nm twice a day.
Result: Poor growth was observed across all groups which implicates that a co-culture on BG-11 alone would ultimately fail (Fig. 5). This suggests that another medium composition is needed - maybe even a combination of different media.
----------------
Question: Can B.subtilis grow in ATCC, CSE and C minimal media with and without 30 mM sucrose?
Experiment: Two experiments were made. First, B. subtilis was inoculated in 100mL ATCC medium that was supplemented with 30mM sucrose in a 250mL baffled flask. The cells were grown for a week at 28°C at 100rpm and OD at 600nm were measured twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. Also both C minimal medium and CSE minimal medium were tested, with and without supplemented 30mM sucrose under the same conditions. Second time, the experiment for ATCC had the same set-up. However, the cells were now grown for 22 days, and the medium was changed every fourth day. OD at 600nm was measured every second day. Contamination testing was carried out by plating out 250μL of the cell culture out on a LB plate without any antibiotics. The plate were dried and stored in a 30°C incubator overnight, and the plates were investigated.
Result: To find the right minimal medium for B. subtilis three different minimal medium was tested. These are C minimal medium, CSE minimal medium and ATCC medium. After inoculation, the OD was measured to obtain the growth of the bacterium in the different media. CSE minimal medium supplemented with 30mM has the best growth of B. subtilis over a time range of 117 hours (Fig. 6). Already in the early time period this medium showed superior growth compared to the other two media tested. However, when we checked for contamination we discovered that the CSE minimal medium had been contaminated by another organism that was not B. subtilis (data not shown), meaning that the data for CSE minimal medium could not be trusted. This left C minimal medium and ATCC medium.
C minimal medium showed a constant level of B. subtilis growth until hour 117th. However, at this point, the medium began to be the same yellow colour as for CSE minimal medium. This lead to the ATCC medium that did not"

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Basic Flip Flop#Modeling#Multiagent System_-_-_TEXT.html,"lace), a fantastic information source. We have considered the next measures to model the bacterium.
E. Coli schematics measures
To use these dimensions in the “NetLogo’s patch world” (where the world is made of a grid of stationary agents called patches) we have taken as reference the size of a standard protein (5 nm) ) and adjusted the sizes in order to get that every patch has the same size of a protein with this features. This way, the whole world is made of a grid of 400 x 160. As we have taken a layer with a thickness of only 5nm, we have scaled the typical ammount of several molecules (like ribosomes or RNAps) accordingly (we do that by dividing the numbers by 120, corresponding with the number of patches that theorically would measure the high of an E.Coli).
Once we click setup, we can see several molecules. To initiate a simulation just click on go.
What can we see?
On the left we can see several genes (one couple of genes by default), represented by lines.
The longer genes are LacI genes (Repressor 1), while the shorter ones represent c1ts genes (Repressor2). From now on we will use the terms LacI/Repressor1 and c1ts/Repressor2 indistinctly
Both genes are to scale. In the real bacteria they both would appear in the same plasmid and completely twisted. They both have a promoter at the beginning and a terminator at the end.
After this, we have RNAP (green circles) which can move freely around the cytoplasm until they find a promoter. Once they do it, they have a given chance of starting to transcribe. When they transcribe, they generate a RNAm molecule. When they finish transcription, this RNA molecule will move till stop in a randomly place in the cytoplasm. Each RNAm molecule remains a given time in the cell before it “dies” and disappears; this time is given by a normal distribution with mean of 5 minutes and a standard deviation of 1 minute (by default, but you can change this value to experiment with it).
The big yellow circles represent ribosomes, which move freely around the cytoplasm until they find the Shine-Dalgarno of a RNA. At that moment they start the translation. When they finish, they generate a repressor protein. The size of the ribosomes is also to scale, measuring 20 nm of diameter.
Repressors1, in red in the plots, represent LacI molecules, which"

HUMAN PRATICES
This year we are devoted to degrading antibiotics, which is expected to be applied to waste water treatment plants (WWTPs).  So it is essential for us to communicate with the public and many other stakeholders.
From the Public
We carried an internet-based questionnaire using an online survey tool called SOJUMP (www.sojump.com). We got more 1200 responses in total, which covered a wide range of participants, in terms of their age, field of study and so on. Using these statistics, we were able to analyze people’s knowledge on antibiotic related topics, and in particular, their opinions on our projects.
To the Next Generation
Science popularization is one of the many responsibilities of science majors. It builds a bridge for mutual understanding between scientists and the general public. Some of our team members delivered a wonderful speech to high school students in Beijing. They talked about synthetic biology and our project. The students showed great interests and enthusiasm for synthetic biology, which really impressed us.
With Counterparts
For iGEMers, only working in the lab is far from enough. In order to do our work in a better way, we need to discuss and communicate with others. This year, members from UCAS iGEM met with many excellent teams in China, including Peking University, Tianjin University and so on.
With Industrial Representatives
We are really honored to attend a lecture given by Prof. James Schroeder. Mr. Schroeder is a Penn Alumni and a synthetic biology advisor. At the event Synthetic Biology: China Innovation and Global Bioeconomy, Mr. Schroeder talked about China intellectual property and the opportunity for China to lead the bioeconomy. We also met many representatives from different companies around the world.
CCiC 2016 at SYSU
We attended the CCiC held at Sun-Yet Sen University in Guangzhou. We were happy to meet so many teams and iGEMers from all over China. As a new team, we got some quite helpful advice and general help from many advisors and students.

From the very beginning we have interviewed an expert, Prof. JIA Shiru who specializes in microbial fermentation,for his professional viewpoints and deep understanding about BC. We also did an investigation about the superiority of BC as a wound dressing. Through these work we understood that raising BC yield is an urgent problem to be solved and BC has a lot of good performance that can be exploited and developed. We also went Tianjin university and communicated with team iGEM-Tianjin. We introduced our projects and give suggestions to each other. Besides, we conducted a questionnaire survey to gather information about public acceptance of new BC mask. The result was optimistic. All these works motivated us to figure out a better solution. As we near the end of the project, we visited the factory and asked their views on our project. They thought our work was very meaningful and has been achieved increasing BC production. All of these work has affected and improved our project and every time we had a lot of gains.

THI3 catalyzes the second step in isoamyl alcohol biosynthesis: conversion of α-ketoisocaproate to 3-methylbutanal via enzymatic reaction.α-ketoisocaproate can be converted to isoamyl alcohol which is a precursor to isoamyl acetate (banana odor).
(3) Alcohol acetyltransferase I (banana 3): Alcohol acetyltransferase I is derived from ATF1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ATF1 catalyzes the conversion of isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate. Isoamyl acetate has a banana smell.
Future work
Banana odor biosynthetic system contains BAT2 gene (j45009) and THI3 genes (j45009) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for production of isoamyl alcohol, and ATF1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for production of isoamyl acetate, which has a banana smell. BAT2 encodes a cytosolic branched-chain amino acid transaminase that catalyzes the conversion of leucine to α-ketoisocaproate. THI3 encodes an α-ketoisocaproate decarboxylase that catalyzes the conversion of α-ketoisocaproate to 3-methylbutanal. 3-methylbutanal is reduced to isoamyl alcohol by an NADH-dependent reaction by an alcohol dehydrogenase.  ATF1 catalyzes the conversion of isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate, which has a banana smell.
Conduct “blind smell tests” that is participants have to distinguish between cell cultures producing banana odor and the natural fecal odor of E. coli.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s Mars Oxygen IERSU Experiment (MOXIE), which is able to electrochemically break carbon dioxide to produce oxygen at a rate of 10 g per hour, it is important to note that MOXIE relies on electrical energy to operate and catalyze this reaction. On the other hand, our system, which does not require any external energy source, is able to produce a considerable amount of oxygen, even at its infancy. With more work, possibly by evolving chlorite dismutase to improve its catalytic efficiency, it is possible that we can improve its performance in both efficiency and rate of oxygen production.
However, there are still many limitations in our experiment. Because we performed this experiment in E. coli in vivo, it is possible that the reported results actually underestimate the enzyme’s performance. Because chlorite dismutase is in the cytoplasm and chlorite is added to culture, the chlorite ions must first get through the lipid membrane of the cell into the cytoplasm for the reaction to occur. Given that charged particles have a harder time crossing the lipid membrane, it is possible that the rate of chlorite entry into the cell is slow, limiting the available chlorite within the cytoplasm that can be oxidized by chlorite dismutase. Thus, we need to ensure that the impact of the rate of chlorite transport into the cytoplasm is negligible. Furthermore, it is generally acknowledged that purified proteins will perform better in protein function assays compared to assays performed in whole cells due to possible interference from other cellular components. Additionally, our rate measurement is calculated as the average rate of oxygen production over the 20 minute duration of the experiment. Thus, we need to replicate this experiment with more time points, as well as using different substrate concentrations to ensure reproducibility and determine the kinetic parameters of chlorite dismutase (i.e., kcat and KM).

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," extremely challenging for synthetic biologists to incorporate this process into their workflow.
The two primary advantages that TERRA has over this system are flexibility and cost. TERRA costs less than $400 and is manufactured via accessible means such as 3D printing. TERRA accomplishes this low-cost price point by taking a DIY approach to automating microfluidic experiments. While the LHS system is more precise, TERRA is designed for researchers to perform a wider array microfluidic experiments. In terms of chip flexibility, TERRA can run a wider variety of both microfluidic experiments and types of microfluidic chips by way of the TERRA adapter. Therefore, chips with fabricated commercially as well as the MakerFluidics workflow can be integrated into TERRA. This increases the design space for microfluidic experiments for synthetic biologists.
TERRA’s largest flaw is the complexity of dispensing a wide variety of sample volumes. Currently, continuous flow microfluidics is the most compatible with our system. Using our current size tubing of (0.0625 inches or 1.6mm) , the average droplet dispensed is 48 μL, so volumes that are multiples of the average droplet size are easy to dispense. If the desired volume is smaller or in multiples of this designation, droplet-based microfluidics must be used to dispense that volume accurately. Through this method, the 48 μL droplet that dispensed from the nozzle is part sample and part mineral oil. The proportions of these liquids can be manipulated through flow rate and microfluidic chip design to achieve the desired volume.
Though our modeling experiments were able to discern that changing either the diameter or material of the tubing should also change the size of the droplet dispensed from the nozzle. Given more time, we would have provided TERRA with the functionality to allow the user would have greater control over their experiment by choosing certain nozzle tubing based on combinations of material and diameter. This type of control would be similar to selecting end mills or drill bits in machining.
Impacts of TERRA
A major impact of TERRA is how it both automates and incorporates microfluidics into pre-existing workflow of synthetic biology experiments . Once a microfluidic experiment is set up on TERRA and the UI, it can be left to run unattended, leaving the researcher free to work on other projects while the chip is running. This combined with the flexibility and wide range of microfluidic chips compatible with TERRA make the system easy to incorporate into different workflows.

Most of the day was spent researching previous iGEM teams that have already worked with cholera, quorum sensing, and biofilm degradation. Some of the previous teams projects are very similar to our own, so we are trying to decide whether to proceed with our current plans or to choose something else. Or, if we stick with our current plan, how can we incorporate phage or make our project unique?

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html," cocktail molecular secretado pelas bactérias alvo-patogénicas.
Uma vez junto à bactéria alvo, um módulo genético adicional é activado que conduz à eliminação (morte) do patogénio ou da célula cancerígena. A equipa de Heidelberg investiga duas estratégias diferentes para induzir a morte celular do alvo. A primeira estratégia baseia-se em toxinas bacterianas e  a segunda abordagem introduz viroses especificas para bactérias. Toxinas são normalmente produzidas por certas bactérias para destruir outras bactérias. Porém, algumas destas toxinas são também capazes de destruir células cancerígenas, tornando esta abordagem promissora no campo de investigação do cancro. No sistema teste, a equipa usa informação genética para a produção de toxinas bacterianas. Esta informação é então introduzida na células predadoras (killer) e modificada para que se torne activa apenas na presença das células alvo (prey). Quando alcançam as células alvo, esta activação é iniciada e as células predadoras produzem e libertam a toxina que irá destruir as primeiras.
A segunda abordagem para eliminar as células-alvo usa viroses bacterianas que se sabe naturalmente infectarem bactérias E.coli. Durante a infecção, o fago injecta a sua informação genética na bactéria, forçando-a a produzir novos fagos que serão mais tarde libertados. Fagos livres no meio serão então capazes de infectar outras bactérias criando o chamado efeito dominó: que permite eliminar um elevado número de células-alvo com apenas algumas células predadoras.
Por fim, e somando à investigação experimental no laboratório, uma parte importante do trabalho inclui o desenvolvimento de um modelo computacional para ambos os módulos de detecção e eliminação. As simulações produzidas pelo modelo permitirão prever o comportamento do sistema sob diferentes condições e assim  contribuir positivamente no planeamento de novas experiencias.

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," and a set of output species, the search algorithm returns a subnetwork of operon paths connecting the input species to the output species. Each path within the subnetwork is an operon path that can be used to produce the output species from the input species. In other words, placing operons from a returned operon path as well as the input species into a system can produce the output species.
Biology Captured by the Algorithm
The search algorithm conducts a complex, effective, and robust operon path search over the network representation of the database, ultimately generating single or multiple operon paths connecting a set of input species to a set of output species. A resulting path represents a system that can produce the output species given the input species. Also, each path attempts to capture biological reality by considering two major mechanisms of operon activation (detailed description below).
Robustness and Modularity of the Algorithm
Due to the current number of operons in the database, the search algorithm should scale with the increasing size of the database, which will expand as the synthetic biology community adds more species, operons, and plasmids to the database (see complexity analysis of the algorithm is located below). In addition to this robustness, the search algorithm is easily modifiable since it has been implemented independently from the database and the SBiDer web application. Therefore, the search algorithm can be applied to a broad range of networks. Furthermore, the search algorithm was developed on an open source platform to encourage global collaboration in further optimizing the search algorithm and minimizing the barrier for algorithm improvement. As a result, the database as well as the search algorithm will be easily, effectively, and accurately expanded, extended, and optimized by the global synthetic biology community - together.
Algorithm
Overview of the Algorithm
SBiDer's search algorithm is fundamentally based on multiple breadth first searches (BFS) on the SBiDer database. From a set of input species, the algorithm searches for any operon that can be activated by the input species (see Tutorial for how to format the input query). If such an operon is found, the output species of the activated operon and/or other existing species in the system (details below) is used to search for the next operon. In the process, the search algorithm constructs an operon paths by successively adding activated operons to the path. There are two ways of activating an operon: linear successional activation and nonlinear successional activation (more details below), and the search algorithm can create an operon path using either or both of the activation methods. This search algorithm continues until either: the search"

iGEM kit of InterLab shared by BNDS_China
In the first week of the experiment, we could not begin our Interlab project since we had not received our iGEM kit. At that time, round to July 10th, BNDS_China had completed the Interlab project and there was a plethora of materials left, so we borrowed the kit from them so that we could finish our project before the due.
Help BFSUICC_China
As our team followed the procedure of Interlab, we found that we were specialized in the dilution procedure. We had done an excellent job in the dilution process: the colony of different dilutions had perfectly normal differences, and the efficiency was much high. Therefore, we offered help to the team of BFSUICC_China to dilute the sample. Additionally, after having counted the colony, we helped them to wash the plate.
Help from Team Tsinghua
During July and August, we did our experiment in the next room of Team Tsinghua. Sometimes we shared one facility together, including the gel electrophoresis, the balance, the incubator, and the super clean bench. Team Tsinghua was there to help us at anywhere and anytime. Since we were not familiar with the location of some necessities, they were so active to guide us how to get them. Additionally, when we got something confused or incorrect, they were readily to help us. They reminded us to clean the balance after measuring the weight since we sometimes were a little bit careless when using the balance, they guided us to use their gel electrophoresis device, and they told us many of their lab rules in order to keep us safe.
Modelling Learning with BJRS_China
In August 11, 2018, our team and BJRS_China learned the basic methods to construct modelling of our data online together. We helped mutually to well comprehend the principle rule and solve questions of one another. All of us assimilated the rule of modelling, and by the time we built solid friendship with teammates of BJRS_China.

Their response to our efforts prompted us to reach out to other groups in 15 more countries to further spread our word and evaluate the need for cheaper, more accessible birth control. We also spoke to family members and friends who have lived or traveled abroad to gain additional perspective outside of women's groups that may know more about women's issues than the average citizen.
Outcome
Through our survey and close conversations with people from several countries, we gained a better understanding of the situations and challenges of women around the world. We received over 56 responses to our survey as well as personal testimonies from people regarding their perspective on birth control in their communities.

Jamie, Pediatric Doctor
Jamie is an Australian pediatric doctor. We asked Jamie about her and her patients' experiences with birth control. According to Jamie, ""one of [her] patients would soak a sponge in lemon juice and place it in her vaginal tract to avoid pregnancy because her husband believed condoms were too socially stigmatized with prostitution”. Though prostitution is legal in some parts of Australia, it is still heavily stigmatized along with condom use. We hope to provide women a safe birth control method not associated with prostitution.

Therefore, the addition of His-tag could potentially interfere with the interaction domain and thus the formation of a homodimer, which would be consistent with several reports[4][5][6].  To address this issue, we decided to perform a molecular dynamics simulation using the GROMACS software package[8] on a structure of βHACdH, determined by X-ray crystallography by Leesong et al., 1996[1]. This would allow for the trajectories of the N- and C-Termini of βHACdH over the course of the simulation to be studied, therefore allowing us to identify which terminal would be more suited for His-tag addition.
Installing GROMACS
The Groningen Machine for Chemical Simulation (GROMACS) Version 4.5.5 [8], was installed on a MacBook Pro 2011 model, operating OS X 10.8.3, with a 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 memory, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and a 320 GB SATA disk drive. Prior to installing GROMACS, “command line tools” were installed within Xcode, Version 4.6.1. GROMACS was installed to single precision, with the source file downloaded from www.gromacs.org/Downloads. In addition to GROMACS, the FFTW library, Version 3.3.3[9] was installed, with the source file downloaded from www.fftw.org/download.html.

Clearly, there was not much improvement for either.  Also note that now there is only 18 uL left, since 2 uL was used to do the ligation.
Also decided to transform some of Caroline's parts tonight, seeing as P0501 had been so successful.  It turns out that some of the plasmid solution had stuck to the caps inside the tubes containing them, so that by pounding the tube against the table it was possible to accumulate at least 2 uL of liquid in most cases.  At first, began transformation of all 38 parts, but realized that this was impossible given the amount of plates available in the fridge (50 plates).  Since it was necessary to use two plates per transformation as a safeguard, this would allowfor 23 parts, including two for a positive control and two for a negative control.  Thus, decided to transform the first 20 parts on the list sent by Caroline, which correspond to parts that we hope to use for our tests.  These parts are:

Answering questionnaires about modeling and experimentation of Aalto-Helsinki
Modeling plays a key role in our project and gives us useful predictions on whether our projects will work well. So in synthetic biology, we can say that modeling serves as a crucial link between the idea and realization of an engineered biological system.
In this year, Aalto-Helsinki team survey about modeling. So we, Hokkaido University team, help Aalto-Helsinki team by answering 10 questionnaires on below.
What team are you in?
What is your field of studies?
How long have you been studying?
Is your team doing any modeling? If yes, is there an assigned group for this task?
What kind of roles do you have in your project?
What were your expectations for combining modeling with biology? Was there something surprising?
What guided your model construction? (Your own prior knowledge, a team member's prior knowledge, your own research (research articles etc.), advisor's prior knowledge, other (please specify))
What challenges were there in terms of collaborating between fields?
How did you approach the collaboration challenges? Did you feel your approach worked? Why, why not?
What kind of communication was there between modeling and laboratory practitioners? Were there any challenges in this communication?
How did the modeling efforts have an effect on the wetlab work? If there was no effect, why not?
Do you think that your models depict the real phenomena, or do you treat them rather as mere mathematical tools?
Now that you know better, is there something you would have done differently?
Comments
Modeling is also important for us, so we not only helped to enhance the contents of Human Practice of Aalto-Helsinki team, but had a meaningful opportunity to think of the relationship between Modeling and Biology.

Since laccase takes about 80 days to degrade about 40% of the sample PE, we will also consider integrating a delay module into the alkane metabolism module, inspired by the iGEM team of HKUST 2017. The idea is that the alkane channel and alkane processing proteins will only kick into effect after 80 days of PE breakdown, so as to save cellular resources. The time delay module will be enabled by the phlF inducer, which induces the pHLFp promoter in front of the alkane metabolism genes. Since the genes have a lower RBS strength than that used by the phlF inducer gene, this will create a time delay when producing the alkane metabolism proteins.
6. Primary market research: Listening to our potential users
One of the aims of our public engagement and education exhibition was to find out the major concerns of the general public in choosing sources of renewable energy. This will help us to choose the focus and design our MFC to better suit the public’s concerns and aid in a more user-friendly design. The detailed analysis of our collected data can be found here
The results show that “impacts on human health” and “constraints in the conditions/ requirements for energy production” are the public’s major concerns. There are also concerns with the release of environmental pollutants such as sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid during the production of renewable energy generators. However, survey results show that the public had regarded this issue as less important as the long-term generation of renewable energies are comparatively cleaner than energies from fossil fuels where there are no chemical pollutants generated during energy production. Upon reviewing our MFC system design, the release of CO2 from our MFC will be produced as a by-product during electricity generation, this greenhouse gas, therefore, will still be a pressing issue that the team needs to tackle. Involving the public engagement results into our MFC design, we have set the following design standards/requirements for our MFC:
1. Limit the impacts on human health by limiting users’ interaction with the inner mechanism of our Laccase degradation and MFC system. Chemicals and cell culturing medium should not be harmful to both the environment and humans. This can be done by making the MFC a closed system during operation, where the users need not manually operate the system at any intermediate stage.
2. Focus on reusing or fixing the CO2 that will be released from the respiration of our cell culture to minimize environmental pollution.

Plant Promoter Project
As plants are still novel organisms for most of synthetic biology, we we are interested in developing methods of control for our projects. Currently the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter is the most widely used plant promoter. In hopes of increasing the availability of plant promoters, our project aims at testing viral promoters due to their relative efficiency, as well as cytoskeletal protein promoters due to their natural abundance.  Testing these promoters in parallel with the CaMV 35S will create a plant promoter catalog which can be used for future iGEMers exploration of plant synthetic biology.

Introduction
Synthetic Biology is still a new field with many opportunities for characterization and regulation.  The discovery that DNA could be transferred between organisms occurred in 1946, and the first plant was genetically modified in 1983 (1).  Since then, most synthetic biology has dealt with bacteria rather than plants.  Bacteria are prokaryotic, simple organisms and the procedures for their genetic modification are shorter.  Consequently, eukaryotic organisms, especially plants, have an enormous amount of untapped potential  (2).  Genetic “parts” for plant organisms are limited and often poorly characterized.  Under-developed parts prevent many great scientific ideas for plants from ever getting off the ground.
Among the limitations of working with plants Penn State iGEM noticed that only one promoter was commonly available for expression of proteins in plants: CMV 35s promoter.  Since in Eukaryotic organisms the promoter is currently the primary source of variable expression, a wider variety of characterized promoters would be very useful.  Penn State iGEM aims to modestly characterize several plant promoters for enhanced expression regulation in plant synthetic biology.

Background
Eukaryotic organisms tend to be larger more complex units than prokaryotes.  Some of the differences include the presence of a nucleus, many cytoskeletal elements, and certain genetic devices (1).  The diagram below shows the difference from a synthetic biology perspective (2).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.

Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Experiments
When it comes down to it, SMITe consists of three main components: a spider silk scaffold provided by our sponsors, biofilm-degrading combat proteins and the Sortase A enzyme used to conjugate the one to the other. Our main goals were the expression of functional Sortase A and combat proteins as well as their conjugation to the silk scaffold. Below, you can find an overview of the paths we chose - you can also have a look at our protocols , results or lab books if you’re interested in more details.
Combat Proteins
All of our biofilm-degrading combat proteins were assembled in a similar fashion, allowing for the addition of a linker tag sequence (LT) that would include sequences for both purification of the proteins via Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) and their conjugation to the spider silk using Sortase A.
Assembling our Constructs
Assembly was conducted in two separate steps. First, we used the classic 3A method to assemble our Combat Proteins - defensin, lysostaphin, Nuc and esp - with a T7 promoter. Subsequently, we tested two methods to add the linker tag sequence that was needed for purification and conjugation to the spider silk.
Figure 1: Assembly of combat protein expression constructs
The custom designed LT sequence consists of three elements: a GSSSS linker, a Hisx6 tag for IMAC purification and LPETGG, the C-terminal sequence motif recognized by Sortase A.
Figure 2: Structure of the linker and tags (LT)
Both options rely on a PCR reaction to add a BamHI restriction site to the N-terminus of the combat proteins so that BamHI can be used to ligate the T7-Combat Protein to the LT oligonucleotide. A modified 3A Assembly was used to ligate the T7-Combat Protein fragment with the LT and the pSB1C3 backbone.
Testing Combat proteins
Once our combat proteins were assembled with the promoters, we needed to test whether they were expressed correctly and decided to use a simple SDS-PAGE for that purpose. Subsequently, we tested the combat proteins' activity, purified"

Logical with her decisions (that’s mainly food choices), humour is her strength. A very funny member, she has never failed to make us laugh when things were going south. As for what she wants to do next, Saranya is eyeing neuroscience for her major next year. Beware neuro diseases, you’re going to be extinct soon. Saranya though clumsy and carefree during the college lab sessions, was surprisingly co-ordinated and sincere when it came to iGEM interlab work.

Terpenoids
Implementation on a Platform for Terpenoid Production
The modular design strategy obviously poses a greater advantage to systems aimed at manufacturing related products, such as families of biomolecules, related to each other by common metabolic pathways of production. One such family of biomolecules is terpenoids, also known as isoprenoids, which are a kind of hydrocarbon made up of five-carbon isoprene units, arranged and modified in such a way that all of them share common physical and chemical characteristics and yet also exhibit a wide range of biological properties.  Well-known cases are artemisinin, the drug with the most effective mechanism against malaria-causing P. falciparum, and taxol, a mitotic inhibitor used in chemotherapeutic cancer treatments. Both of them are produced in plants (a fern-like shrub and the bark of a tree, respectively), but their yields are usually low and the demand for their medical use is significantly high. Other examples include lycopene, the precursor in tomatoes for beta-carotene, and limonene, which is present in most cosmetic products distributed nowadays.  The biological pathway through which terpenoids are synthesized in eukaryotes is the mevalonate pathway, which includes a series of molecular transformations from Acetyl-CoA to isopentenyl-5-pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate. These isomeric molecules are the common precursors for all terpenoid molecules. A bioengineering approach for terpenoid production involves using the mevalonate pathway and the appropriate synthases in order to end up with the desired molecule. The yeast P. pastoris already uses the mevalonate pathway, but it has been reported that the HMG-CoA reductase involved in its rate-limiting step is heavily regulated. This can be bypassed by a reported N-terminus truncation that renders it still functional but increases the total yield of the process.  Applying the aforementioned modular biofactory design strategy to this model, it is possible to implement a biological platform for the synthesis of terpenoids. Using the production of lycopene as a proof of concept, the separate genes required include the truncated HMG-CoA reductase, GGPP synthase (CrtE), phytoene synthase (CrtB), and phytoene desaturase (C"

Streamlined mass action model
We met with Thomas Ouldridge again after the previous model and he showed us how we could combine many steps of the reaction to slim our model down to just 4 parameters and 5 species, as well as giving us some more accurate parameters for our system.
With fewer parameters it was much easier to see the effect that varying each parameter has, and thus draw meaningful conclusions from the relationship between the parameters and GFP output.
Given the knowledge of the system that we had, it was reasonable to incorporate:
the GFP maturation into ktranslation
the opening of the toehold switch into the binding of the miRNA
We used mass action kinetics to model the decay of the RNAs and the opening of the toehold switch, however we modelled transcription and translation such that DNA and the open switches weren’t used up. We assumed the pool of resources was constant, as our construct would not significantly deplete the cell free extract’s resources. [6]
We also made the assumption that our inducible promoter could be modelled as a constitutive one. Given arabinose concentration is constant and the assumption that the time taken to induce the promoter was negligible, no changes to the way transcription was modelled were necessary, other than neglecting resource degradation. This was confirmed experimentally when we characterized part BBa_K808000 .
In this model we included a term for miRNA decay, assuming that it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in the system. This was on the recommendation of Thomas Ouldridge as the degradation of miRNA is not well documented in our cell free system.
As we were not confident in this assumption we tried running the model with different miRNA degradation rates and found that between 5×10-4 and 5×10-3 the amount of GFP produced in the positive case increased by a factor of 3. Outside of this range the difference was small. As our value is within this range the uncertainty introduced by the miRNA degradation rate was high. However, this did not affect the model's usefulness  in understanding the qualitative effect of varying the parameters as the miRNA degradation rate stretches the GFP against time graph horizontally. This changes the time our test takes, but not the final difference in GFP output.
As with our previous model we assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.

n (boric acid) n (subtilisin E) =  448300
Conclusion
As the concentration of cleaved photo protection groups is almost 480,000 times lower than the concentration of boric acid its toxicity is allowed to be 448,000 fold higher for the same toxicity of the liquid washing detergent. If the toxicity of cleavage products is less than 448,000 fold higher than the toxicity of boric acid, washing detergents with replaced boric acid were less toxic than the actual.
Example for one washing cycle (100 g liquid laundry detergent)
For this calculation we assume that 1% of the liquid detergent stays in the laundry after washing and the composition is like in the calculation above.
DMNB and ONB group
n (cleaved group) = n (subtilisin E) =  1% ∙ 0.0001 g 27701.06 g mol = 3.6  ∙ 10-11 mol

m (ONB) =  4.9 ∙ 10-9 g
Boric acid
1% ∙ 1 g = 0.01 g
In this scenario 0.1 g of boric acid or 7 ng of DMNB or 4.9 ng of ONB remain in the laundry.
Comparative environmental risk assessment
The diluted compounds of washing detergents end up in the waste water and consequently in the waste water treatment plant.
Boric acid is highly water soluble and can be neither eliminated in the waste water treatment plant nor in the drinking water purification plant. [ 13 ]
The LIPs products are organic products, which could be eliminated by a biological waste water treatment plant but this remains to be verified as there is no related data available.

Analysis of questionnaire content
Which type of cancer treatments do you know?
Figure 8.
During your treatment, what kinds of treatment did you receive?
Figure 9.
Result of question 1 showed that, chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy were the most well-known 3 treatments to patients and their families. Among the three, chemotherapy comprised 88.71%, accounting for the highest number of votes, showing that everyone considers ""cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"" closely linked.
It could be learnt from the question 2 that, chemotherapy plays highest application in cancer clinical treatment, accounting for 87.1% of all investigated patients, which made chemotherapy the most well-known one.
Now when it came to new drugs, it surprised us that around 1/4 of the patients already know about molecular targeted drugs and other new drugs, and 14.52% of patients have received new therapy treatment, showing that patients are no longer unfamiliar with targeted therapy and other new treatments now. Also, doctors would rationally suggest the appropriate patients to actively try new therapies including targeted therapy.
We also learned that, there exists many patients who tried target detection but at last not eligible for targeted therapy; For those who apply targeted therapy, only half of them are receiving good effect, while the other patients choose to give up targeted therapy and regress to traditional treatment due to trivial effect or unaffordable medical expenses.
For different treatment methods, which part do you think is more important?
Figure 10.
The results of question 3 showed that, regardless of treatment types, patients value the efficacy superior to other factors. Many patients and their families told us that they would still strive for an ideal treatment no matter how expensive it might be, as long as it can guarantee efficiency. ‘Side effects’ accounted for the"

Christopher Nokes, Project Manager at AlbertaSat
We also had a discussion with Christopher Nokes, an Engineering Physics Graduate and Project Manager of Ex-Alta 1, the first cube satellite designed in Alberta. He was kind enough to answer some questions regarding payload delivery among other things. This gave us greater insight into the concerns of rocket scientists when they deal with mission launches, and a greater understanding of our own project within the context of the space industry.
What kind of restraints were in consideration in the design of your system regarding factors like weight and volume?
Mr. Nokes: Ex-Alta 1 was designed according to two primary documents.  The first is the CubeSat Design Specification.  The second is the QB50 System Requirements (go to qb50.eu and navigate to the Documents tab).
Both these documents have very specific details concerning weight and volume, and I recommend you read them in detail.  That said, from our experience with Ex-Alta 1, the critical factor of the two is volume.  This is for technical reasons. The satellite must fit within an envelope volume which is non-negotiable.  Whereas with the weight, since cubesats most often weigh only a few kilograms, going over the weight limit by even 1 or 2 kg is not a big issue. The rockets launching these cubesats have plenty of contingency to accommodate a few extra grams/kilograms here and there.
You mentioned that the rockets launching cubesats have enough contingency to accommodate a few extra kilograms. However, I'm assuming that the weight restrictions on the design of Ex-Alta 1, albeit flexible, are in place to avoid unexpected extra weight so that the appropriate weight of fuel can be allocated. So, concerning the general economics of the launch, are payloads that are as light as possible favoured in order to keep the costs of launching at a minimum?
Mr. Nokes: Yes.
However, when talking about Ex-Alta 1 and cubesats in general it is important to distinguish between the primary payload that the rocket is launching and the secondary payloads.  Fuel requirements for a rocket launch are almost entirely defined by the primary payload objective. Thus, secondary payloads such as cubesats have very little impact on the overall fuel requirements.
There are cases where cubesats are the primary payload, in which"

Architecture and Synthetic Biology
Introduction
Besides working on our project BareCillus, over the course of the summer we also explored potential synthetic biology applications in the field of architecture.
The potential relationship between synthetic biology and architecture is attracting interest from many people, such as designer Daisy Ginsberg, innovator Rachel Armstrong and architect Christian Kerrigan. The following article is a discussion on this relationship based on the knowledge and experience that we gained over the course of this project. To begin with, we briefly talk about similarities and differences between the two fields that have become apparent to us over the summer, particularly after the architecture workshop . We speculate about what kind of specifications the potential application area must have in order for it to be valid and discuss to what extent we believe synthetic biology will be applied to architecture. We also reflect on the advantages and disadvantages that may arise from this relationship.
Similarities and Differences
Over the course of this project, certain similarities between Architecture and Synthetic Biology have become prominent, especially in the design cycle.
One of the key aspects of synthetic biology is that it applies techniques used in engineering to biology in order to design and develop a product.
This makes the design cycle in this field very similar to the design process in architecture. In both fields, we begin a project by identifying the required specifications in order for the final product to meet its purpose.  Then comes the design stage, where ideas and suggestions are investigated in order to help us discover the best solution possible.
Next stage is modelling,  where we use powerful computers to simulate as accurately as we can"

Este sistema debería dar lugar a la bacteria en el exterior del biorreactor expresando menos luz cosecha antena proteínas que las células en el interior, reduciendo NPQ manteniendo un alto absorbancia de fotones incidentes. Nos centraremos en la alteración de la cantidad de cosecha de la Luz Complejo 2 (LH2) mediante una regulación de la pucB / A genes que codifican para las dos subunidades del complejo. LH2 absorbe fotones máximo en la longitud de onda de 842 nm y redireccionamientos su energía a la reacción y LH1 centro. La proporción de LH2 complejos a LH1 natural oscila entre 3,0 a 6,7 en diversas condiciones de luz (Scheuring et al., 2005).Proponemos que si esta relación de LH2 para LH1 se altera al rango de 0-7 o más en respuesta a la intensidad de la luz incidental, entonces la eficiencia fotosintética y la productividad de una cultura de R. sphaeroides puede ser maximizada.

Gel Electrophoresis and DNA staining makes use of mutagenic chemicals like EtBr, SYBR Safe or any other DNA staining. Wear protection (gloves) when carrying out this protocol and work in an assigned area for this work to prevent contamination of the rest of the lab.
For a 0.8% (w/v) gel in TAE, weigh agarose powder for a 0.8% (w/v) gel.
E.g. weigh 1.6g and add to 200mL TAE buffer for a 0.8% gel.
Add weighed agarose in TAE buffer (1X) and warm the solution (in a microwave) until it is completely dissolved. Let the solution cool down to hand warm temperature.
NOTE: Make sure the lid is not completely closed to avoid possible exploding of the glass bottle.
Pour gel in gel tray and mix well with SYBR Safe. For a small gel (~ 40mL solution) add 1µL of SYBR Safe; for a large gel (~80mL) add 2µL of SYBR Safe. Add a comb to create wells for the samples. Allow the agarose to solidify (approximately 20 minutes).
NOTE: For better mixing, add SYBR Safe to bottle instead of tray.
Transfer the gel to the electrophoresis cell, remove the combs and cover the gel  in TAE buffer (1X).
NOTE: Mind the direction of DNA migration when placing the gel in the cell.
Prepare the electrophoresis samples by adding Nucleic Acid Loading Buffer conform the manufacturer’s instructions.
Load the molecular weight marker (DNA ladder) in the first well according to manufacturer’s instructions (generally 3-5µL) and load 5-10µL of the dyed samples in the other wells.
NOTE: Do not contaminate the loading buffer and ladder with SYBR Safe! Do not touch it while wearing a glove.
Connect the cables of the gel tray following the colour code and run at 80-110V for 40-60 min.

    This is a rough direction judgment of the mechanism and helps us to further analyze. In the analysis of the acid resistance mechanism, it may not be more substantial than the information in a large number of documents, but it is still a good reference. When analyzing a new component with fewer references, the two analyses will make a big difference.
    In general, the establishment of our model uses a statistical approach, in which the PCA dimensionality reduction algorithm is the point. The results of the model are basically consistent with the LLNZ-RS02280 obtained from the experimental results, and the accuracy is very high. Therefore, the model can be used to identify the key genes of the target mutant and to explore its possible mechanism. However, there is a small amount of data loss in the process of PCA dimension reduction, so the accuracy is not 100%. The results also need to be verified by experiments with several genes with higher ratios.

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," . The MHC molecules can be divided into two classes, the MHC class I molecules and the MHC class II molecules. Both molecules present short peptide fragments on the cell surface to the T-Cell. The peptide is bound in a binding groove on the MHC molecule. Both classes of MHC share similar structural characteristics, but differ in their subdomains. MHC class I is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha transmembrane chain and smaller beta-2 microglobulin, which is not convalently bound to the MHC molecule. MHC class II molecules are heterodimers consisting of two transmembrane chains (alpha and beta) [] . Due to those structural differences, both molecule have different peptide binding properties. MHC class I molecules favor binding peptides of 8-10 amino acids in their binding groove, since hydrogen bonds at the C-terminus and the N-terminus of the peptide are the main stabilizers of the MHC-I/peptide complex, whereas MHC class II molecules favor peptides between 13 and 18 amino acids [] .
Immunogenicity
The immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals can be caused by many different patient- and drug-associated factors. In our software tool we focus on the most important aspect, which is the sequence of the protein and the resulting T-cell immune epitopes presented on MHC class II molecules. However factors like a lack of glycosylation, different glycosylation patterns or protein aggregates might also trigger the immune system to a response. An important patient related factor is the set of alleles of every individual. Since they all have slightly different peptide binding capabilities, an immune response to a protein can be related to the presence of certain alleles [] .
MHC allele frequencies
Since immunogenicity is largely influenced by the MHC molecule peptide binding characteristics, our tool  destroys epitopes for alleles of choice. However, since every individual has a different set of alleles, it is nearly impossible to perform a generalized perfect deimmunization of the protein. As a result, it is inevitable to make compromises in the epitope removal. The goal is not to completely remove all epitopes for all possible alleles, but to reduce the immunogenicity of the protein for the largestpart of the population possible. Another major challenge in this optimization problem is the different frequency of MHC alleles around the world, which limits a deimmunization to a distinct population carrying those alleles. In case of an average central European population, a combined epitope removal for the most prevalent alleles like DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*03"

In our human practice, we want to achieve a complete exploration process. In this process we need to enhance our project and to promote our project to the world. We mainly based on the following principles:
1. Extensive investigation
So as to better achieve the value of the project, we need to listen to more suggestions from the community. As the saying goes: no investigation, no right to speak.
2. Positive exchanges
Not only to show the world our works, but also to have a certain exchange of interaction with the world, we want to get good feedback.
3. Targeting the market demand
iGEM is not only a competition, but also a good project. In order to complete projects successfully we need to understand people's interests, which will help us target the market.
4. Pioneer the future
It’s essential for us to establish a system of Human Practice system, and we can obtain a lot of gains from this system. In addition, the system can be used by other teams in the future.
5. Education
Educate responsible engineers.
Our human practice focuses on the safety, rationality and value of the society. From the beginning, we wanted to find the problem in the daily life. We visited a lot of communities, and interviewed some well-known experts and scholars in the area, and also went to a lot of well-known domestic companies to communicate. We got a lot of good feedback. In the process of human practice constantly on our project has been improved.

INTERVIEW WITH MEMBER OF MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Dr. Wei Yang.
After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind. Generally, most of them have the main shortages of high calories and bad taste even though they might be very sweet. We based the human sweetness receptor on our design and hypothesized to construct the signal conduction pathway in the yeast. And the most important thing is biology safety.

6/30:  This morning I checked the transformation plates from the ligation reactions run at different temperatures ( 16C for 1 hr and 4 C overnight) of RFP + term and BFP + term.  Out of the 6 plates, only two had colonies on them:  RFP+term @ 16 C and RFP+term @ 4 C that was heat inactivated.  The two plates had only colony each.  The control plates of competent cells on KAN plate had no colonies.
Since our ligation reactions were still no successful, I continued to troubleshoot, looking at the New England Biolabs (NEB), manufacturer of the ligase enzyme, website about certain problems that may arise for ligation procedures: http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM0202.asp There they suggested using 5ul of ligation reaction per 50 ul of competent cells for transformation.  We had been using 10 ul of ligation reaction for our transformation protocols.  To test this, I set up a transformation using the ligation reaction of RFP+term from 6/27 and made 3 reactions:  1ul of ligation, 2ul of ligation, and 4ul of ligation reaction.  This time I also plated controls of competent cells on KAN plate as well as just LB agar plate.  The LB agar plate is meant to show if there is anything wrong with the competent cells, as they should grow well in plain LB.
Another thing that we have notice with our ligation protocol is that our calculations are slightly off.  Because the volumes and masses of backbone and insert are relative to each other, you must standardize one measurement.  Initially we standardized the volume of the backbone, but this resulted in a very low mass of DNA for the ligation reaction.  Thus, we changed our calculations so that we standardized the mass of the backbone to 50 ng.  This may have been our problem with our ligation protocols.
7/1: The transformations using varying volumes of ligation reaction in the transformation protocol were unsuccessful and grew nothing.  This is not a complete surprise after our discovery of wrongful calculations leading to a low mass of DNA in the ligation reactions.  However other wet lab members' ligation reactions using the correct calculations of insert and backbone did not grow as well.  Thus, we are forced to brainstorm more on what is going wrong.  On the NEB website for the protocol using T4 DNA ligase with cohesive (sticky) ends, it suggest"

Motivation for Modeling
In contrast to pure experimentation, modeling allows for the rational design of synthetic biological systems.  Part characterization makes it possible to apply the known activity of genetic parts to developing a prediction of their qualitative behavior when they are pieced together into a composite device.  Such an approach was aptly demonstrated in the paper by Dr. Ajo-Franklin (Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007).  They generated a Hill equation model for composite system, to which they applied experimentally-quantified values for the parameters representing the individual parts in the system.  Their predictions with this approach matched up considerably well to measurements they made once they have built their final device.
Seeing as we incorporating many of the same parts into our own limiter network, we decided to modify their Hill equations to suit our particular design.  It was important for us to model our system because it was necessary to ascertain, given the complexity of the transcriptional interactions, whether the design would generate our desired threshold-driven output.
Hill equation
According to a Hill equation, it is possible to model the relationship between a gene (G) and its transcription factors.  The equation varies slightly depending upon whether the transcription factor has an activating or inhibitory effect, and one observes a multiplicative effect if several factors regulate expression of the same gene.
We have modeled all gene products in our system using the following equations:
One will note that the variables correspond to this diagram of our system.
Modeling results
Here we display one of numerous modeling configurations used to understand the behavior of our system.  In this situation, we vary the constitutive strength of the promoter controlling expression of gene Y.  Specific values have been included below.  These values reflect experimental values taken for some of the same synthetic transcription factors (Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007).  Many parameters were made to be equal for simplification of the modeling analysis.
Initial values: X = Y =Z = 0  I = G = 25
Parameters values:

ShanghaiTech,2018,Team:ShanghaiTech#Project NFBL_-_-_TEXT.html," In this way, the downstream transcription will be prevented. As for the translational level, the occlusion of the RBS by the terminator hairpin will prevent the translation of the target gene.
In conclusion, while antisense RNA is not present, the gene will express as normal, while antisense RNA is produced, the downstream target gene will be repressed effectively.
The RNA regulators show sufficient advantages over traditional protein-based regulatory systems, including:
Programmability: As Watson-Crick base pairing is predictable, the RNA-RNA interaction can be predicted by sophisticated software tools. In this way, a RNA switch can be designed artificially, which are difficult for proteins.
Lower metabolic cost: Compared with proteins, the RNA switches dispense with translation step, which saves a great amount of resources.
Fast response: RNA switches could propagate signals faster than proteins considering the fast degradation rates of RNAs.
Despite these advantages, RNA regulators still suffer from incomplete repression in their OFF state, making the dynamic range less than that of the proteins. This leak can cause the network to function incorrectly. Therefore, we submit the dual-control pT181 attenuator, which can solve this problem.
The dual-control pT181 attenuator we submitted offers a significant advantage over previous iGEM parts that submitted in 2013:
Reduce leak: As our pT181 attenuator could regulate both transcription and translation in a single compact RNA mechanism, which means it could provide stronger functions without increasing burden. This dual control repressor is able to increases repression from 85% to 98%.
Our approach
pT181 attenuator is the part C in our negative feedback loop. As the regulator in our system, pT181 attenuator will be activated by part B, since we place part B’s target sequence upstream the gene for pT181 attenuator antisense. Meanwhile, pT181 attenuator will repress the part A due to the pT181 attenuator sense target upstream the gene for part A. Consequently, the upregulation of part B caused by the expression of part A will indirectly repress part A. In this case, the whole system is ready to response change of the input signal.
In the absence of input signal, we hope that there is no expression of the output. However, due to the inevitable leak from the part A and part B, it seems to be impossible to avoid expression of the output. With pT181 attenuator in our system, we could avert it at utmost because of the efficient repression of it – just tiny quantity of pT181 attenuator will prevent most of the leak. This ensures the"

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," have. The price difference in developed countries is relatively small, since the value of the raw ingredients comprise a small part of the total cost of processed food [4]. However, the reverse is true in undeveloped countries, where the diet is comprised of mainly unprocessed food, resulting in a market more sensitive to the price of these crops. Families below the poverty line spend upwards of 80 % of their income on food, leaving low margins for a price change of basic food goods.
Should environmental sustainability come before the basic needs of human beings? The future of all is of course predicated on the fact that there is a livable earth for us to inhabit. “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few” as the saying goes. But do the two goals need to be mutually exclusive? We certainly hope not.
Self-sustaining production system
How can the need for industrial substrate be limited and at the same time move the world onto a sustainable production of chemicals and fuels? Our answer: Create a production system that produces its own substrate. Photosynthesis was the key to this solution, as photosynthetic microorganisms have the ability to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into sugars by converting sunlight to bioavailable energy (ATP) to fuel this process. The use of cyanobacteria addresses both the substrate issue as well as decreasing the carbon footprint of the industry. A photosynthesis-based production system would not require the arable land that food crops need, since the microorganisms would be grown in contained bioreactor systems.
However, there are some disadvantages when working with cyanobacteria. One of them is their slower growth rate than most chemotrophs, making genetic engineering of them slower. Since a future expansion of the biosynthesis field certainly will require extensive genetic engineering, working with this organism is not ideal. Leaving the product synthesis to faster growing organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis, which already have already proven capable of viable production, could therefore be the better choice.
The approach we chose in our project was to modify the cyanobacteria to simply produce the substrate for the production organism. The genetic modifications performed in the cyanobacterium will therefore only be focused on one task - the production of substrate - and the organism will not have to be reengineered for each new product that one wishes to produce. Furthermore, dividing functions into different strains can lead to decreased metabolic load and prevent competition between the different functions within one organism [5].
How do we create a system that is self-regulating and at the same time avoid the risks discussed earlier?
To prevent one organism"

On June 19, 2018, five members of the MSU iGEM team visited the Monsanto Learning Center (MLC) in Monmouth, Illinois. We know that Monsanto has recently had a negative public image, but their learning center is open to the public and does general education on agrobiological topics such as genetics and crop growth. We were taken on a tour of their agricultural test fields by Troy Coziahr, the manager of the MLC. He talked to us about hybrid breeding methods, the evolution of corn and soybean plants over time, and field trials of genetically modified crops. Mr. Coziahr was very knowledgeable about the most efficient ways to get those crops federally approved and then planted. This is useful to our own research because we hope to eventually have our own genetically modified crops."

How They Helped Us?
UI_Indonesia helped us greatly in our human practice, for both the outreach and the feedback garnering of our social study.  As a part of our study about public’s opinion regarding gene therapy, they helped us to translate our research questionnaire into Bahasa and spread to the society in Indonesia.
This was of great help as there were a great number of respondents from different educational backgrounds, age groups, gender to provide us with an extensive demographic profile, avoiding potential selection bias.  As Singapore and Indonesia are two countries in different phases of development, in terms of the social and religious environment, size of population, rules and regulations etc, with data from Indonesia, we were able to compare how the public opinion might differ for two different countries. 
Figure 5. Sample of data UI_Indonesia collected for us
Our main reason to extend our human practice to other countries is that we hope that ultimately gene therapy can be applied evenly to everyone in the world. Therefore, it is important to understand the public views of different countries with different socio-economic conditions. It is a good chance for us to utilize this collaborating opportunity with UI_Indonesia to conduct an international study regarding gene editing. We are also thankful that UI_Indonesia helped us to analyze the survey question for the study in Indonesia. From UI_Indonesia analysis, we found that most of Indonesians support gene therapy editing for treatment. However, most of the respondents also have many concerns about cost, safety, and ethics. We deeply appreciate their help in sampling and  survey analysis  and their results are valuable inputs to our  human practice .
Figure 6. Outreach by UI_Indonesia
Apart from helping us in our survey study, UI_Indonesia also planned an outreach event for us. We believe that it is important for the public to know more and be aware of this gene-editing therapy. Moreover, since gene editing is not a common issue, there is a lack of knowledge about this in Indonesia. Therefore, as a part of our outreach, UI_Indonesia helped us to educate students from the University of Indonesia so that they could be better prepared for gene editing technologies in the future.
We are pleased that we were able to share about our project to students in Indonesia through the help from UI_Indonesia . We prepared the material that we would like to be delivered in this outreach. The discussion was held in"

UT-Tokyo,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo#Team#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," participated. Tokyo Metropolitan University hosted. Each team presented for 40 minutes about their team projects and human practices followed by questions. There were two aims for this event. First is for Japanese teams participating in iGEM 2012 to get to know each other better. Second is to get advice on our projects during the question time. In addition to being given an opportunity to practice the presentation, we were able to spend quality time with a lively question and answer session. Also, we renewed our motivation by learning other team's projects. In particular, it was fruitful that we noticed a problem about our project and got a hint of the answer to the problem by the question-and-answer session from the other teams. An appropriate and humorous piece of advice from Dr. Kiga who has been participating in iGEM for a long time was instructive. At question and answer session, we were given a memorable phrase from someone at a team; “I wanted to research about this theme, but I couldn’t. I want UT-Tokyo team to accomplish this project.” We pledged that we will carry through our project, whether his comment was true or not. We knew that one of our projects “inhibitions of transcriptional factor” is similar to “Arg box” (BBa_K649401), which is one of Tokyo Institute of Technology’s projects last year. We requested the cooperation of Tokyo Institute of Technology, and got some parts for this purpose. On the basis of these parts, we attempted to make additional tests of Arg box, to compare the results with our version, which extends upon their method.

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," of honey bees (Figure 3). The alteration of the gut microbiome composition increases susceptibility to infection by opportunistic pathogens.
Figure 3. A lovely honey bee landing on a flower in eastern Germany.
Since crops as well as weed co-evolve with glyphosate over time, the development of herbicide resistance is never ending (Figure 4). Indeed, once a resistant plant has been selected, repeated use of a herbicide over multiple generations allows resistant plants to proliferate as susceptible plants are eliminated.
Figure 4. The emergence of plants that have acquired resistance against glyphosate is increasing world wide (status: April 2018). Adapted from http://www.weedscience.org .
Other applications for glyphosate
Companies like Monsanto with patented chemical technologies will generally try to patent all reasonable potential uses of that chemical in order to obtain maximal return on their research investments. Since glyphosate inhibits the aromatic biosynthetic pathway in many bacteria and parasites, a reasonable case can be made that glyphosate might be effective as an antimicrobial. Indeed, Monsanto has filed in 2003 a patent for the invention that the herbicidal agent glyphosate can be used in combination with the polyvalent anion oxalic acid to prevent and treat pathogenic infections caused by protozoan parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa ( Patent No.: US7,771,736B2 ). However, a lot stands between glyphosate as a substance with antimicrobial activity in the test tube and a clinically effective antimicrobial agent. A reliable effective concentration of glyphosate with a reasonable oral dose in humans is difficult to achieve, especially when glyphosate is orally applied. Moreover, glyphosate only shortly persists in humans. Glyphosate blocks the production of de novo synthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria, and the bacteria will die, or at least stop reproducing, if they cannot obtain these nutrients from the environment … but blood and tissues are not water - they are chock-full of the nutrients that microbes need to survive. The addition of aromatic amino acids to the growth medium of bacteria indeed interferes with glyphosate-dependent inhibition of the EPSP synthase (6). Moreover, nobody has demonstrated so far that glyphosate is an effective antimicrobial agent for treating human or animal infections. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether glyphosate may indeed act as an efficient and reliable antimicrobial agent to fight pathogenic bacteria and protozoan parasites.
The glyphosate controversy
Despite warnings over potential risks to human health and the environment, farmers around the world depend on the herbicide glyphosate, which is the active ingredient of of Roundup that is produced"

Laboratory Work
Model
Successful
With minimal mathematical and informatics background, we were able to adapt a pharmacokinetic model to our situation and code effective solutions for diffusion data analysis. This model allows us to approximate peptide concentrations within a nanocapsule at several time intervals; it can also help further developments in similar projects.
Unsuccessful
Our mathematical model went through many iterations (no pun intended) before arriving at its final state: we tried to develop a molecular model to evaluate protein production and a populational model to predict the health of the beehive by eliminating nodes of infection. In the end, time and resources forced us to concentrate our efforts on the most pressing of matters: peptide delivery.
We were unsuccessful in solving the equation for D; we tried several series properties and other sorts of tricks, but we couldn’t find an analytical solution. We decided to find the diffusion coefficient with a simulation of multiple lines.
Our most poignant failure was not being able to run the experiments successfully. Apidaecin was retained at a customs office for a whole month. By the time we needed the nanoencapsulation to be at the lab for experimentation, the peptide had not yet arrived. We are left with a burning vigor to help make importation easier for all sorts of experimentation in Mexico.
Laboratory
Successful
We are the first iGEM team from Tec-Chihuahua that manages to send successful results for the InterLab Study. Besides being a rewarding experience, it was a lot of learning since we had never used a microplate reader.
We achieved the assembly of three BioBricks. BBa_K2834003 that codes for abaecin, BBa_K2834005 for defensin 1 and BBa_K2834006 for apidaecin, the three of them are expression systems of antimicrobial peptides.
Unsuccessful
At the beginning, we worked with E. coli TOP10 but later we had to change to DH5a since the TOP10 strain was contaminated.
For a few weeks, the successful transformation of our competent cells was difficult. We discovered that the key was in the quality of the competent cells. We tried to make several stocks of competent cells with glycerol and store them at -20 °C, however, this did not work. We had to make the competent cells on the same day that the transformation protocol was to be carried out.
We worked in the transformation of competent cells of DH5a with the synthesis of our part linked with pSB1C3. When they were disseminated in the LB medium with chloramphenicol"
