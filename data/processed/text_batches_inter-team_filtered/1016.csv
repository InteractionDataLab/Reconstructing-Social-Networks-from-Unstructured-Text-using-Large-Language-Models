Collaboration
As a hallmark of iGEM, collaboration has been an important part to strengthen contacts and promote friendships with other teams. In 2016 iGEM, we, SYSU-MEDICINE, communicated with several teams and gained a lot.

Collaboration with Team ShanghaiTechChina_B
· Team ShanghaiTechChina_B aimed to confirm the therapeutic effect of the over-expression epidermal growth factor (EGF) on E.coli in colitis microenvironment and hoped to utilize the peptide EGF secreted by the engineered bacteria to repair the colon tissue in patients.
· Our team established the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) model to confirm the homing capability of the modified bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
As a result, we assisted Team ShanghaiTechChina_B with animal model establishment to confirm the function of EGF derived from modified E.coli to prove the effect of the peptide in vivo.
Experiment Design
During the competition, we received the purified EGF peptide expressed by the engineered bacteria from Team ShanghaiTechChina_B. We established the IBD mice model and injected the EGF solution into the colon by cocolysis.
We referred to the related article to select the effective way (TNBS) to establish the model and examine the effect of EGF.[1][2]After IBD mice model establishment,
1. Selected several similar mice and weighed them on the second day of fasting.
2. Chose half of them for EGF solution enema as an experiment group, and the rest of them were dealt with normal saline as the control group.
3. Weighed each of them at the same time every day.
4. After the fifth day, sacrificed the mice by cervical dislocation and measured the length of colons.

). The activity of this promoter is between the activity of the strongest Bacillus promoter Pveg and the weak PliaG.
Inducible promoters from B. subtilis as a novel BioBrick
The last group of promoters consists of two inducible promoters from B. subtilis, PliaI and xylR-Pxyl. They are useful if the strength and timing of gene expression needs to be tightly controlled, because these promoters need an inducer to initiate transcription. PliaI is evaluated with the reporters lux and lacZ and added this novel promoter to the registry.
PliaI ( BioBrick:BBa_K823001 )
PliaI is an inducible promoter from B. subtilis, which responds to antibiotics that interfere with the integrity and biosynthesis of the cell wall (Mascher et al., 2004) . In the presence of a stimulus, the two-component system LiaRS is activated. The activated response regulator LiaR binds to the operator of the promoter and induces the transcription of the lia locus. When the promoter is turned on, the two proteins LiaI and LiaH (which play an important role in the stress response of B. subtilis) are expressed. The major strength of this promoter is its very low basal activity in the absence of an inducer and its high dynamic range (Mascher et al., 2004) . This promoter is evaluated with the reporter lux (see Data inducible promoters
) as well as lacZ (see Data inducible promoters
). The induction was measured with different concentrations of bacitracin, demonstrating a concentration-dependent response over a large range of promoter activities.
xylR-Pxyl ( BioBrick:BBa_K823015 )
Pxyl-xylR is a xylose-inducible promoter from B. subtilis. XylR is the repressor of Pxyl in the absence of the sugar xylose. In the presence of xylose, XylR dissociates from the operator and Pxyl is active (see e.g. Kreuzer et al. ). For this promoter we have not yet suceeded to clone it in a reporter vector to evaluate the activity. So far, there is no data for this promoter.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," primers specific to our genes of interest. After running the gel, we found that we had ample amplification of both of these genes, as shown in the picture below:
In the above gel, lanes 4-5, 7, and 9-12 represent successfully amplifed NPT (669 bp). Lanes 14-16 and 18-20 show that CAR (4690 bp) has been successfully amplifed.
Following this, we performed a Cycle-Pure Spin Protocol to purify the amplified CAR and NPT DNA. The resulting concentration of CAR was 171.6 ng/ul, while NPT was 20.8 ng/ul. Using a restriction digest, the CAR gene was cut with AscI and HindIII, while NPT was cut with both XbaI and PstI, as well as with EcorI and PstI. Using these same enzymes, the PET vector was cut to be ligated with CAR, and the pSB1C3 vector was cut to be ligated with both NPT digests. Following incubation, the inserts were ligated together with their vectors. Transformations were then performed, with the CAR/PET ligation transformed on a Kan plate, and the NPT/ pSB1C3 E/P and X/P ligations transformed on chloramphenicol plates. Transformations were successful, but there were not a great deal of colonies on the CAR plate, and both NPT plates revealled a very high proportion of red colonies, indicating that our desired NPT gene had not been successfully ligated and transformed. Nonetheless, colony PCRs were run in order to test for successful transformations of the ligations the following week. Meanwhile, the results of the ADC gene sequencing came in, but unfortunately it was found that this gene did not correspond well to its theoretical sequence on PartsRegistry. It therefore could not be used with our AAR gene to produce a PetroBrick . The Washington iGEM team agreed to send us a plasmid stock of their PetroBrick and ADC .
Week 15 (August 7 - August 10)
We ran the gel on the CAR and NPT colony PCRs from last week, but unfortunately these gels were blank. Another colony PCR was performed, with twelve colonies from each of the following plates: CAR/PET, NPT(X/P), NPT(E/P). Both NPT plates did not look very promising, as they were completely covered by red colonies, with only a few white ones. Many of the white colonies from the previous week had become red."
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Sample preparation
Blood samples are commonly taken from athletes during regular doping tests. We used these blood samples to extract DNA from serum or the buffycoat (serum and white blood cells) required for testing ( Ni et al., 2011 ). We built an extensive gene doping kinetics model to predict the amount of gene doping fragments in blood over time based an input concentration of gene doping vectors and an injection frequency. We used this model to determine the appropriate time window for gene doping testing based on the measured sensitivity of DNA extraction.
Figure 3. Concentration of doping DNA in the blood over time after a single intramuscular injection of 141 billion viral vectors. The detection limit of 1000 copies per mL of blood is estimated based on the loss of DNA that occurs during sample preparation and targeted sequencing preparation.
2. Prescreening
Figure 4. Colorimetric gold nanoparticle assay. Positive samples result in a red color, whereas negative samples result in a purple color.
We incorporated a prescreening step in our method based on the  advice of Dr. Oliver de Hon of the Dutch Doping Authorities. He emphasised the importance of a high throughput assay that could screen thousands of athletes simultaneously. Therefore, we developed a colorimetric assay based on the extent of gold nanoparticle aggregation ( Baetsen-Young et al., 2018 ). When target doping DNA is absent, the nanoparticle completely aggregates, resulting in a purple color. When target doping DNA is present, it forms a secondary structure with a targeting DNA probe,  which stabilizes the nanoparticle from aggregating, resulting in a red color .
3.Targeted library preparation
Positive prescreened samples proceed to our novel rapid targeted next generation sequencing. Targeted library preparation relies on our innovative fusion protein consisting of a Tn5 transposase and a dxCas9 . The fusion of these two proteins resulted in a target specific transposition. As a proof of concept, we showed that our fusion protein is target specific with an in vitro targeted integration assay, that was verified by visualising the amplified integration products with gel electrophoresis. Once we established the functionality and optimal conditions, we implemented the fusion protein in the established rapid next generation sequencing library preparation protocol from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We replaced the original transposase, responsible for random integration of the sequencing adaptors, by our novel fusion protein. In our case, a specifically designed sgRNA will guide the fusion protein to the exon-exon junction target site and prepare only gene doping DNA for sequencing. Additionally, we developed a sgRNA model which identified the"

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence emissions). This can be achieved by using a single whole cell biosensor consisting of multiple different sensors and reporters or several different whole cell biosensors include in the same device each having a single sensor and reporter system.
Since biosensors use cellular machinery they do not require any other energy input than water, sugar and salt and are more convenient to use compared with conventional chemical methods. This fact presents a major advantage compared to actual pollution detection systems which are energy and water consumers [13]. When deployed in sealed containers biosensors are very suitable for field applications as they are more easily transportable than electronic measurement devices. Thus, accurate and sensitive whole cell biosensors for pollutant detection and quantification provide useful alternatives to direct analytical methods because of their low cost, rapid response, reproducibility, and ease of production. [15]
In addition, living cells give not only analytical information but also functional information on the effect of a stimulus on an organism. Whereas traditional analytical chemistry does not distinguish the different forms (ionic, inert forms) of a pollutant, biosensors make a difference between available and inert, unavailable to biological system forms. Therefore, biosensors can assess the real impact of pollutants on living organisms [16] [17]. This information is important and relevant for environmental measures [18], [19].
To conclude, biosensors supply rapid and specific results at low cost and are able to detect pollutants in a highly specific manner. As they are easily transportable (minimal size, reduced weight) and integrated into other technologies, they are perfectly suitable for field measurements.  Only a few tools using biosensors are currently commercialized. For that purpose, our team had decided to realize one to detect VOCs.
Why choose Bioluminescence ?
Bioluminescence has been recognized as an alternative to fluorescence [21] and has become widely preferred for quantitative bioanalysis [22]. It is assumed that the light intensity is proportional to the concentrations of the targeted molecules. [22]
In bio analysis, photon emission chemistries including fluorescence and bioluminescence are popular due to their inherently high sensitivity and simplicity. [22] Fluorescence relies on photons as the energy source whereas in bioluminescence, the photon emission is based on natural biochemistry.
Fluorescence is brighter due to the high rates of photon excitation. However, this high influx of photon raises the background levels. The number of photons introduced is much more important than the number produced by the reporter gene and photodetectors could not be able to discriminate between excitation and emission photons. Others fluorophores can be present within the samples. [22]"

Analyse
Through communication with other local teams, we found that the data we obtained in the determination of the fluorescein standard curve differed by two to four orders of magnitude. According to our analysis, this is mainly because the model and age of the plate reader we use are related.
At the same time, in subsequent measurements we found that among the six different test devices, device 4 had the strongest fluorescence and device 3 had the lowest fluorescence."

We prepared pC13CO, pC13CL, pC13BA for sequencing. We made glycerol stocks of pC13CL and pC13BA. We got a sequence confirmation  for pC13CK. We got sequencing for pC13BN and had a portion of the lac operon inside the prefix and suffix...a weird recombination must have occurred. pC13AZ sequencing results were good! That and pA13AM and pA13AW were miniprepped for glycerol stocks and biobrick submission. A PCR to add homologous regions to pC13F for Gibson assembly was done. The gel of Q5 PCR of pAK13AO colonies 1,2,3 and pC13CB 1,3,4 all had correct lengths. Thus, we miniprepped the colonies with correct plasmid insert lengths and submitted them for sequencing. We ran a PCR and electroporation for pC13CV  and pC13I, which turned out to be bad. We made overnight E. Coli culture for pC13AF (colony #2). An overnight ligation was done for rbs + crtI (from pC13L) at 4C. We ran a PCR to check the inserts in pC13A, pC13I and pC13J. We protoplasted and transformed Cochliobolus with Dongliang, a post-doctoral research associate in the Turgeon Lab. We used our constructs of pAh13G / pC13BR linearized with SphI, as well as the highly efficient Cochliobolus vector PNG from the Turgeon lab as a ""positive"" control. We submitted pC13BM 1 and pC13BK 1 for sequencing. We homogenized a dilute culture of G. lucidum and inoculated each of the plates for the antibiotic sensitivity test with 20 μL aliquots, without spreading.

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," the presence of formaldehyde the yellow and fluorescing diacetyl-dihydro lutidine is formed. In the reaction catalyzed by the Mdh methanol is converted to formaldehyde which can be detected by the mentioned assay.
First, the different cells as well as their respective fragments and lysate supernatants were screened for formaldehyde production. The samples were taken 6 h after induction from shake flask cultures. Several cells, fragments and supernatants showed a production of formaldehyde but the Mdh activity in the intact cells was higher for each strain.
The formaldehyde assay was repeated only with whole cells and additional samples taken 20 h after induction. Moreover, the assay was conducted not only at 37 °C but also at 30 °C. The GlgC expressing BL21 Gold was used as a negative control. Again, in several strains functional Mdh could be detected and some general conclusions could be drawn:
More formaldehyde was produced in the samples taken 6 h after induction
Strains cultivated at 37 °C show a stronger response than the same ones cultivated at 30 °C
The assay works better and faster at an incubation temperature of 37 °C
Comparison of different strains at varying cultivation conditions.
The highest activity could be shown in BL21 Gold (DE3) at a cultivation temperature of 37 °C in M9 in a sample taken 6 h after induction.
By far the highest formaldehyde production was observed in the BL21 Gold (DE3) cells 6 h after induction cultivated at 37 °C despite its formation of inclusion bodies.
To show the significance of the production of formaldehyde the assay was conducted with the Mdh expressing BL21 Gold (DE3) cultivated in the labled methanol experiment along with the BL21 Gold (DE3) expressing GlgC as a negative control, both in multiple replicates (n>35).
Formaldehyde formation during in vivo assay
#IGEM# expresses Mdh and #OHES# expresses glgC as a negative control (4.5 h after induction). Both constructs were incorporated in vector pSB1A30 and the strains were cultivated at 37 °C. Each value is made from at least 35 replicates of each construct.
The Mdh expressing strain showed significantly more formaldehyde production indicating a functional expression of the Mdh.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," proud of inspiring our successors and we hope many among                  our peers there will be future synthetic biologists.
Our SEBİT workshop
In collaboration with SEBİT, an educational technology company, we took a role in a workshop that would increase attention to                  science and biology in children. We dressed up as biologists that work in the laboratory section of a facility. We pretended to do                  experiments in accordance with the concept of the workshop and introduced lab environment to children. At the end, we felt so happy                  that the responses from children were in a way showing praise to science and biology. They said they wanted to be like one of us in                  the future and do great work for the sake of the world.
Inspiring Enthusiasm among Scientists of the Future
We visited primary school students of our school in their Science lessons to introduce them to the synthetic biology                  and biofuels. We had a chat on why different people, animals or plants have different characteristics, why bread mold                  and how scientists made a tobacco plant glow to teach them the existence of DNA. As soon as they heard that we changed                  genes of other organisms, they said they wanted to “transfer lion DNA to warriors” which we explained how bad it is                  to do so and good scientists would never do such a vile thing, introducing them to bioethics. To debunk some myths they                  may have believed in, we told them how some bacteria are good whereas some are bad, and thus excess antibiotic use is                  bad for them. Most importantly, we taught them how bad fossil fuels are, and how we can abandon their use, particularly                  with our project. They were stunned when they heard we made cars run on wood. We stated how biofuels would “save the world”                  which they said was “very cool”.
It was encouraging to see young, primary school kids are enthusiastic about biofuels. Since they will be the future scientists,                  they are almost “future aspects” of our project.
Presenting Biofuels on The VI. Intelligence and Talent Congress
Tugba Inanç, our PI, gave a speech introducing our project on  VI. Intelligence and Talent Congress held                  annually by the Turkish Intelligence Foundation. This congress hosts educators, families, and students from                  all over Turkey to have a discussion on skill, craft, intelligence and success with gifted individuals with                  extraordinary abilities or inspiring stories of entrepreneurship.
With this Congress, we found a chance to introduce biofuels to a diverse audience. It was refreshing to see                  their enthusiasm; as we received many questions on the matter after the"

Dr. Melinda Stapleton, the senior lab technician at the University of Sheffield’s undergraduate teaching labs thought that it would be useful if our device could change the filters in order to change the wavelengths to suit different experiments. She also suggested tailoring our device to allow measurements to be taken at different times from as short as 15 minutes to longer periods. Following her advice, we will be modifying our coding to allow for different measurements to be taken.
Ryan Kinsella from PreventX Diagnostics raised the concern about ensuring patient confidentiality. We have addressed this issue by developing our own encryption software based on discrete cellular automaton models to ensure that data can only be accessed by clinicians and lab technicians.
We also spoke to consultant microbiologists from Poland and Cyprus who informed us about a similar device to ours which is currently being used in diagnostic labs - Vitek2. Our team was inspired by Vitek2, to develop different types of well-plates which would contain antibiotics in the form of powder which can be used to select the most appropriate antibiotic treatment for patients.
The team also met Professor Stephan Matcher, from the University of Sheffield who specializes in the development and application of biophotonic tools to obtain information about the structure and function of tissue in the body. Professor Stephan Matcher proposed the use of deeper wells for the well plates for our device in order to increase the sensitivity of our device. We therefore ordered deeper well plates and are currently performing experiments to investigate the benefits they offer for our device in terms of improving sensitivity.

In the last step, the C chain is digested from the proinsulin by an exoprotease - carboxypeptidase E. The mature insulin contains chains A and B linked by 3 disulphide bonds and in total comprises of 51 amino acids with a molecular weight of 5.8kDa 5 . The maturation of preproinsulin into proinsulin and finally mature insulin is shown in Figure 4.

The colors represents the following: Pink: Signal peptide, yellow: B chain, green: C chain, Blue: A chain, red: Disulphide bonds. The proteolytic events is carried out by the carboxypeptidase E. Figure from WatCut .

DESCRIPTION
The first insulin was extracted from animals, and E. coli was emplyoed in the production of the A and B chain separately as recombinant DNA technologies progessed. Today insulin is produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by a single chain nonnative ""miniproinsulin"" precursor, which is matured by trypsin and carboxypeptidase B 4 .
Goal
In order to demonstrate Y. lipolytica as a versatile cell factory we aim to produce proinsulin as an answer to increasing global demand for insulin.
Results
The human proinsulin sequence was obtained from Sures et al. (1980). The sequence was codon optimized for the codon bias of Y. lipolytica using the codon optimization tool developed by our team, and ordered as a gBlock. The proinsulin gene with the RFC10 prefix and suffix was amplified by PCR into our BioBrick BBa_K2117003 and assembled with our TEF1 promoter to form our device BBa_K2117002 . This was done in pSB1A8YL using standard A3 assembly. The construct was transformed into E. coli, purified and confirmed using analytical digenstion, PCR and sequencing (data not shown).

Add 200 μl of SOC media (make sure that the broth does not contain antibiotics and is not contaminated) to each transformation
Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 2 hours while the tubes are rotating or shaking. Important: 2 hour recovery time helps in transformation efficiency, especially for plasmid backbones with antibiotic resistance other than ampicillin.
Label two petri dishes with LB agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid backbone, and antibiotic resistance. Plate 20 µl and 200 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
For the control, label two petri dishes with LB agar (AMP). Plate 20 µl and 200 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread.
Incubate the plates at 37ºC for 12-14 hours, making sure the agar side of the plate is up. If incubated for too long the antibiotics start to break down and un-transformed cells will begin to grow. This is especially true for ampicillin - because the resistance enzyme is excreted by the bacteria, and inactivates the antibiotic outside of the bacteria.
You can pick a single colony, make a glycerol stock, grow up a cell culture and miniprep.
Count the colonies on the 20 μl control plate and calculate your competent cell efficiency.

The pcambia p1201 and p1281z  vectors were double digested with EcorI and BamHi, 35s promoter, HCHL enzyme and NOS terminator were digested and ligated together. Finally, the construct was ligated to the vector and then transformed into bacteria.
Further Study
Additional research is required in order to troubleshoot why transformation failed.  The next steps will include stabilizing the construct in the pcambia vectors and transformed agrobacterium. Later the transformed agrobacterium, with the desired plasmid, will be used to transforms plants.  The plant tissue then should be analyzed to determine  if the desired products are present.

After transforming this plasmid into DH5alpha E. coli cells, we set up an experiment to test MelA's ability to use tyrosine as a substrate. We set up untransformed DH5alpha cells and just tyrosine wells as controls, alongside MelA-transformed DH5Alpha cells, all containing 2mM L-tyrosine. The wells contained 180 microlitres of cells at a starting OD600 of 0.5. We placed this plate into a Tecan-Sunrise, which measured the OD450 of the well contents at every 20 minutes for 2.5 days. The value of OD450 is directly related to the amount of melanin being formed in the wells. The following graph represents our obtained data.
Graphed for each of the wells containing DH5alpha cells (transformed with MelA and not transformed) is the average of three replicates. The error bars represent standard deviation.
Tyrosine alone with no cells does not polymerize on its own, since there was no increase over time of OD450. Interestingly, there is a statistically significant difference in the OD450s when comparing the DH5alpha cells without and with MelA transformed in them. The data indicates that, in the presence of constitutive MelA production and 2mM L-tyrosine, more melanin in produced than wild-type /E.coli. This would indicate that 1) WT E. coli can produce melanin using L-tyrosine, and 2) MelA can use L-tyrosine to produce melanin, ever moreso than WT DH5Alpha.
With this data, we intended to perform nanoparticle synthesis with L-tyrosine and MelA-transformed E. coli cells, and have these cells attach the gold nanoparticles to the surface of the E. coli cells using our FhuA-GBP fusion protein (BBa_K2045000), following the protocol created by Tsai et al [1].

PDC/ADH-XbaI/PstI and σ70/pSB1A3-SpeI/PstI were ligated and transformed into NEB10 β cells.  Single colonies from LB-Ampicillin plates were selected and tested on LB-Amp and LB-Chlor plates.  No usable colonies were obtained (all were light pink and grew on both LB-Chl and LB-Amp plates).
Bay Laurel Thioesterase
MT: Four colonies of Part J sigma 70 contiuative promoters was cultured and digested with SpeI and PstI. 3-2 and 3-3 cell lines of Bay Laurel Thioesterase with RBS and terminator (BTE) were digested with XbaI and PstI.  All cell lines of sigma 70 and BTE were shown to be fully digested by check with 1% agarose gel.  Colony 1 of sigma 70 and 3-2 of BTE were chosen to be ligated together in the J61002 Amp R plasmid that sigma 70 came in. The ligation was transformed in NEB Beta cells and spread on Amp R plates. Twenty-five white colonies were chosen from the transformation and streaked on Amp200 R plates cross-selected on Cm34 R plates. 17/25 of the colonies remained white and none of the colonies grow on the chloramphenicol plates.  Ten colonies were chosen for culture, and minipreped.

Procedure: DH5α cells were transformed with the promoters K390015 (petBD+RBS), K390016, and K390017; the integration vector K654056; GLF; and INV. All genes were contained in the plasmid pSB1C3. Transformants were selected for on chloramphenicol plates and cultured in LBccm broth. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformants using a QIAgen miniprep kit. Isolated plasmid was digested with EcoRI and PstI to ensure that the correct plasmid transformations took place.
Results/Discussion: The EcoRI and PstI digests did not confirm successful plasmid transformations. This seems to be due to a defect in the restriction enzymes. In order to advance in our research,"

Methane sensing
i) Introduction
In our methanE.COLIc project, the first critical point is to sense the ambient methane gas. While in literature search, we have focused on the methane and DNA or methane and  regulator protein  interaction which binds to DNA after binding to methane. In structure, methane consists of one carbon atom  and four hydrogen atom which means it is smaller in size and weight. Therefore it is hard to find any study based on methane interaction with DNA or protein to regulate transcription. This made us search for carbon hydrogen bond interaction with any oligo or protein to trigger transcription of any metabolite product. So that we also searched the literature for any organism which utilizes  any alkane chain and alkane which regulates the transcription of organismal metabolites by  interaction with DNA or protein. Since bacteria are environmental adapting organisms, it is possible to find any alkane to regulate the transcription of degradation metabolism. Then we have found the organism, Pseudomonas oleovorans to analyze the alkane degradation  of organism for its carbon source.
ii) Background
Many microorganisms live in the environments where the conditions changing frequently and so the evolution is inevitable for mechanisms to withstand unfavorable situations.  Therefore microorganisms can use their specific and sensitive mechanisms for sensing the required nutrients for them or any pollution to affect their sustainability. Otherwise they can expose to mutations which change the gene expression and gain new functionalities.  In case they have ability to survive in such conditions.
While we were scanning the literature based on methane and alkane degrading organisms we have found some organisms that sensitive to methane presence and have mechanisms to activate transcription of related gene clusters.
We analyzed the soil bacteria, Pseudomonas oleovorans. This strain can assimilate the alkane for its carbon source and one of the microbial whole cell –biosensor.  They have a gene cluster which codes for degradative pathway and includes the activator which interacts especially with linear alkanes. This activator protein, AlkS, in the presence of alkanes, induces the transcription from PalkB promoter which initiates the expression of genes code for assimilation of alkanes. We have analyzed the related articles in which"

Collarboration with  NCTU_Formosa
Team Collaboration
Since we are a fairly new iGEM team, we are not familiar with the details about iGEM competition. Therefore we turned to NCTU_Formosa, who hosted this meetup on Aug 24th, during which we took turns presented our project, gave each other feedbacks             and suggestions. NCTU_Formosa is especially very helpful on our wiki page. As almost all of our team members are in biology background, building wiki page is truly a huge challenge for us. In this meeting, NCTU_Formosa spent a lot of time             teaching and troubleshooting our problem on building wiki pages, for which they prepared a 2-hour-course containing content list below. This is truly a very successful and helpful collaboration. After the meetup, NCTU_Formosa stayed in contact             with us by messenger to further assist us with constructing wiki page. T
Team NCTU­_Formosa gave us a tutorial about html. During the tutorial, we learned:
1. Basic tags and elements for html
2. Image scale and website format adjustment

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#SmallPhage#Springexp#Period3#Exp#6.27 Mutagen Concentration Test - Third Protocol_-_-_TEXT.html," 7mL of x8 agar was added to each test tube and the content was then plated.
Plates were incubated upside down for 72 hours.
3) Titer to Determine Phage Concentration 2 (7.2)
Same process for as Titer to Determine Phage Concentration 1, but plates were incubated for only 24 hours.
4) Spot test to confirm phage viability (7.3)
Spot test was performed using procedures similar that those in 4.25 T7 phage viability test ]
Phage solutions spotted include 2 dilution series from mutagensis result (one created on 6.28 and one newly created from stock). Two positive controls were used: 5.3 stock (this is what we used for mutagenesis) and mutagenized stock from 6.12 Mutagen Concentration Test - Second Protocol .
V) Results
1) Applying the mutagen
- No clearage was seen after 22 hours. Following steps were carried regardless.
2) Titer to determine phage concentration
- The plates were left in for too long so the bacteria overtook the plaques that formed; no viable data.
3) Titer to Determine Phage Concentration 2
- There was one plaque on the ""500ug -2"" plate and 11 plaques on the ""200ug -8"" plate. All other plates had no plaques. We are not sure why this is.
4) Spot test to confirm phage viability
- Both of the two positive controls formed plaques on all of the plates. The only other plaque was on 200ug, new dil, 0.
- This confirms our suspicion that phage death occurred because it was incubated for too long with mutagen.
VI) Conclusion
Something went seriously wrong with this set of mutagenesis. None of the phage survived. Not even those in the control test tube, with no added mutagen. We weren't able to identify the source of phage death because our phage stock remained viable in the fridge. We have thus decided to repeat this experiment with shorter incubation time to rule out the possibility that it is the longer incubation time that killed the phage.

LA_Biohackers,2014,Team:LA Biohackers#Practice and Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," Biotechnology Activities is federally administering the issue. In their 2011 report, the board promoted this culture of responsibility over regulation. Either way there are numerous protections already on the books which could potentially ensure the nation’s safety and  security. Everyone, however is not convinced communication offers enough protection.
Critics of DIY Synthetic Biology worry about three primary forms of risk: lab safety, environmental safety, and bioterrorism.8 Lab safety is governed internally through the scientific community and insures against accidental harmful exposures of research staff. Uniform codes of laboratory safety and best practices are promulgated by research organizations like the American Chemical Society, ACS. To prevent carelessness and ensure lab efficiency and efficacy, this basic code of laboratory conduct is universally embraced and followed within the scientific community. Additionally, scientific specializations, even relatively new ones like synthetic biology, are built upon a strong ethical foundation that practitioners take very seriously. This ethical code is both an essential component of lab safety and an integral part of accurate data collection and reporting.
This system of ethics and professional standards has been largely successful in policing internal lab activities. As a result, local, state, and federal regulations focus on guarding against bioterrorism and protecting the environment. Local zoning codes stand as the first line of defense against environmental exposure. These local ordinances partition potentially harmful research from residential and high traffic commercial areas by designating zones for special land uses like scientific research. In Los Angeles for example, Title 22 of the Los Angeles County Code9 specifies zone SR-D for scientific research and development. In order to comply with this zoning code, laboratory space is required to maintain permitted use, structure size, required parking, building set back, and maximum lot coverage. Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning enforces these provisions by monitoring land usage and ensuring land owners comply with the requirements of the code.
In addition to zoning laws, state and federal agencies regulate hazardous waste disposal to prevent DIY laboratories from contaminating their surrounding environment. Federally, hazardous disposal is regulated under the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act10 (RCRA). In California, the California Environmental Protection Agency11 administers this federal statute in addition to provisions of the California health and safety code through is child agency the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC). DTSC has more than one thousand employees, and is headquartered in Sacramento. The agency also maintains regional offices across the state including two environmental chemistry laboratories, and field offices in Sacramento, Berkeley, Los Angeles, Chatsworth, Cypress, Clovis (Fresno), San Diego and Calexico.
Under the RCRA, disposal without a permit is permitted in"

Clotho Beta: Future Development
The next release of Clotho after iGEM is planned for a late Spring 2009 release. This will be the official Beta release (the other releases will have been Alpha and iGEM). The main focus of the release will be to fully implement all the features currently in Clotho as well as fix bugs that are found. Clotho testing and deployment will begin with Anderson Lab at UCB and expand to Voigt Lab at UCSF. It is our goal to have Clotho be a main software component in each lab. In addition to general robustness, Clotho Beta should also incorporate a few new features as will be described in the following sections:
New Features
A Biomek 3000, similar to the one we'll be working with in the lab
New design views to supplement the Sequence View and allow easier designing of basic and composite BioBrick parts. This will likely include a ""schematic view"" for assembling parts, similar to the one in BioJade . We would also like to explore a ""parts view"" where the individual parts have associated icons. A design now no longer becomes writing nucleotide sequences but rather dragging around icons which have sequence data associated with them.
Ability to interface with devices, including robots that can be used for automated production of parts designed in Clotho. (In the future, this will contain a link to Anderson Lab's Biomek robot.) This aspect will be tied to the assembly algorithms already in Clotho. These algorithms will be expanded upon to deal with other assembly issues such as tracking methylated ""righty"" and ""lefty"" parts.
Increased support for other interchange format standards such as GFF3 . This will allow us to begin to interface with such tools as BioStudio.
Improved Features:
More database support: we plan to expand the number and variety of databases that Clotho can connect to, including BrickIt! ) and the JBEI registry.  One of the databases at the top of our priority list is iGEM's own Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
Improved Plug-in environment that allows users to add even"

Figure 3: The minION device used for the sequencing.
The second approach used a technique called “Phage Display”, which utilizes a random peptide library expressed on the surface of phages. By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple peptide suggestions that may bind to our nematodes’ surface proteins.  This would allow the biosensor to aggregate at the detection sites and create a stronger signal.
In our project, phage display has been used in a whole new way. Performing phage display on a whole organism is an unconventional and unpublished procedure. By creating a working protocol for the purpose of finding a specific binder for strongyles we have applied this Nobel-prize winning method in a new way

3. Reporter System
After receiving the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, they need to be combined with a reported to get a functioning diagnostic tool (Worm Buster).  We have adapted and troubleshot the expression of a fluorescent chromoprotein, UnaG, to be able to detect our worms in both the intestines and in feces. This would enable a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect the worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
In order to make this a viable reporter system, we wanted to make sure the original biobrick part was functional.  We show how we tweaked this part in order to study if it works properly so that it could be potentially used in future studies.

A good model is a great tool to study the simplified behaviour of a real world problem. Often it can be more a practical, time, and cost efficient way to study the model of the real world system. We aim to showing the economic impact of strongyles and anthelmintic resistance through this study.
Modeling Optimal Time Between Treatments
To make sure the unnecessary use of anthelmintics is minimized we have created a model that compares regular and optimal usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimal use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment"

Outreach and Human Practices
The Missouri S&T iGEM team is highly involved in outreach and human practices events on our campus, in our community, and within our region of the state.  It is our goal to use these events to build awareness about our team and our role in promoting research in the field of synthetic biology.  We have hosted educational events, ethical discussions, and outreach events to recruit new members.  If you would like more information involving our team’s outreach activities, please contact our Public Relations Officer, Katie Nelson at klnyb5@mst.edu.
Exploring Synthetic Biology
Exploring Synthetic Biology is an annual event that we use to educate the campus body about synthetic biology and its applications.  At this event, we describe our team, the basics of how synthetic biology research is conducted, and how this knowledge can be used to better our world.  To better facilitate the students’ understanding of the subject we had them perform several hands-on activities such as a wheat germ DNA extraction and a simple pipe cleaner plasmid modeling exercise (courtesy of the iGEM British Columbia 2011 community brick activity).  Students reported an increase in understanding and appreciation for synthetic biology following the event, and they also said that it was a lot of fun!
The Science behind ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks""
Freshmen at Missouri S&T that are enrolled in their basic English course participate in the “One Book Program”.  In this program, all of these English courses are dedicated to the study and interpretation of a single piece of modern literature.  For the past two years, the book studied has been The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot.  The novel details the story of Henrietta Lacks, the unknowing tissue donor that led to the famous HeLa cell line that has become a staple in biological labs across the world.  But despite the fame of her cells, little is known about Ms. Lacks or the ethical, racial, and economical implications of her story.  This narrative is explored as Ms. Skloot’s account of family interviews and paper trails is weaved together into a fascinating story.
The Missouri S&T iGEM Team saw this as a prime opportunity to reach out to the new students on campus.  While the book"

A subsequent conversation with Dr. Eliasson focused on more acutely addressing our primary stakeholders’ needs. Based on prior confirmations and confirmation from both patient and healthcare professionals, we had identified another critical lag in the traditional diagnostics journey. In post-therapy monitoring, there is often a significant decrease in communication between the doctors and patients, and this lack of post-treatment symptoms reporting can be crucial in judging if the treatment was successful. We wanted to address this, and based on the trends of digital health, our team had the idea to develop a digital health platform . Talking to Dr. Eliasson helped us understand the key components, especially personalization and the ability to give actionable information for both the healthcare professional and the patient.
Takeaway:
Our conversations with Dr. Eliasson led us to believe that implementing this digital health platform would give us a novel beginning to end workflow for the liquid biopsy space. His advice really helped us make functional prototypes of our platform for the Jamboree and will continue guiding us as we optimize it in our post-iGEM journey. In addition, reviewing our conversations with Dr. Eliasson allowed us to come up with a completely novel use case that leverages hypermethylation as a continuum.  To address the emotional toll that family members and patients experience about the anxiety of knowing whether treatments are working or not, we could use hypermethylation and its correlation with tumor burden to see if any individual was responding to treatment, thus decreasing an economic burden as well.
Harry Gandhi, founder at Medella Health
Our conversation with Harry was centered around understanding the intricacies of smartphone diagnostics. One of the key concerns that patients expressed when approached about the idea of using smartphone applications as platforms for personalized medicine and health tracking was the possibility that confidential medical data would be released. In addition, he also wanted us to focus on having a clean design for the actual interface and try to address as many pain points for HCPs and patients as possible. Although Harry is more involved in the technical deployment of the sensors, he was still able to provide guidance about the security protocols . We had a robust discussion about the importance of complying with HIPPAA regulations as well as the GDPR rules recently passed by the EU. He appreciated the novelty of our vision and looked forward to seeing a prototype.
Takeaway:
Talking with Harry gave us a good opportunity to understand the debate of ethics that has engulfed many digital health efforts. Although the issue cannot be resolved with a simple yes or no answer, we felt that it was vital to our best to understand these concerns and plan our strategy accordingly.

Plants as Plants: natural factories producing fuel, plastic, flavoring, and more
Welcome, to the Penn State iGEM wiki page! This year our team took on the challenge of working with plants.  Through several projects we hope to help characterize key plant parts and demonstrate the ability of plants to be used as natural factories.  Below you will find a short description of the our projects, for more information please refer to the ""Projects"" page linked on the left of the screen.
Promoter Project
As plants are still novel organisms for most of synthetic biology, we we are interested in developing methods of control for our projects. Currently the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter is the most widely used plant promoter. In hopes of increasing the availability of plant promoters, our project aims at testing viral promoters due to their relative efficiency, as well as cytoskeletal protein promoters due to their natural abundance.  Testing these promoters in parallel with the CaMV 35S will create a plant promoter catalog which can be used for future iGEMers exploration of plant synthetic biology.
Cas9 Project
A CRISPR/cas9 system is a large protein guided by a self-guiding RNA, which is capable of targeting specific DNA sequences. Cas9 has been characterized previously in bacteria and mammalian cells.  Often targeted to a promoter region, Cas9 acts as highly effective gene repressing tool.  The goal of the cas9 project is to make this regulatory tool available to plant genetic engineering.
Cellulose Synthase (Cesa) Project
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth and is incredibly valuable for multiple uses including paper, cellophane, and biofuel. Although cellulose in everywhere, we are still limited by the amount of production by the plants and constantly use more. The goal of our experiment is to introduce a secondary cell wall cellulose synthase complex into the primary cell wall to ultimately increase the production of cellulose in plants. Our hope is that if we use a primary cell wall promoter followed by secondary CesA’s (Cellulose Synthases) in Arabidopsis thaliana, we can produce more cellulose and create stronger plants.
Butanol Project
The butanol project’s goal is to synthetically produce the enzymes that make up the University of California’s cyanobacteria pathway to produce n-butanol within physcomitrella. Thereby making a plant directly produce"

Specification - Preventing Horizontal Gene Transfer
As part of our human practices work, we need to consider what will happen in the event that our modified bacteria are released into the soil. The potential consequences of their release relate to their uncontrolled spread and the possibility that they pass on the auxin genes to naturally occurring soil bacteria.
The auxin compound that we are using is the natural indole-3-acetic acid, which is not used as a herbicide like many other synthetic auxins. However, in high concentrations, indole-3-acetic acid can retard plant growth - as shown in our experiments.
While there are already a few species of bacteria that are able to secrete auxin[1], it would be careless of us to release our bacteria without giving some thought to a containment device. So
The Gene Guard Design
We have implemented the Holin/Anti-Holin regulated kill switch designed by the Berkeley 2008 iGEM team to create a system limiting horizontal gene transfer. Holin is a protein that forms pores in cell membranes and anti-holin binds to holin, inhibiting it's action. Once pores are formed by holin, lysozyme can access the periplasmic space and degrade the cell wall, causing cell lysis.
In the BacTrap system, the antiholin gene will be on the genome of our engineered bacteria under the control of a strong promoter. The Holin and Lysozyme genes will be present on the same plasmid as the two auxin genes and the chemoreceptor gene. The idea here is that the presence of the antiholin will prevent the cell from lysing from the effects of holin and lysozyme. In a different cell, i.e., one that does not have antiholin on its genome, the antiholin and lysozyme will kill the cell, preventing it from keeping the plasmid containing the auxin genes. This mechanism will prevent"

Meet Mrs. Lupita Cohnnie!
“Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya. She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees. She gets the women to plant new trees and water them, drop by drop. In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest, the soil is enriched, and the village is saved. The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down. Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy. For every dollar given to a women's program, 20 dollars are given to men's programs. Women are 51 percent of humankind. Empowering them will change everything -- more than technology and design and entertainment. I can promise you that women working together -- linked, informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet. In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians, mainly women and children. They are collateral damage. Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.”

An avid rock climber, she enjoys scaling the formidable walls to attune herself with the Earth.  She is also learned in song and dance, particularly the style of Bhangra, for which she has joined Cornell’s Bhangra team and has had much success.  But above all, she is a defender of nature; a hero to us all.
Jeffrey Ly
From the moment Jeffrey was born, he knew he was destined to join the Cornell iGEM team. Two years later, he was successfully recruited. His youth isn't all drawback: his energy rivals that of his best friend and mentor, the energizer bunny, and it allows him to be more on top of things than most people. It has also earned him a place on the team as director of all things requiring enthusiasm. His other responsibilities include optimizing his teammates' vacation schedules and cheering up cells recovering from transformation. You may say he's a dreamer, but he is the only one.  Isn't he cool?
Tim Abbott
Tim Abbott was the original cybernetic organism from which James Cameron based the terminator upon. He was sent back in time from a post-apocalyptic future in an effort to protect members of the Cornell iGEM team which would go on to design a novel metal sequestration fiber reactor. Once the war would break out between artificially intelligent machines and humans, humans would hold their own for a surprising amount of time. But their greatest downfall would come when the machines contaminated all the world’s water supplies with heavy metals. By successfully aiding the 2014 iGEM team in completing their metal sequestration fiber reactor, Tim effectively has ensured the future of all of mankind.

As a senior member of Cornell iGEM, Shawn imparts his vast stores of worldly knowledge onto the ‘youngins, sometimes dropping some advice on a sick double clutch fadeaway he saw Kobe perform once, other times, schooling teammates on the intricacies of synthetic biology.  As a chemistry/biology double major, Shawn is clearly a mad-man and should not be approached under any circumstances, unless you come bearing naval oranges, his favorite fruit.  Perhaps one of the more intriguing facts about Shawn is that every car model with an “"
Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," growers and a consultant for cannabis businesses; we also talked with the founder of Confident Cannabis, a company that provides software for cannabis testing labs. One interesting problem was aflatoxin contamination, which is caused by a fungus called aspergillus flavus. It is very common for aspergillus to grow on leaves, but there is currently no good way to distinguish benign strains from strains that produce aflatoxin. Aflatoxin is only tested for when the harvest is being processed, and if it is detected, then that batch must be destroyed. Based on this need, we decided to develop a way to detect aflatoxin on living cannabis plants so that growers could remedy the problem by removing contaminated plants before losing their whole harvest.
REFINING OUR PROJECT
We started our research by looking at previous iGEM projects relating to aflatoxin detection. We were particularly struck by the work of the 2017 Tsinghua team, which adapted a yeast two-hybrid system for small molecule detection instead of protein screening. Initially, our plan was to port their system from yeast into bacillus subtilis, a non-pathogenic bacteria that naturally colonizes cannabis leaves, so that our detection system could live on the leaves of plants as they grow and produce an easily visible reporter in response to aflatoxin.
However, we soon realized that this was not a realistic idea. After getting more information from the 2017 Tsinghua team and consulting with grad student mentors, we realized that the original yeast two-hybrid for aflatoxin detection was not as successful as we had thought, and was unlikely to be successful. Instead, we decided to expand upon the system and develop a three-pronged modular approach to detecting not only small molecules like aflatoxin, but also DNA and protein. We were excited by this system because it allowed us to initiate transcription in response to detection, opening the possibility of producing therapeutic proteins in the presence of specific signal molecules. To better understand the uses for this new technology, we talked with our potential users. We met several times with a researcher and consultant working on early detection of liver cancer; he helped clarify potential detection targets and the need for improved diagnostic tools. We also talked with a senior scientist at New England Biolabs about potential use cases in strain engineering. These conversations gave us the confidence to go ahead with our project and implement our ideas, knowing that they were still addressing a need.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," Escherichia coli codon usage ( BBa_K2020000 ). Once introduced into E. coli, this BioBrick is able to produce subtilisin E, an alkaline serine protease, which non-specifically digests proteins, and simultaneously secrets the enzyme into the periplasm of the cell. Caused by the lacI regulated promoter BBa_R0010 , the expression system can be induced by addition of IPTG. With the iGEM promoter BBa_R0011 , which was integrated in our sequence at first, it was not possible to successfully express subtilisin E due to fatal mutations inside the expression system in all analyzed colonies. Either there have been single base deletions or insertions in the pro-peptide, which led to a frameshift of the whole protein, or a 23 base pair deletion in the promoter. Both types of mutations result in an incorrect expression system, so that an expression of the protease is impossible. Since the promoter BBa_R0011 is leaky and induces the expression even without addition of IPTG, it can be assumed that subtilisin E is toxic for E. coli. Hence, we exchanged the promoter against BBa_R0010 . For achieving this, we carried out a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to extract everything but the promoter and the RBS and simultaneously extend the remaining DNA sequence with the pre-fix of iGEM. Afterwards, we assembled it with the BioBrick J04500 and in parallel cloned it into the vector pSB1C3 - by cutting RFP out of the BioBrick J04450 . The implemented BioBrick J04500 itself contains another IPTG inducible promoter ( BBa_R0010 ) and the same RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). An expression with the newly integrated promoter BBa_R0010 led to a colony with the correct sequence in opposition to our trial of gaining a positive clone while working with the first promoter BBa_R0011 . We continued our experiments by performing a skim milk assay on agar plates. Therefore, we poured LB skim milk agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotic and streaked out the E. coli BL21 cells containing the plasmid with the expression system.

An important aspect was to focus on safety with a presentation of the individual protective clothing (glasses, gloves and gown).
To finish, the students laid their hands before and after washing them on a petri dish containing LB + agar in order to observe the importance of hand washing.
The vast majority of students showed curiosity and asked many questions.
Group 2 : Microbioworld
The discovery of the microbial world was also made through the card game “Microbioworld”. In teams of 2 to 4, the students played one of the 6 strains of the game. Although some rules and some concepts were not understood from the beginning, the students quickly took to the game. At the end of the game different ideas were discussed: the differences between the culture media, different resistance of microorganisms and plasmids, different characteristics of microorganisms (pathogenic or not, gram positive or negative). These ideas were sometimes simplified for the sake of clarity for this young audience.
Group 3: “Microbes: Bacteria and Viruses”
Figure 1: Kids drawing bacteria
This part was more like a course in the true sense of the word. The subject of microbes was introduced by questions about pupils’ knowledge (what is a microbe, where can you find them, what do they look like).
To answer the questions raised in the first section, we viewed a video on the differences between viruses and bacteria.
We corrected the previous questions from the video and we clarified the misunderstandings in groups. Then, we visualized photos on a tablet (diagram of the shapes of bacteria and viruses and photos of observations under the microscope).
Finally the students filled out a form where they invented their own microbe.
The students were very interested in this part although it was more conventional. Creating microbes allowed the development of the imagination of the students in quiet work conditions.
Additional reflection
We started the intervention with all 3 groups in the same room. It was not a good idea and we quickly changed it!
We had 2 classes of CM1 in progress, both teachers remained throughout the intervention to help us maintain good working conditions.
Overall agitation was more prevalent in groups 1 and 2 because the activity was more playful. The intervention took place from 9h30 to 12h, it was not possible for group 1 to have their scheduled break.

Team Safety
Due to the nature of our software team, there is relatively little hazard to evaluate in our day to day activities. We are programming tools to be incorporated into iGEM workflows and manipulating genetic sequence data to derive results - as such almost no time is spent in the wetlab by us software team students.
Deinococcus Library Preparation
As part of our project we have coordinated the receipt and library preparation of several experimental Deinococcus strains of bacteria. These strains were cultured by the Daly group at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, pelleted and sent to us. These strains grow very slowly and at temperatures warmer than the human body, so pathogenicity is not a major concern when working with these species. Regardless, DNA was extracted from them inside a biosafety flow hood with a face pressure of over 100 ft / min. The DNA was than taken though Illumina's TruSeq Library Preparation protocol which is used by many researchers and is generally regarded as safe.
iGEM Safety Questions
1. Would any of our software project ideas raise safety issues of any kind?
No, none of our software projects raise research, public, or environmental safety issues other than those already mentioned.
2. Do any of the BioBricks or devices we've made raise safety issues?
No, none of the scripts we've developed raise safety issues (though they will enable future cloning projects..)
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at our institution?
We have departmental approval for our safety policies, and IRB approval is not needed since we don't have human subjects.
4. Do we have any other ideas to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
As a software track team of 2011 iGEM competition it's our goal to design good open source tools that would allow everyone to engineer and understand biology more efficiently. We believe that by making good software tools and data sets available to the broader"

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the CutA protein. The A280 absorbance was read over time as the sample was eluted off the column. The resulting peak shows the elution volumes containing the CutA protein.
COPPER BINDING ASSAY
To begin, our team determined the standard copper concentration curve by measuring the average absorbance of various copper concentration solutions, and determined that the standard curve is linear. We can then relate the absorbance to the amount of copper left in solution; therefore, we can determine how efficient the metal binding proteins are, how many ions can be removed, the protein activity, optimal concentration of binding and optimal time of binding.
Figure 4 - Graph of standard copper concentration curve. Measured standard concentrations of copper in solution to provide a frame of reference for future copper binding assay.
Figure 5 - Graph demonstrating the absorbance of the copper solution after CutA (copper binding protein) was introduced as a function of time. Measured absorbance over various time intervals and determined that the optimal time is 60 minutes, and the optimal concentration is 151mg/L.
We added the CutA protein to the copper solutions and left the samples for several time intervals. After the given time intervals, the process of salting out was used to aggregate the remaining proteins in the solution while they remained bound to the copper. Then, following centrifugation, we measured the absorbance of the remaining solution, making sure to minimize capturing protein from the sample.  At approximately an hour the absorbance was lowest in all samples demonstrating that the most copper was bound at that point. The concentration at 151mg/L seems to show the optimal amount of binding over time.  However, our data does not show a significant change in absorbance and therefore there is not a significant change in the amount of copper ions being bound by the protein . This is likely because there was not enough protein being introduced into the reaction during our assay. To validate this idea we created a model demonstrating the binding events in our assay. This model showed that insufficient amounts proteins were indeed the issue and is explained more in depth on the modelling page. (Click here to view modelling page)
BACTERIOPHAGE ASSAY
The relationship between bacteriophage and bacteria is crucial to the implementation of our project. To demonstrate this relationship and help to improve our mathematical modelling, we completed a phage assay. We used a 96 well plate and filled various wells with a specific amounts of bacteria. Then introducing various concentrations of phage to specific wells, and using a plate reader we measured the absorbance during 23 hours.

In addition, plac is a fully functional part which act as a substitution to pluxL, preventing pluxL from inhibition of the AHL-LuxR complex, what’s more, releasing the negative influence on the expression of LuxR.  Based on this enhanced E.coli quorum sensing system, we got a innovative method for specific metal ions detection. The highlight is that we combine MerR and relevant promoter sequence pMerT to the downstream of luxI. The MerR family of metal-binding, metal-responsive proteins is unique in that they activate transcription from unusual promoters and coordinate metals through cysteine residues. They have conserved primary structures yet can effectively discriminate metals in vivo. Expression of MerR (in the absence of MerR and Hg (II) in the cell) proceeds from the PmerR promoter.  In the absence of Hg(II), the MerR homodimer binds to the operator region within  the divergent  promoter  with binding centered on the dyad symmetrical DNA sequence between the -35 and -10 sequences of  PmerT, slightly repressing transcription of the structural gene promoter, and repressing transcription of merR from the PmerR promoter.  Once the MerR homodimer has bound to merOP, recruitment of RNAP to the mer promoter occurs , and MerR has been shown to cross-link to several subunits of RNAP .  In the presence of mercuric ions, one Hg(II) per MerR homodimer coordinates in a trigonal manner to three essential cysteine residues of the MerR homodimer, two cysteines from one monomer, and one from the other. Hg(II) binding to the MerR homodimer results in both a relaxation of the DNA bends induced by apo-MerR, and both DNA distortion and an allosteric under winding of the promoter sequence by approximately 33. The under winding of the promoter DNA aligns the -10 and -35 sequences, such that RNA polymerase can recognize and bind to these sites, initiating transcription from PmerT .  The reporter gene we apply is gfp ,which also depends on the transcription of the same promoter pMerT. According to the design, we intended to make best use of the recombinant E.coli quorum sensing system to increase the bacteria density to a threshold value and produce a sufficient amount of AHL and LuxR protein, forming a continuous"

Biological Safety
As per the rules of iGEM, we stay away from all level three and four organisms, as they could cause serious harm to us
We also use mechanical pipettes not only to ensure better measurements but to increase control (2 for 1!)
We also get a two for one when we properly dispose of our pipette tips and beads: It keeps our lab clean and keeps bacteria under control
Wiping the work bench routinely with a disinfectant is also good for keeping bacteria under control and out of our experiment. It also keeps our bench clean
While this may seem like the most obvious, it is arguably one of the most important. No food or drink should be in the lab. If we need to eat a snack, there is a lounge just down the hall that we can go to and eat

03. China iGEM Southwest Union (iSWU)
On the basis of iGEM teams in southwestern China, the China iGEM Southwest Union（iSWU）, which was                     founded in 2015, devoted itself to exchanging the knowledge and optimizing the methods of synthetic                     biology, aiming at accelerating the popularization and development of iGEM competition. In 2018, for                     the further cooperation and optimization of projects, the China iGEM Southwest Union meet-up was hosted                     in June by the team “SiCAU-China” in Ya'an Campus of Sichuan Agricultural University, Ya’an, Sichuan.                     This year, the union was composed of iGEMers from University of Sichuan Agricultural University（SiCAU-China）,                     University of Sichuan (SCU-China ) and University of Electronic Science and Technology (UEST-China & UEST-software).

iSWU meet-up was held ahead of experiments this year which aimed at enhancing allied communication                     and cooperation to achieve the optimization of an experimental project. In the iSWU meet-up, each iGEM                     team gave a presentation of the project. After each presentation, there would be a Q&A session, where                     audiences could raise questions or offer advice about steps interested in. Via these communications,                     we knew the process and dilemma of other projects while discovered the shortage of our project.

We created fire retardant bacteria, any concerns about the application?
We would like to apply our prototype of fire retardant protein/bacteria to paint and textile industries. We didn’t perform any test with purified proteins so far because of time and cost. We recommend the proteins have better to be purified before any application. If you want to use them as paint, you can just dry and kill them completely like what we did in our test. Furthermore, we’re planning to collaborate with the KraigLabs to make GE silkworm to produce fire retardant fibers by putting the SR genes into the host.
 
 
Will there be any biological material escape from our lab?
1) We always killed all the materials including bacteria by standard autoclave procedure before letting them leave the lab.
 
2) The model of wooden house coated with fire retardant bacteria was dried completely in the oven at 100 for over 30 min. All the bacteria are supposed to be killed by the procedure. The fire retardant effectiveness is based on the composition of the contents, and it still works well after killing the bacteria or decomposing the proteins.

The results obtained from the blot showed no presence of lanosterol synthase at 83kDa, suggesting we are only detecting a degraded version of it instead of the whole enzyme. The purification conditions will have to be optimized in order to continue with our fingerprint aging device.
Future Work
After purification and characterisation, through site-specific mutagenesis, the active sites (positions 232 and 455) will have to be inactivated to guarantee that the enzyme wouldn’t destroy any vital evidence on the scene or convert the present squalene epoxide into lanosterol.

Therefore, we replaced GFP with blue                     chromoprotein (amilCP encoded protein) for visual detection. On the one hand, amilCP expression is                     less affected by temperature and is a more stable reporter than GFP. On the other hand, blue                     chromoprotein can be visualized by human eyes, instead of requiring the special equipment.                     Therefore, we believe that our improved part BBa_K2817007 is very beneficial to farmers.
According to the results of the ShanghaiTechChina_B                         2016 team , 100μM Sodium Nitroprusside Dihydrate (SNP) aqueous solution can continually                     release NO, and the NO concentration is stable at about 5.5μM. Since our project also tested for                     inflammatory signals, we chose this concentration before testing for BBa_K381001 and BBa_K2817007 .
The construction of BBa_K381001 can be seen from Figure 1A. We transformed the plasmid containing                     BBa_K381001 into DH5α competent E. coli strain and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to OD600 =                     0.4. Then we took half of the bacteria as control and the rest was added SNP aqueous solution, and                     induced at 37 ℃ for 6 h. Then the fluorescence intensity of cells was observed under microplate                     reader (Figure 1B) and fluorescence inverted microscope (Figure 1C). The histogram of GFP                     fluorescent density and microscope images indicated that PyeaR could be effectively activated by NO                     and there was almost no leakage expression.

Project Description
Issue
In many developing countries, rapid urbanization leaves people with limited access to cooking facilities, resulting in a large dependence on reasonably priced and conveniently available street foods. These foods, however, pose a high risk of food poisoning due to microbial contamination. According to WHO statistics, food poisoning kills 420,000 people a year worldwide[1]. One of the primary microbial contaminants is the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (or E. coli) O157:H7 (STEC). These particular pathogenic bacteria cause severe diseases in humans worldwide by secreting a toxin called Shiga-like toxin (SLT). Research shows that E. coli causes 73,000 illnesses in the United States every year. It is even estimated that STEC causes 2,801,000 acute illnesses worldwide annually, leading to 3890 cases of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, 270 cases of End-stage renal disease, and 230 deaths[2]. Currently, Shiga toxin detection must be conducted in a laboratory environment utilizing time-consuming PCR and assay techniques, so consumers have no way of protecting themselves without strong legislation.
Project
Lack of action taken by governments and street food vendors in developing countries lead to the prevalence of street food-related illnesses, and call for the necessity of consumer awareness. Ultimately, our project is to create a device that would detect the Shiga-like toxin in foods more conveniently and more quickly than current available methods.
Shiga-like toxins are exotoxins, which consist of a toxic enzymatic A subunit and a cell-binding B subunit. The latter binds to a globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor, expressed on the surface of the target cells[3]. This interaction is responsible for the toxin's entry into the host cell. Through our device, we exploit the binding of Gb3 to subunit B and compare the migration pattern of the bound Gb3-subunit B complex to a non bound subunit B. A shift in migration pattern on a PAGE gel will occur when Gb3 is bound indicating the presence of the toxin in the food sample. If no shift occurs in the SLT migration pattern, this implies the absence of the toxin within the sample, and reflects the safety"

-We worked as a team and set up the CRISPR test
-So I was involved in everything that Garrett talked about above
Garrett Jensen - 9/11/2014
- Our plates had some interesting results. The controls did not grow, but that was because we plated both strain B and DB5a on Cam+Amp plates. The dilute phage plates did not have much growth. T7 phage pretty well wiped out the E. coli. The spot test plates also had big plaques. The interesting result was that there were many colonies growing inside of the plaques on every single plate.
- The lack of CRISPR function could be attributed to a number of different things: We could have designed the T7 spacer region wrong, the T7 phage we used may have a mutation where we chose"
Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," following chemical reaction C2H5OH + O2 → CH3CHO + H2O2 and generates hydrogen peroxide. We’d like to measure the production of hydrogen peroxide to demonstrate AOX enzyme activity. Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit of Sigma-Aldrich was used for the study. In the kit, the red peroxidase substrate is designed to react with hydrogen peroxide to generate red fluorescence signal that can be detected at Ex/Em = 540/590 nm in the microplate reader. First, a serial dilution of hydrogen peroxide was tested to see if the kit works in our lab. As Figure 3 showed, the three-fold serial dilutions of hydrogen peroxide from 10 to 0.014 μM were linearly correlated to red fluorescence intensity, demonstrating H2O2 concentration can be measured using this kit in our lab.
Figure 3: H2O2 assay. The concentrations (μM) of hydrogen peroxide were measured at red fluorescence intensity unit (RFU) [Ex/Em = 540/590 nm]. The serial dilutions of hydrogen peroxide were tested and correlated to red fluorescence intensity.
 
 
Next, we examined the activity of AOX enzyme by measuring H2O2 production from the oxidation of ethanol. We prepared 1ml of overnight cultured E. coli displaying LO-AOX enzyme. The bacteria were centrifuged and resolved in Assay Buffer provided by the Sigma-Aldrich kit. Then, the resulting lysates were mixed with the increasing concentrations of ethanol from 0%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.10%, 0.15% to 0.2% for 3 minutes at room temperature. The tested alcohol concentrations were at the range from 0.03% (the alcohol law limit for safety driving) to 0.2% (people may lose consciousness at this level). The following procedure was according to the manufacture’s instruction. The data were read out at Ex/Em = 540/590 nm in the microplate reader (BioTek Microplate Spectrophotometer). As Figure 4 showed, the intensities of AOX activity were significantly and linearly correlated to the concentration of ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicated that LO-AOX enzyme we produced has a functional enzyme activity and reacted with alcohol concentration dose-dependently, implying we can use this assay to measure the unknown sample of alcohol. Although we cannot make sure whether AOX enzyme was displayed on the cell surface of E. coli or not"

Our Project
The aim of our project was to develop a cell-free detection system for congenital Chagas disease in the acute phase by detecting the cruzipain in the blood.  Congenital Chagas disease is a growing global concern and at present, the acute phase of Chagas disease is difficult to diagnose as it is asymptomatic and current diagnostics are both expensive and inaccessible to the majority of those affected. Our final diagnostic kit would allow Chagas disease to be detected by preventing the clotting of a blood sample.
We imagine that this system would be adaptable for other parasites and pathogens which have similar difficulties in detection, both in the input for the system and the options for output.

Function overview
After the effective Toxin was coated by CNC, we need a convenient device to place our poison in. One of our goals is to kill all termites in a house. In order to be easier for the users to clean it up for a second use the device is designed to be removable. Meanwhile, all units of the device must be standardized so that we can change the alluring part into the killing part directly. Here is our device and it works in three aspects.
Monitor
In fact, we made a big improvement about our device on the monitor unit recently. In the last version, we used a compressed spring which is connected to a thin wooden block. Once termites eat the block, the string will elongate and another wooden block will get out of the device to alert the users. Further more, we decided to design a digital circuit for customers so that they may discover the situation in a shorter time with less attention paid to the device.
However, when we talked about our device with Prof. Mo, an expert on termite control, he told us that when termites eat wood, their secretion flows out and sticks on the wood nearby. Termites will even plug the hole when they go through it. This makes it difficult for our monitor unit to work.

HKU-HKBU,2009,Team:HKU-HKBU#team_-_-_TEXT.html," Bosco
Hi, my name is Bosco and i am a year 2 student at HKU reading biochemistry and chemistry. During these days working as a member in the HKU_HKBU team, i have learnt a lot about synthetic biology and yet made invaluable friendship from the other members.
I joined this competition not only for learning more about biochemistry, but also the essential lab skills that i need for my studies. Through these months conducting experiments in the lab and holding numerous meetings late, i am very surprised i have survived from all these.
Especially when some of the members went home and there were only few people here in hong kong, we have encountered a very great crisis in human resources. Yet, with all our keen devotion, we have resolved and learnt from problems to problems. I love the days being in the team and the days spent with my teammates, making fun of each other, hard working together without sleeping. Now i just wanna finish our current and can't wait to see us beating up the other teams at MIT (if we were able = =).
To be honest, actually i never emphasized i am the leader of the compeition. As i am a person who don;t want to make the other people shoulder a lot of pressure and i don't want think i am the person with good leading skills.
I just think of myself being a normal member and try to do my best. I know i am not a good leader at all but anyway i feel very grateful for those who gave me support and forgave my wrongdoings during the hard times.  I know i have said a chunk of stuff and i know it is clumsy. The last thing i wanna say is that i am very proud that i have spent time with my friends pursuing a dream during my most busy summer, pursuing a goal that to undergraduate students seems so far away and demanding yet it is the sweetest ,remarkable and memorable dream i have ever had in my life time.
I just love you all!

The LabPats worked on logo design and the abstract as they waited for sequencing results to arrive. Today was the last day for the USAFA team, and the LabPats decided to go out for lunch to treat them before they left. After a tearful goodbye, the students were hopeful to see them later at the Jamboree. They reached out to MIT labs where they had been experimenting with biofilms within the human body. The sequencing results arrived later and Dr. Breedon explained that the backbone had most likely ligated to itself, allowing the cells to grow but not producing the desired results. The LabPats learn the hard way that not everything in SynBio always goes exactly as planned.

T7-const-C2-Lysis + Ptet-GFP
T7-const-C2-Lysis + Ptet-RFP
T7-const-C11-Lysis + Ptet-GFP
T7-const-C11-Lysis + Ptet-RFP
into BL21 using Amp + Kan plates. He used 1 uL of each plasmid.
Vince also prepared a 96 well plate for testing all the randomers (7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18) of T7-RFP and grew it overnight (shaking, with Easy-Breathe paper to let the cells get air).

Nadine's platereader experiment gave disappointing results: the cells didn't grow much, reaching only 0.1-0.2 OD instead of 1 normally. This will be repeated next Tuesday. The minipreps of J6 Ptet-RFP and the T7 biobricks yielded high concentrations, and therefore were sent for sequencing.
Vince made 2 new plates from his ""main"" plate that had grown overnight, and he grew those plates to make them into glycerol stocks. He took the ""main"" plate to the Bioscreening Facility to use their platereader. Meanwhile, he set up a time-lapse, qualitative test of the lysing ability of the C2 culture. We set up two sets of three test tubes, one with C2 induced with 250 uM IPTG and the other un-induced. Here are the photos, and, as you can perhaps see, the last one shows some lysis.
The randomer plate-reader experiment went well and results should be appearing shortly. We used 250 uM IPTG. Vincent made liquid cultures of all 12 of the T7 and T7-lac2 RFP variants for a big plate-reader experiment on Saturday.
Saturday, 10 September 2011
Vincent ran the plate-reader experiment for the 12 T7, T7-lac2 RFP variants, using 250 uM IPTG and 0 uM as a negative control. The induction curves look great, results should be coming in shortly.
Vdog made liquid cultures of T7-C2, T7-C11 and T7-RFP-1 for the lysis platereader experiment.

Next Steps: A sample of the miniprep was sent for sequencing to confirm the presence of LbpA in the pQE80-L vector.
Week Beginning 29/6/15
Summary
Protein expression optimization experiments were performed on LbpA to assay protein production levels. However, cell growth seems to cease when LbpA expression is induced.
1/7: M15pREP4 E.coli Overnight Cultures containing pQE80-L-LbpA
Aim of experiment: To set up overnight cultures in preparation for protein expression experiments tomorrow.
Protocols Used: Overnight Cultures
Results: N/A
Next Steps: The overnight cultures will be used to set up day cultures tomorrow which will be used to test expression of LbpA.
2/7: Optimization of LbpA Expression
Aim of experiment: To set up day cultures and induce expression of LbpA using different concentrations of IPTG and check levels of protein production via SDS-PAGE.
Protocols Used: Protein Expression Optimization
Results: N/A
Next Steps: The samples were stored in the -20oC freezer overnight and will be ran on a gel tomorrow.
3/7: Continuation of Optimization of LbpA Expression
Aim of experiment: To test the samples obtained yesterday on an SDS gel.
Protocols Used: Protein Expression Optimization
Results: Figure 4
Next Steps: Further optimization experiments will be set up next week using different concentrations of IPTG.
Week Beginning 6/7/15
Summary
Further protein expression optimization experiments were set up, this time using a range of IPTG concentrations to induce expression of LbpA.
7/7: Further Optimization of LbpA Expression
Aim of experiment: To set up further tests to optimize expression of LbpA using different concentrations of IPTG.
Protocols Used: Protein Expression Optimization Note: An SDS gel was not ran, instead the OD600 readings were recorded for the uninduced and induced cultures at 20 minute intervals for 2 hours, 1 and half hours after the cultures were induced.
Results: Figure 5
Next Steps: A plate reader experiment will be set up next week to monitor the growth rate of the the cells over a longer period of time after LbpA expression has been induced.
Week Beginning 13/7/15
Summary
Protein expression optimization experiments were continued this week. A growth curve assay was carried out to assess the effect of LbpA expression over a longer period of time.
