OUR TEAM
We are a group of students mostly from Faculty of Biology at Warsaw University, though we also have members from other faculties and universities of Warsaw. Our group is the oldest one in Poland – this will be our 7th time in iGEM. So far we managed to win 6 medals: 2 bronze, 2 silver and 2 gold – the last one in last year’s European competition finals in Lyon for our FluoSafe project. Although we love to spend all our free time in the lab, we also like to talk about science, Doctor Who and upload silly things on facebook.
OUR PROJECT
Our project consists of utilization of two-component system (PmrA-PmrB) from Salmonella enterica, which we used to detect and bind lanthanide ions. Lanthanides is a group of fourteen elements in f block of the periodic table, which unique electronic properties make them irreplaceable in modern industry, such as electronic devices, catalysts and rocket science. Their deposits on Earth are limited, expensive to mine and difficult do refine. Based on work of prof. He’s group from University of Chicago we were able to use mutated version of PmrA-PmrB system, where FeBT (iron-binding tag) was replaced by LBT (lanthanide-binding tag).

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," a higher number of smaller glass slides and assemble them to a column. As we were sure that this would be a practical way to bind, irradiate, and elute our protein of interest, we thought about ways to design a purification column with many parallel glass slides instead of a hollow cylindrical one. This lead to a purification concept in which the surface of the column is crucial for the yield instead of the volume compared to conventional purification techniques.
EluX prototype one. First flow model of a purification column with parallel biotinylated glass slides inside and UV-permeable acrylic glass plates in front and back to enable the radiation with light of 365 nm wave length.
We designed our first flow model of the column by stacking eleven biotinylated microscope slides parallelly above each other separated by blocks of acrylic glass. Two big blocks on top and at the bottom of the column close the system. There are also holes to implement a pump system. To irradiate the slides properly, we used our self-designed LED-panel where a row of LEDs fits precisely between two slides for the front. On the front and back side of the column scaffold, we have adjusted two UV permeable acrylic glass slides to let the light through and seal the column. On the back side, there is an aluminum plate that will reflect the light and thus ensure an evenly irradiation. The individual parts of the column are sealed through rubber. To improve our first model, we talked to some lecturers of protein purification and related fields in order to get some feedback and ideas of how we could increase the efficiency of our column. We were advised to round up the inner sides of the acrylic glass blocks to grant a more evenly flow-through between the glass slides. We got also the required information to choose a matching port that is connectable to the pumps that are used in our labs to make the column compatible to the inventory.
EluX prototype two. Second flow model of a purification column as basis for a workshop and a 3D-printed model to test, evaluate and improve the concept of light induced elution.
Implementing the feedback of the experts mentioned above, we designed our second column version, which we wanted to build and test in a protein purification experiment. The second model contains the rounded inner sides of the scaffold blocks, and holes for threaded rods to tighten and seal the column up. We were able to build this version of our purification column as a self-made 3D-printed model. We also invented the hard- and software of an LED-panel to irradiate the column properly and control the elution process. With this test column,"

Secondly, the previous binding induces the oligomer insertion into the lipid rafts membrane. A formation of ion permeable pore is followed by the insertion which allows small molecules to pass through the membrane. The membrane potential inevitably changes greatly, causing the swelling of cell and finally breaking down. When the cell lysis reaches to a certain degree, the midgut necrosis and epithelial denaturation follow. Then, the alkaline hypertonic inclusions in midgut enters into hemocoel and the pH of haemolymph rises causing paralysis of larvae and finally death. To increase the express level in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii, we synthesis Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii codon optimized Cyt1. Meanwhile, we added 2A peptide sequence at the end of 5’ According to the published paper and the result of Swiss-model, there is no effect to the toxicity of Cry or Cyt.

jacarandasmile@163.com
Cyt2 is cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis BRC-LLP29. It shows specific toxicity to Culex and Aedes by bioassay.Cyt proteins have a single α-β domain which do not bind to receptors but can directly insert into the cell membrane and then form a pore causing cell death. Although Cry and Cyt proteins are two big families of δ-endotoxins, they are far related.Cyt1 and Cyt2 are two types of Cyt proteins found in Bti.. Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple steps. At the beginning in mosquitoes' gut, the crystalline inclusions are cleaved at the disulfide bond to release the Cry pre-toxin. Then the soluble proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins, or known as receptors on the membrane. The binding process takes two step. Firstly, the monomeric Cry toxin binds to cadherin, resulting in the formation of pre-pore oligomer

Indigoidine. Proving Modularity of NRPS by Shuffling Domains.
Highlights
Endogenous PPTase of E. coli was proven sufficient for activation of the P. lumninescens derived indigoidine synthetase indC
Production of Indigoidine is improved by co-transformation of host strain with supplementary PPTases
Synthetic T-Domains generated by consensus and guided random design yield functional indigoidine synthetases
Domain shuffling works across modules derived from different pathways and host organisms
Strong influence on the yield of indigoidine production was proven for the interaction of PPTase and T-domains
Abstract
An integral characteristic of synthetic biology yet often undermined is the ability to learn fundamental knowledge by systematically perturbing a biological system. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are predestinated for such a trial and error approach. Their hierarchical organization into modules and domains offer a unique opportunity to spin around their inherent logical assembly and observe if their functionality is preserved.                             Following this idea, we prove the interchangeability of NRPS domains at the example of indC from Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii TT01 (DSM15139). The native NRPS domains have been replaced with domains from other bacterial organisms and fully synthetic domains. To quantify the NRPS efficiency we established an indigoidine assay based on OD measurement of the blue-colored pigment. Interestingly, we find that our data points out the dependence on the T-domain and the 4'-Phosphopanthetheinyl-transferases (PPTases), resulting in different levels of indigoidine synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce HiCT"

During the discussion, both of the two teams came up with some great ideas on human practice, such as activities on the Associations Opening day and building up an official account on WeChat.
Team members of SCAU-China suggested us to make a short funny video to explain our project or to introduce our team.
Associations Opening Day
We applied for a booth at Associations Opening Day, which is held by Guangdong Experimental high school and available to visitors all over Guangzhou, to enrich high school students' knowledge about iGEM and synthetic biology.
Through our posters and leaflets designed and manufactured before Associations Opening Day, people could be introduced to our project. A great many students are filled with curiosity and interests about our project after reading them.
A wide range of special activities are offered by us during the Associations Opening Day, including being introduced about our team, using optical microscopes, and asking questions that would be responded to as well as answered immediately. For introduction of our team, we produced posters of two kinds. One was descriptions about iGEM, synthetic biology and our project, the other was mainly constituted by some photos showing our presentation and experiment. Two of our teammates were standing close to the posters to explain the details and answer the questions.
Optical microscope is one of the most common apparatus in biology experiments. We borrowed some mountings from Sun Yat-Sen University ,and took advantage of optical microscopes from Guangdong Experimental high school.
Moreover, we prepare some simple questions about biology. If students was able to answer two of them correctly, they can get a postcard designed by our teammates.
Through the Associations Opening Day, we enable students to have some standard concepts about iGEM and a bit primary knowledge about synthetic biology.  Last but no least, we acquaint them with our project and our potential contributions.
Some legal questions
According to insiders in specific fields, there are explicit safety management laws about agricultural genetically modified organisms. Forestry somehow lacks of specific regulations because of special reasons, such as the growing cycle of woods. However, forestry problems may refer to agricultural regulations.
1.May our project refer to some legal questions?
It can be referring to genetically modified organisms safety multi-system management. There are specific safety management laws such as regulations on Administration of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety, Measures for the administration of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety, Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety evaluation management approach, Implementation Regulations on the Safety of Import of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms, Measures for the management of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms processing, etc.

It was also very interesting to know that students had to categorize the smell of bananas on how strong the smell is, so on the right, there is a gradient of strength of banana smells! I did smell those and the strength of the weakest one to the strongest one is very different!
June 6: Diamond Spin
My topic is on the macro-development of the beast. I’m super excited to learn about the beast. As I researched for other similar systems that have been developed, I learned that many researchers are aware of the idea of a multitouch table, however, the topic is so new that people are still trying to figure out what is the best way to use a tool like this (or if there is even a best way). There wasn’t really much about a system as big as our beast, making the idea of getting the chance to work with the beast very exciting to me.
During research, I found this app called DiamondSpin, and it’s super cool. It addresses the idea of seeing/ moving objects around different side of the table. It also addresses the idea of what space is public/ private/ important in relation to the workflow.
Feel free to check out ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok1n0lwY1ZA ). It’s pretty cool!
June 7: Interaction with the BEAST
In research today, we finalized our presentation on interactions with the Beast (aka. our bed-sized tabletop) the Beast and everything that I read finally seems to come together. I learned that there are so many different systems out there, but there is so much more you can do with it! Everything that you dreamed of as a computer is totally possible, and it’s probably something that people are already working towards!
For example, today, I learned about Kinect, which senses human as a blob. However, if we represent a human being as joints and points, we can have finer movements. And by connecting the Kinect to a tabletop (with the appropriate software/ apps), we will be able to use gestures to control the tabletop surface without having to touch it.
There are just so much cool things out there! It’s amazing.

It’s obvious that it changes a lot（circle in red）of the position and number of spores in the observing area of wild-type Metarhizium anisopliae 128 experimental groups.
Fig.5 One of the Metarhizium anisopliae HsbA transformant groups: P3 is the picture before treated and P4 is the picture after treated. The spores quantity is 42 in P3 and 52 in P4. And there are 41 spores left that have not been washed away and moved. The adherence rate is 41/42=97.6%
It’s obvious that there is almost no change except for the place (circled in red) in the position and number of spores in the observing area of Metarhizium anisopliae HsbA transformant experimental groups.
Finally, the following chart (Fig.6) can be obtained by statistical data of four areas in all experimental groups.
Fig.6 M.a128 is the wild-type Metarhizium anisopliae 128 groups, and the adherence rate in average is 26.7%. HsbA is the Metarhizium anisopliae 128 HsbA transformant groups, and the adherence rate in average is 97.7%.
In conclusion, this result confirmed that Metarhizium anisopliae HsbA transformant certainly enhanced the capacity of adhesion.
Penetration: Bbchit
In order to make Metarhizium anisopliae penetrate the cockroach's body wall more efficiently, we transferred Bbchit( BBa_K2788001 ), a gene from Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860, which encodes chitinase that can be secreted extracellularly[2]. Chitin decomposes, thereby cockroach body wall destroys, finally fungus enters the hemolymph.(Fig.7)

We then retransformed the most critical parts (inducible tolR, and periplasm-localising GFP) into the cloning strain on Sunday. Sunday also saw us screen some of the old colonies from several weeks back for their parts, to try and start putting together our BioBricks for submission
Characterisation Team
On Thursday and Friday, Michael Carnell trained Charlotte and Gavin in how to use the Zeiss LSM 780, a confocal microscope. Each session was around three hours in length, covering the theoretical underpinnings, advantages, required sample treatment, parameters to consider, and use of the machine.
Week 16: September 12 - September 18
CRISPR Team
We used colony PCR to screen 11 colonies that were potential degP knockouts, but none showed the band size for which we were hoping.
Overexpression Team
The glut of colony screening for this week began on Monday. As more sequencing results came back as junk, we began rescreening more tolR and g3p transformants. The new transformants of the critical inducible and periplasm-localising parts were also screened. Then, on Thursday, we received two new plasmids: pET-Duet, and pRSF-Duet. We transformed these into our cloning strain, to start building up a stock with which we can start working. Much of our time was then devoted to designing primers to make our existing parts compatible with these Duet plasmids, as our intention next week is to start cloning our genes into this, and hopefully successfully express that way
Week 17: September 19 - September 25
CRISPR Team
We set aside Tuesday for another growth rate analysis of our Cas9-edited cells, as per Week 15. Again, the data were inconclusive, leaving us with no direction for this part of the project
Overexpression Team
Starting Monday, we began rescreening colonies to find those bearing our T7-controlled construct. We hit various snags, as colony PCRs using VF2 and VR revealed multiple bands of the same size across all 7 colonies screened. We then miniprepped all these colonies, and performed the same PCR on the pure plasmid template, but saw the same pattern of bands; the consistency of this perhaps hinted at contamination of the primers, but more than likely it was due to some quirk of the sequence. We found out the VR binds two locations (once at its correct site"

Modelling
An interesting question when you are more of a biologist than a mathematician (too many complicated equations!!!). And most of our team members are biologists/biochemists… Thus, we tried to explain modelling and our model in a comprehensive way for everyone.
This is our Biological Modelling for Dummies !

What is modelling ?
Definitions
A model is a symbolic representation of an object’s or a phenomenon’s aspects in the real world.
“All models are false. Some are useful.” Georges Box
Modelling is the process that enables the development of a model. It takes into account [1]:
The phenomenon to represent
A specific formal system (equation, diagram..)
Objectives (what we want to do with the model)
Data (for variables) and knowledge (relation between variables) available or accessible by experimentation or observation
The tasks to obtain and use the model depend on the biological situation and the formal system chosen. Nevertheless, it must:
Have a formalization work, which is the model writing
Manipulate the model in the formal system to describe its properties (theoretical main behavior regardless of the values of the parameters)
Establish relationships with other representations (computer program, graph function)
Interpret and compare different representations obtained in the formal world with the biological reality (often that reality is seen through experimental data)

Biological System description
Situation
After the destruction of the biofilm by “Biofilm Killer” bacteria, we want to have the choice to either create a surfactant or establish a positive biofilm, both to prevent the recolonization of the surface by deleterious organisms. The toggle switch is done by environmental conditions : two inducers can be added to select one behavior or another.
Biological system to model
For this, we have created the following construction, with a double regulation:

and 2 inducers (IPTG and Xylose), and also sfp and abrB genes for Sfp and AbrB proteins.

Erel met with us several times to check the product,laboratory progress and marketing pace.
In his opinion there are two main reasons for investment: emotionally and mentally. One reason is education; the fact of the initiative coming from youth to help other youth is amazing in his personal opinion. As well as the scientific foundation the kit is based on, it is innovative thinking and exceptional in his opinion. Erel Margalit encouraged us because of us being high school students, and especially because we live in the periphery. In his eyes, the exceptional motivation he saw in us was moving and
gives hope to many other students from the periphery.
The second reason was the economic feasibility of the product - the real need for it in the market. The diagnosis of people
with celiac disease is becoming increasingly prevalent in Israel and around the world. The product's ability to accurately and rapidly identify food ingredients may be beneficial for Celiac Disease patients and save them ""unnecessary abdominal pain"".
As proof of faith in our product Erel Margalit put some of his precious time to meet with us close to the contest time in his home, he saw the presentation, and he even gave us tips and enlightened us on how to improve the presentation.
Dr. Erel Margalit has become an extremely important supporter of our project and we wish to thank sincerely him for that.

Fluorescence signals were measured, data quickly evaluated and our app demonstrated that the water was contaminated with date rape drugs ingredients. For detail see our final sensor approach .
Detection of γ-aminobutyrate
Induction of B. subtilis GABA sensor with GABA. 5 mL cultures in M9 with different GABA concentrations were grown overnight and RFP fluorescence was measured in a plate reader. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
When we started discussing the detection of date rape drugs, we were not sure if it would be possible to detect substances such as GBL and GHB directly due to legal restrictions as well as questions with regard to dual use. Therefore, we looked for an alternative to the direct detection of date rape drugs and came across γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), which is a structural analogue of GBL. By enzymatically converting GBL to GABA, it would be possible to use a GABA biosensor for the detection of date rape drugs as well.
Literature describes operons that can be induced by GABA in both Bacillus subtilis and Rhizobium leguminosarum. We obtained the genes for the responsible proteins and the inducible promoters by gene synthesis and placed mRFP1 under the control of the inducible promoters. After growing overnight cultures with 10 mg/L GABA, we observed that the cell pellets of the B. subtilis sensor were bright red, while the pellet of the R. leguminosarum sensor did not differ from the negative control. Consequently, we decided to work with the B. subtilis sensor. Upon further characterization of the biosensor, we noticed that the background signal in LB medium was very high, possibly because it contains traces of GABA. The background signal in M9 medium was considerably lower and we observed a clear induction by GABA when growing overnight cultures with different GABA concentrations and measuring the RFP fluorescence in a plate reader. A reaction was observable down to concentrations of 1 mg/L.
We also tested whether it is possible to induce the biosensor with GBL. However, we observed no signal with three different GBL concentrations. In contrast, a qRT-PCR showed an upregulation of the gabT gene in B. subtilis. This gene is usually activated by the transcription factor GabR in the presence of GABA. We assume that GBL was metabolized to GABA in B. subtilis"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

We also met with Dr. Saurabh Sarma, a postdoctoral fellow in Civil Engineering, to discuss VFA production in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). He advised us on integrating our process with the desired applications. We also discussed the composition of VFA commonly found in WWTP and parameters that impact VFA composition. Dr. Sarma suggested reaching out to Daniel Larson, a laboratory technician in Civil Engineering, to discuss VFA and PHB quantification using gas chromatography.
The entire team visited one of Calgary’s WWTP this week, where we learned about the current wastewater treatment process. After the tour, we met with representatives from ACWA (Advancing Canadian Water Assets) Research Facility at the Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, who are working on wastewater treatment research. However, they work with the output from the wastewater treatment plant, while most of our questions were about the wastewater treatment process itself. They directed us to the City of Calgary chemistry laboratory that performs analysis on intermediate samples from various stages of the process. We have contacted representatives from the City of Calgary.
Week 5: May 29 - June 2
This week, the entire team focused on evaluating the feasibility of the 4 proposed project applications: production of PHB on Mars from human waste, integrating PHB production in a wastewater treatment plant, integrating PHB production with leachate treatment, and integrating PHB production in developing countries. Our subgroup calculated the approximate amounts of PHB that would be expected in each scenario.
We approximated that about 40 - 90 kg of PHB can be produced on Mars per year with a crew of 6 astronauts. A crew of 6 will generate about 6 tonnes of solid organic waste over 2.5 years (Zhang, Ylikorpi & Pepe, 2015). Reported COD content in feces was found to be 354 mg COD per gram of wet human waste (Rose, Parker, Jefferson & Cartmell, 2015). One study looking at PHA production from food waste estimated the yield of 0.05 g of PHA per g of COD applied (Rhu, Lee, Kim & Choi, 2003). Another study reported 0.11 kg of PHA produced per kg of effluent COD in a PHA production process from activated sludge (Bengtsson, Werker, Christensson & Welander, 2008). The predicted PHB range was based on COD to PHA conversion. Another member of the team assumed the"

Meet with CCiC
Time: 2018.8.27-2018.8.31
Place: ShanghaiTech University
• Overview
As an 8-year-old team, ZJU-iGEM absolutely won’t miss this biggest iGEM conference in China! This year, CCiC attracted more than 80 teams to share their projects and exchanged their valuable experiences.
• Details
Also, we presented our project and drew much attention.Then,during panel session, Xuan Wang, an experienced iGEMer, post-doctor in Tsinghua University, told us that especially for the New Application Track, if we want to stand out, we must convince others by showing them a workable device. Since we were trying to construct a user-defined sensor, we considered to write a universal and detailed instruction which made it possible for everyone to construct his or her own sensor.
This year, we found that there were 2 teams trying to construct cell-free systems. And we exchanged our experience and shared our ideas on how to make a more distinctive ‘cell-free’ system. We all agreed that there is not a clear definition of cell-free. So, we  further explored how to construct CFPS (cell-free protein synthesis) in a better way.
What’s more, our inspirations burst out when we communicated with other iGEM teams. How to predict our protein docking model was one of the biggest barriers toward our project’s completion, but after talking to Peking-iGEM, we surmised that their theoretical modeling can help us out! We were also worried about lacking negative control in Curli-Fibers Expression. Fortunately, UTSC-iGEM gave us a suggestion that we can use Acetobacter xylinus to express Curli-Fibers without SpyTag so that we could set it as our negative control when demonstrating the specific binding for our reconstructed Curli-Fibers.
In iGEM HQ face-to-face session, we sat around Mrs. Meagan and discussed how to make iGEM projects better and lead iGEM competition to a more influential competition.

""What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal.""
Our aim is to construct a transducer system that is able to efficiently recognise free ligands inside the blood to activate downstream reporter in real time. The SynNotch and CAR systems have all been proved potential for cell therapy, while both of them are limited to cell-surface antigens. That’s why we finally chose another new synthetic system, namely the Modular Extracellular Sensors Architecture, as our transducer framework, and the main part of our STEP system.
This cell membrane receptor consists of two chains, one chain of transcription factor (TC) and one of protease (PC). The two chains are in a free state under normal circumstances, but will dimerize in the presence of the ligands. Once these two chains get close the protease on the PC chain can cleave the peptide linker between the transcription factor and the transmembrane domain of the TC chain, then the transcription factor can be released into the cytoplasm to activate the reporter (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Basic theory of STEP system.
It is obvious that the extracellular domain can literally be any kinds of protein that can bind to the tumour markers, including natural receptors or binding domains as well as antibodies and scFvs. Two different binding domains can be used to recognise different sites of the ligand, while identical domains can also be used for dimers. Considering the accessibility of ligands and sequences, we decided to use the two dimers, VEGF and D-Dimer, as our targets for the demonstration of our system, one for broad-spectrum cancer targeting while the other for NSCLC. And as a consequence we are allowed to use the same binding domain for both TC and PC chains.
For VEGF recognition, we selected one of its single-chain variable fragment (scFv) as the extracellular domain of our receptors. The only V"

NM media has 1% of the glucose concentration written in the protocol, it is 0.4mg/ml instead of 40mg/ml. Nevertheless, our overnight culture of pKD46 grew successfully so we will continue to use the media unless other problems arise.
One possible explanation for our failure to PCR out a kan-ZFB insert from the recombined colonies is that the insert was integrated into the genome somewhere else besides the 1529620 locus. This might be why the PCR shows no insert while the colony still grows in kanamycin. We will try to PCR the insert using primers that anneal to the kan and his-ura sections (since these primers are about 70 bases long, we will do a 2-step cycle)

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#eco#1_-_-_TEXT.html," not relent whatsoever—just take a glimpse at the responses in various online debate websites [7], media [8], or the surveys done in different countries and areas [9][10][11][12]. Pros and cons— each side thinks it knows better from an objective point of view, but in fact, is it, really? Subconsciously we all are taking a stand from either side so we could hardly remain objective as a person [13], for this is a picture that involves the welfare of us all so it’s hard to remain a bystander be it a researcher or a layman. It’s either pro or con, safe or unsafe, and the conditional middle ground might eventually have to, or come to choose a side.
     Former teams have looked into the cause of this confliction that never seems to settle, giving out insightful ethical and philosophical explanations. Team Manchester2013 analyzed the public’s attitudes to science and picked the flaws of the knowledge deficit theory [14]. Team Paris2009 did a fairly comprehensive investigation of many commonly used concepts in synthetic biology and presented some brilliant discussions [15]. Their works is marvelous and thought-provoking, and thanks to works like this, the ethical dimension of synthetic biology has been thriving, and more and more complex problems get to surface.
     In this report, however, we would like to try a different approach from the previous teams by borrowing game theory from economics to analyze the tradeoffs of the stakeholders in the GMO market.
     When science meets the market, it tends to abide by the rules of the market, for the market has its own science that refuses to be dictated. The market is like a chess game, each of us is a piece on the board. The moment we encounter each other, we enter a game of decision which we want to be at the winning side of, and all behaviors are viewed as different kinds of tradeoffs for different kinds of maximum profit, moral imperative or not. The difference is that, in a chess game someone always loses, while in the market we might both win, or lose.
     Game theory in economics is often used to analyze human behaviors that are related to tradeoffs [16]. It has the advantage of allowing the analyzing of the influencers of a subject once at a time which in this report will be the safety conditions.
     The GMO market has been intensively researched by previous economists. Charles Lawson listed the situations of information asymmetry in GMO market under the Gene Technology Act 2000[17]; McCluskey and Swinnen studied how the media was influencing the supply and demand sides of the GMO market by influencing people’s perception"

Presentation for CSTEP Summer Students
We presented for CSTEP Students, which are incoming freshmen at Stony Brook University. We presented about the basics of synthetic biology, since many of the students already had a foundation in AP Biology. We also spoke about our projects and what they plan to accomplish, as well as why they're important. We answered any questions that the students had about research, college, and our projects.
Presentation at the Seawolves Community Movie Night
iGEM team members had a table at the Seawolves Community Move Night and spoke to people about what iGEM was and what our projects were. We also spoke to some college students there that were interested in getting into research but didn't know how. We also advertised for our Building With Biology event to be held in mid August
Presentations for the Lang Program students
iGEM team members presented about synthetic biology in today's world as well as iGEM and the premise of BioBricks for high school researchers involved in the Lang Program through the Museum of Natural History.

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,"We found that all AI-2 Consumers, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK and pLsrACDBFGK successfully manipulated AI-2 signal in the environment, as expected. As shown in Fig. 14, after the IPTG induction, AI-2 concentration in the environment was significantly reduced in three hours, which means that constructed AI-2 Consumers can 'quench' AI-2 signal in the environment. What's more, statistical analysis shows that AI-2 Consumer pLsrACDBFGK has the most significant absorption ability in manipulating extracellular AI-2 concentration, while there is no significant difference on absorption ability among Device pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG and pLsrACDBK.
Fig. 14: AI-2 uptake profiles of ""AI-2 Consumers""
AI-2 Response Device function validation
We successfully constructed two devices that could respond to AI-2 by producing GFP fluorescence, providing an independent means to measure environmental AI-2 concentration.
We firstly tested whether AI-2 Response Device A and B can respond to different AI-2 concentration. We directly added exogenous AI-2 into the culture. The final concentration of AI-2 is 50μM, 40μM, 30μM, 20μM, 10μM, 0μM. Every one hour, optical density was measured and samples were harvested for fluorescence analysis. The results below (Fig. 15 and Fig. 16) demonstrate that two devices can both respond to different AI-2 concentration by emitting different intensity of GFP fluorescence.

Demonstration of AI-2 Controllers' application in real world
We found that a 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 Suppliers could significantly enhance AI-2-inducible GFP fluorescence compared to the control group. Also, 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 Consumers could significantly depress AI-2-inducible GFP fluorescence compared to the control group.
We also found that AI-2 Controllers can manipulate biofilm formation process. See more in Demonstrate .

how to write DB. Have fun working.
Summary: This is a crazy week for me! Together with Liao, we make huge modifications on the
structure of for at least 3 times! We change the xml structure for storing data, revise the
attributes on each item, and have heated debate on our standard of bio-modeling. At first the
modification process seems endless, but by the end of the week, we have come to agreement on
most of the details. This gives me a lot of hope, and this week has definitely been a big
leap for our DB. This time Liao finally realizes that we are actually making the next-
generation standard of SBML, haha. Settling a brand-new standard of bio-modeling has actually
become the core of our work. As far as I’m concerned, we have made 3 shifts on our goal, UI
-> simulation -> bio-modeling standard, this is poor goal-setting, we didn’t make a clear
map of what we are doing at the very beginning. I talk on DB and modeling with 2 junior
students, they are all confident and eager to learn, I think they can handle it properly very
soon. I just don’t have the time to talk with Soimort and Kun.

Summary: Write a detailed note on UI&Input and discuss it with Soimort. I believe it is not
easy for him to understand the whole design of UI&Input and its connection with the database,
I should spend more time to explain the details for him. Kun says he has finished the L2V4
update of ODE solver, he is now working on the boolean value judging module which will be
used in Liao’s code. Liao’s first edition of document on DB standard is done, it’s now my
turn to refine it and fix the bugs. Zhengda He has written part of the DB of EPF-Lausanne

B. Obtained logo for the attTn7 site by introducing the last 38 bases of all the showed sequences. The translation of the obtained logo nucleotide sequence is shown below
From the performed multi sequence alignment (figure 3.A) arises that the last part of the glmS gene is highly conserved.
The obtained logo (figure 3.B) showed a nucleotide sequence in which, as reported by Rupak (figure 2) ( Rupak et al, 2010 ) the first two positions at each codon were highly conserved, and variation was seen only at the third ‘wobble’ position. However, the obtained nucleotide logo sequence was similar to that reported by Rupak but it also differed in many positions.
By contrast, when translating the obtained logo nucleotide sequence, the resulting amino acidic sequence was the same as obtained by Rupak and colleagues ( Rupak et al, 2010 ). As in Rupak paper is not totally explained which organisms have been used to obtain the shown logo, we cannot completely explain the found logo differences.

The kan plates from the transformation all had colonies! We chose one from 2:17H and one from 3:11P to grow up in LB+kan for miniprep and glycerol stocks.
Ordered quikchange primers: for OZ052 and OZ123 we added the context bases 5' and 3' of the binding sequence (found in OPEN supplementary materials).  Since CODA did not include the extra bases, we left them the same as the original plasmid (i.e. Zif268's).

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#TiffanyNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"'s something that we will fix on Monday! Overall, a good day in the lab.
Week 7: July 15 - July 19
Monday: Sravanti and I have made it so that search is no longer case sensitive, and new search results do not append to the end of the previously generated search results. We have created a popup to show the properties of a part when you click on the part. However, every time you click on the part, it generates a new pop-up window. We will be sure to fix it later. We also started to tentatively work on the styling on the popup box.
I have started making the poster for the end of Wellesley Summer Science internship program conference style poster session. It's been slow going at the beginning, as always when making a poster, but at least I will not have to spend hours making figures this year like I have in the past!
Tuesday: We fixed the binding for the name information for each part in the pop up box. We have managed to get direction to show up as well, but for the moment, it relies on that information being in the correct spot in the data file. We will not worry about that too much specifically right now because we need to databind information from the database for the popup box anyway. I continued to work on the poster.
Wednesday: Continued to work on databinding and the poster. The writing is coming along. I started to think about how I was going to set up the poster. I'm not super creative when it comes to displaying information, I tend to go the route of ""simple is best,"" but that might be too boring for the tastes of this lab. I've been told that my design could be more fun, which is a valid criticism. I am also struggling to come up with a color scheme for the poster. It was suggested that we go with the common lab color scheme of blue and orange. I wanted to go with something a little different, but I'm pretty sure my efforts would come out looking like one of those terrible Geocities websites despite using the aid of a colorwheel.
Thursday: It was hard to be productive today because overall we struggled to get a connection to the internet. And since everything is either saved on GoogleDrive or Dropbox, we were stuck. Before things went down around mid-afternoon, Sravanti connected the popup box to the iGem database, but it stopped working when the connection to the internet started to fail.
I started writing both the public and technical abstracts. Having stared at the same information for so long, and trying to reword it"

In addition, these circuits may then be engineered to detect specific combinations of input signals that could be used to engineer multi-strain, self monitoring microbial populations that perform energetically costly metabolic processes in a single culture (Davis et al., 2015).
The objective of our project is to design and test a variety of quorum sensing networks. This includes creating new receivers for our system, as well as researching various concentrations of AHL signals. We have developed a flexible testing platform in which the QS system is separated into two components designated the “Sender” and the “Receiver”. The AHL synthase is expressed in the Sender cell, while the inducible promoter and regulator are carried by a Receiver cell. When the Sender produces a signal, the HSL, it diffuses across cell membranes and activates the Receiver. In our current system, Receivers will express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in response to induction by Senders from different bacterial species. Ideally, the designed systems would have low amounts of interference and form a functional genetic circuit. Our team has built 3 new receivers.
Our iGEM team is investigating the diverse applications that fit with our quorum sensing quest. Some of the side quests include: new receivers with hybrid promoters, concentration of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHLs), combinations of different senders, induction and diffusion rates, mathematical models and the case of the disappearing mCherry.
MOTIVATION
Suiting Up for Battle
Promoters are a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a specific gene. In bacteria, promoters contain 2 short sequence elements about 10 and 35 nucleotides upstream from a transcription start site. For our project, we utilize inducible promoters to initiate the transcription of regulator proteins and inducible GFP signals. Inducible promoters are a power tool in genetic engineering because the expression of genes operably linked to them can be turned on or off at certain stages of development of an organism or in a particular tissue (Brautaset,2009). This allows us to track and analyze data to find orthogonality between senders and receivers. This is done when senders produce acyl-homoserine signals (AHLs) and attach to a regulator promoter in the corresponding receiver system. This allows for DNA binding and transcription initiation. This in turn allows for proteins to be made which then bind to the inducible promoter to allow GFP to be turned on. If there is no transcription of our regulator gene, aka no AHL attachment to the promoter"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," Failing this, the remaining pathways will be examined; however, the disadvantage in these pathways is their direct reliance on the success of the other steps, as the naphthenic acids must be degraded to the point of resembling branched-chain fatty acids (since all remaining pathways are related to fatty acid metabolism).
Week 3 (May 14-18)
The third week included some additional literature investigation in the first two days. The iGEM distributions arrived this week, and verification began on May 17th by transformation into E.coli, followed by colony PCR on May 18th (using standard protocols on the wiki). Additionally, primers were designed for CAR in Nocardia iowensis, along with primers for Nocardia posphopantetheine transferase (NPT), a second enzyme required for optimal function in the former, and a short list of contacts were acquired to request the donation of the required strain (called NRRL 5646) from researchers who have worked with it previously. A sort of form email was drafted for this purpose, and should this be unsuccessful, we will be purchasing the strain from DSMZ . In the following week, we will begin with development of overnight cultures and gel preparation.
Week 4 (May 22-25)
This week, a gel was prepared for the colony PCR prepared last week, and the gel was run, yielding results that were very difficult to see. The PCR and gel electrophoresis process were repeated, yielding the following gel:

Since 1975, aequorin had become widely used among cell biologists and physiologists as an excellent calcium probe, and its applications peaked around 1985. Since I was practically the only source of aequorin in this time period, I sent out several hundred aequorin samples in response to requests from investigators all over the world. The cDNA of aequorin was cloned and recombinant aequorin was made in 1985, but the patent owners of recombinant aequorin, the University of Georgia and Chisso Corporation of Japan, were not sure about expanding the use of aequorin, thus the general use of recombinant aequorin was delayed. In 1988, in collaboration with Professor Yoshito Kishi of Harvard, we succeeded in making various aequorins that had different calcium sensitivities and properties. Those aequorins contained various derivatives of coelenterazin instead of coelenterazine in their molecules, and were called semi-synthetic aequorins. In 1995, I undertook work on the X-ray structure of aequorin, and the three-dimensional structure of aequorin was obtained in 2000 (Head et al., 2000).
In 1992, the cDNA of GFP was cloned by Dr. Douglas Prasher, who was then at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. At that time, however, it was commonly believed that expressing the cDNA in living organisms would not produce fluorescent GFP, because the formation of its chromophore requires the reactions of condensation and dehydrogenation that are not expected to occur spontaneously. In 1994, however, Dr. Martin Chalfie of Columbia University tried to express the cDNA in E. coli and a nematode worm, and he and his colleagues unexpectedly observed the fluorescence of the expressed GFP. The results suggested GFP, and other proteins linked to GFP, could be expressed in living organisms to observe their behavior. Dr. Chalfie's work attracted the interest of many people, triggering rapid progress in the applications of GFP. Dr. Roger Tsien of University of California, San Diego, engineered GFP by modifying the amino acid residues surrounding the chromophore, producing many different fluorescent proteins that emit various colors, from blue to red. Today, GFP is widely used as a fluorescent marker of protein molecules and cells, and"

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4
Demonstrate
In order to fulfill the goal of creating an automated system that selectively dispenses the output of a microfluidic chip, TERRA is required to have certain functionality.
Functional Requirements:
Application agnostic - treats the user’s microfluidic chip as a black box system so that TERRA can handle a variety of different applications and microfluidic chips
Selectively dispense microfluidic output - uses a UI and XY translational stage to move a well plate so microfluidic outputs are dispensed into user selected wells
Fully Automated - output selection is facilitated by automating valve actuation for each output
Integration with benchtop analytics - Dispense the sample volume inputted by the user into selected
Cost effective - Less than current options and accessible to researchers; >$1000
We have designed TERRA to fulfill all the requirements.
Application Agnostic
Creating an application agnostic system ensures that TERRA can handle a variety of different applications and third party microfluidic chips. In order to make TERRA application agnostic, the system has to treat the user’s microfluidic chip as a black box and work solely with the outputs of the user’s microfluidic chip. In addition, treating the microfluidic chip as a black box offloads the burden of microfluidic expertise off the user, making TERRA accessible to the greater synthetic biology community.
To make TERRA application agnostic, we designed the TERRA Adapter. The TERRA Adapter is a microfluidic chip that connects the user’s microfluidic chip to TERRA, mediating selection and redirection of outputs. The TERRA Adapter is currently a feature available on 3DuF so that users can manufacture and assemble their own TERRA Adapters for their experiments.

Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Project#insertion of motifs into surface-exposed loops_-_-_TEXT.html," was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 µl of serial diluted viral vectors. After washing the plates three times, the recommended amount of Streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well for 1 h at room temperature. Again, the plates were washed three times followed by detection of absorbance caused by converted ABTS substrate at 405 nm. Additionally, the genomic AAV-2 titer was determined by qPCR.
 
A: Schematic overview of the detection of BAP-presenting viral particles immobilized by A20 capture antibodies. Biotinylated capsids can be detected by streptavidin-coupled HRP
B: ELISA AAV-2 particles carrying a BAP insertion in loop 587 which can be specifically biotinylated in vitro
Results and Discussion:
As can be seen in figure B, biotinylation of assembled AAV particles was achieved with the dilution series ranging from 2- to 128-fold. Correlating this assay with the qPCR experiment for the detection of encapsidated vector plasmid (genomic titer using CMV-promoter primers) yields a value of 4.70E+07 DNase-resistant particles (DRP). Consequently, the presence of approximately 3.6x10^5 biotinylated DRPs can be detected using the described ELISA. Compared to the virus particle detection ELISA emploing A20 as capture- and detection antibody, the detection limit of the biotinylated viral capsids is about 10fold more sensitive. This may be explained by the higher affinity of strepavidin towards biotin relative to the A20 antibody affinity or multiple biotinylation of a single virus particle.

OD cheking was performed on all our Biobrick stock to have an idea of the DNA rate into our preparation. We also made a PCR cheking to make sure that the DNA rate really corresponds to our Biobrick.
We got an average rate of 100 ng/µl. Which is a much lower than expect, so 10 times more DNA products would had been necessary to get great constructions.

The problem of originality persists for the application: what about a suture thread? For the peptide-producer microorganism, a yeast could be a good solution because the antimicrobial activity of our peptide is bacterial-specific. For the activation of the peptide production, we’ve thought about lyophilisating the engineered yeast.
Week 12
03-21: 9th brainstorming
In view of what has already been done in iGEM for  detection of quorum sensing molecules, it seems that we’ll need a bacteria to detect other quorum sensing molecules because it’s difficult to express a prokaryotic membrane-receptor into a yeast. So we’ve imagined a system with a prokaryote that detect a quorum sensing signal from a pathogenic bacteria, and that triggers peptide production by a yeast.

Actual solution to fight against cholera are not sufficient to prevent great epidemics, we need to contact NGOs to benefit from their experience of the field of a cholera epidemy. For the proof of concept, we need to find an effective cholera detector, and a good peptide producer. The detector bacteria could be E. coli, or maybe V. harveyi, that already possess the quorum sensing receptor of CAI-1, and all the proteins to do the phosphorylation cascade in response of CAI-1.

Methods
What we have done in the process of developing ""BioBrick Search"" can be roughly subdivided into 3 parts:
Retrieving data
Establishing a searching and sorting method
Designing a user-friendly UI
1. Data Retrieval
In order to achieve practical search latency, we need to retrieve and store data in our own server that performs the search. The source of data we utilized in ""BioBrick Search"" includes the basic information of each part obtained from the partsregistry.org API (http://) and the contents of wiki pages for each BioBrick on partsregistry.org (using MediaWiki API).
We combined the data from these two sources and converted them to JSON format to use for the search.
Partsregistry.org Database API
We utilized the partsregistry.org official API to obtain basic information such as a part's name, ID, description, nucleotide sequence, inclusion relationships between parts, availability, and so on.
This API allows us to obtain basic information of specified parts in xml format. We acquired a list of all part names at DAS Parts Server entry point ( http://partsregistry.org/das/parts/entry_points ) and, by querying for each BioBrick on the list, gained information on BioBricks. By this methodology, we successfully obtained information on 14,831 BioBricks.
Partsregistry.org Wiki Pages
As the data contained in the partsregistry.org database has little information as to what the BioBrick does and how to use it, we thought it would be quite useful if the data on partsregistry.org wiki pages could be used, in addition to the basic data in the database, as cues for searching BioBricks. Luckily for us, MediaWiki, a software that partsregistry.org Wiki Pages are built upon, provides API ( http://partsregistry.org/wiki/api.php )that allows us to retrieve all the pages for each BioBrick.
2. Searching and Sorting Method
Search engine
As writing a search engine from scratch is quite time-consuming, we adopted the open source software called ""elasticsearch"" ( elasticsearch.org ) as a backend search engine.
elasticsearch can handle complex queries on structured data quickly and this characteristic of elasticsearch allowed us to build a sophisticated and responsive search tool.

6 Generation of products based on reaction templates
Introduction
We design and develop a software tool, iGame, which supports database written in MoDeL format, to perform task of automatic modeling. Actually, automatic modeling is a database-dependent network-searching-and-developing process from the initial conditions. Besides the database, users are required to provide initial environment condition, such as initial plasmids with biobrick parts. iGame will generate the network of the biological system in SBML standard. Please refer to User_Interface to know more about input and output of iGame.
Algorithms for automatic modeling will be shown in the following sections. An overview is as follow:
Section Algorithm flow chart gives an overall description of the general framework of our algorithms;
Section Special reactions and volume strategy tells details about the methods and strategies our program utilizes to handle with some special reactions;
Section Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme provides details of sorting as well as weighting scheme and their functions;
Section Structural pattern match of template species provides details of the core algorithm of iGame: how to find matchings between template species defined in database and species existed in the bio-system;
Section Generation of products based on reaction templates describes the mix-trim-split method to generate products.
Algorithm flow chart
Before stating our own algorithm, we will first make an analysis about the difference and difficulty brought by introducing a new language system. The general algorithm idea is common: find out all species and reactions between them. Ignoring the efficiency of program, the most obvious method is doing the following recursively until no more species is generated:
find reactions between species have been found and generate products as new species
Similar idea applies to our program. Some modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program. In addition, process of products generating is not as easy as just creating a new species with specific name, too. Their structures are required to be constructed under rules defined in MoDeL at the same time. The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break"

Simulation results tie in with data measured from synthetic gene regulatory circuits, showing the same conclusions. Furthermore, our models predict several conclusions under conditions we not yet have time to carry out, or even hard to achieve experimentally, and illuminates the way for future research and design.
Gillespie Algorithm Simulation
Gillespie Algorithm, a Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), can simulate biochemical reactions with small number of molecules accurately. Reactions in cells are full of random fluctuations due to low number of molecules present. For instance, there can be only one or two copies of a gene in one cell. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm for more details)
TCaption: an example simulation result of our script using Gillespie Algorithm. 100 cells are generated in this figure. We can see how the state of the cell (in this case, a one-dimension state space )
We use this algorithm to generate hundreds of sample trajectories at high and low inputs, each representing the dynamic changes in the amount of protein in a single cell. Afterwards, we find a time point when all reactions in cells have reached steady state, and ink down the states of the cells at that very moment. The approach resembles the flow cytometry experiment, in both of which we get a sample composed of cells with dissimilar protein levels.
From the simulated data, we can use methods in experiment data processing to calculate channel capacities.
We use ${k_{on}}$ and ${k_{off}}$, two parameters of dimer forming and disassociation, to characterize the process of dimerization. For split EBFP2 without intein, kon is relatively small due to low affinity, and ${k_{off}} > 0$. For split EBFP2 with intein, kon is larger and ${k_{off}} = 0$ because once they interact, they will not fall apart.
Under suitable parameter set, we obtained the following results shown in the table below. When ${k_{off}}$  comes down to zero, channel capacity increases in accordance to experimental results.
We computationally scan the two parameters in two-dimensional parameter space to explore the impacts of those kinetic constants.
In the heat map, warmer color stands for higher channel capacity, vice versa. The figure on the left stands for the case where both halves are driven by inducible promotors, the right for that where one of them is driven by constitutive promotor. The latter resemble chemical titration, so we legend it as above.

In fact, both coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs, including some miRNAs, have been found in human saliva. Although mRNAs are highly degraded in saliva, miRNAs are stably and abundantly present in saliva. Recently, there are many reports on cancer-related miRNA expression in saliva. Featured miRNA expression are reported to be found in oral squamous cell carcinoma, parotid gland tumors and esophageal cancer, indicating potential salivary miRNA to be biomarkers for detecting these diseases. According to the test done by Zijun Xie group, there are three type of miRNAs significantly upregulated in the whole saliva from the esophageal cancer patient group in contract to normal control group – miR-10b, miR-144, and miR-451 (p value 0.001, 0.012 and 0.002, respectively; AUC 0.762, 0.706 and 0.756, respectively). And four miRNAs are significantly upregulated in saliva supernatants from the esophageal cancer patient group – miR-10b, miR-144, miR-21 and miR-451. Among them, miR-21 is the most frequently reported one for its high performance in specific expression level related to esophageal cancer (according to one of the reports, p < 0.05, AUC = 0.8820, sensitivity = 90.20% and specificity 70.69%; different tests may report different results).
Comprehensively considering the performance of each miRNA, we finally chose miR-144 as our biomarkers for esophageal cancer. To make our detection quick and convenient, we designed synthetic gene pathways based on paper. It will only require some saliva to complete the detection, which will do no harm to human body. And this techniques can be expanded to be used in the detection of many other diseases which has specific miRNA expression pattern in saliva.

After this workshop,            participants were able to critically analyze the development of science and biotechnology and its ramifications. This workshop is important for iGEM members and students of all backgrounds and learning stages because it            will provide the necessary means to formulate ethical, social and political assertions that positively progress            synthetic biology rather than interfere with its growth. Each class included an interactive activity, in the form of an informal debate, to engage participants to            understand and evaluate the nature of the disagreements. Participants will be given a problem or scenario that            requires them to formulate questions, analyze evidence, connect evidence to pre-existing theories, derive            conclusions, consider all perspectives and reflect on their learning.
The bioethics workshop comprised of four sessions:
Agricultural Biotechnology -- Introduction to bioethics and its prevalence in synthetic biology,                engineering, and medical sciences. At the end of this lesson, students will have demonstrated the ability                to define bioethics and bioethical principles, ethical norms, moral objections and concerns in the synthetic                biology field.
Gene Drive/Biomedical Ethics -- Alteration of one’s genetic inheritance via genetic engineering has                controversial bioethical issues. Discussion of the utilitarian principle and new knowledge to eliminate disease.
Ethical Research Practices -- Research that involves human subjects promotes complex ethical, legal, social                and political issues. In research ethics, the objective is to protect human participants, to ensure research is                conducted in a way that promotes the interest of individuals or communities and to examine specific research activities                for their ethical soundness. Discuss issues such as management of risk, protection of confidentiality and the process                of informed consent.
Science Policies & Ethics -- Although there are laws in place, depending on the jurisdiction of engineering                practices, this does not ensure ethical behaviour. Discuss and understand some interactions made between science and                government in which political decisions are made.

Minnesota,2010,Team:Minnesota#Judging_-_-_TEXT.html," to characterize other parts that already exist in the registry. We have picked up few parts from the registry, described in the table below. We have submitted our characterized constructs to the registry. All our constructs are in the biobrick plasmid pSB1C3, and were sequenced prior to submission. Our experimental results are described here in detail.
We looked for the parts in the registry that were not characterized previously. We decided to look mainly for regulatory parts, as we wanted to compare strength of different promoters by reporter assays. We looked for a range of regulatory parts like metal sensitive promoters or yeast promoters, primarily to have a sense of variety of regulations in different systems and also to study a part which could be useful to our lab advisors (see Table below). However, despite our best efforts, we were unable to clone and confirm most of the promoter parts.
We finally zeroed down on a family of constitutive promoters that were isolated from a combinatorial library by the iGEM Berkeley team in 2006. Further search and sequence alignment revealed that these are mutant tet promoters. The labs of our faculty advisors use inducible tet promoters regularly for different experiments. We were tempted to compare the tet promoters from this library to our tet promoter. We decided to study one weak and one strong tet promoter, to get a practical idea of the difference between promoter strengths. We picked the plasmid DNA for the part Bba_J23118 and part Bba_J23105 from the 384 well plates, which was supplied to us by iGEM. We first resuspended the DNA from the plate A, well #20 (J23105) and well #22 (J23118). We transformed the resuspended DNA into TOP 10 cells. Both the plasmids are Ampicillin resistant. We got ~100 transformants the next day. We inoculated a single colony from these freshly transformed plates into 50 ml LB media with ampicillin. Next day, we isolated both the plasmids to proceed with further cloning. We digested both the plasmid with EcoR I and Pst I enzymes to get the Promoter+RFP part or PoPS generator part. We ligated each promoter+RFP part into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone (cut by the same restriction enzymes). The transformation of this ligase mix was done in Top10 cells and clones were confirmed by isolating the plasmids from the recombinant cells. These plasmids were subjected to restriction digestion by EcoR I and Pst I enzymes to look for the correct"
NYMU-Taipei,2015,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," B, the development and investment in GERD is proportional to the growth of iGEM teams in a country. For example, the number of iGEM teams established in China grew steadily over the past five years from 17 teams in 2010 to 55 teams in 2015. As shown in the graph below, the percent of increase in GERD has been growing rapidly in China ever since 2004, thus providing an explanation for the growth in iGEM teams.
Education also serves as a factor of the distribution of iGEM teams. According to QS World University ranking, 47 out of the top 50 university in biological sciences major have participated in iGEM in the past five years. Therefore, we conclude that higher ranking universities in biology related major tend to establish iGEM teams. Schools with better reputation and funding for biological science have more incentive to join the iGEM competition.
In conclusion, the two main factors for the growth of iGEM team numbers are the development in synthetic biology and education. Further research and improved education on biological science are incentives for school to join iGEM competition.
Synthetic biology’s future
Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel bio-molecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms will change our lives over the coming years, revolutionizing our lifestyles. Using stored information and basic materials to grow very complex things, synthetic biology strives to make molecular biology more like engineering, with characterized materials and parts put together in predictable ways. One of the most amazing things about synthetic biology is how advanced the tools and components of its trade have already become. A continuously growing collection of genetic parts that can be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices. With demonstrations on synthetic cells, scientists now have a lot of tools to edit an existing genetic sequence on a computer, use DNA synthesizing machines to create it in fragments, and stitch these together in the lab. However, it’s still difficult to predict what cells will do after they’re altered. Researchers are often stymied by cells’ natural drive to grow and live as they please, which in many cases must be overcome to harness them for certain use in an efficient method. One of the biggest hurdles lies in the creation and assembly of starting materials, modular bits of DNA that code for a particular function and are synthesized in the lab. Creating this DNA is time consuming and expensive. Like any commercial product, it must be designed, built, and tested. Even making relatively small changes can take a lot of work, time and money.

Result 2 Test the function of the Riboregulator and PhiR73 activator together
 
We assembled PO promoter with mRFP1 to create BBa_K1087018 ，so that we can test the basal expression level of PO promoter.
We also assembled “TetR promoter + lock3d” with phiR73 activator to create BBa_K1087007 . Then, we assembly BBa_K1087007 with BBa_K1087018 to create BBa_K1087022 .
Finally, we assembled RiboKey BBa_K145215 with BBa_K1087022 to create BBa_K108702 3.

Guanajuato_Mx,2016,Team:Guanajuato Mx#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"roningen) developed a biosensor using Lactococcus lactis as chassis, which senses, and produces dispersin and lactonase to destroy the biofilm and to avoid quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa, respectively.
    In this work we designed two biosensors using two bacteria as chassis that are recognized as safe by the FDA, E. coli K12 and Lactococcus lactis. E. coli K12 is transformed with the lasR gene of P. aeruginosa PA01 (transcriptional regulator rhIR, Gene ID 878968,NCBI) and also with the alginate lyase gene (algy), in tandem with a bacteriocin (i.e. microcin S). It has been reported the alginate is one of the main components in the P. aeruginosa biofilms (Tielen et al., 2013), our modules will detect and destroy the biofilm and kill the bacteria. In our second biosensor, a nisin producer bacterium (i.e. L. lactis) is transformed with the genes required to detect P. aeruginosa, to produce alginate lyase and an additional copy of nisin. It has been reported that nisin at high concentrations, has an effect on P. aeruginosa viability (Giacommetti et al. 1996). Our  biosensor will overexpress the bacteriocin in order to kill the pathogenic bacterium and the alginate lyase to destroy the biofilm. Additionally, we designed a patch made of poly(vinyl alcohol) and a nitrocellulose membrane, containing the bacterial biosensors that will allow the molecule to diffuse through the membrane in order to kill the pathogenic bacterium. Here, we show advances about the construction of bacterial biosensors and the patch modeling.
Main purpose
    Our objective is to develop a biopatch harboring a bacterial biosensor capable of detect and defeat infections caused by common pathogenic bacteria in burns, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Patch composition
First the shape of the hydrogel was chosen to be a square 30x30 mm block. We imagine it being used for an infected wound on the arm. Its total thickness was chosen to have a value of 4 mm, including the nutrient rich layer. Our decision fell on this thickness, because you do not want a very thick layer of hydrogel on your skin as a patient. That would be inconvenient and more prone to being damaged by shear stresses when wearing clothing for instance. We compose the patch of three different layers as can be seen in figure 1. The top layer is the one containing nutrients that nourishes the cells and allows growth of the cells and lysostaphin production by the cells. However, the most important layer, namely the layer that houses the lysostaphin secreting E. coli cells, can be found on a buffer layer. A buffer layer of hydrogel sits between the cell layer and the wound. This buffer layer should be small enough to ensure a sufficient amount of lysostaphin flowing from E. coli cells towards the wound, but the buffer layer should be large enough, along with the gel where the cells reside, to ensure that as little nutrients as possible end up in the wound by diffusion.
In physics, displacement of molecules can be influenced by diffusivity as said above, but flux can also have influence on this displacement. Through movement of the patch or forces on the gel, while it is on the skin of a patient, flux can be generated. However, these external influences are small and unpredictable. For this reason they are difficult to put in a model. So for simplicity we assume an ideal situation where there are not any external forces or movements that cause flux through the gel.
Skin
Since we want to simulate our patch on top of the skin, we also had to simulate a piece of skin in COMSOL. However, we assumed that the wound is not just a superficial wound, but an open wound because superficial wounds are generally able to heal by themselves and are not easily infected. So we assumed that the wound was open and covered with exudate. Moreover, as we are working with an open wound, the blood vessels are extremely close to the surface if not just separated by a single line of cells from the exudate. Because of the low amount of cells, we assumed the permeability constant of the skin to be negligible. In conclusion, the diffusivity through both exudate and blood were"

Week18 (Jul 13 -Jul 19)
We constructed a new part P-atp2+B0034+K907000(Bxb1 gp35)+K907001(Bxb1 gp47) by OE-PCR and transformed it into BMTOP10. And we started to selected the positive bacteria from our transformant.
We did the fourth cell culture to increase the experimental data and analyzed the common features among the four experiments. However, we didn’t get the expected results again. But we have learned some lessons.
Week19 (Jul 20 -Jul 26)
This week, most members of our two groups attended the iGEM conference held by National Chiao Tung University. So the plenty of members selected others bacteria together.
We added a terminator downstream the gene glsA. Through 3A assembly, we have successfully constructed the complete standard part. Through the result of sequence measuring, it turns out to be completely right.
Week20 (Jul 27 -Aug 2)
We artificially synthesized attP and attB, the recognized sites of Bxb1, by Genwiz, so that we should wait for them. And we totally selected 1082 positive bacteria. We used LacZ alpha as a report gene and started the verification of them.
We have improved our experiment methods and carried out the fifth cell culture. Considering the pH might change after cell culture, we added buffer to control the pH. Moreover, we tried to realize the the synchronous culture by choosing the single bacteria on the plate. Unluckily, the results didn’t meet our requirements.
Week21 (Aug 3 -Aug 9)
This week, we got a measure that we helped Beijing Normal University(BNU) to finish their gene circuit. So we transformed the gene I15008(ho1) and I15009(PcyA) from iGEM kit plates into BMTOP10. And we still did the verification of our mutants.
We measured the intensity of proteins again. It showed that the expression of glsA is critically low. So, we planned to change a strong promoter T7.
Week22 (Aug 10 -Aug 16)
We got the BNU's part (J23100+B0034+PcyA+B0034+ho1+B0015), and constructed it to the pSB1C3. We still verified the mutants this week.
Referring to the paper we read, we did a small experiment to measure the proportion of living cells under extreme pH 3.0, both the testing group and the comparison group didn’t grow"

After completing a Master in engineering at École Centrale Paris and a research master in applied mathematics for biology at Paris 6 University, I am to start a PhD thesis on real-time control of biological systems on microfluidics chips. For many years interested in the relation between maths and biology, I discovered synthetic biology in 2011 through its connection to systems biology and immediately got ""infected"". My expertise being mostly on theoretical aspects, I enrolled in iGEM to get closer to the wetlab and apply my scholar knowledge to real life problems.

I am curently in 5th year at the engineering school Epita and specialized in scientific computations. I am interested in biology since high school and more especially in the links between biological systems and my speciality: computer science. After all a cell can be seen as a kind of computer, as seen in the name ""genetic code"". I learned about the IGEM comptetition when I discovered the synthetic biology field in an article in Nature a few years ago. Since then I wanted to participate to the comptetition but never had the opportunity. I bring to the team my programming and engineering skills and hope to learn a lot from biologist in the lab.

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," and check the absence of unwanted minor secondary structures. Nonetheless, these softwares not only specifically provide the minimum free energy (MFE) structure, but ViennaRNA also outputs                               the proportion of this structure compared to the ensemble of all the possible structures.
Indeed, the structure of a DNA molecule is dynamic: with a certain ΔG, the molecule can change its structure into a new one. As a consequence, there is a non-null probability to find single-stranded probes in the sample:                               the MFE structure indeed accounts only for a fraction of all the different possible secondary structures* and, among the remaining ones, many of the structures will actually be ""circular"". These include both the structures                               with an open circular shape, as well as all the possible “non-optimal” structures where the binding region for the gRNA is mostly single-stranded (and not the expected double-stranded stem). Therefore, in this case, as the                               probe is complementary to the gRNA, it can activate itself Cas12a by means of the PAM-independent mechanism and then output a fluorescence.
This is validated when performing the calculations for Probe 1, which we used for the Cas assay. As shown in Figure 8, this probe actually has as MFE structure the expected dumbbell-like shape; nonetheless, the proportion of                               this structure with respect to the ensemble of all the possible structures is only 20.22%. As a consequence, we hypothesized that the proportion of co-existing single-stranded structures (although not easily computable*)                               which could be targeted by a gRNA binding to the stem was high enough to produce a very high background fluorescence signal covering the signal from the amplicon (being the concentration of probe in the solution very high,                               estimated in 5 μM before RCA).

Moreover, an additional consideration is that the probes activated in the circular shape upon binding of the miRNA remain in this circular single-stranded form also after RCA, acting as unwanted targets for the gRNA.
In order to test our hypothesis and potentially overcome non-specific Cas12a triggering, we decided to design new gRNAs having perfect complementarity with the amplicon, but no complementarity with the probe: we achieved this                               by having the binding site on one of the two loops of the amplicon and not on the stem (Figure 9, more details in Detailed Design ).

These data shows that the pesticide production in China is increasing rapidly, and the herbicide production increases more rapidly, which means herbicide will take more proportion in pesticide. There is information suggesting that 45% of the herbicide produced in China are export.
Atrazine is widely used herbicide in the world. It is an organic compound consisting of an s-trazine-ring, which was discovered 60 years ago. According to secretary of the party committee of Changxing First Chemical Industry, having been developed for 60 years, atrazine has been a main herbicide using in dry farm, especially in corn field. There are 70 percents to 80 percents of corn field using atrazine as herbicide. The atrazine production in Changxing First Chemical Industry is 5000t every year, including 70% for export and 30% mainly sold to north China.
Also, there are many companies and researchers trying to improve the efficiency of atrazine and lower its poisonousness. For example, Zhongshan Chemical Company, which produces atrazine as their major business, has developed a series of technologies awarded by both government of Zhejiang province and Ministry of Science and Technology of China on manufacturing and using atrazine"

Ran colony PCR and created liquid cultures from the same colony from each transformation plate. VR and VF2 was used to amplify the chromoprotein+His-tag. The colony PCR may have been messed up because too much of each primer was added to each of the tubes. We will run a gel of the colony PCR to image and see if the correct region was amplified.

Gel order: Ladder, TP, MP, PP, VP, VV, LO, SO, BB, DT, SP, CP, DM

The gel showed interesting results with the thing we amplified at around 300 bp. We are thinking something went wrong with the PCR so we will re do the PCR tomorrow and see if our results differ

Here is the gel we ran of our colony PCR. From left to right the order is:  Ladder, TP, MP, PP, VP, VV, LO, SO, BB, DT, SP, CP, DM. Most of the samples look to be around 300 base pairs (bp) where they are amplified. The other 3 samples were around 1,200 bp. Both of these numbers of bp are not what we were expecting to see from the PCR. We were expecting our chromoprotein plus his-tag to be around 1000 bp.

One plate (TP) began to show colorful colonies so we made a liquid culture from one of the colored colonies to see if that would also show color

We spun down the 12 liquid cultures of the DNA 2.0 chromoproeins + his-tag and these cultures did not show color but cells were present. They will be placed at room temperature oscillating to see if color growth will be seen after a couple more days

The culture we made for TP was spun down and color was seen. This helps to confirm our Gibsoned work but we will colony PCR from a colorful colony today to see if that also helps confirm our results.
TP Colored Cells
Here is the result when TP+His-tag was spun down. Color is seen in the cells that grew from the colorful colony we picked from yesterday.

Collaboration
In August, We were informed that the Nanjing-China team needed our help to build their model. Considering that the communication and collaboration is a truly important part of doing research of synthetic biology, we promised that we would help them. So, then, they sent us their documents about their circuit and the function they wanted to realize. Our team had a discussion and found something we didn’t understand, so we had a video conference with them to know more about their circuits and confirm those details that we need to build this model. When we had finished a half of the formulation work, they came to our school to visit some igem team and had a discussion with us. We showed them our work and asked for their suggestion and after that we confirmed more details and adjust a few equation. After we listed all the equations, we tried to simplify them. And then we begin to bury ourselves in coding, using the Matlab tool. We set a map with some parameters and some cells, with the map and cells’ state we can get new data of each cell and with the new state and the old map we got a new map and refresh it. With the right method and code, the only thing we needed is the right parameters of those equations. After finished that, we got the result which met our expects. Finally, we sent the code and equations to them and finished this work. With collaboration, we have got many communications with those who have the same dream in synthetic biology and learnt so much from each other.

Introduction
The mean function of carbon fixation E. pangu is transforming inorganic substances into organic substances. Unfortunately, the process will definitely be affected by their natural ability of utilizing glucose to serve energy to E. pangu themselves. Thus, our project includes a part in which we will knockout the genes of glycolysis to verify the functions of carbon fixation E. pangu . The gene circuit for this part is shown in figure 1:
Fig. 1. Gene circuit of carbon fixation testing
Here we introduced a gene editing technique called CRISPR Cas9 to knock out glycolysis of E. pangu . CRISPR is widely used to edit genome based on the complexity of sgRNA and Cas9 protein. Unlike other gene edition technique, CRISPR can be designed in one dimension instead of stereoscopy. Thus, when targeting different sites, we just need to design corresponding sequences. After knocking out several key enzymes, we will be able to regulate the metabolism of E. pangu , so that the ability of carbon fixation of our engineered microbe can be qualified.
At the initial stage of bacterial growth, the energy requirement is relatively high. To ensure the normal growth at this stage, we added a regulated promoter before Cas9 protein, through which the glucose catabolism of our bacteria can be regulated. That is, we will not knock out the glycolysis system until the cell growth has reached stationary phase.
Result
1. pRhl Insight
Before we got started, we tested a standard biobrick BBa_K57503 (iGEM11_Northwestern) to find out the optimal condition for the initiation efficiency of promoter pRhl:
Fig. 2. Components of biobrick BBa_K57503
This part consists of a promoter pRhl and the gene of required binding protein, as well as a gene of GFP (E0040). We transformed this part into E.coli BL21 (TaKarRaTM), and added C4-HSL (Final Concentration 100uM) to induce the expression. After incubated in shaker (200rpm) at room temperature for 4h, we got the result as follows under UV light.

When we discovered that we did not have the desired Biobricks in the registry, we decided to design and characterize our own Biobricks. We wanted to characterize the superfolded GFP which was optimized for Lactococcus lactis and the CP promoter collection. We made the constructs containing the CP promoter collection with the super folded GFP. Although the superfolded GFP was optimized for L. lactis, it works in E.coli as well. The promoter collection was studied in E.coli by measuring the fluorescence in FACS. Based on the FACS data we analyzed the promoter activity of the CP promoter collection and proved superfolded GFP works well in E.coli too. One of our new Biobricks, NisA, was characterized by putting it before a CP44 promoter. NisA was then transformed to Lactococcus lactis and a nisin activity test was done. But unfortunately we could not see any zone of inhibition.

Thoughts About GMO
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) refer to plants, animals and microorganism which are generally altered or manipulated by a non-natural means in order to incorporate genes from another organism, which share a similarity with synthetic biology. In addition to numerous scientific and technical challenges, both GMOs and synthetic biology raise ethical issues and biosecurity issues.
There is nothing ambiguous that GMOs and synthetic biology are capable of improving the quality of our life and handling a variety of global problems to a large extent. However, the dangers vs. benefits of GMOs are widely debated ever since its birth.
For the sake of arousing citizens’ interest to synthetic biology and trigger further reflection on GMOs, ZJU-CHINA held a debate among undergraduates in ZJU campus. The topic for debate is ""whether we should stop developing GMOs technology and synthetic biology"". Positive side stands for ""we should stop developing GMOs technology and synthetic biology"", while the negative side stands for ""we shouldn’t stop developing GMOs technology and synthetic biology"".
First Round
Negative side [1st debater]:
Honorable judges, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to state the opinion that “we shouldn’t stop developing GMOs technology and synthetic biology”.
There is no denying that developing GMOs can make great contributions to human beings. From the aspect of agriculture, a huge lack of foodstuff would pose a threat to human beings in the near future.
First and foremost, the areas of arable land are sharply decreasing or occupied by industrial land as the process of urbanization. Thus, improving unit area yield of agriculture product and in turn improving the total grain output is of great urgency. Furthermore, for the increase rate of human beings, global population is predicted to reach the number of 8.5 billion until 2030, so all the living material will be extremely limited. Among all the methods to solve this problem, developing GMOs and synthetic biology are just the most efficient ones. So, I’d like to point out that “we shouldn’t stop developing GMOs technology and synthetic biology”. Thank you.
Positive side [1st debater]:
My fellow debaters, I’m afraid I disagree with your opinion and reasons"

Modularity
After the team had finished the genetic design of Inland, Coastal, Marine, and Polar bacteria, time was almost run out and there were still some concerns on the performance of promoters and ribothermometers. To make sure that we could have a chance to test the uncertain parts without delaying the whole circuits’ synthesis, instructor suggested us to modularize genetic circuits and then manipulate the modules by using Gibson Assembly.
The team divided the modules into two groups. One is “promoter + operator/ RBS/Ribothermometer”. The other one is “Coding sequence + terminator”. Details are in the following form.
Actually, in Inland, Coastal, Marine and Polar bacteria, there are several overlaps in the composition of genetic circuits. For instance, Marine and Polar bacteria both contain blue chromoprotein gene; Coastal and Inland bacteria both contain yellow chromoprotein gene. Each repeating part is only shown as one module.
How can modularity help?
Firstly, the modules would be directly inserted into the plasmid pSB1C3, so that the team could hand in new parts immediately after characterizing them.
Secondly, this method ensures us to get the perfect circuits as soon as possible. It makes constructing long designed"
Vanderbilt,2015,Team:Vanderbilt#Practices#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", fluoresecnce measurements were much more consistant. In addition to this valuable finding, which has caused our lab to change our measurement protocol, they also validated our finding that the K314100 promoter was not reliable with expression. On the contrary, with the R0010 promoter, our engineered RFP had good fluorescence signal- thus giving us independent confirmation from a second lab that our optimized RFPs were still expressed well.
University of Virigina:
As killswitches were a maor emphasis for our mutation-optimization strategy, we proposed to improve the SacB killswitch that Virigina's iGEM team was using for the engineered probiotics. Using their original part sequence, we generated an optimized version which we then sent their time for synthesizing and testing in their system. We also gave their team the names of Vanderbilt faculty that had legal expertise in the area of probiotic medicine that their team was working on.
University of California at San Franscisco:
After hearing about their project through our mutation survey, we offered the analyze the genetic circuits that the UCSF team engineered. We have arranged to analyze their full circuit sequences through our circuit-optimization software, in order to determine the risk mutation would pose in their paritcular situation.
University of Georgia:
We participated in the Archae interlab study hosted by the University of Georgia's team, during which we measured red fluorescent proteins for them
Vilnius-Lithuania:
After hearing about their project through our mutation survey, we gave the Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team statistics on how mutation-prone their two most important gene sequences were. We divided these mutation spots into categories so that their team could consider the potential contributions of different sources of mutagens.
