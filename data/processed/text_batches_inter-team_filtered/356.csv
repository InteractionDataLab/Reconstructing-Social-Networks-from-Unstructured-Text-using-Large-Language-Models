iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

We synthesized β-carotene and zeaxanthin by assembling crtEBIY and crtZ of existing BioBrick parts. Though the part crtZ has been unconfirmed to produce zeaxanthin, we confirmed it for the first time in iGEM.
In addition, we succeeded in synthesizing astaxanthin by introducing the new BioBrick part crtW. Therefore, the carotenoid synthetic pathway reached the end.

Introduction
Carotenoids are natural organic pigments in plants and bacteria. Synthetic carotenoid pigments colored yellow, red or orange represent about 15-25% of the cost of production of commercial feed. Carotenoids are terpenoid based on a structure having the chemical formula C40H56. There are about 600 carotenoids, which perform a wide range of functions. (For example, acting as antioxidants [1] , and as precursors to other organic compounds.) Among carotenoids, astaxanthin is not known to be converted to Vitamin A, which is converted from most of carotenoids and is toxic when its concentration too high.
Previous year, our team has completed melanin synthetic pathway. Since the carotenoid synthetic pathway is huge, BioBrick Registry doesn’t cover all parts to complete the pathway. This year, we introduced a new BioBrick part to synthesize more various kinds of carotenoids. And we succeeded in synthesizing astaxanthin, one of the final metabolite of the pathway.

May 24: Correspondence with McKenna Hicks (Former iGEM Member, 2017 UCSC Team)
McKenna Hicks was a member of the 2017 UCSC iGEM team. We emailed her to ask her questions about her team’s project related to cyanobacteria, especially since that team worked with the same strain of cyanobacteria that we were planning to work with. In particular, we asked for advice on constructs and culturing techniques. McKenna advised us to add terminators to our constructs because the plasmid backbones we were using did not have correctly oriented ones, as her team discovered during their work. She also supplied information and specifications about their culturing setup. Emphasized that cyanobacteria transformation may be a time-consuming process of transformation without carbon dioxide so we should consider running our experiments in parallel projects if necessary.
May 25 to May 31: Correspondence with Dr. Susan Golden (Director of Center for Circadian Biology, University of California - San Diego)
We reached out to Dr. Susan Golden upon review of the literature, we discovered that she wrote the protocol for S. elongatus transformation and created the promoterless luxAB NS1 vector, pAM1414 in which we would eventually use in our final project. We wanted her advice on performing her protocols in optimal conditions. More specifically, we emailed Dr. Susan Golden to ask about her vectors on Addgene. We asked her questions regarding the restriction enzyme sites for our promoter sequences which we would put upstream of the LuxAB gene in pAM1414. She explained that BamHI and BsiWI should be suitable enzymes to insert our promoter sequences. Dr. Golden also confirmed that DH5alpha would be a compatible growth strain for the cyanobacterial cloning vectors pAM1414, pAM2991, and pAM1579. She also answered our questions regarding which luminometers should be used for characterizing the promoters. Regarding promoter characterization, we were unsure of whether to use a luciferase- related plasmid such as luxCDE or use decanal and Dr. Golden explained that adding decanal to the cells would be adequate. Additionally, when talking with Dr. Golden, we learned about neutral sites in her recommended cyanobacteria “suicide vectors.” These types of vectors integrate into the genome through double homolog"

JUDGING FORM ⇗
Our team engaged with the public about synthetic biology often, most notably when we presented at the NASA Ames Research Center Showcase, the Mountain View Tech Showcase, and the NIAC Symposium in Boston. At all of these events we presented on our project to a diverse audience –– ranging from children to researchers working on NASA. At the showcases we also extended our presentation to what the field of synthetic biology is, teaching through demonstration: having individuals extract strawberry DNA (to the delight of many children) and fold up paper origami. It was also particularly rewarding to hear young people, especially young girls, say how much they our project and that they wanted to pursue an education in science.
NASA Silicon Valley Innovations: From the Earth to the Moon and Mars
At the NASA Silicon Valley Innovations: From the Earth to the Moon and Mars Showcase, we were able to engage with several children and introduce them to the field of synthetic biology. As mentioned above, we conducted quick & fun experiments with children ranging from ages 5 to 10 to extract the DNA from strawberries. We also folded DNA structures with them from printed cut outs, as well as provided a mini Mars like environment to encourage children to play and think about how to build their own dream Space Habitat. We additionally had the opportunity to talk to professionals at NASA who further informed our project and encouraged us to consider different avenues of research. We similarly were able to expose them to the potential for synthetic biology in their own practice.  You can learn more about the NASA Ames Showcase by seeing their webpage linked here.

Mountain View, CA, Tech Showcase
Similarly, at the Mountain View Tech Showcase, we were able to present to a broad range of individuals. We performed similar outreach to children, adults, professionals, and the like. We were able to generally educate individuals on what synthetic biology is, as well as our project and our goals.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," working at the laboratory for this purpose. Since the base of synthetic biology is the work with genetically modified organisms (GMO), it is necessary to look out for risk factors like spreading of the organism or infection from the investigators. It is also important to highlight that molecular biology works at the laboratory involve the use of some harmful chemicals, which is another aspect of the safety to be considered.
Safety in the laboratory
Figure 1: Team members listening (except Jan ;) ) to the lecture of Dr. Martin Schlapschy covering safety in the laboratory and the german genetic engineering law.
The Laboratory in which the iGEM Project has been conducted, at the Chair of biological chemistry is classified as a laboratory with the biosafety level S1. According to the German law of the regulation of GM technology (Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik) there are 4 levels of biosafety, namely from S1 to S4. In the Level S1 there is considered that no risk for human health or the environment is present. [2] In order to guarantee the integrity of all the team members and the environment, we took preventive steps prior to the beginning of our lab work. All team members that were going to be performing wet lab tasks were required to attend a lecture about the risks and precautions while working with GMOs. It was conducted by Dr. Martin Schlapschy in charge of the safety of the laboratory. In this presentation  information about the regulation of biology by governmental institutions in Germany and the obligations each laboratory has to fulfill e.g. having a good and ethical practice was also included.  After this, all team members were given an introduction to the laboratory, in order to get to know all important safety features as well as localization of the proper lab equipment. Factors like disposal of chemicals, GMOs and handling of dangerous chemicals or sensitive cells (cell culture) were specifically emphasized and thoroughly explained.
It is important to underline some important safety measures that have to be taken while conducting molecular biology experiments:
The use of Ethidium bromide, since it is considered to be a mutagenic chemical compound. The use of gloves and safety glasses was mandatory while handling it. [3]

Project Name: The beast and its Achilles heel: A novel target to fight multi-resistant bacteria
Project Abstract:
Since the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928, antibiotics have marked a major victory of mankind in the battle against infectious diseases. However, after 90 years, the antibiotics are now losing their old time glory: Bacteria acquire resistance against antibiotics and become unbridled. We must control the use of antibiotics, meanwhile, we need new antibiotics, which can sufficiently eliminate the invaders without hurting the ""good"" bacteria. Therefore, cyclic di-AMP, an important, recently discovered signaling molecule in Gram-positive bacteria, has come to our sight. Our project is to build a screening system targeting c-di-AMP, which could be applied in novel-drug screening. With this system, the level of c-di-AMP in the cell can be visualized and measured.

TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"karyote to animal. In prokaryotic organisms, bacterial cellulose is synthesized mainly by Gluconacetobacter, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Escherichia, Enterobacter and salmonella. In nature, only bacteria can synthesize cellulose pellicle with water-holding texture, among which the most studied bacteria are the genus Gluconacetobacter. Several common strains in the genus Gluconacetobacter can be distinguished by different representations. Bacteria that can synthesize bacterial cellulose are mainly G. Europaeus, G. intermedius, G. Oboediens, G. Nataicola, G. Sacchari and G.xylinus. Researchers have been studying the biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose in recent decades. This G.xylinus has long been recognized as a model strain. Many classical cellulose synthesis pathways and regulatory models were obtained in G.xylinus. Therefore,we choose G.xylinus as the research object in this experiment.
The biosynthesis pathway of bacterial cellulose in G.xylinus is complicated including the synthesis of cellulose precursor, polymerization of glucan monomers and assembly of glucan chains.
The biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose begins with the conversion of substrates to cellulose precursors, which are usually carbon sources, such as the conversion of glucose to uridine diphosphate glucose (udp-glucose). Uridine diphosphate glucose is the substrate of cellulose synthase, and it is catalyzed by cellulose synthase to form β-1 and 4 glucoside bonds between glucose monomers. There are specific sites on the outer membranes of the bacterial cells, which are coupled with the cellulose synthase complexes and is the spot where the polymerization is conducted [9]. When the polymerization reaction is over, the newly generated cellulose is secreted to the extracellular through these sites. The following figure is a partial schematic of the production of cellulose by G. xylinus
We hope to optimize the metabolic pathway of bacterial cellulose, redirecting more carbon sources into the production of bacterial cellulose; meanwhile expressing key genes in BC synthesis process. Through these two methods we hope to achieve high yield of BC . Therefore, we designed the following experiments:
Design & Engineering :
Phosphoglucomutase(PGM) is able to catalyze the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate and plays an significant role in both glucose metabolism and BC metabolic network.

At last, our circuit is complete!
If everything works as planned, this circuit should express C16 on the surface of E. coli via INPNC, which will then bind to CSP receptors on S. mutans, anchoring the two cells together.
Putting it to the test!
Having a circuit is only the start! Now we must test how well our circuits function, specifically if INPNC can truly anchor the fusion protein on the cell membrane. The first test is a qualitative assay to determine if the fusion protein can truly function as intended, and the second is a quantitative test to further reinforce the conclusions of the first.
Is the INPNC-C16 fusion protein on the membrane?
To test whether or not our INPNC-C16 fusion protein can be successfully expressed on the surface of our E. coli, we constructed a testing circuit with RFP after C16:
We expect this circuit to produce an INPNC-C16-RFP fusion protein with RFP on the very outer side of the membrane, shown below.
At the same time, we used our functional circuit design as a control:
We expect this circuit to produce everything identically, besides RFP, and that it will produce a colorless tube.
After constructing our testing circuit, we incubated the transformed bacteria together for 12 ~ 16 hours, before centrifugation. Theoretically, there are three possible results for our testing.
Possible Result 1: Fusion protein is on cell membrane
This is our anticipated result. If the fusion protein is on the membrane, then after centrifuge the pellet should display a very clear red color.
Possible Result 2: Fusion protein is inside cell membrane
If for some reason the fusion protein failed to display on the cell membrane, we will see a dull whitish-red color after centrifuge.
Possible Result 3: Fusion protein is outside cell membrane
If for some reason the fusion protein had been exported outside the cell, we will see a dull red color in the supernatant.
Here is the details of our method
Use 5ml LB culture and 5μl chloramphenicol antibiotic to incubate bacteria transformed by function test circuit (K523013 + CSP16 + E1010 and B0015) and control circuit (K523013 + CSP16 + and B0015) 12~16 hour.

Every iGEM project is a team effort. Without anyone in the following list, this project would not have gotten to where it is now.
General Organisation
Brian Weidensee, Nikolas Layer, Daniela Nguyen and Katharina Sporbeck were responsible for the general organisation, starting by organising the weekly meetings to communicate with other teams and institutions.
Fruitforce
The idea for the this year’s main project was initiated by Mirjam Gneiting. The final project was then developed together with Brian Weidensee, Lukas Fuhs, Maximilian Bunz, Nikolas Layer and Yana Parfyonova. For the lab work, Stefan Petschak, Pascal Wang, Milena Krach and Simon Christmann reinforced the team.
Clone Wars
The Clone Wars project was developed and planned by Nicolai von Kuegelgen, Daniela Nguyen and Katharina Sporbeck.  The practical work in the wet lab was done by Stefan Petschak, supported by Milena Krach, Mirjam Gneiting, Pascal Wang and Stefanie Holz.
Death Star
The concept for our Death Star was developed by Mirjam Gneiting and Kevin Sabath.
Human Practices
Our human practices team consists of Jens Reich, Lucas Muehling and Sarah Roffeis. They organised participation at the meet-ups, organised our presentation in the Science Slam, and helped our high school intern to find around our lab.
Modelling/Wiki
All of the modelling was done by Adrian Geissler with the help of Alexander Roehl. The wiki design was done by Mirjam Gneiting, and Adrian Geissler transformed this into the code for the wiki.

2. ArgR knock-out
The second construct is meant to increase the arginine production by knocking out the repressor argR which is induced by the presence of arginine [10]. The argR::Kan knock-out provided by Anne Farewell was transduced to a recipient strain via P1 transduction [11]. The P1 phage was also provided by Anne Farewell.
Bacillus subtilis
The purpose of the constructs in B. subtilis is to enable it to grow on acetate and overproduce arginine. Both constructs are based on the vectors from the bacillus box made by the 2012 LMU-Munich iGEM-team [12].

B. subtilis cannot utilize acetate as a carbon source, which can be solved by inserting the glyoxylate shunt from Bacillus licheniformis into B. subtilis, see Figure 10. The shunt consists of two enzymes in an operon, aceA and aceB, under"

While scientific advances constantly generate new innovations, it is a major challenge for those who root themselves in time-honored moral traditions to think about how these new discoveries should be approached.
Vegans, vegetarians, and eaters of kosher all scrutinize the origins of their food before consuming it. If offered snacks don't conform to the guidelines they live by, they won't eat. The preparation of meat for these groups is particularly tricky, as it either involves careful ritual slaughter, in the case of kosher, or a prohibition against meat altogether, in the cases of veganism and vegetarianism.
One recent US patent describes six methods for producing meat in a laboratory. The possibility of growing meat in petri dishes has already garnered the attention of groups concerned with the ethical treatment of animals; it would mean that meat could be produced with virtually no opportunity for cruelty or mistreatment of animals. But one salient question has not yet been approached: Is such a product truly meat?
While such questions are in general not very useful – why should it matter what we call it? - when it comes to translating modern concepts into the language of ancient traditions, we are forced to clearly define the objects we are dealing with. As such, we have approached leading thinkers in the Jewish community whose expertise includes both the legal aspects of their respective traditions as well as the scientific knowledge necessary to comprehensively consider the issues.
The Legal Approach: The Search for Precedent
First of all, this discussion requires a quick overview of the general laws of kashrut (the kosher system):
• Among fish, birds, beasts, and insects, only a small group of species may be eaten. From fish, only those with fins and scales. From birds, only those not expressly prohibited by the Bible and from the remainder, birds that closely resemble in appearance and behavior those traditionally"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Conclusion1_-_-_TEXT.html," permits to treat several pathologies. DVS is a new tool to integer a gene insert in a target cell. We choose to use DVS in lung cancer.
Nowadays, lung cancer is the most spread cancer. Often associated to tobacco, it can touch people who had never smoked as well.
Lung cancer can be divided into several types :
- Squamous cell carcinoma (35-40 %)
- Adenocarcinoma (25-35 %)
- Large cell carcinoma (10-15 %)
- Small cell carcinoma (20-25 %)
In each case, like in most cancers, tumor suppressor genes are mutated and become non functional. DVS bring tumor suppressor genes « wild type » and their promoter in cancer cell of the lung.
Lung cancer has been chosen in consequence of the natural tropism of the tissue vector , Mycobacterium avium, for lung. Inside the lung, it delivers the cell vector . These one infects cells. In the case of healthy cells, tumor suppressor gene promoters are naturally present but not activated. Therapeutic plasmid promoters will not be activated as well, so there is not apoptosis induction. But in the case of tumor cells, tumor suppressor gene promoters are activated but their sequence are mutated so proteins are not functional and the apoptotic pathway is not induced. Therapeutic plasmid brings a new sequence  of these tumor suppressor genes with their promoters. These promoters are activated and new transcript proteins are functional and able to induce the apoptotic pathway of the cell.

Future prospects
DVS is a tool usable in several diseases. It can be adapted to pathologies by the strategic choice of the tissue vector . In function of the tropism of the bacterial strain chosen, different organs are reached. Furthermore, DVS is specific thanks to the therapeutic plasmid which contains interchangeable genetic sequences depending of the target disease.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," of bacteria and phages (and hence an MOI), understand how the populations interact and change over continuous time.
Assumptions:
There is no delay in infection. (All infections are instantaneous.)
All infections are successful (infected bacteria subsequently die of infection)
New bacteria are introduced from the external environment at a constant rate. This is a reasonable assumption because bacteria concentration in the water that enters our multi-cistern system should be consistent.
Definitions of Parameters and Variables:
1. Intrinsic Growth Rate of Bacteria (r): aka. Intrinsic rate of natural increase or the Malthusian parameter. This rate describes the maximum theoretical rate of increase of a population per individual. Using this parameter to account for bacteria population growth instead of the traditional doubling time allows us to investigate the interactions between phages and bacteria in continuous time.
2. Influx of Bacteria: An increase in bacteria population caused by the entry of external bacteria into the system.
3. Natural Death Rate of Bacteria: Bacteria death caused by factors other than infection.
4. Natural Death Rate of Phages: Phages that become unable to infect more bacteria.
5. Contact factor (c): This parameter describes how efficiently a given phage population can infect a given bacterial population. Although the computation of c is very complex and involves many factors as described above (such as the time during a bacteria lifecycle when inoculation begins), the use of empirical evidence of the value of c from past researches simplifies this process without compromising the accuracy of our model.

Figure 5: Bacteria-phage dynamic in continuous time. The initial bacteria population reproduces and gradually increases. Once the bacteria population reaches the threshold (the peak observed) for mass action, the high abundance of susceptible bacteria makes the probability of phage infection increase greatly, at which time (about 1.25 hours after inoculation as shown in figure 5b) the phage population increase drastically and overwhelms the bacterial population. However, the bacteria population is never zero at any given moment due to the constant influx and the intrinsic rate of natural increase. Any presence of bacteria, though, results in the bacteria being immediately infected by the phage population, which explains the constant gradual increase observed in the phage population following its drastic increase around 1.25 hours and"

THURSDAY, JULY 14
Thursday morning began with celebration as all of the previous day’s transformations worked with multiple colonies appearing on every plate. Go, team! With all phosphorus genes successfully transformed, the team can now move forward with characterizing proteins. Along with this, some strains will be sent to other collaborating teams for characterization to confirm results.
FRIDAY, JULY 15
Are synthetic biology terms sometimes confusing? Is scientific jargon difficult to understand? Look for explanation no further than the team’s newly-released glossary of synthetic biology and iGEM terms hosted on the Experiment page.
With the new bioreactor prototype, several protocols needed to be written including a standard for measuring water flow and a process for system maintenance. The plan for the upcoming week is to characterize individual proteins and begin conducting tests to determine the optimal substrate for E. coli to inhabit in the bioreactor’s external chambers. Any thoughts on what to name the bioreactor? Tweet @PurdueBiomakers to let the team know what you think.
Week 9
MONDAY, JULY 18
In collaboration with Exeter, the team will be growing up last summer’s killswitch genetic construct under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. To begin the week, they set up Dr. Rickus’s anaerobic chamber, which is a large, clear box with thick black gloves attached to reach into it–very mad science-y (example below). This week, culture growth will begin after air tanks to sustain the anaerobic culture arrive.
TUESDAY, JULY 19
Mid-week discussion centered around using the sol-gel method to suspend E. coli in silica beads with which to fill containers external to the main containment area of the bioreactor. The bacteria will be immobilized within the matrix of silica fibers while phosphorus is still able to pass through, making this solution ideal for easy input and retrieval of E. coli from the bioreactor system. See the diagram below for an explanation of the method.
WEDNESDAY, JULY 20
Wednesday’s focus was the development of a protocol for the quantification of phosphorus both intracellularly and extracellularly. It involved the creation of a guide for phosphorus on the Experiment page, so if you want to become familiar with the differences between total phosphorus, orthophosphate, and polyphosphate, feel free to check it out.

Control Theory
Control theory is an engineering concept that describes dynamic input-output systems with feedback. Using control theory, we have four steps in our automation setup: Measure, Compute, Compare, and Correct. Each step describes what our system must accomplish, and creates feedback in order to create a desired outcome.
Figure 1. Control theory schematic.
Colorimetry
We specifically chose the violacein pathway in order to exploit the unique self-colorimetric properties of its metabolic products. Each product in the pathway has a certain pigment, thus providing us a way to potentially measure its concentration akin to performing a colorimetric analysis. This can be implemented if each concentration of product (or mix of products) relates to only one unique RGB value set.
Image Processing
The image processing and response system handles the implementation of control theory in our system. To control products being made, a camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi computer will continuously capture images of our yeast culture with metabolites.
Through processing RGB values, it will determine the amount of metabolites in the solution, and send feedback signals to the culture management system to change inducer concentration levels. To explain it as a set of mathematical expressions, we want to establish a relationship between:
Inducer concentration and metabolite concentration
Metabolite production and RGB values
Figure 2. Vector I represents inducer inputs, and vector P represents concentrations of metabolite products. The matrix of RGB values are the points to generate each color intensity graph for each color, where the subscript term determines where on the x-axis it lies.
Machine Learning: Determining I ⇒ P
The relationship between inducers and metabolite products can be solved with machine learning.
Inducible promoters work by having the inducer substance bind to a repressor on the gene binding site. By binding to it, the inducer changes the conformation of the repressor, making it detach from the DNA. In this way, inducible promoters"

BSim Graphical User Interface (GUI)
We have made BSim more widely accessible by creating a user-friendly and intuitive graphical user interface. This makes BSim accessible to the entire synthetic biology community, rather than just those with JAVA programming knowledge.
Gene Regulatory Network Modelling
We have investigated the behaviour of our bacteria by creating a mathematical model of their behaviour. This model could then be analysed using numerical and analytic methods.
Collaboration
Our modelling team have helped to simulate the UCL 2010 team’s new system. Working with another team has also helped to inform the design of the BSim GUI.
agrEcoli Cost estimates
In support of our human practices work, our modelling team have looked into the cost to farmers of using agrEcoli, and how much money and fertiliser they can expect to save.
Human Practices
Publicising agrEcoli
Our new approach to human practices, building on previous work by iGEM teams, is a publicity campaign. By presenting our prototype as a functioning and marketable product, we've framed a hypothetical situation in which our project could be released.
Public Engagement
Our team has visited a school and spoken on two radio shows in order to communicate our ideas with the general public.

When the uric acid concentration was lower than the threshold value, HucR inhibited Phuco, and Phuco was turned off. Subsequent genes could not be transcribed and translated, so that sRNA inhibiting lysis2 could not be expressed, while lysis2 could be normally expressed, resulting in death of bacteria. Due to the high concentration of uric acid in the intestinal tract of uric acid patients, the death rate of bacteria in the patient is not high. However, when the bacteria are lost to the external environment, the uric acid concentration in the external environment is lower than the threshold value, which activates the lethal system of the bacteria, leading to the death of bacteria cracking and reaching the purpose and effect of in vitro death.

Safety of lab:
We wear plastic gloves, white coats and goggles when performing the experiment. In addition, the experimental team of our team conducted safety training and had a clear understanding and deep understanding of how to ensure safety during the experiment. During the experiment, we will use the knowledge we received during safety training to ensure safety.
At the same time, we always guarantee the clean and orderly laboratory.
Safety of transporting DNA:
Miniprepped plasmid DNA (over 250ng) have been dried down. They are in 96 well plate format sealed with adhesive foil. We commissioned GenScript Biotech Corp. to carry the transportation components. Submission shipments have been declared and labeled as DNA (non-hazardous, non-regulated, non-infectious, for research purposes only).

A sample was then taken from an agar plate containing E.coli possessing pMUTIN4 and was added to each of the two flasks. The 500ml flasks were then left in the 37ºC shaking incubator overnight.
Preparing the chosen BioBricks
Mathew pipetting the sterile distilled water needed to hydrate the BioBricks
Jess carefully rehydrating one of the BioBricks from the Spring Distributions
There are five BioBricks which are likely to be used by our system. They are:
BBa_C0056 – cI repressor (lambda phage)
BBa_B1002 – Terminator sequence
BBa_C0077 – CinR activator
BBa_C0076 – Autoinducer synthetase
BBa_R0077 – Promoter (CinR and HSL regulated, RBS+)
Each well containing these BioBricks was firstly identified and marked with a pen (in the corners of the wells). Once we had confirmed that the correct wells had been identified, a pipette containing 15ml of distilled water was then used to pierce the film lids of the wells and hydrate the DNA within. After a few rounds of mixing the DNA inside the wells, the BioBricks were extracted and placed into Eppendorf tubes which were transferred to the -20ºC freezer for storage.
The locations of the BioBricks can be found here – all are contained within the iGEM spring distributions. The hyperlinks for each BioBrick below will direct you to the distribution information page:

Hannah completed her CBAR transformation today. Kait, Victoria, and Alexander completed a gel, gel extraction, and transformation for constructs for the Codon Optimization Project . Kevin and Chris inoculated six cultures with transformed colonies that grew overnight. Chris also did a comparison transformation between the CC DH10B cell line that he and Kevin made over the weekend, and the other CC cells that the team has been using.
Wednesday, June 13, 2012
Victoria and Kait made more plasmid stock for the Codon Optimization Project . Hannah made cultures from the colonies that grew from her CBAR reaction. Kevin and Chris extracted plasmids for the Multidirectional Promoters Project . They also began making more plasmid vector in preparation for their CBAR reaction.
Thursday, June 14, 2012
Plasmids from Hannah's CBAR reaction were extracted and back-up cultures were inoculated. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander ran a gel to confirm the components of plasmids to be used in the final Codon Optimization Construct. Kevin and Chris inoculated a culture with a colony containing the vector plasmid for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. They came in later that night to extract the plasmid.
Friday, June 15, 2012
Kevin ran a PCR on the vector component that he and Chris extracted the previous night. This was run through gel electrophoresis to separate the desired component from other side-products, and to ensure the fragment was the correct size. This was finally cleaned and concentrated for a CBAR reaction on Monday. Hannah grew her cultures from her CBAR reaction to get a higher plasmid yield. She also prepared new chemically competent DH10B cells since the stock was running low. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander checked a plasmid's components for the Codon Optimization Project.

The cell viability curve below outlines the survival of cells after electroporation of the Cas9 RNP  complex in vivo. Higher concentration of Cas9 RNP complex results in lower cell viability correlating with an  increase of double stranded breaks. This indicates that the Cas9 RNP complex is efficiently introduced in to the bacteria cells without a loss of  function. These results were also observed by Dutra et al [1].
Fig 2. Cell viability curve of CFU/mL against increasing Cas9 concentration. The curve indicates that increasing Cas9 concentration inversely effects cell viability.
Individual colonies from the serial dilution plates were patch plated from M9-glucose to M9-glycerol plates which is expected to cause increased production of heme to allow oxidative metabolism of the glycerol. These patched colonies were screened for the accumulation of PPIX by fluorescence spectroscopy  (Ex 404nm/ Em 600-700nm and Em 630/Ex 350-500nm). The emission peak at 630nm and excitation peak at 404nm indicates the presence of PP-IX. The excitation spectra from this screening is shown below.
Fig 3. Fluorescence spectroscopy results demonstrating the accumulation of PPIX at 404nm excitation. (A) Mutants are indicated by peaks at 620nm suggesting PPIX accumulation. (B) Control assay grown on glycerol, showing no changes in peak emission.
We found 12 colonies which were slightly coloured on the cells from Cas9 RNP complex colonies patch plated from M9-glucose to M9-glycerol plates. These were screened for fluorescence and showed PPIX accumulation. The highest accumulator, mutant #1, which was the most coloured was selected for further experiments.
Mutant #1 was streaked out to single colonies and the single colonies were screen for PPIX accumulation. The fluorescence emission spectrum (Ex 404nm) of two of these colonies is shown below, indicating significant accumulation of protoporphyrin IX within these cells. This mutant was then made competent and used in further experiments .

The numbers (1,3,4,5 etc.) describe the plasmids of different bacterial colonies. Additionally, a DNA ladder (100 - 10000 bp; Fermentas DNA Ladder Mix) is added into the gel for the validation of the DNA product length. The resulting RARE insert should be 212 bp long. The RARE inserts are difficult to recognize, because the JeT insert of the original plasmid is ~ 180 bp. Therefore, some good constructs are chosen: RARE #8, RARE #9, RARE #15 and RARE #23.

The latter example shows that a lot of money can be made with antibiotics nowadays when the old ones keep of failing against multi-resistant strains. Although big pharma companies like Bayer, Roche or Sanofi have realized that by now, it might be too late to catch up to the leading position. While Astra Zeneca increased its department in 2009 through buying the French Novexel, Sanofi and co. gave up on many promising ideas that are now fruitfully developed by their spun offs.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of animals and also between the diverse tissues. Ruminants’ entrails contain most B12. However, the type of cooking has further impact on the B12 content. [4]
Also some vegetarian B12 nourishments exist. But, again, the B12 was synthesized by microorganisms living in symbiosis with these products, e.g. algae and edible mushrooms, or being part of the production process as in tempe or beer. Nevertheless, the B12 content in plant-derived food is often biologically inactive in humans or only present in small quantities that an adult for example would have to drink several liters beer per day in order to cover the B12 requirement. [5], [6]
An adult needs approximately 3.0 µg Vitamin B12 per day [7]. Vitamin B12 fulfills diverse functions in the human body. Thereby, only the two forms methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) are biologically active. MeCbl functions together with the methionine synthase in the methylation of homocysteine, resulting in methionine. Thus, MeCbl contributes to the one-carbon metabolism and the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, thereby being part of the synthesis of diverse molecules like DNA, RNA, hormones, proteins, lipids or myelin. AdoCbl on the other hand interacts with the methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase in forming succinate out of propionate, by that contributing to the fat and protein metabolism, hemoglobin synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Consequently, a Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause diverse disorders when important compounds cannot be synthesized and partially cytotoxic intermediates, like homocysteine, accumulate. Heart and vascular diseases, stroke, arteriosclerosis, megaloblastic anemia, depression, fatigue or neuropathy can amongst others result from a B12 deficiency. [8], [9], [10]
Especially vegetarians and vegans as well as elderly people have a higher risk to lack Vitamin B12. Therefore, these people could need to compensate the deficiency by taking B12 supplements.
Vitamin B12 is also added to diverse everyday products like vegetal milk, fruit gum, contact lense solution, tooth paste, energy drink etc. Just take a closer look on the products’ ingredients you use in your daily routine.

Why did we collaborate?
Not only does the option of the InterLab study contribute to communication within the scientific community, but so does the collaboration aspect of iGEM. Here, we reached out to teams across the world, offering our help and advice, and also receiving some in return. We have conversed and gotten to know many other teams, both national and international, through not only e-mails, but Skype, Twitter, Facebook & more. It has been a pleasure getting to meet such amazing people all around the world. Many thanks to all who have helped us through our journey.
Newcastle University
Initial Contact: We were looking for a UK team to perform a perchlorate growth curve, and luckily Newcastle offered to do one! We got in contact via e-mails, and soon had sent the COSHH and protocol to follow.
Cooperation: As Newcastle's iGEM project is focusing nitrogen fixing bacteria, they grew these in sodium perchlorate salts. The following bacteria were used: Herbaspirillum seropedicae, Azorhizobium caulinodans and Azospirillum brasilense. They were grown in different concentrations of sodium perchlorate, in a 96-well plate. They then gathered the data from this, and produced a growth curve shown here . This data helped us hugely with understanding how perchlorate affects the growth of different organisms, not just E. coli, and opened the idea that we could potentially take other bacteria to Mars.
Follow-Up: Since these results we have stayed in touch via e-mail. From one UK team to another, we'd like to thank Newcastle for being amazing and helping us with our project. We're very much looking forward to supporting their project and presentation in Boston! #TeamNewcastle
University College London
Initial Contact: After deciding to conceptualise a bioreactor we reached out to teams we met at the iGEM Oxford meet up who had engineering expertise. UCL as an institution has an outstanding reputation for bioreactor innovations and"
NAWI_Graz,2017,Team:NAWI Graz#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," wanted to form an even closer cooperation by detecting a degradation product from their experiments and thus directly prove that their experimental setup and our construct function. We organised a video conference, but the plan was rejected, because the substrate amounts would not have been high enough to activate our promoter. Although no physical exchange took place, we would like to express our gratitude for the willingness to support and establish a new team in the competition.
Online Discussion about Safety
As part of the preparations for our lab work, we have seen the call for an online discussion of the team Uppsala on the official iGEM Collaboration page. After the subsequent contact, we got seats in the session #Genetic Engineering with special attention to safety. The questions were focused on the areas of ""uncontrolled dissemination"" and ""harmful abuse of our openly accessible GMO"". Together with the teams ETH_Zurich ,   UiOslo_Norway , Lund , Groningen and Uppsala , we discussed whether and how we could assume our GMOs behaviour in the wilderness. In addition we figured out whether and how GMOs could possibly be misused in a harmful way. The results of this discussion helped us  to complete our Safety Form .

Interactive Maze Design
We posted an announcement on the official iGEM Collaboration site to help us improve our robot algorithm. We developed a software to design mazes and therefor test and improve our robot controling code. As it is usual and obligate for software developers, we reached out for beta testers. Other iGEM teams are predistinated for this job, so we invited all other teams to help us. In addition, we set up tools in form of tablet computers at our human practice events. Some day, the iGEM Team Groningen contacted us. They were our first beta testers. The first mazes of the team, as simple as they were designed, could not be solved by our robot.
Fig. 2: The first maze design with our online maze design software. Designed by the iGEM Team Groningen
Due to these feedbacks we have extended the code of the program significantly and found a way to insert a coherent storage possibility, which allows the robot to escape much better from angled corners again and find the end of the maze.

Sole carbon source
bdh2 improves growth on 3HB
We have previously observed that MG1655 cells can survive in minimal media that contains 3HB as sole carbon source. This is evidence for that some uptake mechanism and a metabolic pathway is active at a low level in the cells. We hypothesised that the 3HB dehydrogenase could improve growth since it can convert 3HB into acetoacetate, a common metabolite in E.coli.
In order to test this, we run a growth experiment with various 3HB concentrations where the growth of cells containing bdh2 (BBa_K1149050) and Empty vector was recorded on a 96 well plate. We have calculated the growth rates from this data and plot it on the graph below.
3HB sole carbon source growth in minimal media with phaCAB and EV. MG1655 phaCAB were grown in supplemented and minimal M9 media. Relative to the empty vector control, there was no significant difference in growth as t-test gave p = 0.8072 > 0.05. However, an ANOVA of the data gave (F 3,8 = 6.589, p < 0.0149), thus the null hypothesis, there is no difference between M9M and M9S must be rejected. Indeed if we look closer, we see that both M9M EV and M9S EV are significantly different from another (p = 0.045), as are M9M phaCAB and M9S phaCAB (p = 0.0284). Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
3HB sole carbon source growth in M9S with P3HB synthesis pathway genes. The 3 phaCAB promoter constructs are represented with native phaCAB, constitutive phaCAB and hybrid phaCAB. In addition bdh2 was tested to see whether its presence increased growth for the cells. This was completed with 3 3HB concentrations - 100 μM, 10 mM and 100 mM. ANOVA analysis shows that there is no significant difference between any of the constructs (F 4,10 = 0.1875, p <"

Project Description
Background
Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in the world. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the number of new cases of breast cancer in the world reached 1.38 million in 2008, and that is 22.9% of all female malignancies; 460,000 women died of breast cancer, which is 13.7% of all female malignant tumor deaths, and 1.7% of all female deaths [1] According to statistics, the annual incidence of female breast cancer in China is 169,000, which is the second most common malignant tumor in women; the death of female breast cancer in China is about 45,000; it is the sixth most common cause of malignant tumor death in women [2] The occurrence and development of breast cancer involves many factors, and the change of gene level expression is the most important regulatory factor [3]. In recent years, breast cancer has become a growing threat to people, and many well-known celebrities have died of breast cancer, which has also aggravated people’s panic about this type of cancer.
Beina Yao, a Chinese pop singer, was born in Wuhan, Hubei, in September 26, 1981. At 16:55 January 16, 2015, Yao died due to relapsed of breast cancer in Peking University of Shenzhen Hospital, and she was only 33 years old. This incident caused great sensation in China.
miR-155 and miR-10b are two miRNAs that have high expression in human serum when a person has developed early forms of breast cancer in their tissues.Based on the high expression level in breast cancer patients’ serum and the high specificity, miRNA-155 and miRNA-10b will act as biomarkers (the alarm of breast cancer)in our project
What we are doing
 Our project is to use miRNA——miRNA155 and miRNA10b——in human serum as biomarkers to detect early forms of breast cancer.Based on the high expression level in breast cancer patients’ serum and the high specificity,miRNA-155 and miRNA"

No matter which protein we choose to produce, we will need to optimize the conditions for production taking the specific protein into account. How important the theoretical limitations we present here are, will be further unveiled upon future investigation and experiments.
Conclusion
Based on our research and discussion with expert we propose to use our system for production of IGF-1, PTH, GH, G-CSF and camelid antibody during long lasting space missions. First of all this decision is based on our interviews and discussions with experts. Based on their opinions we have further considered how easy the different proteins would be to produce with our system taking into consideration posttranslational modifications (PTM), protein size and the literature.  We have therefore analyzed potential target proteins from several perspectives, especially considering 1) is this protein interesting from a medical point of view? 2) Is this proteins feasible to produce with our system? It has been very important for development of our project to have the possibility to speak with experts such as Virginia Wotring, Karen McDonald, Jon Scott, Jørgen Sauer and Eva Horn Møller and we have very much incorporated their inputs into the very core of our project.

We were suggested that DH5α has a better viability and a higher protein expression. So  there's some mistakes in our strains which cause us couldn't get a expected microfluidic experiment result. So we compared two identical groups cultured at different degrees, 30℃ and 37℃.  Data analysis: E.coli maybe cultured at 30℃ had a stronger expression of protein from picture 1 but we were confused by picture 2 cause it indicated that expression at 30℃ is not larger than expression at 37℃.
2013/9/26 22:09:40
Future plan: 1.It's much better to culture at 30℃ rather than 37℃. 2.Does it better for us to use superfolded GFP? 3.Change another ultrasonic instrument or high pressure homogenizer.

Description:   We changed high pressure homogenizer to get cell fragments, in order to gain a more definite gel analysis. The high pressure homogenizer is under 37.5 kpSI  which supposed much too high to make protein. Even the super protein is far less compared with gel picture made after ultrasonic fragmentation, the unclear band is still there.  Data analysis: The band marked in red was not the target band. The band marked in green was not the target band.

There have been tweaks on the way landmines detection is done, but no major leaps on speed and versatility were achieved yet. Speed, versatility and maintaining the safety standards are some of the most important elements that need to be taken into account in the detection method.
In addition, when dealing with landmines clearance there are also several social limitations: poor infrastructure, low level of education of the workers, due to the fact they don’t have great exposure to technology.  Another problem is posed by the heavy machinery. Mr. Brady recalled cases on Angola, where the equipment was not able to arrive at the field.
In addition, the equipment consumes a lot of fuel and with metal detections battery life represents an issue. These are small things, but they tend to become obstacles in the long-run.
NPA has a Humanitarian department. What brings them to a particularly country has to deal with the urgency, ability to raise funds, humanitarian impact.  Priorities are brought from outside. Within the countries there is coordination done trough national authorities and United Nations to make sure there are no redundancies in the process.
Mr. Brady mentioned also about the  Global Landmines survey Initiative.  This was supposed to be an impact survey and get some sense of the impact. Yet, the number of the affected area is not 100% accurate as they were coming back with exaggerated areas. For instance in Yemen were identified  over 900 square kilometers. They were taking into account only the face value, and in the end it turned out being smaller. Demining technical people where involved to bring the numbers down ( and was possible to up to 20%). This urges to work with technical people and then delineate the area. The results of the survey are available online. The database that is used in all mines programmes is the Information  Management System for Mine Action.
Because we wanted to have a cost-benefit analysis of our device, ELECTRACE used in order to detect landmines, we asked about the current typical prices for the detection method. We found out that the target price for screening the area is less than 1 dollar per square meter, including all the costs: logistics, administration costs, etc. However, in some cases can go beyond this value, or could be  more expensive, depending on the locations. For instance, in Cyprus the costs were higher due to the fact is a more developed country.
A notable aspect to mention here is the huge amount of square meters that have to be initially"

Our Construct
According to theses two scientific findings, we designed our construct illustrated below.
Unlike previous studies FimH that we designed is produced continuously, after obtained binding induction of arabinose promoter would give rise to Butyryl CoA: Acetate CoA transferase that forms Butyrate subsequently.
Control group cells only (6 hours)
E.coli K12 (6 hours)
E.coli BL21 (6 hours)
The images above represent our co-culture results that we have treated E. coli K12 and  E. coli BL21 with CaCo2 cancer cell lines. The pictures show that the cells are sustainable for 6 hours, which is enough for our project. Our observation showed that optimal time for co-culture in our conditions is 6 hours. Then we optimized 1 hour is enough for binding and our treatment trials going to be performed in 5 hours. We expected to see increase in the cell death in a time dependent manner. According to our observation our BL21 forms clusters. However, Harvard BioDesign used E. coli K12 and it was challenging to see them without staining. therefore, BL21 was the best candidate in our case.

Promoting iGEM in the Middle East
Throughout the duration of working on our project, we have been communicating with the iGEM 2016 Team Ain Shams-Egypt to provide feedback on ideas and collaborate as the few schools located in the Middle East. The main goal for our collaboration was to exchange ideas to increase the number of teams participating in iGEM in our region.  On October 15, 2016, we had a video-chat conversation between the two teams, and discussed how to bring iGEM closer to our communities.
After exploring different ideas, we decided to create flyers that would be distributed to high schools in the Middle East.

Ethics in Synthetic Biology
By Jeni Shoesmith
Synthetic biology is a growing technology with many new and exciting applications. However along with any new technology comes new ethical issues that need to be addressed. Taking into account these concerns allows this new technology to progress in a safe and ethical manner. The public are highly concerned with what scientists get up to in their labs and if there is enough regulation and reasons, other than personal interest, behind their research. In this article we will discuss how synthetic biology can benefit society, the ethical issues that surround synthetic biology and how synthetic biology aims to address these issues and therefore conduct ethical research [1,3] .
Synthetic biology is a new area of research that takes advantage of molecular genetics to create new devices not seen in nature to solve modern issues. DNA is taken from different organisms and put together in novel orders and re-inserted into a new chassis (Usually bacteria or yeast cells). This DNA codes for proteins which are then expressed in the cells for a particular function eg, proteins that convert cellulose into biofuels. The sequences of these DNA parts are open source; so can be accessed by many people. This means that anyone with an idea could create new exciting devices to help solve problems in society.
Synthetic biology has many applications some we already know about and are on our way to achieving, while others haven’t even been discovered! One of the applications is being able to make biofuels from cellulose (which can be collected from waste paper). This means we could grow bacteria in big vats to produce biofuels and use this as an alternative to fossil fuels as bacteria form a readily available, renewable source. Also using synthetic biology means that we could save space on land which can be used to farm food or alternatively aid towards forest conservation. Furthermore exploiting synthetic biology for a purpose such as this is much cheaper as keeping bacterial cultures alive is easier than growing corn or extracting fossil fuels.
Other exciting applications of synthetic biology include detection devices in diagnostics, using bacteria to remove toxins from water etc, bio-circuitry and drug production. These are all beneficial applications that can achieve their purpose at lower energy usage and lower costs. Therefore Synthetic biology can be used for worthwhile research?
Of course, as with any scientific research, there are ethical issues that arise. One is the economical implications of using synthetic biology to solve problems. As discussed earlier, the applications of synthetic biology have the potential to do some amazing things, however if some of the solutions are implemented there is a potential for a large sector of work to lose jobs"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

1 NotI Concatemers
Used yesterday’s gel purified fragments. We performed ligation using a 5:1 ratio of insert to vector. Our vector size is 2046 bp. Our insert is 143 bp. For 1121 ng of vector, we need 391.75 ng of insert. We set up the ligation reaction as below:
Amount (uL)
Vector (112.12 ng/uL)
10
Insert (52.63 ng/uL)
10
10X T4 Ligase Buffer
2.5
T4 Ligase
3
Total
25.5
We used excess insert because the recorded concentration from the nanodrop was higher than the theoretical yield. In addition, we used more T4 Ligase than in typical reactions due to the reaction having three times as many sticky ends to ligate.
2 Results
We cast a 0.8% TAE agarose gel to separate the bands. We ran this particular gel at 90 V for 2 hours. We excised four bands indicated for gel purification (Qiagen). The bottom most band may be due to vector self-ligation. The second band at 2.2 kb is probably singly ligated product.

In the future, we should CIP treat the vector so it doesn’t re-ligate."

RNA folding path videos
The video on the left for 16 nt signal length shows that the terminator is already hindered from folding completely and the video on the right, which is done for full signal length of 32 nt, displays that the terminator does not fold at all as the signal immediately binds to the terminator sequence as it is synthesized.
Finally we optimized the signal sequence and obtained a signal sequence of only 8 nt length.

Optimization of the signal sequence
We tried to optimize our signal sequence to find the minimal sequence trigger sequence length, which still enables antitermination. For this optimization we kept the random signaling part constant and varied the part which partially binds to the His-terminator to see which length is sufficient for antitermination for each case. Subsequently, we optimized the identity site lenght using the detected optimal trigger site lenght. Then we combined the results to find a optimal overall signal lenght.
When varying the trigger site, we found that having only the 2 nt of this part together with the random signaling part suffices for antitermination as the picture and the corresponding video below show. This is in contradiction to the NUPACK results, and is probably due to the fact Kinefold takes RNA-production into account. Thus, the identity site can bind before any part of the terminator it self is produced. It seems like the kinetically slow folding of the terminator can not compete with the signal, which is already bound to the nascent switch strand. If this simulation depicts the real situation, than our trigger site could be even modified and would be much more efficient as expected by only thermodynamically considerations.
Signal consists of the random signaling part (20 nt) and only 2 nt of the part which partially binds to the His-terminator.
In contrast, using a 12 nt trigger site only requires 2 nt identity site in order to prevent termination as one can see in the picture below.
Signal consists of the part which partially binds to the His-terminator (12 nt) and only 2 nt of the random signaling part.
We then combined these two results: Above one always had the full length of either one of the two parts of the signal, as we now wanted to modify both parts and only 2 nt of each part were not sufficient for antitermination, we finally discovered that a signal with overall 8 nt, 4 nt for the random signaling part and 4 nt for the part which partially binds to the His-terminator, 5' UUUCGUGG 3', suffices to enable antitermination as"
UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," we could attach the desired enzymes onto this prefoldin scaffold. Most fusion proteins are connected by non-covalent interactions such as dimerising linkers or streptavidin-biotin12. However, we wanted our system to be highly stable with the enzymes covalently bonded to the scaffold to allow for permanent localisation. This could be achieved with covalent linkers such as inteins or sortases, however these limit molecular topologies, with sortase linkers only occurring between the N and C termini of target proteins.
Research instead led us to an alternative rapid covalent ligation strategy involving a short polypeptide tag (Spy- or Snoop-Tag) and its reactive domain partner (Spy- or Snoop-Catcher)13. This attachment mechanism involves the spontaneous formation of an isopeptide bond between the respective Tag and Catcher components, with Snoop only reacting with Snoop, and Spy only reacting with Spy. This bond has been shown to be robust under a whole range of reaction conditions13, fulfilling the requirement of functional adaptability (FR2) as the enzymes would remain attached to the scaffold irrespective of the metabolic pathway.
Future developments
If we moved to using the six-subunit eukaryotic prefoldin for our scaffold we would need to employ a further range of attachment systems that do not cross react. Although we could resort to using the afore mentioned systems, such as dimerizing linkers or sortase, sticking with similar Tag-Catcher arrangement would add value to the assembly and function of the system. This is feasible through the use of a third covalent ligation strategy, SdyCatcher14. The team will look out for other developments in the Tag-Catcher space.
Enzymes
Having designed the scaffold and conjugation strategy, we then considered how to demonstrate the functionality of our approach. Mathematical modelling indicated that localising enzymes would result in an increase in product titre as required by our function specifications (FR1). Yet, we needed to develop protocols that would allow us to demonstrate this in the lab . We used the KEGG database to search through a variety of pathways15, looking at secondary metabolites and xenobiotic biodegradation to identify a set of enzymes that would produce a useful product. We also reviewed classic exemplars of synthetic pathways that are used in metabolic engineering, such as the production of terpanoids16. However, through the requirement of reducing complexity (FR1.3.1), our current design had two subunit types meaning that a most appropriate reaction pathway would be one that only required"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," against doping.
We realize that inventive and knowledgeable people could potentially mess with our system, as with almost every detection method. Therefore, we asked all stakeholders we interviewed how they would circumvent our method in order to map our weaknesses. Most directed us into RNA injections in the samples. This might indeed complicate our targeted sequencing. However, then they would need to have the specific knowledge of the actual guide RNA’s that are used, they must have access to the blood sample afterwards and this will not circumvent our prescreen. When the prescreen is positive and the sequence verification negative, a second blood sample might be requested, which fits in with the standard practice in doping testing.
4.7 Sensitivity, Privacy Invasion and Minimal Invasivity
With our sequencing method we have been able to detect a single molecule of EPO doping DNA form a 3.45 nM sample. Further protocol optimization will thereby make our analysis even more sensitive. Additionally, with some optimization, our prescreen can detect up to 29 fM of doping DNA ( Baetsen-Young, et al 2018 ), making the complete approach into a very sensitive method.
Furthermore, we made an extensive model of the response of the human body to different administration methods of gene doping. From this model we derived the most likely ways in which athletes would be gene doping and established a detection window based on our sensitivity. From the analysis, we found that we will always be able to detect gene doping. Therefore, the gene doping screening could be uptaken in the regular doping testing programs and will not entail further privacy invasion of athletes.
Lastly, we have been focussing on blood for the extraction of cell free DNA. The professional athletes we spoke to however indicated that urine testing is the predominant form of testing. Therefore, we looked into urine based cell free DNA testing. According to Casadio et al 2017 , cell free DNA concentrations of up to 138 ng/µL can be found in urine samples.  We are therefore confident that in the near future our method can be extended to urine samples with an adapted sample preparation.

Although eGFP and mKeima are both excited using the blue laser, there is considerable separation in their emission spectra allowing easy separation. Furthermore, mRFP and mKeima can be effectively distinguished from each other using different excitation lasers.
Evolution of mKeima
Work under progress ;D
Lab
Ethidium bromide (carcinogenic chemical) is used during gel electrophoresis to visualize the DNA. A designated EtBr work area is allocated in the lab for EtBr works only so that it does not contaminate other lab equipment possibly touched with bare hands. The EtBr liquid waste is incubated with green bag kit before disposal.
Machines like platereader and cell sorters are operated under supervision of trained personnel.
PPE is always worn in the lab without exception.
Environment
Lab waste containing cells are disposed in yellow bags and ultimately incinerated. The purpose is to ensure to antibiotics resistance bacteria from lab escape to wild nature.
We always recycle our pipette tip racks :D

Summer Science Party
When we started our public engagement, we asked what would be the most challenging thing when we need to talk about synthetic biology to the public? Further idea that branches out is that how can we introduce synthetic biology to small kids? Indeed, in as more as we are absolved into scientific studies, we found ourselves hard to express something difficult like scientific terms to people who has very little background about biology. But nothing is impossible!
We had a blast in workshops introducing DNA models and DNA extraction which is arranged during the ""Summer Science Party 2017"" and organized by the Hong Kong Science Park. This activity aims to educate children about biology while acting as a platform to converse with parents regarding to their opinions towards synthetic biology.
With our target audience being children from the age of 4 to 12, we hold the believe that we can ignite the interest for biology to children at an early age through fun games. We therefore uses candies as a material to make into 3D DNA model which they can bring it back home afterwards. Unlike the minipreps that we do in our lab, the DNA extraction workshop also involves easy and accessible household objects such as meat tenderizer and ethanol so children can try out the same experiment with different fruits to compare their DNA amount, imprinting them with first impression and a growing interest for biology at the developmental age.
Throughout the workshops, we were able to receive instant feedbacks from parents regarding to their understanding of synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms. With more than 75 participants in the survey, 58% claimed to have knowledge about GMOs.  Within this group of participants, 63% knows that genes inside the organism is changed, while an equal percent of participants also think that GMOs greatly affects the ecosystem. 54% of the people voiced GMO will negatively affect human health.
However, these responses contradicts to our research findings prior to the events. There is no valid proof that GM food is harmful to human health. Our team realized"

We can also conclude that even after maximum period of induction (overnight induction) of arabinose, we still see some cells uninduced (in Q3).

The experimental condition was the same as the procedure mentioned in the caption of the Figure 1. The left y-axis is for the percent of cells in       Q3 and Q4 while the right y-axis is for RPU.

(C) Graph for        pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 in BW25113.
RPU of PBAD in different cell strains
In order to solve the discrepancy between Groningen 2011 and Cambridge 2011, we have calculated the Relative Promoter Unit of the PBAD promoter in three different cell  strains across increasing arabinose concentration. The three strains that were chosen was: DH10B, BW25113, and DH5α. Groningen 2011 used cell strain DH5α to obtain the 3-D graph  while Cambridge 2011 used BW27783. Unfortunately, we did not had access to the strain, so we had to use another strain, BW25113, which is commonly used by synthetic biologists.  Only DH5alpha has araC in its genome. All other strains have deletion of araC (and other genes in the L-arabinose operon).

Relative Promoter Unit of PBAD promoter was calculated in three strains: DH10B, BW25113 and DH5alpha. Gradient arabinose concentration (% w/v) from 0% to 1.0% with 0.2% increments was used to test the variation of promoter strength (RPU) in different concentration of arabinose.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

This result demonstrates that people in China still hold a superficial and inadequate perception in the cognition of the malignant degree and the death rate of cancer.
The attitude towards cancer treatment and new therapies
● Of the 780 respondents, curative efficacy and side effects were their top priority concern if selecting cancer treatment.
● Under the influence of ""Wei Zexi incident"" (a malpractice due to deceptive advertising of immune therapy), 40.86% of the respondents worried about the curative effect and side effect of immune therapy as a new therapy for cancer, and 31.04% said they are afraid to be cheated and take advantage of by criminals when try a new therapy. 24.75% said they would believe the latest research achievements, while only 3.34% expressed entrust or even rejection of immune therapy.
● With a brief introduction of the background of molecular targeted drugs (e.g. Iressa), 64.87% of respondents were open to molecular targeting drugs and consider it acceptable, while 18.27% respondents were worried about the high expense, which they may be unable to afford. It should be noted that there are still 16.92% of the objects consider the immunotherapy as immature and are unwilling to take any risk.

Interview with doctor
To better understand the current situation of cancer treatment and further shape our project direction, we interviewed a doctor from Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School (also known as ‘Drum-tower Hospital’) for a broad view of therapeutic concern from professional perspective. There are many teams focusing on technical problems on the interaction between targeting drugs and their models, but the acceptance and trust issues from patients are less discussed. In our project, attitudes of patients is correspondingly valued, so we interviewed doctors from Drum-tower Hospital (Its oncology department is the National Key Clinical Specialist) for their opinions on patients’ acceptance and our project. The suggestion would not only be used for the further improvement of our project, but also provide a general concept of the safety issue that must be dealt with when synthetic biology encounters clinical medicine. Their professional experience and advices are valuable if we want to apply synthetic biology to a broader clinical field in the near future.

Table 2. Results of parameter sensitivity analysis on the time at which XS goes extinct. Elasticity (E), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). Parameters of susceptible bacteria and lytic phage    are without subscript, L – lysogenic bacteria, I – lytically infected bacteria, T – temperate phage ( ae9f326 ).
The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table 1 and sorted in descending order of the absolute elasticity values of the XS extinction times. To better represent the relative elasticity values of different   parameters, they are also presented in spider diagrams (Figure 6). These results clearly highlight parameters that have a significant impact on the outputs: the extinction time of XS and r-value. The top 3 parameters   that have the highest influence on the extinction times are μ, μL and bT. Theн all have a negative linear correlation with the output, for example one per cent increase in μ will   result in 0.398 per cent decrease in the extinction time. The relationship is linear since the absolute value of PCC is very close to 1.0.
In terms of the r-value, Ki, μ and b have the highest elasticity values. One per cent increase in Ki will result in 39.75% increase in r-value, meaning the proportion of lytically infected cells   will increase dramatically. The main rationale behind the r-value is to quantify the selective pressure that a lytic phage is exerting onto the bacteria. The higher the r-value, the larger the proportion of susceptible bacteria that   gets infected with the lytic phage and dies due to lysis. Therefore, one has to be careful whenever trying to manipulate the output variable, such as the extinction time of XS, as an undesirable side effect might result in a significant increase in   the selective pressure thereby raising the risk of"

Sucrose Hydrolase (cscA)
Background
Sucrose hydrolase is an enzyme from Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain Sakai which is involved in sucrose utilisation (Jahreis, et al., 2002) .  Transforming Escherichia coli K12 strains with sucrose hydrolase allows the cells to grow with sucrose as a sole carbon source, something the untransformed K12 strain cannot do. This allows this gene to be used as a selectable marker.
Cloning
cscA cloning
The cscA gene was cloned PCR with cscA specific primers. Figure 1.

Select another promoter with weaker tendency to switch on. Currently, the T7 promoter we use has a quite high tendency. Therefore, the positive feedback will be switched on even very few ribosome going through the terminators.
Progress of ethanol producing
So far, except promoter, we have pieced up most enzymes for producing ethanol. We planed to construct circuit below.
We used HPLC to detect the alcohol with our equipment. Besides, we compared the reference which conducted by Jinchuan Yang before. [5] Here is Jinchuan Yang's way, result and relative parameter he used in detail.
The protocol is set up by Waters corporation
7.8X150mm  IC-Pak, iron exclusion column (WAT010295)
Mobile phase: 100% 0.1mM sulfuric acid
Flow rate: 1.0mL/ min
Comparing to the reference, we conducted the same experiment with different sample and equipment. There is our parameter and result below.
Preparative column,Delta-Pak C18 guard cartridge and column（25 mm i.d. × 10 mm length and 25 mm × 100 mm, respectively
Mobile phase: 100% 0.1mM sulfuric acid
Flow rate: 2.0mL/ min
A solvent peak at 4.24 min is noticed. We concluded that the alcohol did not maintained by our column. In the future, some points we should improve are as below.

Establish LB medium standard
Detect EtOH containing medium (culture medium with Bee. coli)
Progress of Cry toxin testing
We designed primer to clone the Cry toxin gene from Bacillus Thuringiensis Israelensis, and the vector with constitutive promoter, reporter, ribosome binding site, and terminators from E. coli. We have ligated both part with blind cutting sites.(Because of reporter on the vector, we could know whether they were legated reversely or not after checked with colony PCR which uses vector_FP and Cry_RP.) However, we faced some trouble in culturing the colony. DH5a or MG1655 is the target where we sent our engineered plasmid DNA. Both of them are gram-negative bacteria ,most of which cannot form endospores. As far as we know, when Bacillus Thuringiensis Israelensis produces Cry toxin, it will transform into endospore. And"

This region was excluded for further analysis involving the read coverage depth. As foundation for further analysis TSV files containing the information about the mapping at each position of the reference were exported from CLC Genomics Workbench. TSV files are TAB-delimited text files containing the number of supporting reads for each base at each position (Figure 4).
Figure 4: Structure of generated TSV files.
Determination of mutation rate through NGS sequencing results
We used plasmid combinations according to our reversion experiments as reference for the mapping. These experiments consist of one plasmid carrying the mutagenesis genes (either EP-PolI one of the genome wide mutator systems ) and one reporter plasmid with a stop beta-lactamase. Therefore, both plasmids were present in our sequencing library. As a control for measuring sequencing errors our reporter plasmid was sequenced in parallel in a separate library.
Error prone polymerase I
The plasmids for the sequencing libraries were made by transforming 10 ng of the stop beta-lactamase plasmid pLA230 in JS200 cells, carrying the error prone polymerase I. Afterwards, the cells were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in prewarmed LB-broth media supplemented with chloramphenicol and kanamycin. Finally, the cells were plated for the reversion assays or the plasmids were isolated for sequencing. Alongside the experiment was performed using wild type polymerase I instead of the error-prone polymerase I.

In protein expression and interaction section, we hope to mutate wildtype VEGF-scFv according to modification provided by dry lab and monitor its binding process with VEGF through a thermodynamic method known as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) developed by Adrian Velazquez-Campoy and Ernesto Freire in 2006 [8].

3. ITC
The titration curve shown in Figure 11 is isothermal titration of VEGF and wild-type VEGF-scFv, of which concentrations are 90uM, 15uM respectively. However, there is no significant exotherm in the titration curve, since fluctuations may be related to the influx of the solution and the background noise of the instrument.
Figure 11. Isothermal titration of VEGF and VEGF-scFv
Figure 12. Isothermal titration of VEGF and VEGF-scFv’
The titration curve shown in Figure 12 is isothermal titration of VEGF and mutation VEGF-scFv (named VEGF-scFv’), of which concentrations are 90uM, 15uM respectively. It can be seen that there is a significant exothermic phenomenon when the first two drops of VEGF are instilled, indicating that VEGF is completely bound to VEGF-scFv', which is superior to wild type. However, subsequent data has no obvious meaning.
Because the ITC experiment requires a higher protein concentration and buffer composition. The preliminary analyses lead to unsatisfactory results are as follows. "

Temperature changes
In Chihuahua, located in the North of Mexico the land is very arid due to it very elevated temperatures, so it remains a deserted place.They have more problems dealing with high temperatures than cold temperatures. They can reach temperatures over 40 ºC in summer and -7ºC in winter.
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Spray some sulfur in powder before cold temperatures arrive.
Diffuse some atomise algae, the product name is “DIATOMIX”, these algae will absorb the soil humidity and avoid water accumulation in the soil.
They irrigate from February to July to avoid frosts and dehydrations, the problem is that they lack sometimes from water and each year they have to do bigger holes to extract water from the subsoil. They have installed an irrigation system placed 60 cm from the soil that will irrigate water only in the trunk of the wine an the soil.
They are some winemakers that produce wine over 2400 m of altitudes of the sea, in that case they use big turbines that generate heat air to avoid frost in winter.

We felt it was important to do this when introducing the main bulk of the ethical discussion our SMITe project centres around.
Previously students had been presented with scenarios to think about and respond to, however, as reflected in the case of increasing rates of antibiotic resistance globally, we cannot simply wait for the situation to be presented to us... we all need to think ahead and take responsibility for the impact of our actions and lifestyles on the world.

Student Feedback
In a reversal of the usual situation of trying to seek feedback on teaching courses, we found that the students volunteered comments and thoughts about our programme. Most often these were sent alongside submitting their work.
Below are a few examples of the comments we received in this way, which we found to be a great testament to the interest which can be generated by introducing something a little different to the standard school curriculum.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"
