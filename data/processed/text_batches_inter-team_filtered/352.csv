As for the lecture on the third day, we told them more about what exactly Molecular biology is, and we invited a senior who had engaged in iGEM last year shared his experience and what he learned in iGEM. 
This activity gives middle school students a basic idea of Molecular biology. Moreover, it helps increase iGEM’s popularity as well. It is really killing two birds with one stone.

Elementary School Promotion
After S&T Month, we decided to extend our educate range to elementary school students. To let more people know the spirit of iGEM, we went to an elementary school, Chiao-Jen, to teach students there some basic concept of synthetic biology and introduce iGEM to them.
   We prepared a game for them and a bag of candy as reward, making it easier to understand what we want to express. Every team had one million dollars to invest in the genetically modified product. In the meanwhile, we mixed some fundamental idea of the synthetic biology into the game. Then, we explained the relationship between DNA and gene briefly. To our surprise, there was even a little boy asking us our opinion on GMO foods! 
In this activity, we find It is the passionate interaction students react to you that what the most enjoyable moment of teaching is.  It was their passionate participation that made this activity succeed.

Drink Sampling
Content Opinion
In order to know whether sweet foods are more favored by the public, we held an event in school, called “Drink sampling”. 
We made the statistic this way: We offered both sugar-free and sugary beverages. There were buckets placed beside each beverage pail. First, the participants were given two cups of drinks from each pail. They were asked to decide which one they like, and toss both of their cups into the correspondent bucket. At last, we sum up the cups in each bucket to find out the result.
     There are also games to attract more people. It’s a shame that we weren’t able to elaborate the process of our project to every participant due to the chaos, but, it is sure that we’ve"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," public and the scientific community feel and think about life-related questions and the reductionism approach in biology? These are difficult questions. But now that we are directing evolution and trying to artificially create life, we have come to a point at which we need to discuss these issues. We will never get a clear answer on philosophical questions such as, ""what is life?"", even the scientific community is much too homogeneous for that. Still, a discussion to raise awareness and make us think about these questions could help in the debate on whether researchers should pursue the controversial goals that are present in synthetic biology. Furthermore, communication to the general public should be much easier if an overview of the different believes and opinions within the scientific community are available.
A qualitative and quantitative analysis on the opinions of researchers on reductionism in synthetic biology could be achieved by approaching many people in this particular field of science (mostly iGEM supervisors and participants). To pursue the quantitative analysis, I have invited many iGEM teams to complete a short questionnaire.
The survey on reductionism in synthetic biology is now closed. We are grateful to all the people who took the time to participate in the survey. Thanks to them we now have a total of 242 responses of iGEM students, supervisors and advisors.
Conclusions , the headlines:
Participants believe that the value of life cannot be changed by synthetic biology
Craig Venter's research is presumed not to involve creating new life forms, but rather applying genetic engineering
Safety and security issues are acknowledged and additional regulation should minimize their risks
Synthetic biologists are generally careful, but the public wants more
There is no relation between the existence of a God and sacred or holy properties of life
Communication with the general public is difficult but perceived necessary
Life can possibly never be explained by mankind
The reductionist approach towards understanding life is limiting

I didn’t assign any task to our team members, we could do anything we want.
8.06.2012-8.11.2012
It was the longest week I’ve ever felt. We waited our primer day after day but it didn’t come until August 12th. The package was delayed by the typhoon went through Shanghai(where the company we made the purchase from located)and a mistake the carrier made about the address.
During this week, we made a change to the sequence and handed another list to the company. We also read some articles on how to build a model.

PCR amplification of LuxPQ BBk
Purpose:
To verify that the LuxPQ BBk samples actually consist of LuxPQ BBk
Materials and methods:
The procedure is similar to that from May 20. Platinum Taq polymerase was used instead of Taq polymerase, as a higher degree of fidelity was desired in light of poor results last week (for other people). Platinum Taq has an antibody that prevents the polymerase from acting until the initiation temperature reaches 94 degrees C. This makes the system more stringent and prevents polymerase activity at lower temperatures, such as the 56 degree C environment that is critical for annealing.
TOPO clones of LuxPQ are used as a positive control. Since the gene of interest (LuxPQ) is purportedly present in these (according to sequencing results from last year), you would expect to see a band at 3855 bp. If the BBk bands are also this size, it encourages our presumption that they are indeed LuxPQ BBk and not some other gene that can’t be amplified by primers specific to LuxPQ. ddHOH is our negative control.
Note: the BBk and TOPO LuxPQ are very concentrated. More dilute samples of each were made (100 ng/uL) so that an appropriate volume with lower error could be pitetted into the PCR tubes.
49 uL of master mix was pipetted into each tube, followed by the BBk samples, the TOPO samples and the negative control, according to the following key:
Tubes 1 and 2: LuxPQ c1 BBk
Tubes 3 and 4: LuxPQ c2 BBk
Tubes 5 and 6: Negative control (ddHOH)
Tubes 7 and 8: Positive control (TOPO plasmid)
Template: LuxPQ BBk
Forward primer: LuxPQ BBk forward primer (Tm = 60 degrees C)
Reverse primer: LuxPQ BBk reverse primer (Tm = 60 degrees C)

Therefore, we conducted experiments for determining the the steady-state expression levels for different galactose concentrations. Unfortunately, we could neither use the observations to fit the parameters of the pGAL promoter nor could we--due to technical limitations--build a fully functional chassis. (see figures below)
However, an experiment yielded steady-state solutions for pSUC, a promoter which is repressed by glucose. We were able to compute a semi-reasonable fitting of a hill function (\(R^2=0.61\)); we suggest that this could be seen as a proof of concept for the suggested equation of the sensor platform.

Concerning the modeling of Dronpa’s On/Off-transition: We were only able to utilise a laser-scanning microscope to turn Dronpa off and back on again. We utilised Fiji to fit circles around cells and to quantify the background and foreground signal level (similar to the pre-processing of a spotted micro-array). After performing intra-measurement normalisation with global scaling (z-transformation), no pattern was visible in the background corrected signal (by subtraction) over time. Therefore, we were unable to verify the assumption of 0-th kinetics for the photochemical reactions.

The strategy  for the function of engineered CEN.PK2-1C  stains lacks △ far1+△sst2, △sst and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 were divided into the following parts;
(1). Testing the inhibitive effects on the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C, whose cellular period can be stopped at the G1 stage by  α factor.
(2). Expression and identification of Pfus+RFP+cyc1t+PRS42K in engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2.
Antibacterial circle
The plan and method
The growth of CEN.PK2-1C is inhibited by α factor,We want to  test the function of △sst2, △far1+△sst2 and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 by comparing with CEN.PK2-1C .
(1)The influence of the growth of bacteria caused by different amount of α factor in the solid plate.
(2)The observed difference among the function of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains, △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2  acted on the growth of Cen.PK2-1C, △sst2, △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2 impaired  by different amount of α factor.
The results and discussion
(1)The bacteria strain of CEN.PK2-1C stops growing in G1 due to the effects acted by the α factor and antibacterial circle appears in the panel.
(2)△sst2 strain (sst2 is knocked out successfully) and the sensitivity of △sst2 strain to α factor will be increased. Meanwhile the larger antibacterial circle will appear when the amount of α factor is reduced"

    After in-depth communication with BIT-China, we decided to help them solve some modeling problems.We helped them establish the ODE equation in the hydrogen peroxide decomposition model and provided them with guiding recommendations and feasibility verification strategies.Details can be found on their Models page.
    Cooperation on the Experiment
    Documented in the literature, Phenyllactic acid（PLA） is a new type of natural antibacterial substance and preservative, which can inhibit a series of Gram-negative, positive bacteria and fungi. However, we cannot personally determine the inhibitory effect of PLA on various bacteria because of the limited strain of our laboratory. BIT-China determined the inhibitory effect of PLA on yeast Cen.PK2-1C . We performed statistical analysis on their experimental data. In this way, we knew more about the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance of PLA. Details can be found on our Result page.
    Cooperation on the Improve
    Our team decided to make an improvement on Part:BBa_K2120006, but we did not find this part in the official accessories. The BIT-China team provided us with the E.coli strain containing BBa_K2120006, which provided raw materials for our improvement. Details can be found on our Improve page.
    Cooperation on the Handbook
    We designed a handbook that contains an introduction of iGEM and tips for preventing bacterial infections in daily life. We presented useful information in a more concise and clearer way, focused on the prevention of harmful bacterial and how to maintain environmental sanitation. (Details can be found on our HP page).

A suitable clorobiocin amount was found by performing a clorobiocin dilution series on different E.coli strains (XL1-blue and a TolC-knockout strain, following named TolC) by us and on Corynebacterium glutamicum by iGEM team Franconia. As expected, the XL1-blue strain is almost resistant while TolC is more susceptible to clorobiocin. C. glutamicum as a gram-positive bacterium showed by far the most significant zones of inhibition compared to the E.coli strains. The SHV-1 construct provides resistance to carbenicillin in a dose-dependent manner in XL1-blue, while the construct does not seem to work as good in TolC.
Figure 9: Different L-rhamnose concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8%(w/v)) were used to induce SHV-1 expression. 1000 µg carbenicillin were used. pSB1C3-SHV-1 is used as a control because it does not express the protein.
The GyrBR_EC construct shows a reduced zone of inhibition in TolC. The small zone of inhibition in XL1-blue makes it hard to determine a difference after induction.

Part 1 : Team Visit to a Copper Smeltery
Industry sewage, a complex of heavy metal ions, contaminants of organics, will  become
decomposed and source of diseases if left untreated. With the advancement of industrialization
in China, the sewage discharge also witnesses a rising trend, from 42.84 billion tons in 2001 to
67.96 billion tons in 2014, with an annual increase of approximately  1.89 billion tons on average.
Sewage treatment, aims for producing a disposable effluent without causing  harm to the surrounding
environment and preventing from pollution, has become a matter of concern for both  the government and the public.
In order to get a more comprehensive understanding of the process and technology of sewage treatment, on July 28th, 2014, iGEM HUST-China team visited Daye nonferrous metal corporation, a copper smeltery 80 kilometers away from our Huazhong Univerisity of Science & techonology (HUST). This copper production factory is one of the top 5 copper production enterprises in China.
HUST-China Team members Jinjing Wang, Ziang Zhang, Lei Yin and Ruihao Li, together with instructor Dr.Zhan entered this copper smeltery with permission.
Our team briefly introduced iGEM competition and our project to the factory. And Mrs. Yi, a technical expert of this factory, explained to us the facility distribution in this smeltery and then brought us to visit the whole factory.
Blister Copper, which is extracted from copper mine in smelting furnace, contains 98.5% copper. It is the raw material of electrolytic copper production. While the final electrolytic copper product contains 99.99% copper in it.
The electrolytic copper production is processed in the huge copper electrolytic tank fulfilled with copper electrolytic solution. Copper enriches onto the negative plate from positive plate and forms the electrolytic copper final product. The electrolytic solution contains sulphuric acid and copper sulfate. We took some samples of electrolytic solution from the electrolytic tank.
The waste water from the smeltery is finely treated in a water purification station. We also visited this station after visiting the core production zone. There are 2 steps"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Log_-_-_TEXT.html," of a killswitch in the pathogen responsible for Rice Blast disease and realised that we would need to spray an entire rice field for it to be effective. To overcome this issue we came up with the idea of using a genetic clock to construct a “time bomb kill switch” in which the killswitch was triggered by the build up of a specific protein.
We are very excited about the idea of creating a board game targeted at secondary school children. Some potential concepts included a set cards that have basic questions, a build-a-cell game where the first to obtain all necessary parts wins or a combination of the two.

Today was mostly focused on writing up a Penicillium antifungal protein (PAF) proposal for the Synenergene grant and expanding an idea of creating a CRISPR/Cas9 killswitch.       Unfortunately there much more we can do at the moment beyond fleshing out ideas and emailing academics.

It was a very exciting day as today we recorded our very first blog entry! Vlogs are a great way for both the public and any absent iGEM members to keep up with our project and see what progress we have made in bite sized chunks. At the moment we have decided to publish them on YouTube two weeks after filming to allow time for any editing.
We opened dialogue with teams based in Newcastle and Costa Rica today and have scheduled a Skype meeting with Leiden for tomorrow.
A few of the team members met with Professor Rob Beardmore to discuss our current ideas. He gave us some great feedback on potential flaws which we are now working on fixing.

To start off the day today we had a Skype call with the Leiden iGEM team where we discussed potential ideas and what we’re currently looking at doing for human practises.
There was a suggestion to combine the PAF and the killswitch idea to create a system with a reliable and well characterised killswitch that could be used outside the laboratory in the environment.

We met with Dr Paul James to discuss the project and the human practises ideas.
Some members of the team met with Professor Peter Winlove who raised the following questions in regards for our PAF idea:
How much protein do you need to kill rice blast?
Could we model how much protein is required to kill rice blast?
Could we have a timer system as a killswitch?

Figure 1: The original 9 part assembly versus an improved 5 part assembly. Top: schematic showing the required parts that we had originally planned to use for making our fully assembled plasmid. Bottom: The revised assembly plan, which makes use of a 1-5 Bridge. The 1-5 Bridge reduces the number of parts in a BsaI GGA reaction by combining many of the non-variant part types into a single part prior to the BsaI assembly reaction.
Our solution was to create a standardized bridging sequence that contained part types 1 through 5 to make the number of overall BsaI containing parts in the final reaction smaller. Instead of designing primers that contain both BsaI and BsmBI sites on both ends, the 1-5 bridge only contains a BsaI sequence on the Type 1 Forward primer and on the Type 5 reverse primer. All other parts in the bridge contain only BsmBI sites. Therefore, when the parts are combined in a BsmBI Golden Gate reaction, a single part that can be used in BsaI assembly is formed.
Better Reporter Genes
Many of our chromoproteins, such as Red chromoprotein and E2-Crimson, express weakly or take days to portray the desired phenotype. To make them more useful reporters, we coupled the sequence to a strong, constitutive promoter. This created brighter colors that expressed faster
When attempting to make assemblies, our experiments were often delayed when we attempted to use certain fluorescent proteins or chromoproteins because they either did not express, expressed weakly, or took many days to become visible.
To solve this problem, we extracted a strong promoter, CP25, and a red chromoprotein from pSL1, with primers that added BsmBI and BsaI restriction sites. We then inserted that sequence into pYTK001 to make a part plasmid. Currently, we are attempting to make assemblies with this part.
Figure 2: Red chromoprotein coupled to a strong promoter inserted into an entry vector and expressed in E. coli.
Integration of Feedback from Synthetic Biology Experts
Dr. Brian Renda of Gingko Bioworks emphasized that our kit would be limited by the ability of the plasmids to be inserted into the bacteria of interest as many can not be transformed with standard protocols. Therefore, we transformed the assembly plasmids into a strain of E. coli that can act as a plasmid donor in conjugations.

Our final brochure.
From Hyukjin Ko, 9th of September
The papers Keena presented were completely irrelevant.
We need to use microbes that detect heavy metals using a specific system.
These papers seem to explain human related genes and their relationship with heavy metals.
To make it short, I need more information on Pb and Lead.
Ars, the information Young sent me was quite useful.
I know school started, but why do I always see the same people trying really hard while others do nothing?
Professor and other students are not working on the project because they got plenty of time left.
It's your iGEM. Work on it.
I want to order the primers till this weekend so we can start our experiments on Monday.
See you all.
From Keena Jeon, 8th of September
I am not sure if these are useful, but I think it contains some information.
Give me feedback.

2. How will you use AMD as a reporter?
3. Any simulations?
From Cheolwon Choi, 7th of September
The meeting held on Friday was great.
Almost all members attended the meeting: Hansung, Hyukjin, Jihee, Jihae, Young, Simin, Cheolwoo, Yeonjin, and me.
Sadly, Yeonjin, Keena and Yoonjoo is quitting iGEM project due to personal reasons.
Young, Jihee, Jihae, Hansung, and I am going to attend the Jamboree.
We decided to separate the members for our experiment.
The problem at hand is what parts we are going to use.
We will be also looking for sponsors next week.
Have a great week all !
From Hyukjin Ko, 7th of September

Your browser does not support the video tag.
But unfortunately … it seemed to be damaged so we couldn´t carry out the necessary transformations for bronze medal. However, our friends from iGEM Tec-Chihuahua collaborated with us and sent us the transformations. Take a look at our collaborations for more detail
Our constructs we constantly revised and corrected for optimization. When we were finally able to send them, logistics between the company that was going to synthesize them and the mexican provider were too slow … Then a huge earthquake hit Mexico city and all the process slowed down even more. Our construct did not arrive on time to be sent to iGEM HQ.
All of the above without taking into account other logistic problems at our University labs and other within team…
But no matter what, we learned A LOT!!
Re-planning and planning for emergency as well as integrating as a team helped us distribute responsibilities and engage people in the job.
Choosing the most viable and easy to replicate solutions usually prevailed.
Listening to instructors, advisors, and experts in the subject is key to correct mistakes or prevent some failures due to inexperience.
Communication within team members must always be encouraged.
The design of the project and actions taken must always follow clear objectives.
Asking for help and establishing new relationships to learn is always a good idea.
Try to assure at the best extent the compromise of the team regarding the project.
When we started the project, most of us hadn't even taken a Genetic Engineering course. Today, we have not only learned a lot about this subject but have also received valuable lessons regarding problem solving, teamwork and have even become more creative!
One of our team members, Santiago Ochoa, wrote a poem about our iGEM kit arrival experience (which was stuck for a month or so in Customs):
Overdue arrival
We gather round the phone to hear
Such happy news, you’re on your way
Our hearts aflutt’r but not from fear
How excited we were in May
The sights you’ll see, long way to travel
No time for that, that journey’s yours
We must prepare, lest plans unravel
All members up to here with chores
Then time passed at its usual rate
Small comfort as eyes bore a hole
Into our calendars due date
Snail’s pace of mail taking its toll
One day you arrived with a start
Bunch’d together we gape, in thrall
Carefully tearing you apart
Our little Christmas in the fall"

Education
Kindergarten - Observing the “invisible”
Our iGEM team also hosted over 120 kindergarten students to teach them the power of observation and the basics of science. For example, we taught them how to use microscopes to look at anti-counterfiting measures on paper money and how to use refraction lenses to see that white light is made up of various colours. (Whole Team activity)
7th Grade Introduction to Synthetic Biology
We introduced iGEM and the basics of synthetic biology, to all 200+ students in seventh grade. They learned how to use micropipettes, as well as how to load and run dyes through an agarose gel. We also gave students different real world problems. Using paper biobrick parts, students put together constructs that would solve the given problems. (Whole Team activity)

Research Symposium - Poster and Oral Presentations
At our school’s annual spring fair, we manned a booth where people could create their own glitter slime by mixing polyvinyl alcohol and sodium borate solutions. The slime was meant to simulate the biofilm we creating to trap nanoparticles (in this demo, glitter) in wastewater treatment plants. We also asked people to take our survey in order to record opinions on bioethics and concerns about nanoparticles. We also showed a few SEM images of everyday products that contain nanoparticles such as: instant noodles, toothpaste, makeup, and bacteria. (Whole team activity)

WLC-Milwaukee,2016,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," was largely worked on by Harrison and Melissa (the first trial had proven unsuccessful because of low DNA concentration).
April 17th – April 23rd
Jack contacted the various speakers for the camp and finalized the times that they would lecture.
In the lab a gel electrophoresis protocol was performed by Harrison which determined that the second enzyme digest with the four tolC genes was unsuccessful. A new plasmid isolation was performed with the above tolC genes by Ching Tzu and Theresa Boyadjian with just the tolC genes for K. pneumonia and E. coli.
April 24th – April 30th
Jordyn sent out camp flyers to WELS science teachers to hand out to their students. Camp flyers were also sent out to WELS churches to hang on their bulletin boards. Jack sent out camp flyers to home school teachers associated with WELS churches.
Lab consisted of an enzyme digest using the products of the plasmid isolation from the previous week which was conducted by Harrison and Ching Tzu. Gel electrophoresis by Harrison confirmed that the E. coli tolC gene was successfully removed from the plasmid. Meanwhile, Elise verified that many of the tolC genes were moved successfully into pTrc99A.
May 2016
May 1st – May 7th
Another meeting was held with the all the team members. Specific goals were set and responsibilities were handed out. A survey was written up to be sent out to WELS home school teachers to formulate an educational plan. Article topics for background information were decided on and Elise, Melissa, Anna, and Nathan volunteered to get those completed.
The E. coli tolC gene from the previous week was extracted from the gel and a ligation to the pSB1C3 vector was attempted but was unsuccessful. pSB1C3 plasmids containing the tolC genes of Proteus Mirabilis were enzyme digested in order to obtain more iGEM shipping plasmid. After this, Harrison ran a gel of the restriction digests and a gel extraction. Ligation of the E. coli tolC to pSB1C3 followed.
May 8th – May 14th
Our project was solidified and plans began to form. Committees were organized to help make things run more smoothly. The new part that was ordered arrived this week: the tolC gene for Serratia marcescens on pUC57 with the pBAD promoter. After the part arrived it was transformed into DH5α E. coli competent cells via electroporation. Elise started working on"

Answer: about 300 000  tons
→ What kind of problems are caused by plastic waste in the oceans  ?
For this question, people have agreed to say that the main problems due to plastic pollutants in the ocean are:
- The ingestion of plastic by wildlife causing the long-term poisoning of fishes, or other marine life. Consequently, this pollution impacts public health through sea food consumption.
- The disbalance of the ecological dynamics leading to invasive species development. Following plastic production, water rejections are rich in phosphate and nitrogen compounds, which lead to water eutrophization.
- Moreover, those environmental impacts are traduced in direct impacts for our economy
→ How can we fight against plastic waste in ocean ? ?
For the majority of interviewees, the best option is to educate  the population:
- Inform the population on the risks incurred.
- Improve waste collection and recycling.
The idea of applying financial penalty was also mentioned. For waste already present in the ocean, our colleagues thought about the collection of plastic macroparticles. The idea of PlastiCure for microparticles was mentioned.
→ How about ethics: What do you think about our project ?
According to them, to add a value to plastic waste appears to be a very good idea to battle ocean pollution because we will also produce a useful product. Some of them noticed that setting up our project could lead to a high energy consumption in order to build containment structures for our GMOs.
→ What are the advantages and disadvantages of our project?
Avantages:
- added a value to plastic waste
- protection of the environment
- possibility to manufacture other product than erythromycin A by using the same method.
- With bacteria, we can use a very complicated pathways to produce product that couldn't be made by chemical method.
Disadvantages:
- need a long time to set up the project
- high cost of the project
- sensibility of biological system: Will the bacteria survive the conditions of plastic waste treatment?
- difficulty to recover erythromycin A and risk of environmental contamination with antibiotics.
→ The fight against the plastic in the oceans is a large-scale work.
Do you think that synthetic biology can help us overcome this problem?
Yes: Microorganisms has many advantages. They grow as long as they have essential nutrients and allow us to use several biological pathways to synthesize a compound. Synthetic biology is one of the tools of the future that will help us improve our way of life.
No: Oceans cover 70% of the planet, and synthetic biology is"

Cloning hydrogenase genes into iGEM BioBricks
Aim
Cloning the FeFe and NiFe hydrogenase genes individually into pSB1C3, which can then be cloned into pBAD vector using Golden Gate Cloning (GGC).
Method
Basic cloning techniques were followed see respective protocols: PCR amplification, restriction digests and ligation into the BioBrick vectors i.e. pSB1C3. After successful ligations colonies were mini prepped and sent off for sequencing to confirm the sequence.  Individual genes (see table 1) were ligated into pSB1C3, BBa_J04450. Consequently, the genes were ligated together into our expression vector: pBAD via Golden Gate cloning.
Results
Table 1: Gene fragments used as inserts into pSB1C3 using BBa_J04450 as the source for the vector. Gene fragments were ordered from idtDNA. The sequences of the gene fragments were obtained from GenBank. pSB1C3 BBa_J04450 was provided by the iGEM distribution kit.

     She also attended our CCiC and gave a speech in the opening ceremony, approving our work and encouraging undergrads to proceed scientific researches.
Supports from host lab
    Such a wonderful and cherishing experience with the lab!
Our host lab this year is the lab of Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory of the School of Life Sciences. We received mass support from staffs and lab members throughout our project process, which includes:
Commonly used reagents such as PBS, ethanol, and materials like centrifuge tubes, and experimental instruments like incubators and centrifuges are all provided by our host lab.
Lab manager Ms. Zhong and lab assistant Ms. Sun helped us with all the reagent booking, by sending our booking lists to specific reagent agencies.
Lab members lent us cell lines of Hela, A549, MCF-7, 293T, parts of mCherry and CYAN, and all the vectors we needed for experiments. They also generously gave us advice on many experimental details.
Supports from other teams
    iGEM is a big family!
Exchange ideas with SZU, FAFU and XMU
     After Synbiobeta Activate-Shenzhen, team SZU founded a meet up to exchange ideas. During the meet up, we help SZU to debug the construction of their circuits and the project design.
Exchange parts with SYSU-Software and FAFU-China
     We shared iGEM interlab kits and iGEM plate kits with SYSU-Software. During our experiments, we found out that one of our Interlab plasmids (Device I) could not be transformed well in bacterial culture medium. So we borrowed some plasmids from SYSU-Software. Furthermore, SYSU-Software had used up one of their plate kits (B0015 terminator) and we gave them ours.
     We received several parts (CFP, YFP) from team FAFU-China when the shipment of Biobrick to China is still confusing. Sincerely thanks to FAFU-China!
Attending CCiC
     28 teams and more than 200 students came to attend our CCiC. Everyone enjoyed the time and harvest a lot. Thank all the iGEMers for their participation!

Conclusion:
The transformation of PAtpI in pSB1C3 to E. coli Top10 was    successful.
Validation
Experiment:
09/10/16: Grown cultures of E. coli Top10 with the construct were used to    make glycerol stocks and    plasmid isolation was performed (see Fast-n-Easy Plasmid Mini-prep kit ).    Firstly, concentration of the plasmids obtained was measured on    Nanodrop. Secondly, plasmids were sent for sequencing and then stored    at -20°C.
Sequencing:
The plasmid PAtpI in pSB1C3 from colonies 1 and 2 was sent for    sequencing with the primers VF2 and VR, see primer list .

Ciprofloxacin resistance cassette in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1930004 )
To design a qnrS1 resistance cassette BioBrick we designed a gBlock that contains the Bacillus subtilis constitutive promoter PAtpI, which is active from a very early stage of germination and includes a ribosome binding site. The gBlock also contains the original qnrS1 gene sequence from E. coli, the double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) from iGEM as well as the prefix and suffix for BioBricks. In summary the ciprofloxacin cassette consists of the following parts PAtpI+RBS+qnrS1+2TER, see plasmid map below.

The efficiency of PiggyBac transposon system ranged from 2% for one transposon to 0.5% for five transposons [1] . Consequently, it’s quite possible for us to screen out the cells with single or low copies of Neomycin-loxp.
In practical experiments, we totally test 18 different single colony genomes. The lowest copy number of those selected CHO-K1 cell transfected with Neomycin-loxp is around 4, which was not good enough. The reason may be that the designed primer was not so satisfying. Also, the contamination during real-time PCR was hard to avoid. To get cells with single copy of Neomycin-loxp, we still need to design better primers as well as paying attention to the experiment operations.
3. Transfect the cells with mutated TRPC5 by Cre-loxp system
After we’ve selected the CHO-K1 cell transfected with single copy of NeoLoxp, we could transfect mutated TRPC5 into the cell’s genomic DNA using Cre-Loxp recombination system. Then we would use fluorescence activated cell sorting(FACS) to select the cells with high intensity of GFP after long term stimulation. To realize high-throughput screening, we designed a device as"

DESIGN STATEMENT
To design and express a significantly more thermostable Griffithsin dimer and monomer for future implementation in a diagnostic assay.
MODELING of GRIFFITHSIN
Our design began with taking the originally published sequence of griffithsin and modeling thermostable changes in the sequence. Click here for more information on our modeling.
Developing the monomer form of Grffithsin is important because it can create tandemers that are higher binding to HIV, which is important for lateral flow assay design.
DESIGNING A HIGH-EXPRESSING CONSTRUCTS
After creating an optimal amino acids sequence from the Yasara modeling, we codon optimized  the sequence in E. coli via IDT . To express this protein maximum level, we placed the gene within a T7 promoter system—an adapted viral promoter that maximizes expression.  This gBlock was subsequently cloned into our the LC-pSmart Kan vector, using Gibson Assembly.
IPTG INDUCED EXPRESSION
To mimic industrial expression protocols, we created a protocol to first maximize the biomass of the Griffithsin-expressing cells. Then the  IPTG was added to turn on the promoter and hijack the cell’s metabolism to producing GRFT. The GRFT was then removed from the cells.
To express griffithsin (GRFT) at maximum levels, dynamic metabolic control was exercised using IPTG induction as the metabolic valve.
Biomass is grown in of SM10++(max 10g/L) media for 18 hours
IPTG rich SM0++ media is then added to the culture which induces:
The vast majority of its metabolism shifts to protein creation as the strong promoter is turned on.
Cell growth will dramatically decrease
Homgenization
Since Griffithsin is an intracellular protein, homogenization was chosen as the method taken to lyse the cells"

iGEM UK meet-up!
Our team attracted a lot of questions including:
 
-Safety: Look for compounds excreted by bedbugs to engineer a promotor which would switch the chitanase gene on and off.
-Construct a delivery mechanism to transfer the E.coli to the bed bug.
- Discovered that Bt toxin is harmful to humans- no longer a potential solution.
 
Research further toxin alternatives.

Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Week 29: Giant Jamboree registration of 3 team members. Further advertisement of our SynBio Workshop. Synenergene text modifications. Meeting to create a text-delivery schedule for the wiki. InterLab: antibiotics problem solved, new bacteria produced. We can now carry on with the experiments. Modelling meeting to discuss some project approaches.
Week 30: Synenergene restructuralization of the project according to Kjetil Rommetveit’s suggestions, focusing more on the social implications of our LeishMANIA project. Meeting to define wiki’s design. Presentation of of the modelling’s progress done so far, discussion to refine the parameters. IDT genes arrived, so we planned the project’s experiments.
August:
Week 31: Collaboration with Aix-Marseille team by answering their survey. UFMG’s techno-administration employees are on strike, therefore the semester’s registration is suspended, as well as every class, postponing the Idea Incubator’s return. SynBio workshop happened this week, and it was a total success! Professor and instructor Liza Felicori was interviewed by the newspaper “O Tempo” , and the article got the front page! Bacterial expansion of the plasmid containing IFN-ß and further clone miniprep.
Week 32: Kelly Drinkwater asked us to better explain some safety aspects of our project and update the “About Our Project” text on iGEM’s website. The synthesized primers arrived, so we could continue the experiments. Amplification of the IFN-ß biobrick by PCR, followed by its digestion and binding to pGEM and pSB1C3 plasmids. InterLab: successful cloning of the P1-22A; P1-22K; P1-20K and P4-21J promoters. That was necessary due to the low amount of biobricks sample. Replacing the modelling with real data, adding clearance, phagocytosis and half-life of macrophages and Leishmania. Starting to come up with the Giant Jamboree’s presentation. Wiki design and content meeting. Synenergene meeting to improve project’s aspects and survey.

Presentation
Professor MAMZER-BRUNEEL, MD.PhD. , is currently a doctor at Necker Hospital in the kidney transplantation department. Furthemore, she is president of the ""Advisory Council for the Protection of People Subject to Biomedical Research"" and member of the ""Laboratory of Ethics of Paris Decartes University"".
Take home message
We are interviewing her as a member of the laboratory of ethics of Paris Descartes as the ""Advisory Council for the Protection of People Subject to Biomedical Research"" does not deal with such issues: the harm to human beings would be indirect here(via a contaminated bacteria for example) and not direct.
Ethics committee. Professor MAMZER-BRUNEEL thinks that there is no proper ethics commity that deals with such issues (indirect harms that genetically modifed organisms could cause to human populations) and thinks that this is a shame as they are some ethics consideration in regards of the release of genetically modified organisms in the wild. She defined a proper ethics comity as follows: a committee who possesses representatives of the social society and not just of scientists.

1.1 Microscopy system for fluorescence image acquisition
Visual Fluo Bacteria: a software for the analysis of bacteria fluorescence images
Image of fluorescence bacteria is commonly used to visualize the activity of genetically engineered bacteria (see Figure 1).
Figure 1. Fluorescence field
Bacteria fluorescence imagines can be obtained by optical microscopy with a ccd camera. We develop a matlab tool to analyze such kind of bacterium imagine that can be acquired in different format (jpg, bpm, tiff). The software initially segments  bacteria and then computed their number. For each segmented bacteria the software computes the size in pixel, the mean and standard deviation of  intensity florescence. The use of the software is easy and intuitive (see user interface in Figure 2).
Figure 2. Main frame
The algorithm reads fluorescence images and converts it into a ""black and white"" one. Then the image is filtered by Top Hat filter to correct uneven illumination when the background is dark. In the next step the global threshold is computed in order to convert an intensity image to a binary image using Otsu’s method. The image is then ready to be scanned, pixel by pixel, to detect bacteria (cluster  of pixels) and obtain informations about their area, fluorescence mean and standard deviation. Fluorescence is read from R channel for RFP, G for GFP and B for CFP. The software allows to filter imagine by neglecting the bacteria that have morphologic parameters out of a prefixed range. The user can set two indicators:
Area dimension range ( definite by a superior and an inferior limit): This range defers to selected the bacteria that have similar size.
Fluorescence intensity ( definite by the std\mean ratio referred to each bacteria): this values consent to throw away the bacteria that lie on another focal layer or that aren’t focused correctly.
At this point, the filter based on these values discard the bacteria that have a std\mean higher than the threeshold and the bacteria that have a dimension out of the range.
Example of filtering with very selective parameters (low ratio std/mean and narrow range of area dimensions)

Low Budget Colombia Competition
Low Budget Challenge by Uniandes Colombia When doing a synthetic biology project, there are several protocols that must be followed to obtain the wanted results. This protocols can cost a lot of money and most of the time there aren’t the necessary funds available to obtain the best materials and at the same time have the necessary parts to complete the project.  Our low budget proposal consists of two modified techniques: Miniprep and electrophoresis. Both techniques are widely important when doing a project and we chose them because we could prove our Miniprep results in an electrophoresis that is also low budget. When combining both protocols, the amount of money saved can be impressive.
Interteam Collaboration with iGEM Amoy
This year, Amoy team invited us to participate in the newsletter they developed along with Paris_Bettencourt and Pasteur_Paris. We participated along in the discussions about our project, the obstacles we overcome, about science in Mexico and various other topics. The best part of interacting with Amoy team was to see that through communication we can all share our ideas and suggest ways of improving. Here we share the link to the Newsletters: https://2015.igem.org/Team:Amoy/Newsletter
Biosint Queretaro
We reviewed the P&P work of Biosint team, “Ethics for Synthetic Biology, Guidelines for the iGEM Community“. With the help of our instructor, we reviewed their ethic code for the correct implementation of it in Mexico. In this code, they define Synthetic biology and its principles for its implementation in the research field.

Tec Monterrey Campus Chihuahua Collaboration
We established a collaboration with Tec-Chihuahua team who are working with CNTs. CNTs are cylindrical structures formed by rolled graphite sheets, which are composed by structured carbon atoms rings. These have greater mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, and chemical and biological activity than graphite. Some authors have demonstrated that DNA can adhere to the CNTs by simple electrostatic interactions between positively charged groups on the surface"

DNA vaccine as a new type of vaccine has promising prospects in the future. Using TAT:H4 as a transport device can improve the transfection efficiency and the efficiency of DNA vaccine. We can replace the EGFP with antigen gene of some fish disease to prevent fish from falling ill.
IN THE FUTURE
We will do these jobs:
1. Ichthyophthiriasis is a typical fish disease. We will replace the EGFP with ichthyophthiriasis antigen gene, or even much more genes of fish disease, and do experiments in zebra fish to test whether our DNA vaccine can work in vivo experiment or not.
Figure 1.Sick fish.
Figure 2.Healthy fish
2. We will use different modes of packing to convey our DNA-protein complex to tissues that are susceptible to infection, and make preparations for oral vaccine.
3. We will extract some specific promoter of zebra fish, like histone H3 promoter and β-actin promoter. We will use these promoters to take the place of CMV promoter. This will improve the efficiency of DNA vaccine in zebra fish, and it will improve biosafety.We have extracted the genome of zebrafish and tried to get H3 promoter by PCR.
Figure 3.Lane 1 is marker DL5000 and lane 2 is the genome of zebrafish
4. We will do something to modify TAT:H4 to improve its transport efficiency.
5.We got the new sequence of holin and endolysin with the help of Peking University before the wiki freezed. We will keep testing the new self-lysis devices and try to get ideal results.
6.We also want to use quorum sensing to control the lysis. Thus we don’t need inducer to induce the lysis, which is closer to the vivo experiments.
Self-lysis device automatically
We got DNA sequences of holin and endolysin of lambda phage with the help of Peking University before the wiki freezed. We will keep testing the new self-lysis devices and trying to get expected result. And we will also use quorum sensing to control the lysis. Thus we can induce the lysis automatically instead of manually, which is closer to the requirements of vivo experiments.

Synth. Bio. High School Classes
During the January-May semester, we prepared a 1-hour introductory course to Synthetic Biology aimed to high school students. We made two versions: one for regular students with only a cursory knowledge of biology and chemistry, and another to senior students who were taking an elective class in Biotechnology.
The classes were tested in the Eugenio Garza Sada High School (PEGS), one of our university’s five high school campuses (and the one who participated in this year’s iGEM HS). All of the students were attentive and proactively asking questions. We talked about the current and future trends in synthetic biology as well about the iGEM competition and our current project.
We were invited to return for the next semester. During those classes we will also promote the iGEM High School 2013 competition and answer questions about it.

To make navigation as easy as possible, we've used the default iGEM pages and spent a long time thinking about the structure of the rest of our site. The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .

2. To the frozen cell pellet, add lysis buffer to a ratio of 1:5 grams of cell pellet to mL of lysis buffer.
3. Incubate 5 minutes on ice.
4. Vortex vigorously for 20 seconds, incubate on ice for 5 minutes.  A pipette can be used to carefully re-suspend the pellet if vortexing is insufficient.
5. Repeat Step 4 two to four times, until the pellet is sufficiently broken up.
6. Centrifuge at 4C at max speed for 10 minutes.  Retrieve supernatant (lysate).  The pellet can be kept for downstream analysis if desired.
7. Store at -80C or -20C (-80 recommended) until use.

-Procedure
Because a rotator was not available.  Mixing was done by inverting in a 50mL falcon tube with ice.
1. Add one volume of resuspended Ni-resin to a container with 3-4 times the volume of resin added.  300uL of lysate was added.
2. Add two resin bed volumes of equilibration buffer, mix by rotating for 5 minutes.  Ensure that the resin is fully resuspended at each step.
3. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 700g.  Discard supernatant.
4. If the above lysis buffer was not used, add protein sample to equilibration buffer at a 1:2 v/v ratio for a total volume greater than the resin bed volume if (Usually two volumes).  For example, for 1mL of resin, add (1mL of protein sample + 1mL of equilibration buffer). Save at least 20uL of whole cell lysate for SDS-PAGE analysis.

Lastly, we wanted to make a real impact in people’s lives who were experiencing cataracts. Despite our project’s goal of delivering cataract relief non-invasively, we realize that surgery is currently the most effective way to eliminate cataracts. So, we held fundraisers (in the form of bake sales and club fairs) in order to donate to those who don’t have funds or access to surgery. We raised enough money for 14 surgeries through the Himalayan Cataract Project, which serves underprivileged cataract patients.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", an overview and general direction of projects is given by a broader   circle containing the team - instead of exerting authority, it guides teams on the right track.
The holacratic organizational structure is graphically presented below (Robertson, 2007):
Because the holacratic structure involves high employee autonomy, it requires several traits from people working in this system (TheWorkologist, 2015). These traits are similar to the ones identified in freelancers and entrepreneurs:
Self-leadership and motivation
Personal productivity; drive towards efficiency without supervision.
Ambiguity tolerance; Ambiguity is beneficial for fast adaptation to change and creativity but may create confusion and lack of direction.
Psychological capital; the extent to which employees are efficient, optimist, hopeful and enthusiastic about their work.
Regarding our inter-organizational network, we believe that loose connections with industry and academia are appropriate for our type of business. In a loosely coupled network, actors have higher self-determination and are more observant   of the environment. Therefore, we can be more adaptable. Because we will be a small, specialized company, we need to keep track of emerging technologies to quickly adopt them. Both size and organizational structure enables us to speculate opportunities   and avoid threats faster than large companies. When an opportunity or threat arises, we can seek for help in our network and change certain relationships from loose to strong, until solving the issue.
For example, collaboration with a 3D printer manufacturer would need to be strong in the beginning, until a viable solution is finalized. Afterwards, loose connections with the 3D printing industry would be more beneficial, so we can scan for incremental   advancements improving our existing solution.
People are the foundation for growing an idea for any business or project. Our team members’ backgrounds are diverse and can fulfil most of the functions needed to start a business. Strong cohesion of the group is also paramount for success.
Science and technology are most well represented by knowledge of Life Sciences, Chemistry, Biotechnology, Nanobiology, Physics, Biomedical lab-work, Computer Science and Systems Engineering. Each part would contribute to designing and     constructing a 3D biofilm printer, programming and testing it, and growing the bio-gel needed for printing various biofilm structures.
Management of Technology expertise broadly covers the areas of entrepreneurship, leadership, management, marketing and business strategy, by working in collaboration with science-oriented team members. Basic Economy and Finance operations     can be also covered temporarily until an accountant is hired.
Positive team dynamics is key to a successful project. After more than half a year of working and spending time together, we made"

    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:
        dn/dt=k*(N-n)*fex(t)
        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))
    So the lipid-time function, Slp(t), were found:
        Slp(t)=(N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))

I will probably be working on database support, and I would like to help with the robot automation/assembly algorithm project. I've put up a short bio of myself here .
Sixpi 15:55, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
I talked with Doug yesterday about how the DB manager should work for the new Clotho. The new DB manager won't be a rewrite of what I have now - what I have now should probably be renamed the DB browser. The new DB manager will be the default gateway for information to travel in and out of Clotho, so we want it to be as flexible and powerful, and yet as easy to use as possible. Out of our discussion, we decided that a binding file of some sort was still needed, and that we needed some list of internal types/keywords that all Clotho tools should understand, and a binding file to translate between external types and internal types. Once data passes through the binding manager, another piece of code will be responsible for checking the external data model to see if it is compatible enough with the Clotho data model to let the tools do their work. We will need to consider some things about how different the topologies of the external and internal data models are, and how different the models can be before the tools will not be able to traverse the external data intelligently.
Proposed new Clotho infrastructure

Sixpi 18:02, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
Yesterday we had our general meeting of the week, where we decided who would be doing their minipresentations when next week. I'll be going on Monday. Our last team member, Lesia, arrived in the afternoon and started getting acquainted with Clotho.
Nina and I also went to the wet lab again to talk to Jenn about more robot details. We figured out a few more things the robot automation piece will need to do: keep track of the amount of DNA needed to finish a set of assemblies and warn the user when there isn't enough sample left, and also we need to break the protocol used in Chris' lab down into pieces that are sufficiently general and configurable so they can be reused to easily create new robot automation protocols.
Sixpi 18:20, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
I had a meeting with Doug about the new data model on Wednesday, and he liked my idea of having a core set of keywords and then having a set of extension keyword files. Some features Doug want include automatic connectivity detection and alternate path usage."

When these informations are considered, it is clear that production of TIpB protein is IPTG dependent and Western-Blot can be performed because of its His-Tag site.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered GadE gene into peT-45 vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final construct after this cloning is, respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-GadE. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.
Results
GadE-PSB1C3 CLONNING
We cloned IDT G-Blocks GadE gene into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and GadE G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 858 bp long.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.
GadE-pET45-b CLONNING
We cloned GadE into PSB1C3 vector successfully, then moved on cloning it into the expression vector pET45-b. For cloning into this plasmid, we removed our gene from PSB1C3-GadE plasmid with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with the same enzymes"

If we know the existence of a new kind of hazard, the use of new ways to prevent accidents or how to react in case they occurred, we can help to develop new security measures or apply them if necessary.
During our experimental work, we detected certain cultures which weren't reacting as expected. We caracterized those cultures and identified a mutatuion as the reason of this malfunction. Thus we continued our experiments using aliquots of the original stock culture, avoiding any problem that could arise if we kept using the mutants.  We want to highlight the importance of being on the alert and keeping a well preserved stock to turn to when things go wrong.
Characterization of biological material, is essential given the complexity of biological systems. The more we know about them, the safer we are. And it is important to know how well-studied those parts are. In particular, biobricks could be rated. The more tested and improved by other teams, the more trustworthy they are, so they could be better ranked. This could be added to the “Experience page” of each construction.

Questions (Franco's interview has been translated from the original in Italian)
1) What role do you believe Synthetic Biology will play in the next 10 years?
Franco: In Italy, the role of Synthetic Biology in the next 10 years will strongly depend on its ethical implications. Personally, I am not very knowledgeable in the field of synthetic biology as I lack a full picture on the topic. In our Country, there is a strong feeling of the so-called “Frankenstein Syndrome”, which is the fear that scientific innovation could get out of hand or that scientists without ethics will bring chaos to the relationship between nature and humans. A lot will depend on this.
Anneliese: I think that synthetic biology could play a considerable role in the next 10 years. It is interdisciplinary, and could therefore have a great potential to change areas such as medicine and energy.
2) What are the implications and ethical dilemmas faced by synthetic biology- related technologies being introduced into the society? If generally negative, how can we overcome this? If generally positive, where is the room for improvement?
Franco: The public needs to be engaged. The debate needs to go beyond all the emotional bias, unlike how it too often happens in Italy when talking about themes such as synthetic biology. Everything needs to be put on the field, including risks, opportunities, possible developments and implications. Too often this has not been the case in Italy, because the scientific community here starts from the assumption that the technical concepts are too complicated for the majority of the population to understand.
Anneliese: I believe that there has been limited research into the ethical implications of synthetic biology, and I would want to see greater investigation into this area before synthetic biology related technologies were introduced into wider society. I would assume that many of the ethical implications would be similar to those around the area of GM. I think it’s also important to consider the safety implications of synthetic biology, especially the accidental or deliberate release of a harmful organism into the environment.

BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#Project Resistance Subsystem_-_-_TEXT.html," when NhaA is not sufficiently induced, and/or when NhaA is not activated[8]. Unlike NhaA, the activity of NhaB shows no dependence on pH in the range 6.4-8.3. The affinity of NhaB to Na+ ions (Km = 40-70μM) is higher than that of NhaA.[9]
Design
The gene circuits of the alkali-resistance device is shown in Fig.3. This device consists of two genes and two promoters. The strong constitutive promoter J23119 is used in our gene circuit. In order to resist alkaline stress, we chose two of Nha sodium-proton anti-porter proteins referred before to construct device one. NhaA could make sure E.coli’s survival under alkaline pH. NhaB regulates intracellular pH when NhaA is limited. But NhaB is weakly pH-dependent, so a alkali-induced promoter J23119 is necessary. The construction has been finished .
Fig.3 gene circuit.
Result
Firstly, we obtained the genes, NhaA (BBa_K1) and NhaB (BBa_K2), through PCR. The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of gene NhaA and NhaB is shown in Fig.4.
Secondly, we assembled the standard part J23119+B0034+NhaA(BBa_K3, JBA) and J23119+B0034+NhaB(BBa_K4, JBB). The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of JBA and JBB is shown in Fig.5 and Fig.6.

Conclusion
Introduction
glsA is a kind of glutaminase gene in E.coli functioning at acidic pH ranges[12]. glsA gene encodes glutaminase A(GlsA)[13] which can transform glutamine(Gln) and water into glutamate(Glu) and ammonium[14]. GlsA is activated in acidic environment, and exhibits robust glutaminase activity only at pH 6.0 or lower. The highest activity of GlsA is obtained at pH 4.0, followed by pH 5.0 and 6.0. In contrast, at the pH 7.0 and 8"

where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four promoters and pSB3C5 with high copy plasmid pSB1A3 (copy number: 200). Since there are no tetR protein existed in the system, we keep lux pR unchanged (it is equivalent to use pLux/Tet hybrid promoter).
The results is shown for each (we plot GFP concentration versus time and compare it with experiment measument):

Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR"

""Bacto-Builders""
Overview
Assembling particles at microscopic scales into desired patterns or structures is currently either extremely difficult, or in most cases impossible. Some structures have been shown to naturally self-assemble under speciﬁc conditions [1], but this is limited to a very small subset of all those possible. Other techniques, such as the use of optical tweezers [2], although promising, are human-intensive, a possible disadvantage in certain applications where structures need to change dynamically in response to certain conditions. With this in mind the BCCS iGEM 2008 project aims at developing miniature “Bacto-Builders” to help.
All construction projects require the manipulation of varying size components, many much greater than any individual. To make this possible, teams of individuals work together with a common outcome in mind. In aim of transferring this behaviour to our “Bacto-Builders”, we will investigate the possibility of utilising large numbers of E. coli to perform a task too great for any individual cell. Speciﬁcally, this will involve the physical movement of particles through direct contact with a swarm of bacteria working together in a co-ordinated manner. The ultimate goal is to make collective behaviour emerge by bacteria adhering to a set of simple rules so that particles are assembled according to some desired pattern. Furthermore, patterns or structures could be evolved in real time with bacteria adapting to new dynamic requirements or autonomously forming new ones.
To create these structures, each bacterium searches randomly through an environment to ﬁnd a suitable particle. On contact, it attempts to push the particle towards a goal (chemoattractant gradient). It also sends out a short range quorum signal to tell nearby bacteria, in a position to help with particle movement, that a particle is in the vicinity and therefore to move towards the goal chemoattractant.
By altering the pattern of the chemoattractant gradient, it will be possible to place particles in a speciﬁc conﬁguration. For the longer term, we envisage different sets of bacteria performing complementary tasks. For example, one group, the ’architects’, may have the job of ﬁnding the locations that particles need to be placed. Once found, they emit a chemoattract"

Blue Oven Bakery
One of our team members spoke with Mark Frommeyer, the owner of Blue Oven Bakery, a bakery and wheat farm near Cincinnati, Ohio concerning the pathogens that he had experienced on his wheat farm. He said that he had never seen stem rust on his wheat; leaf rust was a common pathogen but was not a significant worry for him. It might stress the plants slightly, but did not greatly decreases his yield. His main concern, as well as the main concern of other wheat farmers in the area is Fusarium graminearum (vomitoxin), which both significantly decreases the crop yield and produces a mycotoxin which renders the entire crop inedible.
Turner Farm
Turner Farm is a certified organic farm in Cincinnati. They have some employees as well as an internship program, but source much of their labor from their co-op system. The farm grows a variety of fruits and vegetables, flowers, and livestock. They also have a teaching kitchen at the farm and work to educate the community about health, nature, and sustainable farming and sell at local farmers markets.

YouTube
Our team evolved the idea to create a YouTube channel. The purpose was to create and manage a YouTube platform on which collaborating teams could post different kinds of short videos such as lab tutorials and link them to their unique iGEM project. The videos promote the main idea and diversity of iGEM. We are very proud to announce that our collaboration partners come from 4 different continents and speak 6 different languages.
The YouTube channel is intended to reach out to everybody who is not yet aware of iGEM and its possibilities and will consequently encourage and inspire future iGEM teams. It works as a network and multiplies the range of iGEM teams’ social media presence.     You can find all videos here here .

Post Cards
The iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf started a campaign to promote synthetic biology in public by using self-designed postcards. The postcards are created individually by each team to illustrate their project briefly. A batch of each team’s postcard is exchanged so that every team can share postcards from all over the world.
The postcards are used to promote iGEM and the idea of international networking by handing them out at public events. Thus each individual postcard arrived somewhere else around the globe as a symbol of the international and public dimension of iGEM.
Laboratory collaboration: Efficacy spectrum
We want to thank iGEM Team Franconia for testing our produced antibiotic clorobiocin on C. glutamicum.  Their tests with our established protocol for agar diffusion assay and different antibiotic concentrations show that clorobiocin works as potent as Ampicillin on C.glutamicum strain 13032. These data provide information on inhibition of corynebacterium growth by aminocoumarins. They saw that  C.glutamicun strain 13032 is more sensitive to clorobiocin than our tested ΔTolC E.coli and the MIC is lower than 2.5 µg clorobiocin (s.c. 1 mg/ml). This is consistent with the fact that aminocoumarins work most efficient in gram-positive bacteria like Streptococci or Acinetobacter."

This is the iteration plan for the Construction iteration(s). See the UPEDU artifact description for information on what this is and what it contains (including a template).
Milestone
These are the major milestone objectives for the Construction phase:
TODO Our wonderful buoyant, metal filtering bacteria should be alive and kicking!
TODO (?) The lab/plan cloning strategy should be fully worked out at the end of the phase to reflect our final decisions on which parts/protocols/procedures/? to use. (I think this roughly corresponds to the Implementation Model in UPEDU. -- Jaspervdg 11:09, 23 June 2009 (UTC))

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," what safety research has been done. We go forward and hope nothing bad happens; if a problem does come up it may be too late to do anything, e.g. if something escapes the lab.
Yassen asked about the future of biotechnology.
Eric said that past promises were overhyped; biotech failed to deliver in most areas, though there has been some success in medicine.
Eric argued that biotech has not benefited the public in agriculture; the only commercialised traits are those that promote pesticide use. Eric noted that the same companies often own the chemicals and the bio. Increased yields do not seem to have been achieved by genetic engineering.
Yassen asked why biotech hasn't delivered as much as it promised.
Eric was concerned that biotech progress or technology in general was driven by concerns about money and not concerns about benefits to humanity. There is a lack of a democratic approach to determine what technologies are developed.
Eric said that the lack of success was partially due to an outdated view of genetics, i.e. the ""one gene causes one trait"" view. Modern geneticists now know this is too simplistic, genes form a complicated network of interactions. There is a need to learn more about the systems before commercialisation.
Fionn asked about biorefineries - using agricultural waste to make products like sweeteners, vitamins, etc.
Eric said the first thing to consider is what the agricultural waste would otherwise have been used for; it may have been broken down and put back into the soil, which is important for soil health and prevention of soil erosion. So taking this biomass and putting it into a biorefinery might not be the best use of it.
There was a discussion about the biomass-based economy (e.g. to replace petroleum etc). There are issues in global justice. Eric noted that synthetic biology is mostly done in the U.S. and Europe, whereas most biomass was located in the global south (South America, Africa). This sets up a situation where the exploitation of the global south by the north is likely. Land that's in short supply for essential agriculture should not be diverted to other things.
Fionn suggested that biotechnology could be of use to the south but it would depend on who controls the technology. Eric agreed that this was a key issue.
Eric said synthetic biology was often a solution in search of a problem; we have organisms that can do X, Y and Z; what can we do with them?
Yassen asked whether biomass for use in biotech could be sustainably sourced in the future.
Eric said he was not confident. Due to predictions of increased population as well as water"

Given that DNA is our main work tool, we decided to engage the children by letting them extract DNA from bananas, with ethanol and dishwashing soap.
Recipe for a successful banana DNA extraction!
A ripe banana (Brownish)
50 ml of water (About a half cup)
2 teaspoon of salt
2 teaspoon Dishwashing soap or detergent
Rubbing alcohol (cold)
Coffee filter
A test tube (or narrow glass)
Narrow wooden stirrer
Peel and smash half of the Banana into a pulp
Add the 50ml of water(must be at ambient temperature), the salt and the Dishwashing soap
Stir until a soft foam starts to appear
Let the mix pour through the coffee filter (about five minutes)
Throw out the coffee filter and its content, keep the liquid
Take a 2ml sample and pour it in the test tube
Add 4ml of alcohol, two layer should form in the test tube
In the alcohol layer, a white cloud with bubbles should appear, this cloud is DNA!
This simple yet interesting experience helped us attract children to our stand. It was a great starting point for us to start some indepth conversation with them about what they knew of DNA and what could be done with it. Some of them weren't aware that banana had DNA at all and some teachers told us that our demonstration was very well designed and easy to understand without distorting the truth.
The stand having drawn everybody’s attention (thanks to the pungent smell of smashed bananas), our intervention was broadcasted on a local TV (TLT[1]), and we were also selected to take part in International ExpoSciences in Brussels.
Communication in junior high school
To carry on with our education mission, we agreed with one of the science teachers from the Leonard de Vinci junior high school of Tournefeuille to meet with the students. The plan? Bees, Varroas, an introduction to synthetic biology and, of course, banana DNA extraction!
We were allowed by children lawful representatives to use their children image.
Teaching about varroas and bees
We prepared a short presentation about varroa which was followed by a Q and A session where student were able to interact with us and each other about the disappearance of bees, pesticides, varroa and synthetic biology.

During the conversation between two teams, they put forward their future plan to use a kind of reusable materials to adhere bacteria, which is exactly the same as we tried last year. The adviser of our team realized immediately that they might have chosen the wrong reusable material. Therefore, we gave them suggestions about choices of reusable materials. Students of their team were grateful hearing this useful suggestion. Moreover, we also provided them with materials shown in the picture, which is used for bacteria aggregation in solution. No doubt that we saved them a lot of time choosing the reusable material and building the right equipment.
Establishment of New iGEM Teams
 
1. Southeast University
 
Students from Southeast University are interested to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuit. However, they are not familiar with characteristics of DNA. They are also unaware of iGEM. They came to us for suggestions about how to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuits and expressed their interests in participating iGEM in 2017. Thus we assigned one of our team members, Zhen Li to help them with their project design as well as give them information about the iGEM competition. From then on, we formed intimate collaboration relationship with them and discussed with them every week to track their progress. We even specially designed a brochure containing detailed explanation of iGEM competition to them. ( Click here to get the PDF file. ) The collaboration goes smoothly and they have already formed ideas about the project in next year’s competition. They will establish a new iGEM team next year with our help!
 
 
2. TMMU-China
 
This year we also cooperated with team TMMU-China, which is a team participating in iGEM for the first time. For starters, we offered timely help to them around May on how to establish a team by sending basic plasmids and answering questions through social media. After many rounds of discussions, we invited them to Nanjing University to have a face-to-face communication about each other’s project on June 9th. In return for this little conference, on September 24th, some of our team members and our team leader joined the meeting up with TMMU-China along with a few other teams. It is indeed a wonderful collaboration experience and both of us benefited a lot from each other by regular discussions. We sincerely hope that we can hear good news from each other in Boston!"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

“Despite certain hydrophobicity provided by proline, the most important advantage of proline-rich peptides in biological systems is their high degree of water solubility, an essential property for their use in life sciences. [...] In general, it is accepted that CPPs offer several advantages over other known cellular delivery systems, including low toxicity, high efficiency towards distinct cell lines, and even inherent therapeutic potential.” - Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides p 62 Ülo
Nina: Some CPPs seem to be somewhat well studied, now we maybe should find a couple of them that could be good in our project.
“[...] the metabolic degradation of the CPP and the CPP cargo is necessary for the delivery of the cargo after internalization and the final elimination of the CPP to avoid chronic toxicity. An equilibrium between these two aspects is required in order to avoid the premature release of the cargo and its cleavage once internalized.” - Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides p 63 Ülo
Nina: We should learn more about the CPP degradation in order to understand and handle toxic levels.
“[...] permeability can be modulated by taking advantage of the amino side chain, which, in this case, is the a-amino function of the proline. Thus, through this side chain, several parameters of the CPP can be altered, such as hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity characteristics.” - Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides p 63-64 Ülo
Nina: Maybe this information about this amino side chain is good for us to know during our practicals if we want to modulate this part.
