Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," also have their own legislation in accordance with this framework.
In Brazil, the Biosafety Law (Law 11105/05) sets the safety rules and fiscalisation of GMMs and its derivatives in the national territory. The National Technical Committee of Biosafety (CTNBio) is responsible for enforcing the laws and setting the rules for the construction, experimentation, cultivation, manipulation, transport, commercialization, consumption, release and discarding of GMMs and its derivatives.
Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology. However, the Agricultural and Livestock Service is responsible for the importation, sowing and propagation of GMOs, also regulating the exportation of seeds (Law N° 3.557/82 actualised Law N°1523/2001). The Ministry of Health, on the other hand, regulates the labelling of food made with the use of GMOs (Article 107).
India is currently undergoing a massive overhaul in their laws and regulations regarding GMOs. Currently, there is a proposed “Regulations and guidelines on biosafety of recombinant DNA research and biocontainment, 2017’ draft that has been prepared and opened for comments. Currently, under the proposal, the following 6 bodies are in charge of enforcing laws regarding GMOs and GMMs -
1. Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RDAC) - Advisory
2. Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) - Regulatory/ Approval
3. Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) - Regulatory/ Approval
4. Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) - Regulatory/ Approval
5. State Biotechnology Coordination Committee (SBCC) - Regulatory/ Approval
6. Monitoring District Level Committee (DLC) - Monitoring
The laws regarding the use of GMMs are regulated by 4 ministries: The Ministry of Agriculture, The Ministry of Forestry and Plantation, The Ministry of Health, and The Ministry of Food and Horticulture. They created the Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 21 year of 2005 (PP No. 21/2005) on Biosafety of GMO.
In Japan, mainly Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the use of GMMs. With these ministries at the core, other institutions such as Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare are also responsible for GMMs in each related field.
The usage of the GMMs in Korea is strictly regulated by the GMO Law, established on Jan 28,"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#IntroductoryLabwork#9 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmid DNA from colony 8 - BBa_J04450 with plasmid pSB1AT3
Well 10 = plasmid DNA from colony 9 - BBa_J04450 with plasmid pSB1AT3
Well 11 = plasmid DNA from colony 10 - BBa_J04450 with plasmid pSB1AT3
Lid was applied and electrodes positioned correctly (positive electrode at end furthest from wells and negative electrode positioned nearest wells). Power was switched on and voltage set to 150 volts. This process was allowed to run for 40 minutes.
Observations and Results
Once 40 minutes had expired, electrodes were switched off and lid removed. In the gel it could be seen that the DNA had streaked from the wells to the positive electrode. Three marker bands were visible, in order from nearest wells to nearest positive electrode - a cyan band, a dark blue band and a yellow band.
Gel removed from gel tray and taken to UV scanner. The following photograph was produced:
From this photograph it can be seen that apart from the E.coli cells located in colony 9, all the colonies that had survived the negative selection and displayed either a red or a green colour in solution contained plasmid DNA. This proves that most of the colonies had been transformed with a plasmid at least. The possibilities for colony 9 not revealing a plasmid DNA readout are as follows:
Colony 9 E.coli cells did not receive the plasmid DNA and acquired it's ampicillin resistance and colour properties elsewhere
The plasmid DNA (which appears as a transparent pellet in the previous experiment) was lost when the supernatant was tipped out.
Now that Team:Newcastle has proved that the competent E.coli cells have taken up the plasmids, the next step will be to prove that the 'E.coli' have taken up the specific BioBricks that we attempted to transform them with. This will involve restriction enzymes and another DNA gel electrophoresis.

Austin_UTexas,2015,Team:Austin UTexas#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," cell’s fitness, breaking the genetic circuit. However, the development of a more stable genetic device could lead to a robust method of biofuel production that lasts over many generations and help alleviate the fuel crisis.
By creating and using these genetically stable circuits, many companies can save time and money when developing synthetic products. For example, Amyris, a company specializing in synthetic biology products, spent $33,202,000 in 2014 to make their biosynthetic models (Amyris 2014). Companies such as this invest millions on genetic devises to make their products, therefore if these genetic devices are unstable then the company will lose a lot of money. Along with big companies, research labs working in this field would benefit in the same way if their devices lasted longer. Making synthetic biology more cost effective and efficient makes the expansion of using synthetic biology to help society greater. By making it more reliable and cheaper, it may also encourage more biohackers who often use community spaces with far less monetary resources to get involved.
The advancements in this project can be taken to a global level, where the production of many biosynthetic devices/products can be improved dramatically, efficiently, and cost effectively. Using biological systems to create useful products is not only fast but is also less expensive when compared to conventional manufacturing. When it comes to fixing Third World problems such as access to fuels, food, water, or materials in a cost effective and timely manner, stable genetic devices within engineered microorganisms could be the answer. However, synthetic biology can only be helpful if the devices we make can perform for a long period of time. A village in a country without stable power will not have the ability to simply thaw out another tube of bacteria, should their device-containing bacteria mutate to break the device. By addressing and solving the issue of stability we can deploy synthetic biology for the betterment of society and the future of science.
South By South West
The 2015 iGEM group had the opportunity to present at Austin's premier festival South By South West Create, that offers a unique convergence of emerging technologies and partners with community support. One of the main concerns for the exponentially growing field of synthetic biology is bridging the gap between science and society. Understanding the sociological components of introducing new synthetic technology to the public is an area that needs more intervention from scientists and the government.

IIT_Delhi,2016,Team:IIT Delhi#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to modify the Danino Oscillator so that we can tune the frequency of os- cillations. Further, we wish to use optogenetics to control this tuning. Oscillators  can be used as clock references, and thus, controlling the frequency of oscillation  would offer certain advantages. For instance, increasing the frequency might allow  faster execution of a process and vice versa. In this regard, one possible medicalapplication could be time-controlled drug delivery. If a drug is known to function  optimally if delivered at distinct regular intervals, an oscillator handling the de- livery of the drug would be an attractive option. Further, if under circumstances  quie stark from the ordinary, the rate delivery needs to be increased (decreased),  our approach could be a viable option.
We require two additions to an oscillator to realize HOTFM. A mechanism to  modulate the frequency of oscillation and an optogenetic module to act as a switch  for this mechanism.
Frequency Modulation
The Danino oscillator has a latency period where both the activator (LuxI) and  the repressor (AiiA) grow in concentration. One possible way to reduce the time  period of oscillations would be to reduce this latency period. For the Danino os- cillator, it is known that the time period and amplitude have a linear relationship  [4]; thus, we could, in principle, reduce the amplitude to reduce the latency pe- riod and increase the frequency of oscillation. We propose to do this by adding  negative autoregulation on AiiA. This transforms the amplified negative feedback  oscillator into a smolen oscillator [8]. There are additional benefits of adding  negative autoregulaation on AiiA; this makes the oscillator robust to parameter  variability [8]. If there is a sudden variation in AiiA’s concentration the negative  auto-regulation would automatically bring the concentration back down. Thus, we  expect HOTFM to have lesser peak to peak variability compared to the original  Danino oscillator. In-silico simulations confirm our intuition about HOTFM (refer  to the modelling section for a detailed analysis).
Optogenetic Module
In order to have a tunable frequency modulator, we need to have a switch that  controls the negative auto-regulaation (self-repression) on AiiA. To achieve this  end, we use optogentics as a flexible and easy mechanism. The Self-repression pathway is put under the control of lambda repressor; and this lambda repressor  controlled by the C"

The majority of teams (85%) appear to feel that there is at least the possibility that their project could be turned into a viable business or project – this makes sense given that many teams seek to use their project as an opportunity to use synthetic biology to address a problem.
Again, this chart shows how many teams believe their project is relevant to society. There was a split, slightly skewed towards commercial investment, in terms of the favoured means of funding, although it should be noted that many participants selected more than one option, suggesting mixed feelings and uncertainty on this question. Donation to the public domain was a popular option, indicating that many students support the BioBrick agreement and are keen to contribute their parts to it.
Responses to this question support the need for guidance for iGEM teams on IP issues. Possible explanations for this the larger than expected (29%) group selecting 'adequate' include: evidence of a Drunning-Kruger effect whereby people overestimate their level of knowledge; underestimating the significance and relevance of intellectual property law to synthetic biology; or a genuinely adequate understanding amongst students.
Sangamo patents zinc finger nuclease technology
Sangamo's patent, titled ""Nucleic acid binding proteins (zinc finger proteins design rules)"", ensures that any use or production of zinc fingers with attached nucleases is the intellectual property of Sangamo.
The graph indicates that profit is the least important considerations to students, but all others ranked more or less equally overall. The most important factor overall was benefit to society.

Three Plasmids
Three Parts & Three Plasmids in a Glee
In a synchronized oscillatory system, three important parts should be included: the oscillator, which is the biochemical machinery that generate the oscillatory output; the coupling pathway that ensure the connection among cells; and output pathway, which is also known as a reporter that reflect the state of the oscillator to downstream targets (Fig. 2-1).
Fig. 2-1 Circuit working mechanism
Oscillator
Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell signaling mechanism that refers to the ability of bacteria to respond to chemical hormone-like molecules called autoinducers. When an autoinducer reaches a critical threshold, the bacteria detect and respond to this signal by altering their gene expression. In our circuit, QS (from Vibrio fischeri) is installed as a positive feedback while aiiA (from Bacillus Thurigensis) acts as a negative one to compose an oscillator together. In the quorum sensing part, the luxI gene is at low expression level and produces LuxI protein that synthesize a kind of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which is a small molecule that can diffuse across the cell membrane and mediate intercellular coupling when it reaches the threshold as enough biomass accumulated. AHL will bind intracellular protein LuxR, which is also consecutively produced by luxR gene. The LuxR-AHL complex can activate the luxI promoter, and the positive feedback loop is built. At the same time, the aiiA gene, which is under control of the same promoter is expressed and produce a lactonase enzyme known as aiiA that hydrolyzes the lactone ring of AHL. (Fig. 2-1) In this system, the activator"

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," are 10^11 free-living V. cholerae cells (which is perhaps unrealistic) entering the host, not enough will survive in order to infect.  Alternatively, the most successful V. cholerae enter as microcolonies or as part of a biofilm.  Bacteria that are part of a biofilm produce an exopolysaccharide matrix that will protect them from the low pH.  Once the V. cholerae have made it to the SI they need to travel through the mucus layer covering the epithelium.  Therefore motility is an important trait for V. cholerae.  Transportation of the bacteria through the mucus layer is facilitated by the expression of hapA.  HapA encodes for haemagglutinin/protease (Hap), a mucinase, which is produced by V. cholerae.  After making their way through the mucus layer, V. cholerae will attach to the epithelium.  Initially, the bacteria produce nonspecific adhesins that allow themselves to attach temporarily to the epithelium while determining the suitability of the substrate.  Some of the important adhesions are Mam7 and GbpA.  Mam7 creates protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, while GbpA binds to GlcNac molecules that are attached to epithelial cells.  Once V. cholerae are attached to the SI epithelium they produce cholera toxin (CT) an adenylate cyclase ribosylating toxin attached to a pentameric receptor-binding subunit.  Once inside intestinal cells, the toxin subunit causes large increases in adenylate cyclase, which causes chloride ion pumps to increase the extracellular concentration of chloride ions, resulting in a huge out-rush of water into the intestinal lumen.  This causes watery diarrhea that leads to dehydration and death in the host.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," screening
One major goal of synthetic biology is to make biology engineerable and predictable. Currently metabolic engineering does still involve a lot of trial and error. With the number of possibilities for pathway finetuning this scales very fast, becoming very difficult to tackle with traditional methods.
Also, once we create such a library of metabolic pathway variants, possibly including thousands of strains, we have to find the most promising ones among these. A traditional approach would be to check the production of each strain in its own culture flask. Using for example
HPLC
or mass spectrometry.
A more suitable, easy way to quickly screen for metabolite concentration in a semi quantitative way are biosensors. One of the easiest to use classes of biosensors are metabolite-responsive transcription factors (Liu et al. 2018). They are usually very specific towards their distinct substrates. In vivo, most of these systems help their native organism to react to environmental clues by regulating expression of for instance catabolic enzymes or importers.
In the past, these have ben co-opted by researchers to function as sensors or to control enzyme expression to regulate a pathway depending on the availability of a certain metabolite (Rogers, Taylor, and Church 2016). By using reporter genes like
GFP
or the
LUX
operon, we have a measurable output that can be used to select for the best contenders. By running this in several iterations, nature's most powerful optimization tool, evolution, can be applied to further improve the pathway (Williams et al. 2016). Applying fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) coupled with V. natriegens incredible doubling time, thousands of generations can be screened for progressively better pathway variants.
So, we decided to put our toolbox full of characterized parts to good use. The Marburg collection contains all the parts needed to find the ideal enzyme balance for highest production. Being able to build a large number of differentially assembled pathways is the answer to creating the most productive strain. Finding the right one in that complexity is another difficulty to overcome, one we solved by finding transcriptional regulators that specifically activate reporter gene expression relative to the concentration of key metabolites, 3-hydroxypropionate and Malonyl-CoA. This gives us a quantifiable output with which we are able to judge the different combinations. Also, utilizing the speed of V. natriegens , the time required for a high throughput screening can be reduced dramatically.
We deemed the concentration of two different metabolites as being critical to our project: 3-Hydroxypropionate, the product itself"

Hassan Chaudhry
Hassan is a Mathematician at Warwick and found himself leader of the team and inadvertently our resident travel agent. He also took a firm hand in organising and keeping on top of the team while developing models for many of the parts in the meantime. Unfortunately, developing an allergic reaction to a tree he had come ""very close to touching"" outside the lab, he refused to dine al fresco with the rest of the team on the (rare) hot summer days.
Leo Vong
Leo is a 2nd year student studying Biochemistry at Warwick, hailing from all over the midlands. He was key to sponsorship, obtaining free gloves, laboratory reagents and other samples needed for our work in the laboratory.
Chris Davis
Chris is studying Physics at Warwick and was our honorary computer scientist taking the wiki by storm. He was also a major part in our data analysis and was driven almost insane by biologists and their ""continuous lack of enough repeats and far too many abbreviations"".
Iva Burova
Iva has ventured furthest from home, coming from Bulgaria and is studying Engineering at Warwick, looking to specialise into biomedical engineering post uni. She took a shine to the lab work, deeming everything ""so adorable"", and kept a meticulous lab book where you could find anything and everything experiment related. She was infinitely helpful, coming in at weekends and staying late every evening in order to complete the tasks at hand and studying for her exams alongside.
Dan Goss
After briefly lapsing his strong vegan beliefs and accepting the use of fetal bovine serum and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in the lab, he took charge of the measurement study and put his controversial views to good use at the forefront of our human practice ventures. He spurned interesting and heated debates about the project and its applications as well as its environmental impacts.
Chelsey Tye
Chelsey is currently studying in Chemistry following a 3 year undergraduate course in Chemical Biology at Warwick. She helped Dan in the measurement study and human practices area.
Caroline de Cock
Carrie studies biomedical science at Warwick and played a major role in the experimental side of the project. She was particularly crucial to the testing in human cells"

CystI and Dsr were cloned from Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Desulfovibrio Desulfuricans respectively. Sqr was obtained from Synechococcus (SP. PCC 7942). Sulfite reductase converts SO-3 to H2S and sulfide-quinone reductase convert S-2 to S.
• To test the working of the engineered bacteria for the reduction of the NOx and SOx gases we decided to design a prototype model of the reactor.

Virginia,2009,Team:Virginia Commonwealth#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," variable regions we determined that changing a single base to the second most frequent nucleotide would allow us to quantify the relationship between nucleotide frequency and UP-element strength.
Sequences of designed UP-elements
These UP-element designs were directly synthesized to include a well-characterized constitutive promoter and BioBrick ends on either end of the UP-element promoter sequence.  We also synthesized an UP-element as a modular BioBrick part to study the effect of the added nucleotide spacing between the UP-element and the promoter due to the BioBrick assembly scar.  It is likely that the additional spacing of the eight base pair BioBrick assembly scar may have a significant effect on part performance.
Future work
Higher understanding
From our results, we would potentially be able to more accurately predict the transcriptional effect of the UP-element with each nucleotide change. From this, we would like to create and characterize more UP-elements and possibly come to a more precise consensus sequence.
It has been suggested that both alpha subunits located in the RNAP bind to the UP-element at once. We would like to test this theory by measuring the binding strength when both alpha subunits are present and when only one is present.
Regulated promoters
We would like to study operator sites and redesign them as biobrick parts to tighten the control at the transcriptional level.
T7 Promoters
T7 phage promoters have long been utilized as a way to create orthogonal gene expression.  There is very little variation in the strength of T7 promoters available via the BioBrick registry.  Our goal is to identify a consensus T7 promoter sequence and use our bottom-up design approach to create a library of T7 promoters which we will characterize and upload to the registry.

The exchange reactions determine the metabolites that are beneficial to the medium. Changing the composition will allow us to be able to determine the effect the composition has on the efficiency of the production media.
Model SEED- ModelView
Model SEED is an online analysis software with its own genome and media formulation database. An analysis of G. hansenii is done with the curated model including a biomass reaction set for optimal organismal growth and a control of complete media. The biomass reaction describes the rate, which all the biomass precursors are made in correct proportions [2]. A biomass reaction requires a knowledge of the composition of a cell and the energy requirements that allow for the cell to grow. The biomass equation consists of three levels: macromolecular level (RNA, protein), intermediate level (biosynthetic energy), advanced level (vitamins, elements, and cofactors).  The biomass equation also list to stochiometric coefficients for each part of the biomass equation. Using this biomass equation the  growth rate was determined to be 66.48 gm per biomass CDW/hr was obtained. Since the flux is positive this explains that the flux of the analysis is indeed towards growth a negative or zero flux would have explained that the pathway is not used or it is impossible.
Future Directions/Modifications
Although a growth rate is obtained using Model SEED, this rate is for an environment where a complete medium is used. The growth medium being used contains dextrose, peptone, yeast extract, Na2HPO4, citric acid, agar and water.  Model SEED does not have the capabilities to create a media file, so all further analysis will be done using KBase because it has the ability to customize the media used for analysis. Kbase is a software that allows for online analysis of models, where models and the corresponding media for organismal growth can be optimized. The genome database contains all genomes including the G. hansenii genome  (as a JSON file). A full database for media that exist and capabilities to create the media being used in experimentation through the IRIS interface, which is the command line environment used by Kbase. Using IRIS and the subsequent FBA tutorial, a flux balance analysis was attempted but several issue were observed because of command line issues. Kbase will allow for the majority of modifications to be done in order to obtain the correct model and medium, further help will be sought out in order to conquer the error messages seen.

Introduction
Modeling
Introduction
We have also modeled the improved flip-flop. This models is an extension of the Basic Flip-Flop model . The main reactions at that model were:.
TRANSCRIPTION: RNAp + Promoter → RNAp + Promoter + mRNA
The mRNA production is described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
TRANSLATION: mRNA + Ribosomes → mRNA + Ribosomes + Repressor
The Repressor production is also modeled using Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
REPRESSION: Promoter + n · Repressor → Promoter_Repressorn
Finally we use a Hill kinetics model for the transcription inhibition, which offers an approximation to the cooperative action.
In the new model, we have to include the new reactions involved in the Improved Flip-Flop. These are:
PROTEOLYSIS: Protease + Repressor 1 → Protease
We will consider a mass action rate law, where the protein will be digested according to the protease concentration.
INHIBITION of TRANSLATION: asRNA + mRNA → RNA complex
We assume a mass action rate law again.
Diagram
These two new effects may enhance the robustness of the toggle switch. We will analyze their effects by implementing the model in Simbiology. The following diagram shows all the species and reactions of the model:
Here we can see all the species involved in the new model for the bistable.
The model can be downloaded here:

Shortages
We informed respondents about a recent shortage of EpiPen®. We wanted to know their opinion about the price increase of an essential medicine in the event of a shortage. The majority answered that the price increase is not justified since it is an essential medicine and everyone should be able to access it when needed, the rich and the poor. Also, they suggested that quotas would be more appropriate than raising prices.
A considerable fraction of respondents answered that it is justified to raise prices of medicines as they believed that it represents a good way to prevent overconsumption. In a marketing perspective, it was also mentionned that it is simply the principle of supply and demand.
Overconsumption
Since we think that our technology could make adrenaline more accessible, we were concerned about the possibilities of overconsumption. Because there is a low probability of abuse of adrenaline, we asked respondents about the overconsumption of any medicine in the context of a lowered purchase price. There is an important disparity over that question because many people believe that it is impossible that others will abuse of certain medicines.
However, when they are asked if they would themselves abuse of a medicine if they could, 96% of respondents answered that they would not. Nonetheless, about 10% of those who said they would not abuse of drugs said that if the prices dropped they might buy more to make stocks.
One respondent commented: “I would not use more than before necessarily, but if I’m a long-term patient and see it for cheaper, I’m likely to buy in bulk (depending on the conservation of the drug) and consume in the same dosage as needed before. This could be avoided if the drug is under prescription, legally sold only in small quantities or made to require very specific conservation conditions (e.g. very low temperatures) that would be difficult to achieve in a common household for a long period of time. Better strategies for drug conservation could also mean that the drug would be more available globally, but it does not mean that it has to be overconsummed.”
On the other hand, some respondents commented that one should not buy more of a medicine just because it is cheaper, saying that it is not like pizza or toilet paper.
Are GMOs worse than chemicals?
The large majority of respondents (93%) chose GMOs over the chemical production of adrenaline. Half of them considered GMOs not harmful in any way whereas the other half were not so fond of them, but still considered"

Foreword
China’s tobacco industry ranks first in the world, with the production and sales of cigarette in China taking the first place in the world. Meanwhile, China come naturally to have the largest population of smokers, and the topic of cigarette always has a high degree of attention. The unfortunate reality is that even the tobacco industry do not realized the potential value of tobacco waste, for so much chemical substance in  it may be useful for medicine. This year, our project aimes at transform the nicotine  to prodrug ——SP. We tried to use the pure nicotine at first, but we changed our mind after investigation to the tobacco factory. By using the the waste tobacco, not only we have a large amount of material, but also could help to solve the pollution of burning the tobacco dusts. After that, we made a questionnaire about the social hot issues of tobacco and the knowledge about tobacco waste, which gave us more understanding about tobacco industry so we can revise our project according it. Besides, we make more people know about iGEM and synthesis biology, educate them the harm of smoking by distributing questionnaires, giving a lecture in local high school. We also play a role in the “ Science Open Week” of our university to share the the beauty of science with visitors all over the country. When we communicate with high school students, we put forward to helping them to establish a high school iGEM team. At the same time, we took part in two seminar of iGEM, sharing the experience with other iGEMers.In the Questionnaire, Education, Community Propagation, Help of building new iGEM high school teams section, we constantly propagate the iGEM and synthetic biology knowledge, and help people understand correctly the tobacco industry through discussions with the public. In the investigation, Questionnaire and communication with iGEMers selection, our HP work help us deepen our understanding of the subject and guide our subject to the right direction, and finally we found that a new field can develop a downstream production line for the tobacco industry to produce drugs.Therefore, we think we are qualified for the Human Practice silver"

2a. Co-culture experiment of sender and receiver populations
Message transmission was tested by co-culturing sender and receiver populations, then selecting for successful transmission. During the co-culture, M13 particles containing the DNA message should be secreted by sender cells and should deliver the message to receiver cells.
2b. Exposure of receiver population to filtrate from sender culture
Since the message is transmitted through viral particles, sender cells should not need to be in contact with receivers for message transmission; presence of message-carrying viral particles should be enough. We therefore also tested message transmission by exposing receiver cells to culture filtrate from sender cells, which should contain viral particles secreted by the senders that can deliver messages to receivers.
3. Experimental protocol
3a. Co-culture experiment (Figure 3.1)
Grow sender cells and receiver cells individually in liquid LB media with appropriate antibiotics and supplements overnight at 37 °C with shaking.
Subculture a 1:100 dilution into fresh media containing the appropriate antibiotics and supplements and grow at 37 °C with shaking until O.D ≈ 0.6 (± 0.1).
Remove the chloramphenicol antibiotic from the media of sender cells by centrifuging the cultures and washing the pellet 3 times with saline.
Resuspend the sender cells in fresh LB liquid media containing no chloramphenicol
Co-culture sender cells with receiver cells at a 2:1 volume ratio and incubate at room temperature for ~ 5 h with shaking.
Subculture the co-culture at a 1:100 dilution into fresh LB media with no DAP and the appropriate antibiotics to select for receiver cells containing the messaging phagemid. Incubate overnight at 37 °C with shaking.
Dilute cultures 10-6 in saline and plate 100 μL of the diluted culture onto LB Cm 20 Km 25 agar.

Abstract
The abundance and diversity of our food relies on honeybee pollination. Varroa destructor mites weaken bee colonies through the spread of disease. Our team aims to save bees by killing Varroa using bacteria inside beehives. In continuous conversation with beekeepers and scientists we develop a bacterium that targets mites, leaving bees and humans unaffected. The hive-localized bacteria sense Varroa and produce mite-specific toxin, eliminating the need for beekeepers to dose the product. The bacteria are dependent on a synthetic amino acid and are shut down by light to confine them to the hive. Additionally, we develop an in vitro test of Varroa toxicity to show the utility of our bacterium. The system is modeled in various ways to assess its viability in the real world. This is the first effective method to combine specificity, ease of use, safety through bio-containment, and the iGEM open source character to save the honeybee.

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
The PCR amplicons for construction of the BioBricks Tn5, T7p-Tn5-T7t and Linker into pSB13 were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4 μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
The gel image shows that the pSB1C3 BioBrick backbone is succesfully amplified. However, when the extra nucleotide is incorporated for non coding sequence BioBrick construction, this resulted not in the desired amplicon. The Tn5 was correctly amplified as well as the T7p-Tn5-T7t expression cassette. The Linker sequence is not correctly amplified as there is no band seen at 143 bp.

Leiden,2016,Team:Leiden#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," different age groups or level of education. However, the number of observations in the pilot study was small (n=22), so perhaps the actual survey will reveal significant differences.
Recursively subtracted principal component analysis (RSPCA) of the survey questions. This figure shows the highest variance in the data found in when reducing the 11 questions to a 2-dimensional plot. The grey arrows indicate the direction of the original questions in the new dimensions. For example, question 5, 7 and 11 all ask about dangers or negative consequences and therefore point in the same direction in the new space. Likewise, the positive questions point in the opposing direction. The blue dots each represent a survey of the ""Synthetic Biology"" version. Likewise, the red dots each represent a survey of the ""GMO"" version.
Our hypothesis was that the word ""GMO"" has received a lot of negative attention over the years and may therefore influence the public's opinion. However, no clear trend was observed towards a different opinion of the ""GMO"" and ""Synthetic Biology"" versions, which consistently used only one of these phrasings.
Though the figure provides a quick insight in 11 questions on 99 surveys, it is far from ideal. Questions were answered in sliders, yielding percentage outcomes. Since percentages are not expected to follow a normal distribution, PCA is not the most informative tool. Therefore, we also tested the effect of version on the percentages using beta regression for each question (percentages can be reasonably approximated with a beta distribution). The effect was not significant in any of the questions, so we conclude the use of either phrasing has little to no effect on survey outcome.
Since surveys are rarely completely filled in for all cases, the question arises of how to deal with missing values. A simple, albeit biased approach would be to omit incomplete surveys or impute the missing values. We opted for a more advanced approach described in Taylor et al. 2013.

Sequencing result of Pqrr4+I13500 (GFP+RBS)
Purpose of this sequencing was to verify the presence of both Pqrr4 and I13500 for Emily to test her mutant circuit.  I have received the sequencing result today. At first, I was disappointed because the sequencing that was done with Forward primer had a perfect match with expected Pqrr4 sequence, but only matched 96% of I13500, and as for the sequencing done with Reverse primer, it had perfect match with the expected I13500 sequence, but only matched 99% of Pqrr4. However, because polymerases make mistakes after about 1000bp, this often occurs. So I decided to align the Forward sequence and the reverse sequence.
The following is the result:

We also helped some other teams with their projects. For the SUSTC-Shenzhen-B  team, we helped them test their terminator efficiency calculator and offered  some suggestions for improving their UI. It was a very useful tool and we  helped pass their tool on to others.
Collaboration with SUSTC-Shenzhen-A
Another very interesting app we helped test was the “BioSearch” app for  iOS from iGEM SUSTC-SHENZHEN-A team. We helped test its function and completed  surveys to help them improve it.
In conclusion, collaboration is something an iGEM team should at least  try once or twice. In such a high-end competition as iGEM, all the other  competing teams have really smart and fun people, and interacting with them as  a team gives experience that you will surely treasure.

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Results#RFC_-_-_TEXT.html," part descriptions could improve the usability of the parts registry. Only one percent declared that a standardization would not improve the usability. To our understanding an improved usability of the parts registry accompanies a less difficult access to and facilitated widespread of the ideas of iGEM and synthetic biology in general.
The sixth question introduced a draft of the new standardized BioBrick part description . The large majority of the participants (72%) indicated that they would be willing to employ the new standard. In addition 26% of the respondents stated that they are not sure about their willing to use the new standard and again only a very small percentage showed not interests in the new standard.
Results of Question 7 and 8 were used to improve the quality of the template and some valuable recommendations were integrated into the RFC.
The result: Our Request for Comments (RFC)
This is our draft of a RFC for the standardization of BioBrick part descriptions (PDF) . We intend to discuss this issue at the Jamboree with the whole iGEM community.

Fig.9 The concentration of inhibitor expressed by PBAD changes with different concentrations of inducer.
From this curve, we can clearly see the concentration of arabinose have positive relationship with protein intensity in a proper range.
The point of inducer’s concentration (0.003%) can cast on the protein intensity coordinate axis, and the corresponding intensity is about 24.42 units.
From all these, we can get the conclusion：Since the concentration of arabinose can affect the expression of inhibitor positively, and the concentration of inhibitor can decide the ""in-promoter's"" activity, we can say that by adding different concentrations of inducer could model the environments with different concentrations of inhibitor. Also the different concentration of the inhibitor will change the condition of ""in-promoter"" in the end.
·APPLICATION part·
Aim
To model the application situation of plasmid numbers losing on different levels and the relationship between the plasmids and ""in-promoter"".                                 Find out the threshold of plasmids number which can decide whether the killer gene expresses or not.
In the plasmids sensing system, in order to model the situation of plasmid losing on different levels, we need to simulate the change of substances under different conditions of plasmid numbers. In this system, a constitutive promoter is used to express the inhibitor under different plasmid numbers. Then the ""in-promoter"" will also be repressed by the inhibitor protein. The killer gene has been replaced by RFP (Fig. 1).
Fig.1 The circuit constructed to model the situation of plasmid numbers losing on different levels.
The concentration of inhibitors is positively correlated to the plasmid numbers since the constitutive promoter has a stable strength. Main considerations includes the processes of transcription, translation, repression, the effects of products and the number of plasmids. We also considered reversible reactions as well as the production and degradation of substances.
Fig.2 The inhibitor protein will repressor the expression of ""in-promoter"" and RFP.
The assumptions we made are:
(1) The constitutive promoter can constitutively express the inhibitor
(2) The expression of DNA sequence is directly proportional to the plasmid numbers in a specific range
(3) In a single cell, when the concentration of killer protein reaches a threshold, the cell will be eliminated
(4) Too many plasmids will cause the RNA polymerase and the ribosome overloaded.
(5) Because the rate of transcription is much faster than the rate of the translation, we think the rate-limiting step is"

The inserts LacI <partinfo>BBa_C0012</partinfo> and constitutive promoter <partinfo>BBa_J23119</partinfo> were run on gel after the restriction digest.  The problem with the constitutive promoter is that it is only 35 b.p long, and is therefore difficult to use as an insert. We tried to stop the gel early to see if we could detect the constitutive promoter, but we could not see anything at all. We therefore ran the gel further and cut the LacI <partinfo>BBa_C0012</partinfo> out of the gel.
Gel picture of the two inserts ran on gel. Used two different ladders. To the left we used a 1kb ladder to identify the Lac I insert, and to the right we used a 50 kb ladder to identify the constitutive promoter. Expected the LacI band to be approximately 1100 bp which seems to be about right. The constitutive promoter was expected to be 35 bp, but was not detected on the gel at all.

Background
As detailed on our background page, the main focus of our project is protecting photosynthetic organisms against rising UV Radiation. We came up with three main specific applications: protecting wild cyanobacteria at the poles, shielding plants (mainly crops), and creating resistant cyanobacteria for the use of biofuels. Each of these uses brought its own set of questions that we tried to answer over the summer:
How do you get approval, nationally and internationally, for a genetically modified organism?
Is it possible to release a genetically modified organism into the wild?
Are each of these applications feasible and important?
Initial Talks
At the very beginning of the summer, we spoke to Dr. Himadri Pakrasi, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies photosynthetic processes in Cyanobacteria. At this point, our project only included three of the four genes: Dsup, phrAT, and uvsE. Our project also focused on our first application, protecting polar cyanobacteria. He pointed out first of all that testing our genes only against natural E. Coli defenses would not be very effective. This was because photosynthetic organisms exist naturally in light, and so have evolved much stronger UV radiation resistance.
He pointed out however, that just because they are naturally resistant did not mean that the systems were perfect, and any increase in protection would be useful. He suggested to us to use a control to account for cyanobacterial resistance. To accomplish this, we added the gene phrAC to our list, and decided to try to transform and test our genes in cyanobacteria. He also suggested that we look into genetically modified plants, since there is a much larger infrastructure for that kind of genetic modification.
Industry Visits
Later in the summer, we visited the St. Louis facilities of Monsanto and Pfizer. We were able to see closely the use of genetic engineering in industry, for agricultural and pharmaceutical purposes. After the tour at Monsanto, we were fortunate to have a group of scientists listen to our project and give advice. Our original project design used GFP as a reporter gene,"

According to the above mechanism, we make the two e-oscillators pass the parameters and affect each other. In terms of the transfer function, with the enhancement of the light intensity, the expression of lacI will reduce, which is proportional to the other e-oscillator’s light intensity. It means that the illumination intensity of e-oscillator 2 will decrease and the corresponding lacI will increase. Then lacI will also be inversely linked to the e-oscillator 1. With the circulation and regulation, the two e-oscillator will be coupled or synchronized gradually.
To achieve the process of coupling or synchronization, we write programs in MATLAB and get the simulation result shown in video 1.
video 1. Simulation result of virtual-virtual coupling.
Mixed-reality of physics
In the second stage, LED lamp controlled by single-chip replace the fluorescence released by E.coli. Based on the virtual-virtual coupling, LED will glow following one of the e-oscillators simulated above as the physical real part, while the other e-oscillator will be the virtual part.
Through a camera, intensity of LED will be transfer to computer and affect the e-oscillator. The returned value of e-oscillator will also be passed to the physical real part by single-chip. With the interaction, the two parts will get coupled in the end. The details of connecting device are specified in our Interface Hardware part.
Figure 4. The complete design of physical device.
We program scripts in Python with an embedded code in MATLAB(You can click here to download the codes). And then we put the LED lamp and camera in dark place and run the program. We get the simulation result in Video 2.

Oscillator 1 is the dynamic trajectory of e-oscillator in computer, while Oscillator 2 represents the state of LED. The blue square in the upper right corner is the light intensity image of LED observed by camera(we only read the B values of RGB). As you can see, the brightness of blue changes following the interaction. Besides, the small box in the upper left corner shows the facade of LED lamp, which is manually shot by us in dark environment. From the oscillation images, we can find that the virtual part and the physical real part get synchronized gradually.

Assuming that all functional bacteria (including the target functional gene plastids) have been successfully established, it is estimated that the culture of one test tube (5 mL) can produce 90 test papers, in order to calculate the cost.( We took Thermofisher company, Meru company, Kingtec company, and Sigma-Aldrich company as references.)

Apart from the mass production cost, the total capital investment includes other expenses. For example, the ISBL investment includes the direct and indirect field when installing the equipment. As for the OSBL investment, we did not account for capital investment because it will be included in OEM charges. Since we will do mass production through OEM, the engineering cost was low.

Rewrote the DocumentListener for Sequence View.  For now, I think the sequence view is finished:
I fixed a lot of highlighting issues, and I would argue that the highlighting behaves better than comparable features in ApE.  I plan on writing documentation in the wiki over the weekend.  I should probably also comment the code.
On a different note, I had a good conversation with Viktor today about the Clotho use case.  I feel like I need to have more similar conversations to better understand where Clotho should go.

Doug came back to Boston today; just in time to deliver what he claims to be enough work to make all of us nervous about taking vacations.  Luckily for me, Boston is my vacation in  a sense.
I finished a number of upgrades to Sequence View today along with a number of bug fixes.  I also finished the accompanying documentation .  The tool should be ready for testing by the wet lab team.
I still need to make a presentation and generate a timeline for tomorrow's meeting. I still need to decide what I would like to do next month.  Most likely I'll work on cleaning up the ide dashboard or fabdash.  I want the dry lab team to start using the fabdash exclusively.  I hope to convince the rest of the team about my vision of Clotho.  I should probably clean up the Tool App Browser a bit, so I can begin to convince Doug that the older dashboard is unnecessary.
For tomorrow, I'll be presenting this powerpoint.  A pdf version is provided File:6-20JointMeeting.pdf

I will be covering the following points today at the joint meeting between the wetlab and the drylab team:

Planning new Clotho Interface
Learning Java Swing- graphic user interface design
How it Fits I am writing code for the following reasons:
iGEM software tools are Clotho apps
Wetware team will use Clotho tools to make work easier
No one will use a tool if its difficult to use

Dissecting cheaters
Our experience with the cheating bacteria began when we realized that a mutation was produced in the Bac2 construction (that consisted of the groE promoter fused to the coding sequence AsRed2). We used to grow them all over the weekend in the orbital shaker that was supposedly at 37ºC. The real temperature of the shaker in the Valencia hot summer was about 39ºC. Since Bac2 has a promoter that is sensitive to heat shock (the transcription starts when the temperature is higher than 37ºC), this high temperature was mimicking the “Are you hot?” question. In other words, the cultures were “being asked” continuously because of this high temperature. This led to mutant selection and our mutants were found to lack Bac2 inserts (Figure 1), and exhibited larger molecular weights on a native electrophoresis (Figure 2), suggesting that the inserts were lost and that two plasmids without inserts were relegated in the mutant clones.

Figure 2. Plasmids isolated from ""honest"" (Bac2, lanes 2 and 3) and ""cheater"" (lanes 4 and 5) bacteria. DNA ladder: GeneRuler 1kb (lane 1).
Experimental evolution
We decided to isolate and characterize those mutants “cheaters” and compare them with standard, “honest” clones. We compared their behavior in terms of growth in ampicillin-containing medium and we also performed experimental evolution tests. We started by comparing the growth of the original Bac2 strain and the cheaters, at different concentrations of antibiotic.

Vanderbilt,2015,Team:Vanderbilt#Project#Sequence_-_-_TEXT.html," codons had fewer hotspots than the other. In response to this setback, we made substantial revisions to the algorithm, this time factoring in ""limiting codons"" instead of standard CAI values. These limiting codons are from tRNAs of exceptionally low abundance in an organism, although varying definitions exist for how low the abundance must be for this classification.
Using this new approach based on limiting codons instead of CAI, we were able to increase the expression of our UV-optimized by 200%. Upon further research and refinement of our definition of what constitutes a limiting codon, in addition to re-introducing a CAI-like metric to the mutation optimization algorithm's decision making process, we were able to further significantly increase expression, reaching levels close to but slightly below the RFP E1010 sequence on the Registry. Through our collaboration with the iGEM team at the University of Washington St. Louis, we have achieved an independent replication of our results, under a range of IPTG inducer concentrations.
These findings have vastly improved the expression of our optimized genes, and in the process has revealed some insights into the correlation of metrics like CAI and limiting codons to actual gene expression. With further refinement of our algorithm's criteria, it is reasonable to expect that we will be able to continue this ever-improving trend, and constantly produce genes with comparable expression to ones optimized by traditional methods.
Interestingly, the differences in expression between our most recent iterations of mutation-optimized genes and their traditionally optimized versions are not directly attributable to CAI. When CAI scores are calculated for mutation-optimized and traditionally optimized sequences, they rarely differ. As an example, the figure below shows a graphical representation of the CAI for comparison with our mutation-optimized sequences.

Hence another subproject of our team is the integration of the Violacein pathway into the peroxisome ( Violacein ), we were already supplied with all necessary enzymes − VioA, VioB and VioE.
Figure 1.8: Pathway leading to the production of prodeoxyviolacein − the assay is based on the green color to identify colonies without functional import mechanism.
The figure above shows the principles of the assay. VioA and VioB are localized in the cytosol and lead to the production of the IPA imine dimer while VioE is tagged with a PTS1 variant. Successful import leads to white colonies whereas missing import results in green colonies due to the cytosolic production of prodeoxyviolacein.
Our rests upon the following two plasmids which are co-transformed into yeast.
Figure 1.9: Plasmids used for Violacein assay. The left one carries the coding sequence for the Pex5 variant, VioA and VioB whereas the right one contains the gene for VioE plus the attached PTS1 variant.
As shown above, we created one plasmid containing VioA, VioB and one of our Pex5 variants while the other plasmid only contained VioE. We then designed primers which bind to the VioE plasmid to amplify the whole plasmid except the terminator − random PTS1 variants were attached to VioE with the help of a random primer library. Following up, we did the ligation with the corresponding terminator and obtained a mix of several different VioE-PTS1 plasmids.
After plasmid amplification in Escherichia coli we then co-transformed yeast with the two constructs and waited for the colonies to grow. With the yeast growing, prodeoxyviolacein should be produced in yeast cells with absent import (green color) and the IPA imine dimer (white color) should be produced in those with functional import.
Plasmid preparation of those with white color and subsequent sequencing leads to the identification of functional PTS1 variants. Afterwards, we repeat the cloning steps described before to obtain a mTurquoise−PTS1* construct and co-transform it with the corresponding Pex5 variant. Eventually, the correct localization of mTurquoise tagged with these PTS1 variants provides proof for its function.

Then we visited their advanced laboratories and animal testing centers within a hospital and found an opportunity to learn about different methods used in their studies. They notified that they could help us with experiments and provide us technical support if we need. In the evening we participated to the dinner served in the animal testing center. In the friendly atmosphere we continued the discussion with professors and found an opportunity to take answers directly from the specialists. With a mutual intensive and effective discussion we could successfully complete our first introducing experience.

After analyzing this year’s projects at iGEM, we thought of ‘’If only there were short and concrete abstracts of these studies’’ and decided to put it into practice and made the Secret Book of Fatih Medical.

Our 2011 Fatih Turkey iGEM team did introducing presentations at various high schools. One of those shools; Ahmet Ulusoy high school participated in iGEM HS as AUC Turkey team and returned with iGEMers prise from America. This year AUC Turkey attended our Fatih Medical’s educational meetings. These guys; taking a huge interest in Synthetic Biology and iGEM studies, accompanied us and shared the same laboratuary while doing experiments and other research processes. They continued their studies and learned a lot especially under the consultancy of our team member Mustafa Semih Elitok. The award recieved as a result of intensive work delighted us at least as them. We hope that in next years we will hear of them with more wonderful  news.
Presentation Days
We began our presentations about iGEM and our project during our lab works to domestic and foreign guests who visited our university. Our first opportunity to address a large audience with our project we had in Dışkapı Education and Research Hospital. There, we encountered interesting questions about iGEM and our project from specialists from various disciplines and we could also find answers to important points where we had some doubts.  In the first week of the academic year we introduced iGEM to the newly came 1st grade students. During this presentation we had the chance to introduce the projects of the iGEM Teams Frankfurt and Freiburg 2012. While answering the questions about our project we also conducted our survey. At the end of our presentations there were generally many young students who were very motivated for synthetic biology and wanted to be a part of the next iGEM Team.

Chromosome replication is governed by DnaA and is regulated by nutrient availability and also Soj. Cell division is regulated by the formation of FtsZ in mid-cell, leading to the formation the divisome.
The paper, Metabolism, cell growth and the bacterial cell cycle, provides nice diagrams on the process.

Safety
safety concerns
As a software team, our team does not produce any typical biological safety or ethnic issues. However, we still take safety into account from as many aspects as possible:
1. Safety for programmers
Most of our work is mainly done in front of computers, which is not ergonomically to programmers as working in such environment may cause much exhaust and stress. Therefore, we made a series of regulations to guarantee they are not exposed to computers constantly for too long time and recreational area is within 10 meters. What is more, every time our programmers go to web labs, we make sure that there would be safety equipment as well as accompanies for them.
2. Safety for public
We are aware what our software will bring to teenagers or youngsters, and our software is ensured that no violent or sexual scene or content is included. We also did a lot of work to estimate and reduce the possible errors or faults users may encounter in the future.
3.Safety for software
To better protect our intellectual property rights, we have consulted IPRs centre of USTC in case of future problem. We will restrict the use of our software and we will apply for a patent later.
4.Safety for campus
We are quite aware when we perform our work or lecture in campus, and no disorder or turbulence has shown during in the above activity.
5.Other safety concerns
(i) Our team made no new BioBrick parts (or devices), and no safety issues happened from this. (ii)No biosafety group or committee protested our project.
Suggestions for future development of safety in dry lab.
Although a lot of work is done to ensure the safety of programmers in dry lab, a lot of work still remains to be done. And here we present some brief ideas on how we can develop the safety for programmers.
1. In many conditions, programmers in a dry lab have to share places with experiment operators due to limited space, which may lead to underlying health problems. Therefore, we"

2. Manchester
With the team Manchester , our team has participated in the project of compiling legal and administrative regulations upon GMMs. In this project, 2~3 teams from each continent were allocated to answer 7 questions about the regulation (i.e., What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?). Us KUAS_Korea have addressed the answers via information provided from Korea Biosafety Clearing House, the government agency regulating the biosafety and GMOs. Additionally, we were designated to summarize the answers to the second question; Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis? We anticipate that this project will comfort many teams from IGEM and other stakeholders to easily inquire concurrent trends of GMM regulations from many different nations.
In the course of our investigation and comparing Korea’s regulation with other nations, we have discovered some legislation deficiencies. Thus, we decided to get in touch with the member of Congress who belongs to the biosafety committee. Further information is elaborated on the human practice page of team KUAS_Korea.

Our human practice project includes two themes addressing many very different questions. The first ones are about various intellectual property issues. The other theme relates to the popularization of sciences and more specifically to our contribution to the researchers’ night.
We have chosen to divide the theme ""intellectual property"" into two parts because this theme is the main part of our reflexion and it required a longer development, but also because we collaborated with the University of British Columbia on this theme and an entire part seemed necessary to explain our work. As a summary : the first part deals with the intellectual property rights inference towards the iGEM contest and is made up by a reflexion on the economic challenges the synthetic biology industry faces. The second one sums up our collaborative work on the intellectual property with the UBC iGEM team. And the third one quickly presents our scientific popularization involvement.
Part I: Intellectual property issues
Introduction
Free knowledge sharing is part of the foundational principles of the iGEM contest. Consequently, protecting the possible commercial uses of the iGEM team members’ projects seems difficultly feasible by common ways (especially patents and copyrights). However, the intellectual property rights in general and patents in particular are commonly known to be the only way to promote innovation in a profit-making logic: if companies cannot secure the economic outcome of their investments in R&D, they will not invest in it. A simple conclusion could then easily be drawn from these very statements:iGEM projects would be unlikely to be industrially and commercially developed, to the extent that it would be difficult for companies to capture the economic returns of their investments.
Nonetheless, the decision of opening an iGEM entrepreneurship division, whose objectives are clearly to optimize the economic opportunities given by the performing iGEM innovation system, vigorously shook that very last conclusion.
The aim of this human practice project is to show that patents are not the only way, not even always the best mean to promote innovation. Viable alternative models do exist, such as the ""Common's system"", which will be discussed further on. We will assume the iGEM team members form a commons similar to the Open Source community of the IT sector to strike up a reflexion on the development of alternate economic solutions to patents.
We will most notably refer to both Joseph Stiglitz’s (Nobel prize in economics in 2001"

The graph above shows our expericence to the HKUST, we two teams had a wonderful communication, and we became good friends.
to high school students
The two figures shown behind were the recordings of our journey to the ShenZhen experimental high school and ShenZhen foreign language high school. We had introduced the concept of the synthetic biology, IGEM, and our project to them, which was welcomed by them!
to adults
On Sept.25.2013 Jingyi Liu had a short presentation about synthetic biology and iGem in Wall Street English center at windows of the world in Shen Zhen. Since most of students there are in theri twenties or thirties, we spreaded new ideas in synthetic biology to adults~! They showed big interest in synthetic biology and even came up with their own thoughts during the presentation. What's more, after presentation, though they didn't konw any specialized word, many of them still stayed with Liu discussing about biology with body language till 10 p.m.. It was a amazing moment to make so many people curious in synthetic biology, and it was a even better moment to let them comprehend synthetic biology.

We made samples from the Killer Red BL21DE3, Killer Orange BL21DE3 and plasmid backbone RFP DH5α cultures at dilution factors of 10-3,10-4 and 10-5 and exposed to light in the light box. A duplicate set was kept in the dark room. We measured the temperature inside the light box to be 37oC. After exposure, we spread plate all the samples.

Today, we had a meeting with Ryan Edginton, one of our instructors, in regards to the wiki. He gave us feedback on what had been done so far - credit to Andy, Alan and Joel for coding - and talked with us about what we still needed to do to meet medal requirements for the wiki. It’s definitely coming along though, and has improved significantly in the last few weeks compared to the initial design.
Andy has been making progress on a ‘Log’ page for the wiki, on which these day to day entries will be featured. The current design has an interactive calendar which uses a colour code to show which days have log entries and vlog entries, and allows visitors to click through to each day with ease.
Due to the upcoming bank holiday weekend, very little lab work could be done today. CFUs were measured for spread plates that were exposed to light yesterday, and concentrations of the DNAse1 miniprep were taken so it can now be sent off for sequencing. Glycerol stocks were made of Killer Red 3 in DH5α and Lysozyme in BL21DE3.

We mailed the Killer Orange spread plate to the Glasgow iGEM team for the collaboration, and they’ll be posting the Z1 lac-repressor E. coli strains to us tomorrow morning. Dr Tom Ellis responded to an email from Jack, giving his definition of a kill switch and bringing up potential ways to build upon the project if more time was available (like constructing an almost 100% efficient operon system).
Joel designed a title banner for the wiki over the weekend which incorporated our colour scheme, logo and title (pictured just below).

Introduction
Team Vilnius-Lithuania aims to use the PURE cell free system [1] in order to integrate proteins into the membrane of the liposome from the inside. The BamA complex is responsible for integrating these proteins; OmpA and lgA hence in order to ensure quick integration BamA needs to be consistently present at high levels throughout the expression of OmpA and lgA. This mechanistic model aims to examine the simultaneous expression of these proteins and compare the results obtained from different starting parameters, primarily different starting volumes of bamA RNA in order to quantify the effectiveness of an initial addition of RNA to ensure fast production of BamA.
Mass Action Equations
Mass Action Equations are commonly used to represent chemical reactions and provide a starting point for mechanistic modelling of a variety of phenomena. The laws of mass action state that the rate of any chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the masses of the reacting substances, with each mass raised to a power equal to the coefficient that occurs in the chemical equation [2]. The mass action equations in Figure 1 can be used to represent protein expression:
Each of these equations is used in triplicate to represent expression of BamA, OmpA and lgA respectively and from these mass action equations a system of ordinary differential equations can be derived.
Ordinary Differential Equations
The model uses a simple set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):
In order to solve this system it is first necessary to derive values for all the parameters used:
copiesBamA, copiesOmpA, copieslgA - Number of plasmid copies - In order to take into account the effect of different starting masses of DNA for BamA, OmpA and lgA it is neccesary to calculate the number of plasmids present from which each protein may be expressed. DNA added to the PURE system should be between 25 and 1000ng per reaction [1] and hence it was decided to screen over a number of values in this range. A single base pair has mass of 650 Daltons [3] hence it is possible to calculate mass in kDa of each plasmid with its particular insert"

Questionnaire
We decided to take a survey to know what those around us and the general public think about synthetic biology and genetic engineering technology.
We prepared the questionnaire on the Web not only in Japanese but also in English to gather opinions widely.
We spread the URL to access the format to answer by utilizing SNS such as Facebook.
We would like to appreciate all the people who answered the questionnaire.
By 5 p.m. on 17th of October, we received 410 replies in Japanese version and 161 replies in English version.
We obtained cooperation from iGEM UI Indonesia. Thus especially many responses from Indonesia were received. We answered the questionnaire from iGEM UI Indonesia.
The results of the survey are shown below.
The green pie charts show the results of all responses, the blue ones show those of JAPANESE version, and the red ones show those of ENGLISH version.
The results of ENGLISH version include responses from following countries.
Q1 : What kind of image do you have of “genetic modification”?
The most common answer is “Amazing”. The second one is “Advanced”. Many people have positive image for genetic modification.
Q2 : What kind of image do you have of “Escherichia. Coli”?
The most common answer is “Good for science”, but second one is “Dirty”. The result from Q1, people have positive impression for genetic modification, but the impression of E.coli is negative. It indicates that the fact E.coli used at genetic modification is not known very well.
Q3 : What do you use to exterminate cockroach?
The most people used a bug bump to exterminate cockroaches. It means that people ask for fast-acting pesticide.
Q4 : What kind of image do you have of insecticide?
Japanese people more generally have that insecticide is useful compared with foreign people. Japanese people may have little awareness about environment or influence of insecticide.
Q5 : What do you think about exterminating cockroach with E. coli?
The most people are interested in exterminating cockroaches by E. coli.  This survey indicates that the synthetic biology application resolving daily life problem such as our project, Exterminator coli, would help us to promote better understanding for general people who have negative impression against E. coli and/or synthetic"
Utah_State,2014,Team:Utah State#Results#Chlorophylasse_-_-_TEXT.html,"CHL. This amplified product was cloned into pSB1C3 and is designated as BBa_K1418001.  By removing the stop codon, in frame fusions on the 3' end of the gene can be performed.  Part BBa_K1418001 was then cloned behind a lac inducible promoter and a ribosome binding site (K208010 contains both R0010 and B0034).  To aid in protein purification, a 10x histidine tag with two transcriptional terminators was cloned in frame on the 3' end to generate the final composite construct, BBa_K1418002.
Chlorophyllase Purification
To test for protein production from the new BBa_K1418002 construct, protein purification using a nickel column was performed.  Using methods provided in our ""protocols"" section, cells containing BBa_K1418002 were grown overnight, pelleted and lysed.  After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to the nickel column.  Various samples throughout the purification process were analyzed using SDS-PAGE.  The SDS-PAGE below shows results from analysis of cells containing BBa_K1418002.
It can clearly be seen from the SDS-PAGE that a protein product between 25kDa and 37kDa has been purified using the nickel column. Since the expected size of our chlorophyllase product is 34 kDa, we are confident that we have purified the chlorophyllase protein!
Chlorophyll Extraction From Spinach Leaves
Chlorophyll was extracted from spinach leaves using a modified version of the one found in Arkus et. al., 2008.  Six spinach leaves were ground with a mortar and pestle.  Fifteen ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2 v/v) was added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.  The solution was then passed through a cheesecloth into a glass beaker.  Three ml’s of the solution was transferred to another glass bottle and 1 ml of chloroform with 1.8 ml of ddH2O were added.  The vial was shaken to mix and centrifuged to separate phases.  The upper aqueous phase was discarded and the lower organic phase was transferred to a new tube.  Two to three drops of ethanol were added to clarify solution and allowed to dry out in fume hood overnight.  The chlorophyll was resolubilized in 1 ml of acetone.  Concentration of chlorophyll"

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," system is so big, we needed to make some compromises - we didn’t think it was possible to attach all 10 of our pathway’s enzymes into these amphiphilic proteins, but decided to do it to two of the last enzymes: CAR and ADO. We chose these enzymes for two reasons, the first one being more significant. The product of CAR (and the substrate of ADO) is butyraldehyde, which is toxic to the cell. Therefore, if too much butyraldehyde is built up in the cell, our cells would die. Also, because of the toxicity, cells have many endogenous enzymes that consume butyraldehyde, thus reducing the amount of available butyraldehyde to be converted into propane by ADO. Our second reason has to do with our models suggesting that ADO is a bottleneck in our system. Therefore we would like to try to keep its substrate concentration high in the close proximity of ADO, so that it can function as efficiently as possible.
Our modelers built a model with Python to test our hypothesis about the close proximity of our enzymes, and it resulted in 200-400% increase in the final propane yield. Check out our Synergy Model page to read more about this.
In the situation where CAR and ADO are fused with the amphiphilic proteins, we expect the amphiphilic proteins to form micelles rather than membranes, as the enzymes will most probably repulse each other. This is why we are calling the system amphiphilic micelles, but in reality it doesn’t matter to us whether the formations are micelles or membranes because the enzymes will nevertheless be closer together in both formations.
We wanted to test our hypotheses with something we could easily detect. We found the Violacein pathway, which could by the use of three enzymes produce a detectable green color. We believe that if the violacein green color production could be enhanced by fusing these enzymes with the amphiphilic proteins, we could have an idea of whether the propane production could as well be enhanced in a similar way. There are obviously differences between these systems, but it would give us a rough estimate of whether these types of constructs would be possible to build in the first place.
Constructs
Assembly Methods
Both two of our propane plasmids and our cellulose plasmid were constructed with homologous pairing. Our main approach was Gibson Assembly which is based on > 25 bp homologous regions between each piece that we want to combine.

Many students were fascinated to know how working in a laboratory actually looks like. In school you usually never perform restriction digests or ligations thus students have only some theoretical knowledge about biotechnology but cannot imagine how “digesting” or “ligating” some DNA-strands looks like. Therefore, many were flabbergasted when they heard that we basically pipet some clear fluids into a tube and simply give the enzymes some time to work. In the end we put that clear fluid containing tube into the lab-freezer and call it a day. Only very seldomly we see some colorful fluids, however, there are no other impressive effects in today’s molecular biology laboratories.
In order to top our lesson off we handed out fresh strawberries, bananas, and kiwi to the students. We had prepared mortars, salt, water, washing-up liquid, filters, tubes, funnels, and alcohol beforehand and while we were monitoring the students perform their first DNA-extraction we tried to explain the function of each reagent.
We believe that the students really enjoyed our unusual visit and we hope that they will never forget about the very basic concepts of biology we briefly recapped on that beautiful Thursday morning. All in all, we did not want to proselytize but rather inform the students so that they can form a well-founded opinion about genetic engineering.

Heading into my second undergraduate year, I can undoubtedly say that the past few months have helped put my academic knowledge into context. I held various roles this summer, but was ultimately in charge of qualitative modelling using Autodesk Maya. This has been my first year with iGEM; the exposure to various disciplines has allowed me to see the interconnectivity between synthetic biology, engineering, and business.

Missouri_Miners,2010,Team:Missouri Miners#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," electron shuttling genes from an anaerobic bacteria, Geobacter sulfurreducens, to an aerobic bacteria, Escherichia coli, so as to facilitate MFC research in an aerobic environment.
In older, more traditional designs, MFCs have been limited by the surface area of the anode. The bacteria must make contact with the anode so the electrons can be harvested to power a device. In our new designs, we modeled our work after research conducted by Dr. Bradley R. Ringeisen, Ricky Ray, and Brenda Little at the Naval Research Labs in Washington D.C. The goal of the new design is to maximize anode surface area by using high surface area carbon materials and keeping a very large anode to membrane surface area ratio. In the Mini-MFC design, the limiting factor is the membrane surface area and permeability, not the anode surface area.
To create even larger surface areas for the anode we contacted materials specialists at the Leventis Lab at Missouri S&T. We are using glassy carbon aerogels as anode materials instead of the traditional carbon or graphite felt.

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Innovation HP_-_-_TEXT.html," a survey by questionnaire. Other team often uses the questionnaire, too. Our innovation is quite unique. The idea was to set “Crowd funding”.  Our milestone for our budget from funding was set up to ￥200,000. Fortunately, we got the amount summed up to ￥310, 200. This achievement clearly shows that we had fund-raisers more than we had expected. We had public consensus that our project is worth supporting. This type of activity seems unique in terms of not only the amount of raised fund, but also realization that so many public audiences support us. In Japan, only Nagahama team was successful in setting up “ Crowd funding” and achieving the milestone. We thought that this action is innovation.

After lyophilization, we added 500 μL PBS in each centrifuge tube, and put them in 37°C shaker culture for 15mins. We also added 500 μL DDW in each centrifuge tube. And then, we took 100 μL the dilute bacteria liquid, added in 900 μL ddH《》, repeated the step, and carried out gradient dilution to 104, 105, 106. Then, we picked 200 μL dilute bacteria liquid, and coated the plate with chloramphenicol.
Figure 10. gradient dilution.
The results showed that CAHS protein could improve the preservation effect of freeze-drying bacteria significantly!
The B+ group's CFU is 100 times higher than the B0 group, 30 times better than the B- group. So we think the CAHS is leaking expression in B- group, which has some of the protection for the bacteria in freeze-drying.
After being irradiated by UV for 1min, the B0 group was nearly fully dead, and the CFU of B- group had been decrease to a very low level, while the B+ group was higher. So we think the CAHS is can provide some of certain protection against UV.
Figure 11. The CFU of BL21. (B0 is E.coli BL21 without BBa_K2623014, B+ is E.coli BL21 with BBa_K2623014 and IPTG, B- is E.coli BL21 with BBa_K2623014, UV means the desiccant bacterial under UV for 1min.)
This result shows that the CAHS can provide production for bacteria in freeze-drying. And the CAHS can also provide CAHS for bacteria suffering from UV. We think the CAHS protein is a very potential protective agent, so we can use the CAHS protein to store plasmid and bacteria. We can even design a kit for the bacteria storage with CAHS protein.
After being irradiated by UV for 1min, the B+ group was still alive. Therefore, we think the CAHS protein can provide protection for bacteria against UV and can protect the nucleic acid in the bacteria. The water bear can survive from UV, and the bacteria can also survive from UV, so it is certain the CAHS protein works.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,". The script then applies linear discriminant function analysis to this template dataset in order to create an equation system that classifies the different groups of data based on the mean signals at the five positions. The linear discriminant function is provided by the MASS package (Venables and Ripley, 2002) for the software environment R (R Core Team, 2017). This analysis method provides the linear combinations of the five mean values which best discriminates between reads of different groups, mainly by maximizing variance between reads of different groups and minimizing variance of reads of the same group (see Fisher, 1936, for this approach). By applying the resulting equation system to the very dataset the model was created with, a graphical representation of the classification is attainable. The number of dimensions is depending on the number of linear discriminants needed to discriminate all groups from each other. In most cases, two linear discriminants are sufficient, resulting in a two-dimensional dot-plot with one axis for each linear discriminant.
This approach is best described by taking a closer look at an example. Let us take aside the unnatural bases for a moment and consider that we wanted to create a model that is able to discriminate between the natural bases A, G, T and C at the position of interest in the sequence context presented in Figure 2. First of all, we take sequencing data of four different DNA samples, each one having a different natural base at the position of interest. With the help of iCG filter, the intividual sets of sequencing data are filtered for reads containing the region of interest. Now, the paths of each folder containing one of the four groups are passed to iCG model. Figure 4 shows the group means of the five positions (mean_0 to mean_5), the coefficients of three linear discriminants resulting from the linear discriminant analysis, and a two dimensional dot-plot showing the linear discriminants of the template dataset.
Fig. 4: Example output of iCG model.Group means, coefficients of linear discriminants, proportion of trace and dot-plot of linear discriminants as an exemplary result of a linear discriminant analysis of a template dataset containing sequencing reads with natural bases at the position of interest. The portion of traces indicates the effect of each linear discriminant regarding the discrimination of the different groups. In this particular example, first two linear discriminants are sufficient for classification, as the effect of the third linear discriminant is negligible.
One great challenge regarding the creation of a good statistical model is the quality of the template data used for the statistical analysis. Ideally, the template dataset should"
