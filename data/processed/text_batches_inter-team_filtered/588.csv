UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Gut_-_-_TEXT.html,"After carrying out the positive control, the mNARK-Lycopene cells were tested under conditions of simulated oxidative stress, with the LB media containing 2 mM copper (II) chloride. The results indicate that the mNARK-Lycopene device boots E. coli growth. Wild type E. coli grew to a final optical density of 0.35 after three hours, from an initial OD of 0.15. The mNARK-Lycopene progressed from an initial OD of 0.25 to a final OD of 0.60.
The BioBrick was then tested against simulated oxidative stress conditions of 50 and 100 µM sodium nitroprusside. Both of these experiments, again, indicate that, in the presence of simulate oxidative stress conditions, the mNARK-Lycopene promotes E. coli growth substantially better then the control. At 50 µM, the optical density of the wild type cells decreases to an OD of 0.05 from the initial reading of 0.17. In comparison, the mNARK-Lycopene cells achieved a final optical density of 0.33 from a low of 0.05. At the 100 µM concentration, the wild type cells flat lined, remaining at an optical density of 0.25, while the lycopene cell concentration increased substantially from an optical density of 0.07 to 0.45 after four hours of growth.
In summary, out analysis has shows that our mNARK-Lycopene device protects the cells from oxidative stress and, from this, we can assume that this effect will continue once our lycopene probiotic is consumed by and aging person. Additionally, it has been proved that the cells will be able to survive and multiply in the gut and colonise it. Therefore providing protection to neighbouring cells by ‘mopping up’ the oxidative stress.
After establishing that the mNARK-Lycopene device improves cells growth compared to wild type E. coli, the growth of the Lycopene cells was measured against lycopene expression.
First, the cells were grown in LB media with 2 mM copper (II) sulphate. As shown in the plot, the mNARK-Lycopene device reached a higher cell density of 0.57, which corresponds to an OD485 of 0.68. Wild type E. coli does not achieve such a cell density and, by extension, lycopene expression. From an initial cell density of 0.08, the wild type cells reach a maximum cell density of 0.34. Additionally, the"
UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#description_-_-_TEXT.html," to use a salt-induced promoter because this could function as a potential on-off switch, and (2) We introduced a flag tag that would turn off tagatose production if concentrations of intermediate metabolites became too large for the cyanobacteria to handle
3A Assembly and Genetic Manipulation
After we were done with each individual BioBrick construct and validated the enzymes via DNA sequencing and confirmation, we then decided to use 3A assembly to combine all the different enzymes into a single larger gene fragment.
Focus 4: Using a co-culture bioreactor design
Purposes of a Co-culture design
In order to have an industrially relevant solution, we also knew that we had to address the question of food vs. fuel. One popular trend in biofuel production, in particular, has been to use cyanobacteria directly for production. Combined with the idea that E. coli can be used for biofuel production (as shown by recent yields of ethanol and isobutanol), we decided that having a co-culture system would allow us to have a self-sustainable system since one organism could produce the feedstock and one of them could use that feedstock as the starting point of bio-production.
Considering the Parameters of Sustainability
At this point, we started considering the lifecycle of our proposed platform. We realized that the key to having to a successful platform would be to have a viable bioreactor design. After many consultations with local businesses involved in bioprocessing, we decided to use single-use, disposable bioreactors in order to keep small-scale operations and work at a reasonable rate. We also decided that in order to further reduce downstream production costs, we should genetically engineer the export of tagatose so that the microbes can keep producing without needing time for harvesting, which leads to decreased efficiency and increased costs of production.Click to learn more in the applied design section of our project.
Expanding Scope of Implementation
One potential application of our project is that standalone,  is provides a large-scale production method for unconventional carbon sources, some of which have nutritional value and additional health benefits. The current market for alternative synthetic sweeteners struggles with production scale issues, and the first phase of our platform can serve as an independent solution."

Lethbridge_HS,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," that Red Deer is implementing these pollinator parks, which to me is basically a ‘word of the day’. In the actual population of bees, putting in one or two or even ten of these one acre parks is not even going to do anything. We have 1800 acres of ‘bee park’ within the city. I think if we’re [going to get] the best bang for our buck, and we’re currently doing this, is reseeding the river valley with a native mix. We’re actually doing more than just focusing on one or two little parks around the city.
iGEM: Do you think that our idea would be sustainable?
Ryan: If it met certain parameters. The seed mix would have to be low growth, dry-land tolerant- we aren’t going to irrigate those boulevards. We currently don’t irrigate those roadways. It would have to be okay with the residents. It wouldn’t be something so drastic that they wouldn’t accept it and it would have to limit conflicts. So if we’re adding all of these flowers and people are getting stung left and right, we would have to take a look at it. So if we met all of those and looked at it systematically, we could come up with something.
iGEM: If we were to do this, what do you think members of the community would say?
Ryan: We would get varied opinions. Currently we are doing the river valley master plan. We are looking at what’s existing in the river valley, what needs to be changed, and what [needs to be done in the future]. Within that, we’re getting a variance of comments [from the community].
iGEM: If we did use flowers native to Southern Alberta, would it be as big of an issue with those who want it to be more natural?
Ryan: I don’t think so. I think that people are accepting of that. [It does take time] for people to accept it. Some people are going to complain, some might get really frustrated and write letters to the mayor. I think overall, it’s all in how you frame it. So I might frame it as there is a problem with bees. Bees help with everything from food production to everything else that they do. These are the steps that we’re taking to [help them]. [If you did this], I think you would get better acceptance.
iGEM: Would you see any further difficulties with this?
Ryan: The difficulty I see is that meeting with you, I can’t just go and implement this. So, if this is going"

We started our project in March, and we have three parts of experiment, basic circuits part, regulation part and Error-prone PCR part. Basic circuits part was finished by Zongzhi Lv's group (including Hui Luo) and Wenxin Bai's group (including Changxin Zhang and Jiaqi Xu), Regulation part was finished by Jinlin Li's group (including Jiadong Zhong and Pengcheng Zhang). Error-prone PCR was finished by Jing Yang's group(including Chengyi Li, Mingming Cao, Xiao Peng and Zeyan Li). The experiments of Regulation part consist of the construction and verification of two pH-induce promoters (P-atp2 and P-asr) and recombinase system. The main work of error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) gruop is to select different promoters by error-prone PCR. The duty of Basic circuits group is to construct our basic resistance sub-system and basic regulation system.
Week1 (Mar 16 -Mar 22)
We extracted the genome of Escherichia coli K12 strain and got the gene LdhA through PCR.
We have successfully got the genome of E.coli K-12 DH5α, preparing for the later use of cloning functional genes.
We have successfully got the functional gene glsA from the genome of E.coli K-12 DH5α by PCR, which encodes an acid-activated glutaminase.
Through digestion, ligation, transformation and cPCR, we have successfully selected the expected strain with glsA. The plasmid is pSB1A3.

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," in previous research was used to steadily increase the RBS strength of a gene, GFP mut3b, the expression of which was then characterized. Unexpectedly, expression level of proteins plateaued even as the RBS strength (and thus TIR) was increased. By using the RBS Calculator to increase the translation initiation rate, we can detect when the plateau occurs, which is called the ""maximum translation rate capacity."" Since this plateau occurs independently of TIR, it is theorized that it is due solely to translation elongation becoming a rate limiting step.  The design of the GFPs using only common and rare codons was based on the data in this table.
Codon Frequency
Number in % collumn shows the percent of time that the amino acid was coded for with a specific codon. More frequent codons have higher percentages.
Modified from Maloy, S., V. Stewart, and R. Taylor. 1996. Genetic analysis of pathogenic bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY.
To optimize for common degenerate codons, the most frequent codon for a specific amino acid was taken. To optimize for rare degenerate codons, the least frequent codon was taken. For example, if a codon in the original superfolder GFP coded for Phenylalanine, the codons UUU and UUC were available.  The frequencies of these were taken from the table (UUU-.51, UUC-.59). For common GFP, UUU was used whenever Phenylalanine was desired, because it had the highest frequency. For rare GFP, UUC was used. Because all codons were found to be either common or rare for E. coli, the common and rare optimized genes had zero commonality. Tryptophan is the only amino acid coded by one codon, but it does not appear in superfolder GFP.
Result of common/rare optimization is two coding sequences with zero commonality.
In another recent project, all the genes (coding DNA sequences) of E. coli are divided into five groups based on the naturally occurring TIR, from lowest to highest. Then, the codon usage profile of each group of genes is statistically analyzed to determine whether a codon is slow or fast. A fast codon is defined as one with high correlation between TIR and its frequency. Otherwise, it is a slow codon.  It is hypothesized that the groups of CDS with high TIR will hold more “fast” codons, which will lead to higher translation elongation rate and thus higher protein expression, whereas the slow regions will hold more"

Degredo PETronum!
ABSTRACT
The usage of polyethylene  terephthalate-PET (as like plastic bottles or textiles)  is one of the big problems of our era. Many plastic bottles are not reusable and are not safe for hot liquids or for use in dishwashers or microwaves. Some tougher, reusable plastic bottles may cause cancer. The main disadvantage of plastic bottles is that so many of them end up in landfills instead of being recycled. It takes thousands of years for plastic bottles to biodegrade, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air. We may alter the destiny of plastic in useful way.
Our Abstract in French!
Degrado PETronum La présence de poly-téréphtalate d'éthylène (PET) dans le plastique, comme celui des bouteilles, est l’un des problèmes majeurs de notre époque. La plupart des bouteilles plastiques ne sont pas réutilisables. Et les plus robustes, réutilisables, pourraient être impliquées dans des cancers. Le principal inconvénient des bouteilles en plastique est que nombre d'entre elles finissent dans les décharges au lieu d'être recyclées. Il faut plusieurs centaines d’années pour que ces bouteilles se dégradent,et leur dégradation est à l’origine d’émission de toxine dans l’air. Grâce à ce projet, l’environnement serait débarrassé des PET tout en produisant du pyruvate qu'E.coli serait capable d’utiliser comme source de d’énergie en l’incorporant à son cycle cellulaire. Nous allons dégrader le PET en catéchol. Puis, ce catéchol résultera en pyruvate par le 2-hydroxymuconate.
OUR MISSION
Our project aims to clean enviroment with the degredation of PET to pyruvate by E.coli. With this project,while  the environment will be cleaned from PET"

Week 25th -31th July
This week we started the kombucha growing for the Imperial Protocol reproduction. We are redoing the protocol from their 2014 team to test for the binding of the Cellulose Binding Domains that we are using.
We are carrying out a similar protocol to the one we can find at https://2014.igem.org/Team:Imperial/Protocols
Such experiment aims to measure the affinity of the CBD to the cellulose after several washes with different solutions. The affinity is measured by reading the fluorescence of the Green Fluorescent Protein, GFP, fused with the CBD. The difference between the fluorescence before and after the washes can give a reference of the affinity of the Cellulose Binding Domain under different conditions of media.
We are also testing more washing solutions, such toluene and grape extract in addition to those tested by the Imperial College iGEM team, since they are more related with our future experiments.
This experiment aims to improve the available data regarding the part BBa_K1321357, submitted by iGEM imperial College team in 2014, and also to generate data and compare affinity of the GFP-CBD and the future proteins that we will fuse with CBD in our project"

Third
From the June 24th to the June 29th, We provided parts BBa_C0061 and BBa_I0462 to the Toulouse iGEM team due to the high transform difficulty they described using this year’s distribution. Toulouse could directly use them for their cloning ,while we got some valuable feedback about our parts.
Fourth
On the summer vacation, we drew a doodle about 2013 iGEM in Furong tunnel in the campus with the members of software team of our university. This tunnel is not only a main stem but also a famous scenic spots, so that more than 30,000 people per day will pass by and look our doodle. In addition, the doodle is a quite novel approach to introduce synthetic biology and we believe that no team did it before.
We also held a garden party with software team where introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to 200 students of senior high school from the whole Fujian Province. Go to page…to see more
In the wet lab, we helped them to structure their plasmids, such as teaching how to ligate and digest.
Fifth
We've also had a really good communication with the iGEM team of Peking University. From August 11th to August 19th ,one of our team members went to Peking University to get a deep cooperation with them. Firstly we introduced our own project in this year and exchanged the opinions .They gave us some good suggestions in experiments and models. What’s more, they gave us one BioBrick of sfGFP (pSB1A3-RBS-sfgfp-TT), which gave a great help to our structure. This sfGFP allowed our circuit to generate a brighter fluorescence and made it easier to observe in the microfluidics.
Sixth
We had a short meeting with 4 members of NJU iGEM team visiting us on June24th, 2013. We welcomed all other visitors as well. During the meeting, we introduced our project this year to these visitors and exchanged some opinions with them. It can improve the connection and collaboration between different iGEM teams in China.

This are the results of real-time PCR.
These three graphs show that our sgRNAs has successfully activated the three genes                                         that mentioned before.
As for the cAMP-activated reporter gene system, we choose Forskolin to induce expression                                         of the reporter gene, and expression of the reporter protein luciferase was confirmed                                         by treatment with 10 millimole（mM）forskolin.
After a 24 h incubation, cracked the cell and added the substrate reacting with luciferase,                                         then detected it by fluorescent microplate reader. Here is the data we got. Cells                                         expressing luciferase treated only with 0.1%DMSO was used as a negative control.                                         We can see that the luminescence data gets significantly improved, which proves that                                         the reporter gene we choose is available.
Here comes the most essential experiment. We infected the stable cell lines with                                         all virus to construct a super cell line, which has a high expression of the three                                         genes. Then we transfected OR1A1 and OR1D2 respectively in the super cell, and stimulated                                         with β-citronellol and bourgeonal, which can recognized by OR1A1 and OR1D2 respectively."

with the substrate concentration S, the Monod constant KS and the maximal specific growth rate µmax ( Monod, 1949 ). Because LB medium is a complex medium we cannot measure the substrate concentration so we have to assume an imaginary substrate concentration. Due to the diauxic growth two different substrates with different Monod constants and consumption rates are necessary to model the cell growth. The amount of a substrate S can be modelled as follows

The specific BPA degradation rate per cell qD is modelled with an equation like eq. (3). In the beginning of the cultivations, when E. coli growths on the ""good"" imaginary substrate S1, no BPA degradation is observed. When this substrate is consumed, the BPA degradation starts. The model for this diauxic behavior is as follows:

SYSU-China,2013,Team:SYSU-China#Project#Future work_-_-_TEXT.html," the leakage expression of suicide gene. By controlling the dosage of doxycycline or even change a whole new switch system and prepare for alternative suicide gene, such concerns might be overcome.  Actually, this is one of our on-going work to confirm the pluripotency of iPSCs with the pathway. We will perform the teratoma test in miPSCs and hiPSCs to examine the pluripotency of iPSCs.
Directional differentiation from iPSCs to hepatocytes
This test provides a direct way to prove that our pathway can successfully increase the efficiency of directional differentiation. Since the pathway responsible for hepatocytes differentiation remains a mystery, we do not know if the pathway might crosstalk with relative endogenous pathway although theoretically this would not happen because the Tetsystem is independent to the human signaling pathway. To perform this test, we need extra training in inducing directional differentiating cells from iPSCs which is still a technical barrier for us. However, if the above experiments go well, we can have a try.
Carcinogenesis test in liver cells
One of the shining points of our design is that it provides a new way to fight against cancer using strategies of self-surveillance, self-clearage and self-stabilizing. Previous tests have confirmed that microRNA-122 is specifically expressed in normal hepatocytes. And our device needs to prove that it induces cell death not only in cancer cell lines, but also in transformed cells and such effect can be maintained. So, we need to transfer our pathway into iPS-derived or primary cultured hepatocytes, and induce carcinogenesis and test for our device again.
Perspective
Target selection
Our project aims at providing a new strategy to increase the efficienct of iPS directional differentiation and prevent carcinogenesis in transplant tissue. Here, we choose the iPS-derived hepatocytes as a model to test our idea. We have selected the liver-specific miR-122 as a marker to distinguish normal, differentiated liver cells from undifferentiated or cancerous cells. Actually there are many tissue specific and cancer specific microRNAs as deciphered by microarray, Our design can be broadened into usage in other tissue types by altering microRNA targets. By using engineering regulatory pathway, the rigid standard for highly specific microRNA can be reached by applying several kinds of microRNAs.
Alternative strategies
There are two main goals of our project: (1) increasing the efficiency of transferring iPSCs into tissue cells with the process of cell kind division much simplified and (2) auto-clearing the cancerous cells if the iPSC-derived"

Figure 3 shows that we extract our bacteriocins from ER2566 by using French press followed by thiol induced cleavage in order to purify the bacteriocins.
To extract our protein-Intein from the ER2566 cells after induction with IPTG, we used a French press to destroy the bacterial cell membrane. The lysate were then poured onto prepared chitin beads. Cleavage buffer containing DTT was added, thus causing thiol-induced cleavage at the fusion between the intein and our target protein (Figure 3).

Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Test ( Top )
MIC tests are essential in order to establish the bacteriocins viability as an antimicrobial compound. The MIC test studies the in vitro susceptibility of a bacterial strain towards a compound with an antimicrobial effect. This is measured by the optical density of an overnight culture after 28 hours incubated at 37°C, with a specific concentration of a bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal compound. We wanted to perform a MIC test towards P. aeruginosa and MRSA strains. This was inspired from Hans Jørn Kolmos (professor in clinical microbiology), who suggests that bacteriocins could be potent to treat MRSA carriers. In collaboration with the iGEM Stockholm team 2016 , MIC tests were performed in order to compare the effect of our bacter"

University of Valencia
Our university, founded over five centuries ago by the Juries of Valencia, has become a modern, public university that teaches all areas of knowledge: social,  economic and legal sciences, experimental sciences, engineering, health sciences, educational sciences and humanities.
The university community is committed to being a university of reference: we are ranked second in Europe in receiving Erasmus students and fourth among Spanish  universities in research. According to the most prestigious international rankings, we are ranked fourth in Spain.
Polytechnic University of Valencia
The Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV)is a public educational institution that offers modern, flexible degrees that are designed to meet the demands of society,  as well as official postgraduate programmes that are subject to demanding educational quality control systems.
It has three campus sites: Vera (inside the city of Valencia), Alcoy and Gandia, with a total of 36.186 students, 2.843 members of teaching and research staff, and 2.396  administrative and services staff.
University of Bergen
The University of Bergen is Norway's urban university who is intricately woven into the geographical, historical and cultural framework of the city, with 14,500 students and 3,200 faculty and staff.
UiB has most of its premises concentrated in two areas. Årstadvollen is the University's ""health campus"", where dentistry, medicine and health-care lie close to the Haukeland and Haraldsplass university clinics. Natural and social sciences, psychology, the arts and law are taught at Nygårdshøyden, a mixture of houses, shops and seats of learning.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Database Manager
Database Manager
The database manager is a frontend for database manipulation. Often users will want to edit database information directly without having to go through a complete design flow. To that end the database manager supports:
Manipulation of Formats, People, and BioBrick Object associated tables and fields.
Search capabilities for database tables with both complete and partial matching.
The ability to add People, Formats, and Vectors to their respective tables.
Algorithm Manager
Clotho Algorithm Manager
The Algorithm Manager is a graphical user interface which allows the use of various algorithms available in Clotho. Its primary features are:
Interact with different algorithms - Clotho dynamically detects which algorithms are available to the user and provides the ability to select and view instructions on a per algorithm basis.
Import input from files - read input from a previously saved file.
Import input from any database configured in the ""mySQL Configuration Manager"" - any part in a active mySQL Clotho connection can be imported and translated to the format required by the algorithm.
Save input for later use - input can be saved to a file of the user's choice.
Save output in any format permitted by the selected algorithm - the algorithm dynamically provides the user with a list of output file types it supports.
View that output by loading the appropriate program from your desktop - this includes opening external programs as well as Clotho specific views**.
A user may also implement their own algorithm in Clotho with only a few lines of code - this code is minimal and java docs are provided to allow the user to do so*.
The alpha and iGEM versions of Clotho comes with an optimal assembly algorithm without taking into consideration common sub-parts as well as an algorithm using various heuristics to assembly standard parts taking into account antibiotic resistance markers in the vector.

Aliquot the cells into the Eppendorf cups (40 µL per Eppendorf cup). While aliquoting, filled Eppendorf cups must be frozen directly in liquid nitrogen.
Store the filled Eppendorf cups in a cryobox at -80°C.
Transformation of Electrocompetent Cells by Electroporation
Mix 50-200 ng plasmid DNA with 40 µL of competent cells (always defrost on ice!). Transfer attempt into precooled electroporation cuvette. Incubate on ice for 10 min.
Important: DNA must be salt free! Use either directly in ddH2O eluted plasmids, or (e.g. directly after ligation) desalt the DNA for 30 min on a Millipore filter (MF Membrane Filters).
Electroporation: 2500 V for 2 mm cuvettes (1250 V for 1 mm cuvettes), 25 µF, 200 Ω, discharging time should be 3-5 msec. Contacts of the electroporation cuvette must be dry. Remove all air bubbles before electroporation.
Immediately add 960 µL liquid LB (or, if available, SOC medium for a higher transformation efficiency) into the cuvette and transfer the content into a 2 ml Eppendorf cup.
Incubate at 37°C and 150 rpm for 1 h. Fix tube in horizontal position with tape.

We received sequencing results for:
A15-1 - sequence ok! (long part) (actually it is not consistent with the Registry, but it is consistent with iGEM 2009 QC, in which there are some problems with K112808, even if the part should work)
A15-3 - sequence ok! (long part) (actually it is not consistent with the Registry, but it is consistent with iGEM 2009 QC, in which there are some problems with K112808, even if the part should work)
A11-2 - deletion of 20bp in lacI gene...
A11-3 - sequence ok!
B5-3 - sequence ok! (long part)
B6-3 - sequence ok! (long part)
B3-5 - sequence ok!
COMMENTS:
we used A11-2 and A15-2 for A14 and A18 ligations...so A14 had to be repeated using A11-3, while we will send A15-2 to BMR for sequencing soon (we forgot to do it!).
B3 native stock sequence was confirmed! but we still don't know why we see two unexpected bands after B3 digestions...
B5-3 and B6-3 sequences were confirmed! but we still don't know why we see two unexpected bands after B5 and B6 digestions...

Intellectual property rights, potential risks in recombinant DNA technology, progress vs. profit, and other important aspects of the biotechnology industry are also discussed. The seminar’s main purpose is to get students thinking about future work they might participate in and about potential ethical dilemmas they might encounter. The seminar emphasizes the responsibility that engineers have regarding the research they conduct and the products they produce.
Reaching Out to Ithaca
CURIE:  Bio Boot Camp
CURIE Group Projects and Presentations
CURIE is a one-week summer program for high school girls who are interested in science and engineering. These girls were invited to Cornell to gain experience in a laboratory working on research-inspired projects. These projects were designed to exercise their ability to problem solve and troubleshoot as they worked towards their goal. Cornell iGEM lead the “Bio Boot Camp” session on the first day of the program, teaching the students basic lab techniques (pipetting small volumes, plating bacteria, running a PCR gel) as well as showing them some of the equipment in the laboratory. During the week that followed, Cornell iGEMers worked as teaching assistants with small teams of students on the following group projects:
Microvascular Chips
Wireless Combination Lock
Sleep Apnea Feedback Device
Protein Localization in Mammalian Cells
Sun Tracker
For instance, the Microvascular Chips group used a microfluidic chip to model blood flow in small capillaries. They measured baseline flow speeds by taking videos through the laboratory’s microscopes and calculated the resistance in each channel from the flow speeds and channel diameters. Then they plugged one channel to simulate a blood clot and measured the changes in flow speed and channel resistance. Using resistance as an analogy for an electrical circuit, students then calculated the flow speeds that they expected to find based on simple physics and compared their findings to expected results. This project was framed in the context of modeling a small stroke, but it can be also used to model many biological systems involving blood flow in small capillaries.

Figure 30: One Red_mazF main culture was induced with IPTG (1mM) the other one not. Over 3.5 hourss the OD600 was measured.
Figure 30 shows that the not induced culture (orange line) grew better than the induced culture (red line). Therefore it's possible to say that the induced culture expressed the toxin and so the cells were inhibited in growth.  At the beginning both cultures had nearly the same growth. After 2.5 hours it´s possible to see the difference between the induced and not induced culture.  Figure 6 shows that after a while it's clear that the induced culture didn´t grow in the same way like the not induced culture. We can say that was because of the toxin expression in the induced culture. It inhibited the growth of the cells. Hence we have cloned the right gene and also the right protein was expressed compared to our previous results.
Week 13 (03.10 – 07.10)
Red_mazF vs. Blue_ccdB on LB-amp plates
Our last week in the lab we started with our bacteria fight and got some interesting results.
Figure 31: LB-amp plate 1 and 2: Six (1,2,3,4,5 and 8) colonies with proven positiv insert  (see fig. 2 and 3). LB-amp plate 3 (plated with 20 µl IPTG (1 M)): 1.1 Red_mazF and 1.1 Blue_ccdB  (also with proven positiv insert) were streaked one upon the other. LB-amp plate 4: 1.1 Red_mazF  and 1.1 Blue_ccdB. LB-amp plate 5: 2.4 Red_mazF and 1.1 Blue_ccdB. LB-amp plate 6: 1.1 Red_mazF,  2.4 Red_mazF and 1.1 Blue_ccdB.
1.1 Red_mazF was used in plate 3,4 and 6 and watching these plates one can see that 1.1 Blue_ccdB  is replaced by 1.1 Red_mazF. 1.1 Red_mazF was definitely growing stronger and eliminated Blue_ccdB.  Maybe 1.1 Red_mazF had a leakier promotor than 1.1 Blue_ccdB and because of this more toxin was produced  than in "

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," of factors that are ‘false’ for the first $45$ elements of the normalized_score matrix, meaning classified as gene doping, and ‘true’ for the subsequent elements, meaning not classified as gene doping.
$k$ is the amount of nearest neighbors taken into account per point to judge the classification.
Less than $k-l$ contradicting votes are allowed. By setting $l=0$, we make sure that sequenes will only be classified as one of each group when all k nearest neighbors of that sequence belong to the same category.
Extending the Database
We opened up our sequence classification tool to people lacking bioinformatics knowledge by the creation of a Graphical User Interface that can be used to input hand-typed sequences. These sequences are then stored in an Excel file and can then be run through the subsequent stages of the program. Alternatively, users can load fasta files, the general output of sequencing systems.
Based on the input coming from loaded sequences, the alogrithm accommodates new gene doping sequences it finds into the database. Thereby, the tool can evolve with the sequences designed by gene doping creators.
Computation Time
Accurate alignment algorithms are generally computationally intensive. Our algorithm also runs every input sequence along the sequences in the expanding custom database. Therefore, computation time may increase in time. At present, it takes approximately 10 minutes to run the code for 5 input sequences on 4 parallel processor cores when the workspace has been downloaded. Complete running without workspace takes around 1.5 hours on 6 parallel processor cores. To speed up the running time, we therefore include the basic workspace. The code checks whether the core elements in the workspace are present and determines what parts to still run based on this. Also, we included packages for parallel core running ( Calaway, R., 2017 , Weston, S., 2017 , Calaway, R., 2018 ). In the future, we recommend complementation of the code with a pattern recognition based sequence choice to align with to prevent extreme increases in running time.
1.2 Results and Conclusions
Based on the scores obtained in the steps described before, we constructed figure 2. In figure 2, the classification in the three categories, natural EPO, artificial EPO and other DNA, is displayed. Here, the alignment scores to natural human DNA are displayed on the x-axis and the alignment scores to artificial EPO are put on the y-axis. The blue sector shows the natural human EPO sequence and derivatives with a 6% misread rate ( Loman et al., 2015 ) resulting from sequencing"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Interlab_-_-_TEXT.html," the strongest promoter, BBa_J23101, the GFP produced by device 1 would be the highest among all three. Though all the three promoters are from the same constitutive promoter family, their promoter strengths are different. According to the Part Registry, the promoter strengths of BBa_J23101, BBa_J23106 and BBa_J23117 are 1791 au, 1185 au and 162 au respectively. This could be the main reason for causing the great difference of the GFP produced. Overall, the results obtained was reasonable.

Questions
There are 4 questions in Safety .
Answers
Q. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
A. No issues of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety  raised up during our KIT-Kyoto iGEM 2010 project. All our work was performed fallowing the guidelines of the safety standards required by biosafety level 1. Rules of best microbiological practices were applied. Our project ‘’E.coli Pen’’ enables an appreciator to take a pen, draw and color. Since ‘’E.coli Pen’’ has H2O2 as bacterial killing means, it prevents transgenic E.coli from spreading. (See the article of E.coli survival curve by H2O2 density.)
Q. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
A. No. We developed some parts of producing fluorescence protein used by H2O2 responsive promoter. These parts are completely harmless.
Q. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
A. Yes. We have bio safety group at KIT, and our project has been monitored by them. The leader of this biological safety group was Prof Yamaguchi. Furthermore, there is an upper level committee of transgenic experiences at Kyoto Institute of Technology. Our project has also received accreditation from this committee. All material handled or distributed are non-hazardous and non-infectious. It agrees with all safety standards requested by bio safety level 1. Therefore, Prof. Yamaguchi and other  education stuff and Instructors fully support the work done by this iGEM team.
Q. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
A. No, we don’t.

Some ideas posted by other teams can be found at the Idea exchange page. A list of the projects of last year arranged in few categories can be found at this page.
Biofuels
Styrene Production
Styrene is a hydrocarbon used in several field of chemical engineering and, of course, as biofuel. Some previous experiences on E. coli transformation for styrene oxide production have been reported here .
Hydrogen Production
Hydrogen is not properly a biofuel but is a very active molecule in biological systems and perhaps engineering an organism able to produce it could be an easily affordable task. Check this link for further info.
Biodiesel Production
I recently read on the online version of The Times this interesting news . It is more likely to remain only a cue but it seems that by reengineering E. coli it could be possible to obtain compounds similar to diesel and gasoline from agricultural waste. More info at 1 , 2 and 3
Information processing
Schmitt trigger
Bologna worked on a Schmitt trigger last year ( University of Bologna 2007 ). Domenico already gave an explanation about this device. The project is also very well documented so have a look at their site. More about the Schmitt trigger can be found here ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmitt_trigger ).

In numerical simulations a computational molecule describes the space and time relationship of data.
1-D continuous model
The biological circuit described on the Research page is going to be modelled. Two different cell types A and B are interacting.      Type A cells produce a repellent called leucine which causes       the cells of type B to move away. At the same time, type A cells also produce AHL, which is required by the cells of type       B to move. Initially, colonies of the two bacteria types are placed      at the center of the dish. As molecule production within the type A cells kicks in, the repellent and AHL concentrations      start to increase. This triggers the type B cells to move away from the center. Movement will continue until the       concentration of AHL is insufficient for the type B cells to move further. The behaviour of the two cell types      is described by the model given below:
Our Keller-Segel type model
$$\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = D_a \bigtriangledown^2 A + \gamma A(1 - \frac{A}{k_{p}}),$$             $$\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} = D_b \bigtriangledown^2 B + \bigtriangledown (P(B,H,R) \bigtriangledown R) +             \gamma B(1 - \frac{B}{k_{p}}), $$             $$ \frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = D_r \bigtriangledown^2 R +  k_r A - k_{lossH} R $$             $$\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = D_h \bigtriangledown^2 H +  k_h A - k_{lossR} H . $$
With:
$$ P(B,H,R) = \frac{B K_{c} H}{R}. $$
The model has been derived while looking at [1] and [2] .      The terms that appear can be grouped into four categories. Every equation has a diffusion term given by      $D_x \bigtriangledown^2 X$, diffusion smoothes peaks by spreading them out in space. The two equations related to cell      densities contain logistic growth terms of the form $\gamma X(1-\frac{X}{k_x"

NEPTUNE Collaborative Findings
Given that Neptune was built to provide an accessible, affordable, and convenient solution for designing, manufacturing, and operating microfluidic systems, it was only natural that we would test our toolchain by designing microfluidics for other iGEM wetlab teams. We were able to collaborate with both the MIT iGEM team and the Northeastern iGEM team. Through these exchanges, we were able to test the Neptune workflow while providing a wetlab team with microfluidics to test their biological systems.
Designing Automated Mammalian Cell Culture Devices
SEPT - OCT 2016 | A collaboration with the MIT 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team
Our collaboration with the MIT iGEM team involved designing, creating, and controlling microfluidic devices to culture mammalian cells on chip. The end goal of these experiments was to lay the groundwork for testing endometrial cell lines and their response to various levels of estrogen in an automated microfluidic setting.
PART 1
In our first on-site visit, we designed and fabricated a microfluidic device with specific parameters fit to trapping the MIT team's mammalian HEK293 cells. Our first iteration of chip included an input, cell traps surrounded by two valves, and an output, as shown. We automated the control of the valves using our servo-syringe combination pumps. To prepare the chip for the cells, first, we opened our valves to flow 1.2mL of ethanol solution inside the chip for sterilization. Next, we pulled 1mL of PBS (buffer solution) to clean out the ethanol solution for the benefit of the cells. Finally, we pulled 1ml of cell solution with a concentration of 1 x 10^6 cells/ml through the microfluidic chip. The two valves were then closed (trapping the cells and culture media inside) and the chip removed from the control infrastructure. From there"

Public Engagement
Summary
We, in iGEM Stockholm 2018, have successfully integrated many different parts of society, and made an impact that lasts. We have focused on how to make iGEM life easier for teams all over the world, resulting in a safety booklet for future iGEM teams to come, as well as a modeling handbook to provide teams with valuable information regarding modeling.
Regarding outreach, we have focused on including all parts of community. The result of our close collaboration with different parts of community led to the creation of a board game to engage university students, and a children’s book to introduce children to the world of synthetic biology. We successfully created a bridge between students and research - starting a Standard Student Society within the International Standardization Organization (ISO).
Our strategy from the beginning was to focus on what problems we face in our society today. We thought about how to tackle these problems and how to successfully create an outreach with engagement that lasts longer than the time span of the iGEM competition. We began our journey by having a look in the society we lived in, we tried to understand how it worked and how we should proceed with our project, Biotic Blue, from a Human Practices perspective. We started off with a strong belief that a successful project comes from talking with people from the community, and thus we started our journey within the deep core of the society - getting into people's brains with the help of Misse Wester.
The Spark that Lit the Engine
Misse is a Professor within Philosophy at Lund University, at the division of Risk management and Societal safety. Misse has great expertise in risk perception and we talked with her about the thoughts that people in society have about engineered organisms and synthetic biology. We wanted to know how the awareness might influence our project.
A very important “take home message” when speaking to Misse was that there are other perspectives than the purely scientific. It is common that people tend to rely on the philosophical perspective such as “right and wrongs”, making it more difficult to respond with scientific facts. Additionally, the question about engineering organisms can become an economical question rather than a question about the technique. It is also a fact that engineering and ethics are intertwined, and the definition of natural will differ depending on who you ask.
Misse got us to understand that scientific arguments are not enough in the ongoing discussion regarding engineered and modified organisms. Most views are not based on knowledge, but on opinions. Communication must be based on this fact, but we also need to define society. She got"

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#MSDS_-_-_TEXT.html," K-12 strains are unable to interact with human proteins. Although proteinase K has can potentially degrade human protein beta amyloid plaques [5] , this protein is only abundant in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and neither the bacteria or proteinase K is likely to pass the blood-brain-barrier.
Imperial College London Safety Department is a dedicated department responsible for providing safety guidelines. In order to prevent contamination and infection, Imperial College has established health and safety rules . For example no eating or drinking in labs, wearing gloves when handling the lab apparatus, wearing lab coats at all times, disposal of contaminated and non-contaminated equipment into appropriate bins, and keeping the lab area organised and clean.
We have gone through safety training regarding general safety issues, first aid and emergency arrangements, incident reporting, experimental procedures and waste procedures before starting the wet lab work. We have also separated areas and entrances for wet and dry lab work, and the benches are cleaned before and after experiments. In addition, we always keep transformed bacteria in appropriate fridge or freezer, and dispose bacterial contaminated material into the autoclave bag.
2. Do the biological materials used in the lab work pose any risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
As described in Question 1, E. coli K-12 strains used by the team should raise no concerns regarding human health and safety. The bioengineered E. coli cells, like the non-engineered ones, also lack the key virulence structures that enable them to infect human or other animals. Therefore, human or animal infection by our bacteria released by accident is highly unexpected. The risk to the general public is that the engineered bacteria might release ethylene glycol to the environment after breaking down polyurethane, which might be toxic to human. However, the activity of the bacteria and enzyme are highly inhibited, as they require certain conditions to work.
The engineered bacteria are not designed to be exposed to the general public. We intend to utilise bioreactors to concentrate these bacteria in order to achieve high efficiency. It is possible that worker near the fermentor can be exposed to these synthetic “machines”, but it is difficult to estimate worker exposure, as related information is not available [6] .

When the polymerization reaction is over, the newly generated cellulose is secreted to the extracellular through these sites. The following figure is a partial schematic of the production of cellulose by G. xylinus
We hope to optimize the metabolic pathway of bacterial cellulose, redirecting more carbon sources into the production of bacterial cellulose; meanwhile expressing key genes in BC synthesis process. Through these two methods we hope to achieve high yield of BC . Therefore, we designed the following experiments:
Design & Engineering :
Phosphoglucomutase(PGM) is able to catalyze the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate and plays an significant role in both glucose metabolism and BC metabolic network.
Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a new type of second messenger molecule that is ubiquitous in bacteria. Bacteria utilize it to perceive cell surface signals and activate targets within cells, which involves amplification of the original signal and the subsequent expression of a series of specific genes in the cell. These genes affects the various physiological and biochemical processes in the cells. c-di-GMP control a wide range of process, and has a role in transcription, translation and post-translation levels. In addition, c-di-GMP participates in the regulation of  multiple biological functions and affects biofilm formation. In a nutshell, it is a crucial elements to the formation of membrane-like bacterial cellulose and the improvement of BC production.
This experiment attempts to improve BC production by over-expressing PGM and c-di-GMP, a small signal transfer molecule of bacteria.the goal is to implement both to realize the high yield of BC.
The process of the experiment is divided into following steps, firstly, we   transform the constructed plasmids into the E. coli DH5α. When expressing successfully, then we transform it into G.xylinus through electroporation and put it in comparison with the common G.xylinus. We try to explore the influence of each plasmids on the production of BC after fermentation.
We use PCR to amplify gene PGM and c-di-GMP，and transform reconstructed plasmids J23119+PGM and J23119+c-di-GMP into G.xylinus. Then we put them in comparison with the control group PAsr+PGM and PAsr+c-di-GMP and measure its effect on the yield of BC respectively.
Results
At the beginning of the experiment, it was found that the yield of BC was higher than that of G.xylin"

Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!

Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!

We expressed these constructs of membrane anchor and Snc1 constitutively under control of the RPL18B promotor. In case of Pex15 we used a truncated version, lacking a large part of the N-terminus, only consisting of the transmembrane domain (315-383) (Figure 3.1). For PEX26 we use the truncated version published in Halbach et al. (Halbach et al, 2006) .
Figure 3.2 Concept of secreting peroxisomal contents to the supernatant. For the secretion, the membrane anchor Pex15 or Pex26 is used. This anchor is used to decorate peroxisomes or our modified compartments with the v-SNARE Snc1. For the secretion Snc1 interacts with the t-SNAREs in the cell membrane. Induced from this interaction the vesicle and cell membrane fuse and the content of the compartment is secreted to the supernatant.
We verified our secretion using beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter protein. In 2012 Stock and colleagues described the GUS reporter assay for unconventional secretion (Stock et al, 2012) . With it, it is possible to determine whether a protein is secreted conventional and is N-glycosylated or secreted unconventional and not N-glycosylated. GUS is a bacterial protein with an N-glycosylation-site, which is active only if the protein is not N-glycosylated. The GUS-activity can be measured with different reagents in plate or liquid assays. Liquid assays can be applied qualitatively as well as quantitatively to measure differences in activity. If GUS is secreted by the conventional pathway the N-glycosylation leads to inactivation of the enzyme (Stock et al, 2012) (Fig 3.2).
Figure 3.3 The GUS Assay. GUS secreted with an unconventional secreted protein like Cts1 from Ustilago maydis active in the supernatant. GUS secreted with a conventional Signal peptide (Sp) inactive in the supernatant. If GUS is in the cytoplasm there is also no activity (Lysis control) (Feldbrügge et al, 2013) .

Abstract
Here, we demonstrate that we made a functional prototype of our co-spun silk with natural B.mori silk and the sfGFP co-spinning module. Our resulting fiber had very strong fluorescent properties, but very weak mechanical properties. In the coming weeks, we will incorporate stretching processes that will greatly enhance the material strength of these fibers.
Introduction
To create functionalized fibers, we co-spun the GFP co-spinning module with native Bombyx mori silk. The GFP co-spinning module was designed such that the N and C termini have affinity to B.mori silk, allowing it to bind to the native silk upon spinning.
Methods for co-spinning silk with the GFP co-spinning module
In brief, we followed the standard process as highlighted in the literature [1] to produce a concentrated aqueous solution, or dope, of commercially purchased b.mori silk. We then added aqueous GFP co-spinning module to the concentrated b.mori dope so that the final solution had 750 grams of b.mori silk to 1 gram of GFP co-spinning module. We then extruded this dope into a coagulation bath of 90% v/v isopropanol and water and collected the resulting fiber on a godet. Detailed steps are as follows:
Degumming
Silk is comprised of two main proteins, fibroin and sericin. Fibroin is the structural protein of the silk and our protein of interest. Sericin serves as the ‘glue’ of the silk. Degumming separates and removes sericin and is an essential preparation step before dissolving the silk. We found that commercially degummed silk was not properly degummed for our purposes and this step had to be carried out in-lab.
To degum, we boiled 2.5 grams of B.mori silk in 0.02M sodium carbonate solution for 30 minutes.
Solubilization
The resilience of silk to many different solvents is well known. In order to dissolve silk, we used lithium"
UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," PUF-PIN represents the gene that is expressed to produce a wild-type PUF fused to a PIN endonuclease. The comparison of this construct's results to the mutant PUF-PIN (labeled mPUF-PIN) our main source of experimental data.
The light blue symbol labeled mPUF-PIN represents the gene that is expressed to produce a mutant-type PUF fused to a PIN endonuclease. The variation between our two constructs is a two base pair difference between the 8-base pair PUF-PIN and mPUF-PIN RNA recognition sites. Otherwise, their endonuclease function is theoretically unaffected by the different recognition subunits.

Fig. 1 and 2 include the resulting PUF-PIN and mPUF-PIN proteins interacting with their respective binding sites. The wild type binding site is represented by the orange oval. The mutant type binding site is represented by the light orange square. The yellow rounded rectangle represents the YFP reporter gene. As the PUF-PIN fusion proteins, wild and mutant, interact with their respective sites, cleavage activity occurs due to the fused endonuclease.
Fig. 3
Fig. 4
Fig. 3 and 4 depict the aformentioned endonuclease activity due to the endonuclease, PIN, fused to both PUF and mPUF. After the PUF-PIN complexes recognize and bind to their encoded sites, the endonuclease begins to cut the third base within the 8 bases counted from 5'-3' ; the fourth base downstream the 8 bases counted from 5'-3'.
Since our YFP reporter gene is located downstream of the recognized PUF-PIN cut site, we would be able to quantify changes in expression and fluorescence with and without the introduction of our specific RNA binding endonuclease activity. We hypothesized that in measuring the fluorescence levels, we would have evidence supporting PUF-PIN and mPUF-PIN as RNA scissors with the ability to silence genes.
Non-Specific Binding Control Experiments
In order to test whether the endonuclease activity is specific to the PUF binding site, we propose to match both the PUF-PIN and mPUF-PIN proteins with a controlled wild/mutant binding site with a YFP reporter. The control YFP reporter construct encodes a binding site that doesnt recognize both wtPUF/mPUF protein.

The energy dissipated in a coalescence (merging) of droplets will be related to the volume of drained fluid between two droplets T3, \(E_{dissip} = \pi \eta D T^3 (\dot \gamma)^2 t_c\). Here D is the drag coefficient, related to the Reynolds number:
(25)
The strain rate \((\dot \gamma)\) represents the relative deformation of the fluid flow \(\dot \gamma = (Q_1 + Q_2) / H / (W - 2R_2)\). In the experiments we use high concentrations of surfactants in oil and that is why we have to account for the non-Newtonian behavior of the oil. This means the oil viscosity is not constant with the growing deformation rates. It was shown previously that the solutions of high concentration of ionic or nonionic surfactant have a shear thickening behavior [8-10], which means that viscosity of solution is increasing with the growing deformation. We use the Power-Law for viscosity function:
(26)
Here η0 is the viscosity value with no deformation applied. This is the value given in a manual description of oil and n=1.2 is the power law index. With these arguments the dissipated energy is written as follows:
(27)
It should be noted the power-law description of viscosity of oil is used in all energy terms.
5. Energy balance equation and its solutions
So far we derived all the components making influence for energy balance. We write the energy balance as equilibrium of the total energy. The left-side (LS) of equation represents the total energy of droplet pair moving in a straight channel of the cross-section H×W1. Right side (RS) of the balance equation represents the total energy in a coalescence channel of the size H×Wch. These two terms are written as follows
(28)
(29)
Here in equation (29) we include the energy loss associated with the volume of oil drained between two droplets in the coalescence. Taking together equations (28)-(29), the equilibrium equation
(30)
is being solved numerically for various experimental conditions (droplet volumes and voltage). To find the solutions of eq.(30) we used the package Mathematica 9.0.

We built a light.
Project Description.
Engineered sensors are all around us. Biological systems contain natural biosensors that can be utilized to monitor the environment and health of ecosystems and the individuals within them. A critical part of building a sensor is the ability to detect and measure the output. To enable the design and fabrication of DIY biosensors, we are creating instructions on how to build a low cost luminometer and fluorimeter. The precision, accuracy, and sensitivity of the instrument will be demonstrated using a set of luciferase and fluorescent protein reporters.
The luminometer is a simple photodiode detector with the signal being integrated using an Arduino and output data being processed with open source software. The fluorimeter is an extension that includes an LED light source and emission/excitation filters appropriate for the fluorescent protein to be analyzed. The entire light path is encased in a 3D printed shell.
To test the luminometer, the luciferases from Gaussia princeps, Renilla reniformis and Photinus pyralis were codon optimized for E. coli  and expressed from a strong constitutive promoter. The Gaussia luciferase was extracellularly targeted. Fluorescent proteins including blue, green, yellow, orange, and red with different promoter strengths and an estrogen biosensor are used to calibrate the fluorometer.
To engage the public about synthetic biology and iGEM, we have developed a BioLight powered by luciferase. For education purposes, a light (with parts) and plans for the fluorimeter were provided to the “The Citizen Science Lab” in Pittsburgh and we are hopeful that this will excite the community to start building.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Experiments#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,"Pipet slowly 20 µL of the sample into the gel pockets.
Make sure to include at least one lane with molecular weight standards (PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder™ (Fa. Fermentas)) to determinate the molecular weight of the sample.
Connect the power lead and run the gel with 180 V until the distance of the lowest molecular weight standard lane to the gel end is down to 0.5 cm.
Staining the polyacrylamide gel (Colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining):
After finishing the SDS-PAGE remove gel from gel casting form and transfer it into a box.
Add 100 mL of the Colloidal Coomaassie Brilliant Blue staining solution to your polyacrylamid gel.
Incubate the gel in the solution at room temperature until the protein bands got an intensive blue color. Shake the gel continuously during incubation.
Remove the staining solution.
Wash the gel with destaining buffer .
Incubate the gel in H2O (2-6 h) for bleaching the background. Shake the gel continuously during incubation.  If necessary replace the colored water with new one.
MALDI-TOF/TOF sample preparation
Tryptic digest of gel lanes for analysis with MALDI-TOF:
Be careful that skin scales or hair do not contaminate your sample. So wear hand gloves and tie up your hair.
Reaction tubes have to be cleaned with 60 % (v/v) CH3CN and 0.1 % (v/v) TFA. Afterwards the solution has to be removed completely followed by evaporation of the tubes under a fume hood. Alternatively, microtiter plates from Greiner® (REF 650161) can be used without washing. If you work with reaction tubes from Eppendorf, you do not need the wash step either.
Cut out the protein lanes of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE using a clean scalpel. Gel parts are transferred to the washed reaction tubes. If necessary, cut the parts to smaller slices
Gel slices should be washed two times. Therefore add 200 µL 30 % (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate each time and shake lightly for 20 minutes till the gel slices are destained. Remove supernatant and discard to special waste
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac.
Rehydrate gel slices in 15 µL trypsin solution followed by short centrifugation.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Human Practices#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html," a hint about looking for mechanically gated channels in human ears. Actually, the normal function of ears is dependent on a system that realize amplification and subsequent transduction from sound wave to shear force. Given those suggestions, we read a paper about channels on plant cell membrane may take responsibility for their ability of sound sensing, which suggests the possible applications of our project. [1] Also, we designed microfluidics and other stimulus to test our system.
When we studied advanced knowledge about sound-sensitive channels, we consulted Dr. Zhiyi Wei majoring in Biochemistry& Structural Biology suggested that if we want to achieve better efficiency, we ought to use directed evolution methods to strengthen the sensitivity on protein level.

TecCEM,2017,Team:TecCEM#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," meet-up
During July, our team organized a meet-up for this year’s mexican iGEM teams (Tec-Chihuahua and TecMonterrey_GDA)  to share and discuss their project. In the morning, each team was introduced and we took time to know each other and briefly discuss what we were working on. In the afternoon, we invited several research professors from Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Estado de México and Campus Chihuahua, as well as from CINVESTAV, the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute. Each team was able to present the advances on their projects to the professors, who provided valuable feedback.
Scientist for a day
Family day is an annual friendly meeting where all the employes of our university can bring their family and enjoy a lot of recreative activities. This year Tec CEM team organized some activities and used them to explain our school community the project that we were doing.
Our stand was “Scientist for a day” and the activities were created for people of all ages. The main objective was to let our community know what we were doing. And why we were developing Citric Off. The first activity was designed to explain the disease: in this game we divided the participants in two teams, one of them were “Diaphorina team” and the other “Citrus team”, each member of the two groups had a balloon tied to their foot, the first team to burst all the balloons of the other team was the winner, so the victory could be the infection of the citrus or the victory of the citrus over their threat.
The second game consisted on making a big circle and our hands were held, simulating a plasmid, each group of people represented a single gene. Inside each plasmid, the genes waited for a free space, but they had to compete for them. The winning gene chose an activity to be developed for all the participants. This activity helped us explain the mechanisms of gene expression through a plasmid.
iGEMer for a week
In summer, iGEM TEC CEM  mentored a middle school student: Claudia Jireheli Cedillo Figueroa during two weeks. In this time, Claudia learned some protocols,she had her first lessons of molecular biology and learned about D. citri and its importance.
Conference
The team visited the middle school “Ovalle Monday”. We gave four talks to four different age groups about our project and the basis of synthetic biology. The aim of our conferences was to spread awareness of HLB"
Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Freetime_-_-_TEXT.html," similar, so we used parts of their project as a base and integrated parts of other previous iGEM projects in order to propose a new genetic construction capable of detecting different amounts of a certain substance. We call these new types of sensors, “intelligent biosensors”, because they have the ability to react in different ways depending on their surroundings.
With our project we hope to continue with the previous efforts of other iGEM teams, and at the same time propose a new type of genetic circuit for achieving these functions. In the process we plan to develop BioBricks for two new families of phage activators as well as different BioBrick constructons that can make our system easy to adapt, so that the creation of these “intelligent biosensors” becomes just a matter of choosing the substance of interest and choosing the different reporters.

Duke,2017,Team:Duke#HP#Silver#Economics_-_-_TEXT.html," towards sex work as well as the economic situation of many women facilitate the rampant spread of the disease with an estimated 35-37% incidence in 2014. (2) It was estimated that sex workers and their clients account for 16% of new infections in Uganda with a great financial incentive placed on sex workers not to practice safe sex. Furthermore, the criminalization of sex work also puts a strain on the ability for individuals to actually receive help for HIV.
Aside from men that have sex with other men and sex workers, Adolescent girls and young women, people who inject drugs, and children of mothers with HIV are all groups that are unusually vulnerable to the HIV in Uganda. This country, more than others of the region, has much more information regarding the subject of HIV. This a result of its vigorous campaign against HIV/AIDS, however, the disease is still a highly debilitating one both individually and collectively.
South Africa
5.7 of 48 million South Africans currently live with HIV. It has been projected that, in spite of recent declines in HIV prevalence, there will be an increase in the prevalence of HIV in the years to come (1). As is natural with diseases such as HIV the poor and the working class are disproportionately affected. Lack of access to information and treatment for the disease leaves this group disproportionately affected (3). This in turn, for reasons discussed in the overview, decreases the life expectancy of those of the working class within the country. This implies increased training cost as each individuals working life is shorter and training must be conducted more often (1).
Furthermore, among those at the lower end of the Socio-economic index (SEI) the prevalence of HIV infection was almost double that of the country while the middle class (middle SEI) had an infection rate of 15.9 % (3). These numbers are likely to be higher than what was measured. This is likely because of testing as not only is there consistently higher stigma towards HIV at a lower SEI there is less access to information as well. Furthermore, testing among low SEI men in particular lags behind all other groups (4).
Fundamentally the issue comes down to access. Low SEI individuals have lower access information and as a result, have a greater stigma for the disease (4). It is these factors, that are tied most closely with the prevalence of HIV within the country. HIV can hobble the economic growth of any country (1), and, with a disproportionately affected working population, it can affect South Africa even more deeply. This is a danger of HIV, it is a disease that affects the individual and the collective"

Hi, there! Today is Sunday, and of course we didn’t stop working! The transformation of the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + K346004 and BB_Essential + E0840 in DH5α developed! Today we selected 16 colonies from BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, 16 colonies from BB_Essential + E0840 and 10 colonies from BB_Essential + K346004 to transfer and tomorrow we will make colony’s PCR. An inoculum in liquid medium of 2 colonies from BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, was made, as well as 9 colonies from BB_Essential + K346004 and 2 colonies of BB_Essential + E0840. This was what we could recover from las transformation, in which the binding system wasn’t concentrated.
In total we have: 18 colonies from BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation;
19 colonies from BB_Essential + K346004; and 16 colonies of BB_Essential + E0840.
Sooooo many plates!!!!!

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News#Alberta Events_-_-_TEXT.html," suggestions on how to improve our marketing approach to potential investors.
At last, it was time to dine on something more than a handful of petrified undergraduates. We meandered to a nearby restaurant and feasted on sumptuous food and beverages scarcely short of ambrosia. We also had the opportunity to feast on something more important: namely, the advice of the business tycoons themselves. We were awestruck by the plethora of wisdom and experiences shared over lunch, not to mention the honour of getting to know the Dragons on a more personal level.
After lunch, the Dragons and students converged in Alberta Ingenuity’s lair to discuss strategies for effective fundraising and networking. It was an open-floor conversation where we had the opportunity to learn from the Dragons and the other teams, free of the reticence that was more pronounced in the morning session. We were also able to address some of the challenges that each of the teams had faced up to that point. The day closed with a feedback session, where the teams discussed the format of the event with the Supreme Commander of the Dragons, Ms Jen Hill. As the very first meeting between all three Albertan iGEM teams, we were able to share in the anxiety of presenting at the beginning, and the relief of having succeeded by the end of the day.
We returned home on the evening of May 26th, weary from the experience and yet somehow craving more of it. Having satisfied both of our original ambitions, we were pleased with the result and thankful that we were more than just another meal for a few Dragons in the vicinity. Armed with a new sense of promotional direction, more contacts who can help support our initiatives, and the same stunning good looks that we had before we left, we are excited to implement some of these ideas to help capitalise on our marketing potential.
We would like to extend our sincerest thanks to Alberta Ingenuity for funding the event, as well as to the Dragons for their help and their time. Oh, and for not being as nefarious as the Dragons on the CBC edition.
Ethics Workshop @ Calgary, May 31st, 2009
The ethics workshop was held at our university on May 31st. It was an excellent opportunity for more members of our team to meet the members of both Alberta and Lethbridge teams. At the workshop, we were given valuable insight on the exploration of ethical issues with the help of Dr. Gregor Wolbring and Ms. Lori Sheremeta. Each team was able to introduce their respective projects, and the ethical issues surrounding each project were discussed. We were able"

Humbled, we turned to nature to study and employ an ingenious method by which to waterproof our UAV, and then developed a biological process for degrading our UAV over a time period of our choosing. To extend the capabilities of this winged-Goliath, our team constructed Cellulose Cross-Linkers to further strengthen the cellulose foundation and allow biosensors to be attached to the surface of our UAV.
While the above projects come together to lay a new path for the future of UAVs, they also expand the horizon in all other areas of synthetic biology and bioengineering with their versatile, far-ranging applications. Certainly, there is no denying that UAVs have been stigmatized for their combative purposes, but the SBS iGEM team members have worked hard to help showcase the important role that UAVs serve in all other areas of science and their benefits to humanitarian purposes. Go ahead and take a look around our Wiki, checkout our projects, our twenty biobricks, and our human practices efforts, and please feel free to stop any of us to ask questions or to hear more about our projects.
