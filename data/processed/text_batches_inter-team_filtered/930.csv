Monday
We had begun to collaborate with the UNAM-Genomics_Mexico team, they have catalogued our communications in detail .  We had given them advice on protocols but they were not having any more success so at their request Peter sent them DNA for 5 constructs, luxCDABE and Luciferase and LREs from both Luciola cruciata and Photinus pyralis with and without promoters.
Paul's plate reader experiments continued to give somewhat unexpected results, with an increase in light emission which seemed to be correlated with entry into stationary phase.  We wanted to know if this was some strange promoter effect or a feature of the luciferase pathway.  For these purposes Emily and Bill attempted to assemble fluorescent proteins both under pBAD alone and under pBAD with the rest of the operon. Paul set up another plate reader experiment with a wide range of arabinose concentrations used for induction. Will performed further site-directed mutagenesis of LC luciferase, in case Ben's failed.
Tuesday
Emily and Bill continued trying to assembly the fluorescent proteins with pBAD and PP luciferase. The process proved more difficult than we had hoped, but we got there eventually.
Theo also continued experimenting with his electrical engineering skills with the E.glometer: trying to build a DIY light measurement device.
In the evening we made a live recording of the Gibson Assembly Song at Bill's so that we could record the music video in the lab tomorrow.
Wednesday
Paul continued with his plate reader experiments, this time comparing the light output from all the different L. cruciata luciferase colour mutants.
The transformations from the fluorescent proteins showed some very small colonies. We left them to grow for longer.
We had a lot of fun recording the Gibson Assembly Song video in the lab today. Theo has very good camera skills.
Thursday
Today there were decent sized colonies on the fluorescent protein plates. However, it looked like there was a lot of cross-contamination - red colonies on lots of different plates that shouldn't have RFP. Very confusing. After examining the plates we just took colonies that appeared to be excited at the correct wavelengths and glow the right colour.
Ben, Emily and Bill recorded the individual tracks for the Gibson Assembly Song which Bill"

Customizing Silk
Background
Spider silk is an exceptional natural material.  It exhibits remarkable strength and has the potential to be a very useful medium for a variety of applications. The properties of spider silk come primarily from the structure and amino acid sequence of the silk protein. One spider silk protein is comprised of repetitive units, referred to as monomers.  Repeats of identical monomers make up one spider silk protein, and these proteins come together to form a silk fiber.  The monomer is therefore the basic unit of the silk polypeptide, and changing the sequence alters the physical properties of the spider silk. [1]
Fig 1: This image illustrates the amino acid motifs that compose various spider silk monomers.  Different types of silk protein contain different motifs.  These motifs define the physical characteristics of each monomer and the overall silk protein. [6]
In fact, the sequence of the spider silk monomer differs slightly from species to species. Therefore, silk produced by different species have different physical properties.  Some monomer sequences result in silks with greater strength, while other sequences result in silks with greater flexibility.  Furthermore, individual spiders can produce multiple types of silk such as dragline and flagelliform silk, each with very different properties. [2]
Much research has been done on the production of spider silk from recombinant bacteria. [3] We want to build on this work and take it a step further.  Using the wide range of spider silk monomers as our building blocks, we want to be able to create hybrid silk proteins with specified physical properties.  By mixing and matching these different monomer sequences within one polypeptide, we hope to be able to fine tune the properties of our produced silk.  If this system could be standardized, it could be exceedingly useful for quickly producing silk to fit different a variety of different needs and purposes.
Project Goals
For our project, we have chosen to start out with two different silk monomers, Major Ampullate Spidroin 1 (MaSp1) and 2 (MaSp2). "
Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Limiter#network_-_-_TEXT.html," repression of G, independent of its level of activation.  We might face the issue that increased expression of inducer A would surpass the repressor's ability to oppose gene G's activation.  Thus, instead of a constitutive promoter, we could ensure that the repressor for the gene of interest is under the control of a promoter that also takes the same inducer A as an input (Fig. 3).  This would mean that the amount of repressor expressed in the system scales with the amount of inducer, eliminating the possibility of our repressor being swamped by incresing induction of G's transcription.  However, both of these constructs have a critical flaw- they would always repress gene G, even when and where its expression is at a normal, healthy level.  Repressing gene G completely could cause problems by eliminating the possibility of gene G functioning normally.
To keep our repressor from interfering with normal levels of transcription, we need a way to turn off its activity when activation of G falls below a certain level, the threshold of healthy expression.
Bistability & Feedback
A bistable switch is a simple circuit in which, depending upon the nature or quantity of the input, two stable outcomes are possible.    Such a switch can afford a circuit the ability to alternate between two modes of activity in response to varying levels of input.  In one of the seminal publications in the field of synthetic biology, Gardner, Canton, and Collins of Boston University developed a genetic bistable switch [1] capable of switching between two distinct output states at a threshold level of input to the system.
The mechanism of bistability in this genetic switch is mutual inhibition (Fig. 4).  Two repressing transcription factors are put under the control of the promoter to which the other binds.  Thus, whichever repressor has a slight edge net negative effect on the other's transcription will ""win,"" repressing the other further and removing repression from its own transcription to create a feedback loop in which the system is stable.  Either factor can exist in an induced state, and when it is, the other is repressed.  The system can exist in two distinct, stable states.
Bistable mutual inhibition between two repressors provides precisely the sort of threshold switching behavior that we would like to apply to our factor R.  To set a threshold at which the system toggles between two stable states, we compare the expression induced by A on promoter G to a constitutive promoter by putting a repressor under the control of each (alpha and tau, respectively) and setting them in mutual inhibition.

A checking digestion with an electrophoresis gel of PatA, FMS1, AtoC minipreps was performed. J23119, 20J, OxyR and Ahp checking digesitons were also repeated.

KatGa, KatGb, OxyRa, OxyRb, PatAa and PatAb minipreps from the overnight cultures were performed following the Sigma-Aldrich protocol.
A checking digestion + an electrophoresis gel were carried out for all the last minipreps. Results were unsatisfacotry as we obtained a gel in blank.
We checked DNA quantity in the samples of KatGb, KatGa, OxyRb, OxyRa, PatAb and PatAa with the nanodrop instrument. Very low quantities (0.3 - 0.45 ng/μl )were observed. We thought that must be the cause of the gel in blank. We decided on repeating all the minipreps in the following days. For this, we kept the pellets of the rest of the overnight cultures that we had used that day (to avoid repeating the overnight cultures).

The Cultures Didn't Grow
The 14 cultures that I grew up yesterday, including the silk and pet vector in bl21 did not grow.
We suspect that either the plates that we used to grow the cells on or the bl21 cells are bad.
We are making new plates (Tristan) and I will run a test to see if a colony of the Bl21 cells grows in plain LB.
Redo of Transformation with pET+silk
We suspect there might be something wrong with the kanamycin plates we grew our colonies on, so today I will redo the transformation with the new plates.

Up to 40% of the total biofilm volume can be occupied by curli (Nguyen et al., 2014). Since curli consist mostly of CsgA monomers that interact with each other and possibly with other substances in the biofilm, modifying these monomers provides a simple way to change the properties of the whole biofilm.
Grätzel Cell
Setup of a Dye Sensitized Solar Cell
A dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) does not require expensive material or complex working conditions. It can be literally built out of tooth paste or sun screen combined with a dye obtained from fruits or tea. The starting layer is a glass slide coated with a transparent conducting material. Commonly used coating materials are indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO). The transparent semiconductors ZnO or TiO2 can be deposited on the conducting slide and serve as the electron transporting layer, which is then soaked with a dye. Functional groups of the dye molecules direct and anchor them on the surface of the semiconductor. An electrolyte containing iodine and iodide is added onto this layer to provide electrons and facilitate current flow. The cell is completed with another glass slide coated with traditional conducting materials such as graphite or platinum.
Mechanism of a DSSC
Upon irradiation of the solar cell, the electrons in the organic dye are excited to a higher level, called the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). If the LUMO level is energetically high enough, the electron can be transferred to the conduction band of the transparent semiconductor and from there continue to the anode. The missing electron of the dye is restored by the electrolyte and the electrolyte regains its electron from the cathode. This results in a continuous current flow for the duration of the irradiation.

Furthermore, we wrote and published articles on Comet.is which is aimed at high school students, university students and recent university graduates, please see 'For university students' for a list of the articles we wrote.
 
For university students
Our main form of outreach toward university students was in writing and publishing articles on a burgeoning and government sponsored website Comet.is which is aimed at high school students, university students and recent graduates. Our articles covered a range of topics from our iGEM experience to considerations of ethical issues of synthetic biology and the potential of synthetic biology.
Here are some excerpts:
""All this leads me to refer to synthetic biology as a ménage Ã  trois of a discipline, utilizing engineering, biology and computer science to produce a fantastically creative activity.""
""Given assistance in the form of grants or human resources, entrepreneurial forums along with student competitions like InnovationACT and iGEM have the chance to inspire entrepreneurialism in students. It is in these opportunities for students to go on entrepreneurial adventures, replete with late nights, red bulls and a shot at winning a grand prize – that the next generation of entrepreneurs is born.""
""A prime example of this is in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, which I am a team member of for the University of Melbourne this year. Our team stretches across many disciplines; from telecommunications and business to chemical engineering and science communication, even information technology - we are practically the UN of fields and backgrounds.""

Uppsala-Sweden,2009,Team:Uppsala-Sweden#Butanol_-_-_TEXT.html," precursor for isobutanol production is pyruvate, a central metabolite which is usually derived by the glycolysis. Two pyruvate molecules are converted first to 2-acetolactate and then subsequently to 2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate. A further dehydration reaction results in our first molecule of interest, 2-ketoisovalerate, which is a precursor for the synthesis of the amino acids valine, alanine and leucine. [2]
So far a native pathway has been utilized, our first BioBrick  for the Butanol approach, the codon-optimized version of the alpha-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (kivd) from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis is operating on these products. [3]
This particular enzyme performs a decarboylation reaction, and thus transforms 2-ketoisovalerate to an aldehyde, isobutanal. [4]
Subsequently isobutanal will be oxidized to isobutanol by an enzyme which is encoded by our BioBrick , the alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (adh2) from S. cerevisiae. [5]
Status
as of 2009-10-21
The Butanol construct is completed and is currently being evaluated in E.coli. While the transformation to Synechocystis is done it takes approximately two weeks for the colonies to grow to large enough size to be used in testing.

Introduction
Tuebingen is a special town - with its valued university and one third of its inhabitants being students there is a great interest in research and scientific progress. At the same time a lot of critical thoughts and opinions towards certain research topics exist. Among those are genetic engineering and synthetic biology, topics that are heavily criticized by people.
The iGEM Team Tuebingen tries to counteract these tendencies and improve the communication between science and the public. To accomplish this we organised two events to target different audiences and took action in a third event:
The SynBioDay started as an annual activity by iGEM teams where we try to explain the pros and cons of synthetic biology to the general public.  As a second project we invited a school class to the SchoolClass@Lab day.  Furthermore, we participated in the - open to public - scientific theme congress “RE-ENGINEERING LIFE oder Wollen wir unendlich sein?” (“RE-ENGINEERING LIFE, or Do We Want To Be Infinite?”), organised by the Theatre Freiburg."

Why are PAHs important?
Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial environments with crude oils (or petroleum) represents a fundamental problem worldwide that results in both immediate and long-term environmental damages, including toxicity to plants and soil invertebrates and with significant risks to humans and wildlife. Crude oils are predominantly composed of hydrogen and carbon. The massive ecological damage caused by oil spills in the ocean can largely be attributed to a subset of crude oils called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons account for approximately 80% of the total petroleum hydrocarbons in crude oils. Aromatic carbons such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) tend to be the most toxic and persistent molecular compounds in oil.
Applications of PAH-Degrading Bacteria
Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial environments with crude oils (or petroleum) represents a fundamental problem worldwide that results in both immediate and long-term environmental damages, including toxicity to plants and soil invertebrates in addition to significant risks to humans and wildlife.
Applications of PAH-Degrading Bacteria
Isolation and Understanding PAH Degradation Systems
CCA_San_Diego has isolated and modified two major PAH degradation pathways: fluorene and phenanthrene, in order to further understand the scope, efficiency, and application of these pathways for commercial use. These isolated systems serve to limit unwanted bacterial byproducts by allowing the selection of specific strains for expression, to allow for selection of optimal bacteria in field situations, and to reduce the use of harmful bacterial strains that contain many of the pathways we isolated.
Ocean Crude Oil Pump and Treatment
CCA_San_Diego designed bacteria to aid in the process of bioremediation for pump and treat ex-situ methods. Once spills are identified, contaminated sites may be pumped to remediation centers that contain our synthetic PAH-degredetory bacteria. Please see our applied design page for more information about this process.
Waste Treatment
Leaking waste containers, oil deposits, and landfills contributing to PAH contamination can be targeted for bioremediation efforts. Centers for remediation efforts may use"

Plasmid
DNA Fragments
Design PCR Primers according to the purpose of the experiment
The choice of the reaction system is dictated by the specific experiment
Taq System: to primarily validate the DNA sequence.
KOD System: to amplificate long DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Golden Mix System: for rapid amplification of DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Set up the reaction system according to the protocol of the product you use
If the target substrate is single colony, use pipette to pick up a minute quantity of bacteria. Inoculate the bacteria onto a plate for further use. Then pipet up and down for several times in the solution.
If the target substrate is liquid, add proper quantity of substrate according to the protocol of specific reaction system.
Choosing the Reaction Conditions
The choice of reaction conditions mainly depends on the reaction system you choose.
Validating the Reaction

Project Overview
Motivation:
Although it is one of the most studied field of science, Nanotechnology is lagging in application to solve problems in all fields of life. Nanoparticles are huge risk to the health of common people because their lack of biocompatibility. It is also very expensive to manufacture nanotechnology products because of their small size and complex materials used. In 2017 alone, the budget for nanotechnology research is $1.7 billion dollars, but the outcome of this research seemed to be not high applicable in various fields, especially for scientist with limited amount funding.
Our Aim:
Create a scaffold from material that can has following characteristics:
Biocompatible
Minimal Impact on health
Self-Assembling structure
Inexpensive to produce
Well characterized
dNANO
With dNANO, we have attempted to design and test DNA based Nano-scaffold that has application in wide range of field. Our choice of material, DNA fits the criteria that our aim established. The DNA is relatively non-toxic to the Human body and therefore it is Biocompatible. The synthetic DNA is inexpensive to produce and therefore to order to create massive amount, simple replication can create thousands of molecules. The self-assembling properties of the DNA is characterized and well understood since it is a polymer of four basic molecules.
We approached designing our DNA scaffold using advanced computer software such as CADnano2. The designing was done using M13mp18 DNA to keep the initial cost of the"

TokyoTech,2017,Team:TokyoTech#Experiment#TraI Assay_-_-_TEXT.html," was developed based on TraR (1). In this system, expression from the eukaryotic promoter (CMV minimal promoter) is induced only in the presence of C8. Therefore, we here chose C8 as a signal molecule and tried to engineer E. coli cells to produce C8.
Summary of experiment
In this section, we investigated whether E. coli cells expressing TraI protein produce a practical amount of C8.
To this end, two E. coli strains were constructed; one is the “Sender” strain which produces C8 and the other is the “Reporter” strain which expresses GFP in the presence of C8.
To begin with, it was investigated whether the “Reporter” cells expressed GFP when cultured in the medium containing various concentrations of C8 (0.1 nM -1000 nM).
In the previous similar experiment, the intensities of GFP fluorescence (Relative Fluorescence Units; RFU) have shown to follow Hill's equation (2). Therefore, in this study, the parameters of Hill's equation were obtained from the data and the concentrations of AHL were calculated from the values of RFU.
Then, the ability of the Sender to produce AHL was analyzed. The supernatant of the Sender was mixed with the actively growing culture of the Reporter, and the production of AHL was evaluated by observing the expression of GFP.
The following plasmids were introduced into E. coli.
Reporter E. coli
By introducing the plasmids shown in Fig. 2, E. coli cells are expected to produce GFP in response to C8 and C6. Note that Ptet is the constitutive promoter. Also, note that LuxR can accept C8 as well as the natural ligand, C6 (3); we here employed LuxR, but not TraR, because LuxR had been characterized far better than TraR in the preceding iGEM projects.
Fig. 2 Structure of the plasmids used for creating the “Reporter”
Sender E.coli
We created the Sender by introducing the plasmid shown in Fig. 3.
The Sender is expected to produce C8 constantly, because the traI gene is placed at downstream of the constitutive promoter, Ptet.
Fig. 3 Construction of TraI gene
Results
Assay using reagent AHLs
In order to analyze the ability of the Reporter to receive AHLs and to express GFP depending on AHL, defined concentrations of reagent AHLs were added to growing culture of the Reporter. It was confirmed that LuxR responded to C8 in a similar level to C6. RF"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling Prediction Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the prediction model. Nevertheless, another problem is brought about because this setting is contradictory to our model as the dynamic of mRNA is ignored before. In fact, the equilibrium of mRNA is a fast process when compared to proteins so we argue that the inclusion of mRNA dynamic will not give a picture differs a lot from the case in which mRNA dynamic is neglected. In addition, the dynamic of inducers is introduced, the cooperativity and the binding affinity of inducer to repressor proteins are also considered.
By applying the findings from the stability analysis to the modeling equations, we obtain the following prediction graphs:
Fig. 5. Prediction model of Tristable Switch. Graphs in the 1st row represent the inducer concentration change over time, in this case, a pulse of inducer molecule 2 is introduced to the system from t=100 mins to t=200 mins. The graphs in the 2nd row represent the dynamic of mRNAs corresponding to each of the three operons in the tristable system. The plots in the 3rd row represent the dynamic of the three repressors (i.e. LacI, TetR and Phl). While the graphs in the 4th row describe the reporter proteins’ (i.e. fluorescent proteins) dynamic over time.
From the graph, when a pulse of inducer 2 is introduced to the system, mRNA 2 and reporter protein 2 respond afterwards with concentrations increase from 0 to a high level, and the outputs (mRNA 2 and reporter protein 2) maintain at ‘on-state’ (i.e. high level of output) without decreasing back to ‘off-state’ (i.e. zero output level). In conclusion, from the prediction model, by applying suitable parameter values obtained from the stability analysis, it is simulated that upon addition of inducers, the corresponding state is switched on, which is indicated by the high and steady output level of the reporter protein. This behavior fits the design of Tristable Switch.

Result analysis:
Samples were checked by GC-MS and we found low pheromone signal. I may be due to agroinfiltered leaves showed necrosis. We have to repeat the experiment to confirm that our construction is not well tolerated by plants.
Additionally, we found that the alcohol precursor did not appear in the chromatogram. Nevertheless, the acetate product was present in higher quantities than the previous time, suggesting that higher yields can be obtained when the three  gens are placed in the same construction.

Cre- lox
The Cre- lox system was also successfully implemented and shown to work consistently with 600bp homology flanks (Weinstock et al. 2016) Recycling of selection markers, like antibiotic resistances, as well as the removal of incorporated genes becomes easy and reliable.
Also interesting for future protein related applications is, that a putative secretion signal was identified (Weinstock et al. 2016)

Methods
Natural Competence
What happened with the genetic Information when cells lysis? The DNA will be released to the environment. But can it be reused there? Or is the hole information lost?  Under certain circumstances other cells can take up the free DNA. This ability of cells is called competence. A special kind is the natural competence. These are bacteria that have genes in their genome encoded for proteins involved in the DNA recognition and uptake and in the integration in the genome.
In 1928 natural competence was first observed by Frederick Griffith even if he did not understand the genetics behind (Griffith et al.1928) . He already recognized that information can be transferred from one bacterium to another and thus he set the starting point of a big era to understand the DNA exchange. Thanks many more great scientists researched in this area, we now know alot about natural competence and the ability of some bacteria to take up free DNA. However, as in almost every research, there are still many open questions.
One of the most famous Vibrio species is Vibrio cholerae. This bacterial species triggers the disease called cholera, which is well known. However, this bacterium is like many other vibrio species also interesting for many other genetic features. When you think about how he has achieved his pathogenic properties, it come into your mind that this bacterium is maybe capable to do extensive gene transfer. What we know is, that the most Vibrio species are natural competence, that means that these organism can take up linear DNA from the environment und this genetic material can used for nutrients, to repair the genome or to promote horizontal gene transfer when integrated it into their genome by homologous"

Edinburgh_OG,2016,Team:Edinburgh OG#Experiments#Cyanobacteria_-_-_TEXT.html," sequences, coding sequences can sometimes be troublesome to work with, especially if these are not codon optimized for the selected organism. For the work group this would have meant that all the reporter protein sequences would have required four codon optimizations (for E. coli, Rhodococcus, Penicillium, Synechocystis). As an alternative, and to avoid this situation for further projects, a different approach was discussed and implemented. By trying to design a sequence based on all four codon preference tables, one could generate a sequence able to express well in all four hosts. Perhaps this might not be the most ideal sequence, but, one that could potentially help avoid some DNA synthesis costs.
In order to predict the sequences, reliable codon usage tables were required. These were obtained from the CUTG database from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute in Japan. For the organisms present in the database a lists of the codon usage of genes as well as the number of coding sequences that were evaluated (Nakamura et al. 2000). As a proof of concept, two algorithms were designed in order to predict a sequence for the fluorescent protein using Kazusa’s codon usage datasets. The iLOV fluorescent reporter was selected because of its previously mentioned advantages over other fluorescent proteins. The result was a predicted sequence from each algorithm (more can be found in the materials and methods section). The resulting sequences were named “welov1” and “welov2”.
Terminators
While promoter strength is a determinant of gene expression levels, the terminator also plays an important role in RNA processing related to variability in RNA half-life. Therefore selecting an appropriate terminator is key if one expects positive gene expression. For this research project the terminators used were two double terminators (B0015_DE, BBa_B0015_DF) identical except for their 3’ adapter regions. This was required in order to design level 2 devices. Fortunately, this Rho-independent terminator has been shown to work in both E. coli and Synechocystis in the past (Huang et al. 2010).
iGEM plasmids and Phytobrick standard
In the case of the new parts, these are required to be submitted in a standard Universal Acceptor vector (P10500). In order to correctly clone a part into P10500 some guidelines must be followed based on the PhytoBrick standard.

Figure 10: pUniprom-ramA was transformed into Rosetta cells containing a viral T7 polymerase which is activated by IPTG. Anti-HA tag western blot for RamA in pUniprom within the Rosetta cells (DE3). Cells were subcultured from an overnight at 37OC. Once an OD of 0.4 was reached the samples were added to a final concentration of 1mM IPTG. 1ml of this was pelleted and Laemlli buffer added before loading 15 µl samples onto the protein gel. SDS PAGE (12% acrylamide) was run and transferred to PVDF membrane followed by probing with anti-HA antibody.
We then conducted a plate reader experiment to better determine whether the presence or absence of bile salts (in this case Sodium Cholate, which is the salt of cholic acids) would make a significant difference to the activation of the promoter and to test whether the promoter would still be active in minimal media. From Fig 11 we can see that the promoter construct (PacrRA-gfp + ramA) is active with and without the addition of sodium cholate however, the activity in its presence is higher. Sodium cholate appears to have an effect but it’s significance is debatable. Figure 12 shows the activity of all constructs in the presence of Sodium cholate and in the absence of the transcription factor (RamA) the promoter is being activated. In conclusion we have discovered that this part is active in nutrient broth, MacConkey agar, sodium cholate-minimal media broth and minimal media without sodium cholate, we do note that in the presence of bile-like salts the activity of the promoter is increased. The mechanisms of how this works on a molecular level are still unknown.

Overview
    We believe that a project will not be excellent enough without creative design, diligent lab work, and serious human practice work. Design of the biological machine determines the upper limit of the project, and lab work determines the lower limit of the project. As for human practice work, it views iGEM and synthetic biology in a broader perspective, which is close to the exploration of social value and describes a bigger world that synthetic biology and iGEM exist.
 
    In order to describe this “bigger world” better, ZJU-China has been tried hard to collect the voices outside the lab and integrate the investigated issue into the design and the execution of our project.
 
    As previously mentioned, we explored the topic of public engagement/dialogue. We intended to call for the public’s attention through our attractive project and use their feedback to improve it and the way we tell the story of synthetic biology. What’s more, we also reflected our own conception.
 
 
Elementary activities
    We went to STEM science festival and science & technology museum in summer. And set up a stall in the exhibition hall. We used room escape game, decoding game using cadies as props, and a video telling a story based on synthetic biology to attract their attention and introduced synthetic biology to the public.
 
What’ the feedbacks?
 
 
What do we think and do?
 
    These feedbacks are the epitome of wonder and concern about synthetic biology. The old rejected things that may change their life instinctively, and were very serious about biosafety. The teacher welcomed the new idea of synthetic biology, and want to help the students to expand their horizon. The high school student were curious about what synthetic biology can"

Loading of Mammalian Cells and bacteria
To allow for single cell analysis, we need to reach the stage where most wells in our chip contain only one mammalian cell. We tried several techniques of administration of mammalian cells and bacteria to our chip. The optimal protocol proved to be:
Dilute the mammalian cells to a concentration of 15 cells/µL.
Load 3 mL of the cell suspension into the 6-well plate containing the chip.
Add bacteria to have a concentration of 15 cells/nL into the chip, after measuring the OD thanks to an OD600-bacterial density converter .
Mix the solution with a pipette carefully.
Let the cells adhere for 15 minutes.
Optionally, seal the chip with a coverslip.
Lactate sensing of cancer cells
As a prove that the lactate levels produced by cancer cells are enough to trigger GFP expression from our lldR-promoters, we introduced our bacteria into a nanowell plate, along with Jurkat cells. Fluorescence and  bacterial cell count were monitored using ImageJ and lead to data presented here .
Dilute the mammalian cells to a concentration of 15 cells/µL.

Our third SynBio Club event took place on August 15th and was focused on the use of synthetic biology to create a live virus. As well, this SynBio debated the ethics and morals involved with using synthetic biology, and our responsibilities as scientists to communicate our research. This presentation focused on a paper that was able to use techniques, that we commonly use through QGEM, to synthesize a live and infectious horsepox virus using elements of modern vaccinia virus. The researchers in the paper divided the DNA into ten fragments with overlapping segments, and then ligated the sequences together. They activated the virus by using cells that were already infected with Shobe Fibroma virus (SFV), creating the necessary environment that was capable of assembling the virus fragments together. The research paper noted that this strain could be used as a vaccine against smallpox in humans. It showed less virulence and harmful effects in mice, with also providing vaccine protection. Following the presentation on the paper, the group discussed whether this was a safety concern for the public, the dangers behind the ability to create a live virus, and the accessibility of DNA for synthetic biology practices.

KK Today is March 20th, two thousand thirteen
We were thrilled to get out plate of cholera today! Then we happened upon about 5 iGEM projects from previous years that involve quorum sensing and/or cholera. We were on the verge of beginning our lab work but our paradigm was suddenly shifted a few steps backward: we needed (and still need) to decide if we should continue working on our cholera project. Calgary’s 2008 iGEM team successfully cloned the quorum-sensing circuit into E.Coli and used it to detect and destroy E.Coli that was expressing AHL - whose homologs appears to be autoinducers of V. Harveyi and V.Fischeri. St. Andrew’s iGEM team faced off against cholera specifically, attempted to render it avirulent through generating high levels of cholera’s autoinducer CAI-1, but they did not tame cholera. They only managed to get the CAI-1 autoinducer to work in E.Coli.
We got our cholera from Annette, Dr. Robison’s lab manager. She plated it on Columbia media, and it had been sitting at 37 degrees C for 24 hours when she gave it to us. We don’t know the exact assay for growing biofilm in cholera, but some protocols suggest LB broth. Our plan is to use LB broth and let cholera grow (NOT shaking it, so that biofilm may grow freely).

(b) Test of VEGF-STEP in HeLa. 4 paralleled experiments were carried out, but the dynamic range was only 1.49 folds in HeLa cells.
In our dry lab, to improve the binding affinity, we have redesigned 3 receptor binding domains: VEGF-scFv, KDR Ig domain 3 and D-Dimer-scFv (Figure 6). Also, we have redesigned the DNA sequence of the tTA promoter, to enhance downstream expression (Figure 7).
Figure 6. Binding energy variation after redesigning.
Figure 7. An example for designing result (tTA promoter).
Based on theoretical calculation of Gibbs free energy, we can now design or redesign receptors in silicon to get maximum binding affinity with the ligand. With input structure of receptors and ligands, we can find out the interface of the ligand-receptor complex, calculate binding energy, and mutate some residues to improve it. Even if there is only sequence information, homology modeling can be used to predict the structure. We believe, with the input sequence or structure of any ligand, we can redesign, or do de novo design of the sequence of receptor, thus extending additional functions of our system.

Post Regional Jamboree
After returning from the Regional Jamboree, we focused on sequencing the major and minor capsid protein gene of our mutant phage and acquiring electron micrograph. This following section will present our newest findings up to Monday Oct 28.
Sequencing
We discovered that our S4 mutant (discussed above) contain a nucleotide insertion at position 407. In theory, this will lead to premature termination and truncated capsid protein. Below are figures comparing the gene and protein sequences of our mutant phage to that of WT.
Protein Modeling
We tried to map the mutation we discovered. The following are figures displaying the amino acid residue where mutation/frameshift took place. As can be seen from these figures, our mutation are placed at the interface of where capsid proteins interact. In theory, this will alter protein interactions, which will lead to altered capsid size for T7. We are currently working on identifying the mechanism behind this mutation (insertion).
Electron micrograph
The following is one of the electron micrographs that we obtained of our S4 mutant.

Cholera Induces Bacteriophage Lambda From Lysogeny to its Lytic Cycle
We discovered that lysogenic bacteriophage lambda responds to V. cholerae by lysing its host.  The picture to the right is of E.coli with integrated lambda prophage, plated as a top agar lawn.  To the top plate we streaked cholera in the center, while the bottom plate had no cholera.
We hypothesize that SdiA, a transcriptional activator in E.Coli, senses cholera's autoinducer molecules.  To test this, we have infected SdiA wild type and SdiA-knockout E.coli with bacteriophage lambda, and are in the process of performing top agar plaque-assay tests to confirm that lambda induction is SdiA-dependent. This image is in preparation.
Furthermore, we are researching an alternative method for lambda induction. Two proteins, cI and cro, are pivotal in determining whether lambda assumes, respectively, a lysogenic or lytic state.  We hypothesize that overexpression of the cro protein will influence lambda into its lytic cycle.  We have cloned CRO behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, transformed the plasmid into E.coli, and infected with lambda.  We will plate top agar lawns of this strain with and without arabinose, and anticipate results within the week.  This image is in"

An Overview of Alberta Regional Team Meet-ups
AN OVERVIEW OF ALBERTAN TEAM MEET-UPS
As members of the University of Calgary iGEM team and citizens of the province of Alberta, we are incredibly fortunate due to the backing of the Alberta Ingenuity Fund . The Alberta Ingenuity Fund (AIF) supports premier opportunities in the fields of Science and Engineering through financial support from the Government of Alberta. The goal of the organization is to build the capacity for innovation within Alberta to the end of creating lasting social and economic impacts. AIF recognizes that the iGEM program is one such premier opportunity and has supported all Alberta-based iGEM teams stemming from the Universities of Alberta, Calgary and Lethbridge since 2006.
Not only does AIF provide financial support for the Alberta-based teams, they also provide several opportunities to foster camaraderie (and healthy competition) amongst the three Alberta teams. These events began with the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines (AGEM) competition in September of 2008, an event to emulate"

Searching 2 new promoters since 2 promoters (bricks BBa K091107 and BBa K091104) we planned to use seemed to be something else than shown on the iGEM website. We decided to use pLac-lux hybrid BBa K091100 and lambda cI and luxR regulated-hybrid BBa R0065. We transformed these bricks into competent cells and grew these cells on agar plates. A new restriction digest was performed, this time ac- cording to the standard assembly instead of the 3A assembly method. Restriction of U, W, X, K and Z (FIG.6) .
All these fragments were gel purified.

Another restriction digest was performed, this time with biobricks GFP generator, LuxR, LuxI, pLac-lux hybrid, lambda cI and luxR regulated- hybrid, the constitutive promoter, BAD promoter and CrtEBI.
thurday 28th of July
Since the restriction of 27th July again didn't gave measurable DNA concentrations after gel purification, a new restriction digest of the same biobricks was performed (FIG.8) .
The primers of Eurogentec arrived and were used to start PCR of INP, MelA(Bba K193602), Ribolock (BBa J23031) and the 4 IGEM vectors.
friday 29th of July
A new PCR was performed with some adjustments to the protocol to give better results. This PCR resulted in amplification of the 4 vectors and Ribolock.

A new restriction was performed with 2000ng instead of 500ng of DNA. After DNA gel electrophoresis, only U (= constitutive promoter, Bba_j23119) and W (= pBAD, Bba_I13453) showed high enough concentration to cut them out of the gel. Since these were the only fragments, we didn’t start ligation.

For >2% gels, increase incubation time.  After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to yellow. The adsorption of DNA to the QIAquick membrane is efficient only at pH ≤7.5. Buffer QG contains a pH indicator which is yellow at pH ≤7.5 and orange or violet at higher pH, allowing easy determination of the optimal pH for DNA binding.
4. Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.  To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 1 min. The maximum volume of the column reservoir is 800 µL. For sample volumes of more than 800 µL, simply load and spin again.
5. Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection tube. Collection tubes are re-used to reduce plastic waste.
6.  To wash, add 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Note: If the DNA will be used for salt sensitive applications, such as blunt-end ligation and direct sequencing, let the column stand 2–5 min after addition of Buffer PE, before centrifuging.
7. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for an additional minute at ≥10,000 x g (~13,000 rpm). IMPORTANT: Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.

BNDS_China,2016,Team:BNDS China#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"ina holds a meeting session every week. Their Principal Investigator Xiaoling Yao and David Brackett has given all team members about the basic information of molecular biology. After acquiring a reasonable amount of knowledge, the team started their process of choosing the topic. Every member of the team has taken part in the discussions and all decided to choose the bacterial hard water softener as the project of BNDS_China.
IV. Conducting the experiment
Stucking from getting the kit and the gene, the team officially started their experiments in late August, where many other teams have already finished their project or at least half of them. At first, coming to the lab is not arranged in a formal schedule and people come to the lab whenever they wanted. However, the consequence of this policy creates an issue of really low efficiency. Then the team leader assigned tasks for different students for the time left (October 10-22). Zhongxiu Hu, Yuanyi Xu, Longyin Wang, Ziqi Wang, Yunpeng li, Hao Yu, Xin Luo, Tianlin Zhao are put into groups and work for two days each. The whole project was connected by Zhongxiu Hu who sent lab notes to team members.
V. Wiki design
Hongliang Xiong and Yifei Yao contributed to the team by writing the style of the team wiki. They had studied html, css, and java script by themselves in their spire time. The first draft of the wiki was written by Yuanyi Xu, Longyin Wang, Yunpeng Li, Yifei Yao, Hongliang Xiong, Zhongxiu Hu. Hongliang Xiong, Yifei Yao, Zhongxiu Hu, and our Principal Investigator, Xiaoling Yao, edited the final version of the wiki.
VI. Teachers' helps
Xiaoling Yao is the person who always took the same challenges with us. Not only instructing about molecular biology experiments, she acts as our model of a responsible researching conductor. When we have failed and depressed, we saw hopes from her encouragements and kept working on the project.
David Brackett is the person who always has solutions to the problems we met in the competition. He has lots of valuable suggestions that we can apply.
As for our advisor Xiangmei Dou, she guided us in a more general way. She kept reminding us of the importance of maintaining a clean and comfortable lab.

Freiburg,2012,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractices#Evenings_-_-_TEXT.html,"etermination problem, because we can explain what a trait is referring to both, technical functions and biological functions. Imagine following situation:
A synthetic biologist produces modified bacteria which are susceptible to glucose and that assist the treatment of diabetes in human beings. These bioengineered bacteria have a synthetic toggle switch which is activated when the blood sugar level reaches a tolerance threshold and allows the transcription of a substance to help the uptake of glucose from the blood. The decrease of glucose in blood allows the bacteria to live on.
If we want to explain why the bacteria have a toggle switch, we can say two things: this toggle switch enables the production of a substance, which decreases the amount of blood sugar and hence helps the treatment of diabetes or this toggle switch enables the production of a substance which decreases the amount of blood sugar and is therefore beneficial for the bacteria (and the occurrence of this toggle switch in the bacteria is the result of a feedback mechanisms involving the exercise of producing the substance). The bacteria has also a synthetic toggle switch, because it was constructed so or because it helps the whole system to live. If both functional explanations are correct in the same context, then we have a faulty overdetermination (two causes for one effect).
Publications we worked with:
[18] Holm S (2011a): Biocentrism and Synthetic Biology. App Ethics 62-74
[19] Krohs U, Kroes P (eds) (2009): Functions in biological artificial worlds. MIT press, Cambridge
Eighth meeting - Technical functionality: solution
We decided to work with to two different theories of functions in order to encounter the abovementioned overdetermination problem. On the one hand we studied the ICE-theory for the ascription of technical functions by agents ([20],[21]). On the other hand we studied the organisation account of biological functions ([22],[23],[24]). By the products of synthetic biology both ascriptions of functions are possible – although we noticed that the technical function ascription applies imperfectly. Through the analysis of specific situations and counterexamples we showed that the technical function ascription is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the products of synthetic biology per se. The explanation based on biological functions makes a closure, due to the circular causality of living systems, which makes every reference to human intentionality dispensable. To make this account clear, we can examine the following example:
The hidden entities
In a fictive secret part of our world a civilisation of human beings with an impressive scientific knowledge existed. They constructed impressive machine-like entities, which were capable of moving around and do things, but not to (re)produce,"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"AGE . An RNase alert fluorescence assay from Gootenberg et al. 2017 was used to show the functionality of Cas13a. Additionally, the fluorescence assay enabled us to test the efficiency of different guides (different crRNAs) designed using our novel crRNA design tool .
Sample preparation - From milk to RNA
Cas13a needs an RNA target to detect. Therefore, the bacterial DNA present in a milk sample first needs to be isolated, amplified and transcribed to RNA. DNA can be isolated by either boiling the cells or by the use of a microwave described by Dashti et al. 2009 . We decided to try out both with consecutive amplification and transcription. This included testing the sensitivity of our methods and testing the target in a cleavage assay using Cas13a. We also put effort into constructing a centrifuge ourselves. Lastly, we used our ‘ motif finder ' to design primers that could be used to amplify resistance genes from mastitis pathogens (blaZ genes).
Achievements
Easy DNA isolation
To see if we were able to use the easy DNA extraction method described by Dashti et al. 2009 , we repeated the control steps of the paper. We tried the boiling- and microwave- method on bacteria of the KEIO-strain (JW0729). We used PCR primers that anneal to the kanamycin resistance gene to test our DNA extraction method.
We used the microwave and boiling method described in the DNA isolation protocol. Next, we amplified a specific DNA-sequence of the KEIO-strain with primers IG0014 and IG0015 ( GoTaq PCR ). If the primers annealed, a band of size ~750 bp was expected. To be sure that the amplified fragment was the right one, we did a digestion with BsrBI, to obtain DNA-fragments of sizes approximately 250 bp and 500 bp ( Digestion ). We checked the sample on a gel ( DNA electrophoresis ), as shown in Figure 11.
Figure 11: Digestion of PCR product on DNA extracted by DNA isolation methods. The number of cells are indicated in each lane. The microwave extraction entails using the microwave for 10 seconds, while the longer microwave extraction was for 20 seconds.
We can conclude that both methods are suitable to isolate DNA from gram-negative bacteria. However, the boiling method was more user-friendly. This is because the settings of different microwaves are not always the same. For example, when we tried our protocol with another microwave, the tubes containing the samples burst open.

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," discipline produces a scientific discourse (theories, hypothesis, experiments, results), but does it produce a true technical culture? The iGEM competition promotes synthetic biology practices based on openness and sharing: the research is open-source, meaning that everything is accessible. This achieve a scientific objective: everything is reproducible, and thus experiments can be confirmed or countered. Technically speaking, this openness is crucial: the technical culture requires maximum knowledge, but also maximum reproducibility in order to be shared not only theoretically but also practically. The iGEM competition thus promotes a true technical culture of synthetic biology.
Considering engineering process in synthetic biology, the technical culture is dual: on one hand there are the technical procedures, the machines researchers use, the way experiments are made, on the other hand there are the beings produced, the genetically engineered living machines. In other words: researchers in synthetic biology deal with traditional technical objects (the machines they use) and with unconventional technical objects (the living machines they produce). At this state of development of the discipline, the two faces of the technical culture in synthetic biology are linked: for example, developments of DNA-sequencing and DNA-synthesizing have facilitated the development of the engineered living machines.
Team discussion
A good exemple of technical alientation is computer. Contrary to a dogma, young generations do not really know how to use a computer. Indeed, operating system (OS) are design to be more and more “user-friendly”. 20 years ago, computers’ owner had to put his shoulder to the wheel if they wanted their computer working. This phenomenon is even worse with smartphone: people do not think and do not know how their data transits. On the contrary, free software principle allows informed users to participate to software improvement: they can modify the code and think about how the software works.
To give one light-hearted example , free software principle was originally imagined by Richard Stallman because he noticed bugs in UNIX system . He decided to correct thoses bugs and contacted UNIX developpers. When the developpers refused to let him improve UNIX, he decided to create his own OS : GNU project (GNU Not Unix) and define the bases of free software (use, share, study, modify). Free software are a good basis that allow everyone to share his own improvements but there is a lot of people that use them without understanding them.
Now, the question is: Are standardization, reproducibility and automation creating a true technical culture, or are they leading us toward “user-friendly synthetic biology”? Rephrased: Today synthetic biology is structuring itself, would it choose to share"

Details of Partial Differential Equation Model
We know that the movement of any material is ruled by the certain laws of nature (physical and chemical laws). We establish some mathematical model including partial differential equations to describe these rules especially the mechanism of numerical relationships in the tubulin.
We build the partial differential equations and definition conditions based on the conservation laws.
The tubulin solution area \(\Omega\)  is thought to be a kind of fluid motion. In the solution there are many assembling of tubulins, the hydrolysis, aggregations and disaggregation of the protein filaments. Although the mechanisms of these biological phenomena are still uncertain but we can build the equations based on conservation laws, which certainly rule the biomass.
We take a solution area as our study object. The quantity in the solution area is certainly ruled by conservation laws no matter what shape of the area is. Our models are based on conservation of mass.
We choose a solution area \(D\)  in the \(\Omega\) . Considering in the time range  , according to the mass conservation:
\(\overrightarrow{f_1}\) is the velocity of assembling of the solution which flow into the \(D\) . \(\overrightarrow{f_1}\)  can be regarded as the product of the velocity \(\overrightarrow{v}\) and the assembling ratio \(k\) . However, there is no need to consider the  \(\overrightarrow{v}\) and \(k\) . The inflow mass during  \(dt\) through any  \(dS\) of the \(\partial D\)  can be given:
$$-\rho \cdot \overrightarrow{f_1} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \cdot dS \cdot dt$$
\(\overrightarrow{n}\) is the unit normal vector toward outside so there is a minus in formula. \(\rho\) is the density of the tubulin solution in \(D\) . In a similar way \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\) is the velocity of the disaggregation mass which flow out the \(D\)  and \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\)  can be considered as the product of outflow velocity  \(\overrightarrow{v_2}\) and disaggregation ratio \(r\) there is no need to consider the  \(\overrightarrow{v_"

These safety precautions are not very complicated but very important when eliminating risks concerning our project, particularly when taking into consideration that some risks our project poses at the laboratory stage include: bacterial contamination; contact with harmful acids, nucleic acid stains, restriction enzymes, Keratinase; burns caused by a flame or warm glass or metal.
Lab work workshop at the University of Lethbridge
We have also taken into account some more complicated precautions having to do with the creation of our construct and the different forms of bacteria that we will use to build it. For the basic construction of our project we have planned to utilize an IPTG inducible promoter, but we plan to put a different promoter in the construct for implementation, as a way to allow for a control while testing within the lab in our assays we will perform. We plan on putting a different promoter in the construct, to make sure it is safe for implementation, as well as an efficient and cost-effective method, due to the cost of IPTG. We have also planned to implement a strong kill switch into our construct to allow for ultimate safety if ever the enzyme were to get into the environment or denature. The strain of E. Coli we are using is K-12, a genetically modified, non pathogenic bacterium which has a low probability of survival outside of a petri dish. Furthermore we do not plan to experiment with any other organisms besides our chassis E.coli, a lab strain that is not harmful to humans. We have grown our bacteria on plates that contain different antibiotics such as ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and placed a resistance to the antibiotic within the constructs to help ensure that our bacteria that grows is what is needed with our construct and stay safely inside the petri dish.
For our tests in the near future we will be performing both a qualitative and a quantitative assay in order to test the effectiveness of our project in more than just one way. These assays will be performed on both real hair and feathers meaning that we must take into consideration certain safety precautions. Many of the steps we will take to ensure safety will be our basic lab safety precautions, however some will be more complex such as learning to deal with the byproducts of the reaction, how to extract them safely to potentially be put towards a new product, and in which conditions we should perform this test to keep all students at our school safe from anything given off by our assays. We will maintain our safety standards while measuring in our assays to ensure our construct can be the best it can"

7/30/2015: Day 43
Today was poster session day!! We started the day off by printing our beautiful poster and finishing up details with the tangibles, practiced our presentations, and went down to the science library to present!
I felt very excited and proud to show what we had worked so hard on to create.  The Multitaction itself drew many interested attendees, and we were swamped with people asking questions and asking to test it out.  The best part was having some younger attendees (probably age 7 - 9) playing with it-- they were enthralled!  They kept making different combinations of genes and trying to provide resources to Mars to fill the resource status bars.  Most of our prototype testing had been with an older audience, so it was very relieving and exciting to see how captivated the younger audience was.

Brainstorming with Romie and Anja
Today Romie and Anja came to help us brainstorm ideas for our iGEM project. All of us worked together to come up with ideas that would be able to be converted into a museum exhibit. The energy in the lab was truly amazing and we all really gave all that we had. It was one of the precious times in the lab where everyone was working together on the exact same thing and was 100% focused. We also turned all the lab walls into brainstorming space, sticking post-its with ideas on the walls and writing around them to group them together. It was also very interesting to see what other people were coming up with. It also felt like coming up with science fiction ideas that could be made into reality. My favorite things being mentioned involved changing elements in food to make them better and easier for consumption.
NEGEM
Today was the New England GEM meeting (NEGEM). All teams from the New England area came together at Boston University, where we all presented our ideas for what our iGEM project would be. The atmosphere in the room was amazing and it was really interesting to see what other teams were working on. It was also very informative since I was coming from a computer science perspective when everyone else was on syn-bio track. It was also a very good way to get feedback from other teams on our ideas and our progress. We also were able to find teams to collaborate with, which will be very useful for our progress. In general, it was a great experience and very educational one. I am looking forward to more meetings until the competition and our collaboration with the BU and MIT teams.

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Tar_-_-_TEXT.html,"The second approach that we aimed to explore is the construction of a library with random mutations on the whole sensory domain, as reported in Derr et al. [2]. For this reason, we designed two pairs of primers, one that amplifies the       interesting part of the gene and the other one that amplifies the remaining portion of the plasmid. Once again BBa_K777001 was used as a template.
The fragment containing the backbone was amplified using high fidelity Phusion polymerase. The fragment containing the sensory domain was amplified using Taq polymerase with addition of MnCl2, which competes with MgCl2 and interferes with the       polymerase activity to obtain an error-prone amplification. The protocol was optimized for both fragments, for the first one the most effective way to obtain such a long fragment (>3 kb), was to add 2.5% glycerol and perform a touch-up PCR going from 65 °C to 72 °C, increasing the temperature by 1 °C       every 5 cycles. For the error-prone PCR multiple protocols were tested, using either Taq or Pfu polymerase.       Finally, the most successful conditions were found to be using Taq polymerase, a biased proportion of dNTPs (0.2 mM dATP and dGTP, 1 mM dCTP and dTTp), 0.1 mM of MnCl2 and 2.5 mM of MgCl2. Refer to the protocol for a more       detailed description       of the steps and the PCR mix assembly.
Once a pool of mutated sensory domains is generated, it is crucial to loose as little diversity as possible in the successive steps in order to have a high-quality library. For this reason, the assembly and the transformation need to be as       efficient as possible.       After DpnI digestion and PCR clean-up of the two fragments, the two were ligated using the high-fidelity commercial Gibson assembly mix and transformed in DH5alpha chemically competent cells. Many different conditions were tested to obtain the best coverage possible (i.e. the maximum number of clones with mutations). We tried adding a desalting step after Gibson, using electroporation instead of chemical transformation, we compared       different ratios of fragments in the Gibson assembly mix and different strains of E. coli were assayed. The method that resulted in the highest number of mutants was transforming 5 µL of the Gibson assembly (assembled with 2:1 ratio of       fragment to backbone, with a total final amount of 0.2 pmole of"

Collaboration
iGEM NTHU
In this September, we received the invitation to have a collaboration with iGEM NTHU . NTHU detected environmentally hazardous substances while our project is focusing on the sensing of nitrate concentration. They try to give a broader aspect. However, we try to give a more detail sensing system. Thus, we had a profound discussion of both teams’ projects. Moreover, we also shared our fluorescence idea of 2016 and 2017 with them.
After mutual inspection and troubleshooting with both projects, we were enlightened to expand our sensing device to detect more substances like environmental hormone even heavy metal in the future, which would make our project more practical. Also, NTHU offered their investigation results of aquaculture questionnaire to us. These questionnaires strengthened our data integrity and made our project more fit to the market demand.
This collaboration combined both teams’ detecting projects. We exchanged our hardware design, principle, commercial value, and strategies, making both our projects more compatible.
Collaboration in Biosafety
Last year, we successfully constructed biobrick BBa_K1920006, an arabinose induced cell lysis complication biobrick (P_BAD-RBS-lysis-B0015), but it is not available in the distribution kit of 2017 competition. Before the meet-up with iGEM MDHS and iGEM CSMU (click here to see more), we got a information that Mingdao were interested in this brick and want to combine it into their project for biosafety design. Thus, it’s our honor to provide five Biobricks and PCR production of our construction and handed over to them in the meet-up."

Proof of concept
Five different plasmids were constructed with the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard in order to verify the systems function in filamentous fungi. To ensure a successful transformation the backbone plasmid pFun has two NotI restriction sites flanking the device to be inserted. Hereby, the device can be cut out of the plasmid and the linearized DNA fragments can be transformed into the fungus. The devices for proof of concept are not designed to be inserted at a specific site in the fungal genome. Therefore, the device can be integrated at any site and with a random number of copies by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This means that the possibility of the disruption of essential genes exists.
The fungal proof of concept plasmids, were constructed with the strong constitutive promoter PgpdA , the TtrpC terminator, and the pyrG marker cassette . Different genes encoding fluorescent proteins were included in the reporter system, where different compartments of fungi could be targeted. The reporter system was designed to target the nucleus, peroxisomes, and the mitochondria. All transformations were performed in the Aspergillus nidulans laboratory strain: argB2, pyrG89, veA1.
We here prove that the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard can easily be applied for the construction fungal plasmids. The constructed plasmids were transformed into A. nidulans and in each case the fluorescent protein was expressed. Only the strain transformed with pJEJAM16 targeting GFP to the mitochondria did not"

Mason Lab Ten-Phase, 500-year plan
The Case for Existence
1.  Assume that humans are the only species or entity with self-awareness of its own extinction.
2.  Assume that existence is essential for any other goal/idea to be accomplished (“existence precedes essence”).
3.  Therefore, humans who wish to accomplish any goal/idea should ensure the existence of our species, and all other species that enable our survival.
Proposed long-term goals of the human species:
Establish habitable environments in multiple star systems, to avoid extinction due to a cataclysmic event in one solar system.
Improve the ability of humans and other species to survive in spaced-based environments or on other planets
Genetic engineering
Requires a “do-not disturb” list for the human genome; regions that cannot or should not be altered
Engineer mammalian insulators that can carry genetic payload safely
Establish long-term safety, efficacy, and functional characterization of genomes which have been engineered
Improved DNA damage detection and repair (vis-à-vis Deinococcus Radiodurans)
Protective technology (Nano-fabrication of radiation absorbers)
Achieve peaceful relations between nations or planets
To accomplish these goals, the Mason Lab pursues an understanding of the human genome through a 50-year plan, with the final elements of the plan (of course) estimated to exceed the lifetimes of the founding members.
Phase 1 (2010-2020)
Experiments that complete the functional annotation of the human genome, specifically experiments that delineate base-by-base examination of those elements which cannot be changed, or those that are most flexible (tolerant of mutations).  We will use comparative, evolutionary functional genomics and an examination of those human diseases that constitute the most aggressive deviations from normal biological function (such as aggressive tumors) to understand the genome.

Position effects
Bryant and colleagues showed that the expression level of a gfp gene cassette varies ~300 fold, depending of its position on the E. coli chromosome. We assume that the potential integration sites, in Vibrio natriegens, also vary in their gene transcription. To rationally choose an optimal integration site rationally, potential integration sites must have their transcription levels characterized. The amount of transcription that will take place in an integration site is influenced by multiple factors.
 
Common regulatory factors,
The local general enhancers and repressors, with for example recruit the RNA-polymerase to a nearby promotor or facilitate the formation of the open complex (Wu et al. 2017).
 
DNA-methylation
It has been shown that the expression regulation of some genes is based on the DNA’s secondary structure caused by methylation. In E. coli GATC sites are methylated and can influence the transcription of nearby genes (Plasterk et al., 1983). We expect this to also be the case in Vibrio natriegens, so this must be considered when selecting an integration site.
 
Superhelical density
Adjacent genes can cause transcription coupled DNA supercoiling, the strength of the supercoiling depends on the transcription rate and the length of the transcribed region (Liu and Wang, 1987) . It is also known that microorganisms possess negatively supercoiled domains. It has been shown that the strength of some promotors, can be affected by supercoiling (Sobetzko, 2016) . We expect integration sites that are close to highly transcribed regions to be affected by DNA-supercoiling and to exhibit unexpected transcription levels.
 
Histone like proteins
One master regulator in bacterial cells are histone like proteins such as H-NS, they bind to the DNA and affect the nearby gene expression (Sobetzko, Travers and Muskhelishvili, 2012) (Sobetzko, Travers and Muskhelishvili, 2012). The effect of histone like proteins on our integration sites gene expression can vary extremely, depending on if and what kind of histone like proteins bind nearby.
 
Distance to the origin of replication
Through multiforked replication some chromosomal region have multiple copies. It has been show that chromosomal integration sites close to the ori"

Structural Verification
To validate whether the protein is still stable, we performed a second 10 ns MD simulation with the mutated protein. The RMSD plot shows a RMSD of 0.2 nm, which can be interpreted as stable conformation, regarding the substitution of four phyicochemical totally different amino acids (Figure 11.1). Most of the differences between both structure can again be mostly explained changes in flexible loops of the protein (Figure 11.2).

Figure 11.2: Structural alignment of the mutated botulinum toxin C binding domain with the WT binding domain.
Conclusion
We developed a comprehensive, modular workflow called BERT for the automated deimmunization of proteins. By applying BERT to various protein and subsequent molecular dynamics simulations sequences we demonstrated the immense power and precision of BERT. BERT not only decreases the immunogenicity by large amounts, it also does so while preserving the structural integrity of the deimmunized protein. We applied BERT on the binding domain of the botulinum neurotoxin C and were able to reduce the immunogenicity drastically.
Furthermore, we externally validated BERT on an previously to us unknown protein provided in an intensive collaboration with team Paris-Bettencourt. The very convincing results and validations of our approach can be found on the Collaborations site.
Our very modular code structure allows us to release all of BERTs modules: MHCBoost, EvoCS and CoReM as standalone tools for other researchers to use them for either specific scientific questions or for the development of other workflows.
With our innovative idea to combine the output of multiple machine learning tools based on modern machine learning methods, we achieved excellent computation time and results.
Moreover, we adhered to software development best practices. During the exciting development sprints we were using an agile development structure. Features were implemented on separate branches in two week long sprints, followed by pull requests and code reviews by our very small developer team. Our continous integration setup which is using Travis, ensured that each feature was firstly still passing tests and secondly and most importantly, the project was still building without any errors. To enable easy debugging and inform users about the current status of our tools on runtime, we also incorporated LOG messages at different log levels, such as 'debug' for developers and 'info' for users.

Original Text: To make the process more time efficient, it would be useful to improve the layout of the office spaces. The same principle can also be implemented in enzymatic cascades by bringing the enzymes into closer proximity using so-called surface layer proteins. [Efficiency!!!] Surface layers, or in short S-layer, are prokaryotic protein membranes, which assemble into two-dimensional lattices. Depending on the organism, the S-Layer proteins have different symmetries, like oblique, squared or hexagonal, resulting in specific structural patterns of the assembled lattices. These characteristic properties allow the fixation of enzymes to the surface in a regular fashion. Regarding the office space metaphor, the S-Layer proteins determine the most efficient layout of the office spaces, that allow the employees — the bound enzymes — to work more efficiently.

Re-plate top agar assays for SdiA+ and SdiA- lysogens, with cholera or with H202 as a positive control.
10/18/13
This time, our top agar lawns were not contaminated, however, we did not see the results we expected!  Not one plate had any plaques, not our lawns of SdiA+ lysogens, nor SdiA- lysogens, not by H202 induction nor induction by v. cholerae's AHLs.  So, either our lysogens aren't extremely lysogenic, or the do not have prophage Lambda and are not lysogens at all.  There is evidence that they are indeed lysogens, because Wednesday I streaked lines of each lysogen across a place and attempted to infect with a microliter of bacteriophage Lambda.  None of the lysogens showed any plaques, meaning that none could be superinfected.
We started a PCR reaction for each plate with primers targeting the CRO gene in bacteriophage Lambda.  If we see bands on the gel for CRO, then we know that they are lysogens.
10/21/13
We visualized the PCR reactions from Friday on a gel.  The only plate that appears to indeed have bacteriophage Lambda is one SdiA- lysogenic lawn (see gel).  We began an overnight culture of this lysogen, and plated it on LB/CAM just to ensure that it isn't contaminated, because our SdiA- knockout strain has kanemycin resistance integrated into the genome.
10/23/13
Today we set up top agar tests to check our SdiA- knockout strain. We are hoping to see plaques tomorrow. We plated on four different plates. We plated on a kanemycin plate with cholera added, a kanemycin plate with just the cells, a LB plate with cholera, and a LB plate with H202.
10/25/13
None of our plates showed any plaques.  We either have some sort of super-prophage in a super-lysogen, OR it is possible that the SdiA protein is necessary for both H202-induced AND V.cholerae-induced lysis by Lambda.  The literature we had read (Nina Molin Høyland-Kroghsbo, Rasmus Baadsgaard Mærkedahl and Sine Lo Svenningsen. A Quorum-Sensing-Induced Bacteriophage Defense Mechanism. mBio 4(1). "

iGEM Chinese Guiding Book
For promoting synthetic biology our team have made a synthetic biology guiding book featuring many experimental protocols and well-illustrated graphics which could help people know the purpose of experiment much easier. This year, new iGEM members in our team learned experimental technique by this guiding books. We believe passing down knowledge and following up works meet the purpose of the iGEM community. We hope Chinese-speaking iGEM teams can also be benefited by our guiding book. Feel free to download via the link down below.

Surveys

Few weeks ago, we did a survey on public and inquired their degree of comprehension about synthetic biology. We collected the data and made the diagrams below. We offered these questions to the participants of our iGEM conference and required them to hand back the questionnaire. Through the results, we can roughly find out how much they understand about synthetic biology. Furthermore, we also offered the surveys to public in order to get more information of those who are not iGEMers.
The pie chart clearly show that the participant in our survey is consisted of almost half iGEMers and half non iGEMers.
Compared to the first image, we think that iGEMers must have heard about synthetic biology. So we can know that half of non iGEMers have ever heard of synthetic biology . Meaning that , we have successfully convey the concepts of synthetic biology. Still, we have a lot of progressing space to promote biology related knowledge.
According to the image, it is prominent that half of the participants knew about synthetic biology from school, and with certain percentages, from popular science books and Internet. We can find out that in spite of schools, public media also plays an important role in spreading synthetic biology. But people from school are a lot more aware of it. With that said, we can spread the concepts of synthetic biology through more different measures in the future .
From the image, we got that most participants heard about synthetic biology in freshman and sophomore during college career. Surprisingly, no people have heard of it during junior high and fewer during senior high. As a result, we may focus on the younger generation to spread the idea of synthetic biology in the future.

The major differences between the results and our theoretical values was the later maximum GFP concentration and the difference between the measured maximum and the theoretical maximum for 9×10-9moles/dm-3 of miRNA. In order to delay the peak in GFP concentration the rate of RNA decay had to be decreased. We also introduced a term for GFP degradation, to account for the peak in fluorescence. We then tried to fit the data by changing the parameters with these ideas in mind. The new values for these parameters were:

This been my second time participating in the iGem competition I am a 17-year-old student in fifth semester of junior high. Having the Japanese and Mexican Nationalities is what makes me unique. I am as an Asian has to be “naturally” (such a stereotype -_-) interested in science and technology, but besides that I am a really open minded and a happy person. That’s why I have the best of both sides of Mexico and Japan. I was really interested in the competition because I could learn more about a topic that I am passionate about and to experience such an international and intercultural event will make my world bigger than the really one. This year been the president of the team gave me an irreplaceable opportunity which opened my eyes and realize how difficult is to accomplish something, but not impossible.

Why fit in when you were made to stand out?” I am sure there is no better description of me than these Dr. Seuss' words. I am an 18-year old senior, who is passionate about life. Growing up, I have always been a very hyperactive girl: fond of music, people and science. I love dancing, singing, meeting new people and places, and of course learning how and why things work. This peculiar mashup has led me to learn invaluable lessons. I guess my biggest goal is to make the difference, create the change I have always looked for.

Figure 3. Growth curves of BL21 under different concentration of Cd2+
According to the graph of growth curve, we can reach these conclusions:
(a) Adding of Cd2+ to media impedes the growth of wild type E.coli. But after 18h, wild type bacteria grow in low concentration of Cd2+ media (lower than 0.2mM) will reach the same platform stage as the group of media without Cd2+. Higher concentration of Cd2+(over 0.4mM) will limit the platform stage to a lower OD600.
(b) The metabolism of cysteine by CysDes slows down the growth of E.coli and delays the start of exponential stage compared to the wild type. But BL21 expressing CysDes can still reach the platform stage after 18h in the nearly same concentrations as the wild type.
(c) Adding of Cd2+ to media can also obstacle the growth of E.coli expressing CysDes and delay the start of exponential stage. But the change of Cd2+ concentration has no obvious effect on growth curve and cells expressing CysDes grow under 0.4mM Cd2+ can reach a higher concentration approximate to the group of 0.1mM and 0.2mM Cd2+ than the wild type.
(d) The expression of CysDes does strengthen the E.coli ‘s resistance of Cd2+ toxicity, but also slow the growth of E.coli to some extent. We can supplement the media with appropriate amount of cysteine to reduce the negative impact caused by the expression of CysDes.
4. Enzymatic activity analysis of CysDes in vitro
To analysis the enzyme activity of CysDes, we choose to detect the concentration of S2- which is reduced from cysteine under the catalysis of CysDes. Because of lacking appropriate purifying methods, we just analyze the activity of raw enzyme obtained via bacteria lysis. According to the method described in L.Chu et al. of hydrogen sulfide detection, we first cultivate the 1mL mixture of cysteine, PBS buffer and raw enzyme for 2h at 37 ˚C. Sulfide formation was determined by adding 0.1 ml of 0.02 M N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2 N HCl and 0.1 ml of 0.3 M FeCl3 in 1.2 N HCl to the reaction tubes. The absorbance at"
