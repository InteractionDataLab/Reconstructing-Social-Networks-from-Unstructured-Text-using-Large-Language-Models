MIT,2014,Team:MIT#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," ourselves, we sought to design our system such that the safest, most effective, and most publicly acceptable method of delivery would be used.
      We began by interviewing professionals in the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer’s disease (see Interviews ). Armed with the industry opinion and our own research, we designed various methods of delivery and considered the pros and cons of each.
      We also considered the necessity of public approval of the system for it to be effective as a therapeutic. This led to the formulation of our public opinion survey .
      Ultimately, these considerations aided us in designing the system that we have developed. We targeted the path of neuron delivery, but also explored numerous other delivery options.

Let it solidify for about 5 minutes.
Unclip the gels from the clasps and gently.
Wash the glasses with water to remove the urea (make sure not to move the glasses, make sure that no water enter).
Put the glasses into the cassette (movable green sides to fixate the glasses securely).
N.B: If you are only running one gel, you should add a little plastic space holder so the space inside the cassette is safely closed.
Fill the inside of the cassette with 1X TBE Buffer. Nothing should leak.
Put the cassette into the big plastic container used to run the gel and fill this with 1X TBE buffer until the 2 gels mark.
Wash the wells with the 1xTBE buffer already in the gel cassette.
Let the gel pre run in the incubator for 1 to 2 hours at 300V. (Temperature of the gel should be between 40 and 60°C).
Sample preparation
In a 200 μl PCR tube, put 2 μl of the 2X RNA loading dye and 2 μl of the desired sample or ladder.
It helps to put some dye on the side of the gel (first and last well) to have the samples in between the dye as it protects the RNA.
Let the reaction run for 28 minutes at 300V.
Put 100 ml of 1x TBE buffer to the SYBER_SAFE box and add 10 μl of the gel red stain.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," survey results combined with our analysis and discussion, We believe that Chinese girls need more opportunities and platforms to improve the ability of independent critical thinking. And iGEM, as a competition encouraging innovation and creativity, should undoubtedly provide such a platform for girls. As a team consisting of many girls, we ought to do something to help change the situation. However, we spent a lot of time on designing, handing out and analyzing the questionnaires, which left us little time to react upon these findings. Therefore, we plan on starting a GILR-UP Campaign after the Giant Jamboree. We also suggest that iGEM perhaps could add some more elements that can help develop girl power in the future.
Collaboration on lab safety
In the Chinese academic society, safety education is an essential but usually neglected component of the lab training, which, unfortunately, has led to numerous tragic accidents. To our astonishment, only limited material on this matter can be easily accessed within the Chinese academic and educational atmosphere. Therefore, we planned a Chinese voice-over lab safety educational video shooting event together with Shanghai Technology University, Wuhan University, and some other Chinese universities. We were inspired greatly by the Yale Biosafety Manual, and divided the tasks into several parts and assigned them to each school. Our part was to shoot an introductory video on the safe operation on several commonly used equipment.
Sorry, the video is not spupported by your browser. video.

Recruitment Campaign
Since the very beginning of team iGEM BNU-China, we've been optimising the process of team member selecting and training to better prepare our iGEMers. To generalize our past experiences and standardize the recruitment and training for our new iGEMers, we have compiled a handbook in Chinese. The handbook contains all essential contents of building up an iGEM team and specific procedures throughout the whole competition. With this handbook, every new iGEMer will have good command of what needs to be done in iGEM and how to accomplish them. It will significantly enhance the efficiency of the recruitment and training. Furthermore, we have sent this handbook to the future iGEMers in Chongqing University to help them establish their first iGEM team from scratch. Hopefully, they will join in the iGEM community next year.
On Sep. 24th, we held a recruitment campus event. We invited our coach, Prof. Zhu Xudong, to give us a keynote speech on the general idea of synthetic biology and iGEM. Later"

Overview
The highlight of SVCE_CHENNAI’s ReguloGEM project is the adaptor that converts translational regulation to transcriptional regulation. Our model of the adaptor here is used to determine the amount of protein produced with respect to if the riboswitch present upstream is in its active or inactive form.
For this, we have used the SimBiology desktop, which is an applet of MatLab, to model both the active as well as inactive states of our adaptor with the constitutive RBS. For comparison purposes, we have also modeled normal GFP production, to compare and contrast the two cases of GFP production, with and without the adaptor.
The reason that we’ve decided to model our adaptor is that since it is a fairly new concept, we wanted to run simulations that would help the team understand our project more, while simultaneously helping us to predict the behavior of the adaptor which would help us in our actual experiments.
Reactions
We would like to acknowledge Team Lund hereas they had been kind enough to help us form the following reactions and differential equations.                        The following is a diagram of the adaptor circuit:
Adaptor
Adaptor with constitutive RBS
We assume two conformations of the constitutive riboswitch corresponding to its active and inactive form, ON and OFF and their mRNA transcripts are given as M a and M b , respectively.
1. Transcription of the mRNA transcripts M a and M b :
The above differential equation shows the rate of change of promoter concentration with time, which is zero, since the promoter concentration is constant.
The next two DEs show the rate of change of the mRNA transcripts MA and MB of the ON and OFF states, whose degradation is represented by the degradation terms given in the equation.
2. Formation of TNAc peptide:
The above DE corresponds to the rate of change of TNAc concentration over time. A degradation term has been added to depict the degradation of TNAc peptide. The translated polypeptide T will be considered as a transcription factor using the following logical basis. mRNA El"

Inspiration
The CheapStat[1] is a budget friendly device developed at UC Santa Barbara several years ago. We aspired to build this circuit and modify the software for our purposes, however, the microcontroller on the CheapStat was controlled predominantly in machine level code. The learning curve seemed unreasonable considering our deadline, so we had to find another solution.
We were ultimately forced to build our own. With a clean slate, we wanted to create a device that would fulfill our needs, but also be welcomed by the iGEM community. We aimed to match the performance of the CheapStat, but also improve in three ways: increase the effective range of the instrument, decrease the cost of the circuit, and convert to an arduino-friendly microcontroller. In this capacity, we have succeeded.
We modeled the potentiostat circuit in TINAspice to better understand the limitations of our opAmp selection. We also designed an abstract to better visualize our circuit design.
Abstract
Breadboard
Development began on the protoboard. Circuit designs were prepared using the CheapStat as a reference. SMD-ICs were soldered to DIP adapters and the potentiostat was wired for the first time. The protoboard became the primary device with which to develop the software. The protoboard was not designed with a switch to control current"

The Bioink and Alginate as Supporting Scaffold
In initial experiments printing with bacterial cells dispersed in LB media it quickly became obvious, that a supporting scaffold would be required: due to surface interactions the liquid spread out creating a final thickness of the printed line of almost one centimeter.  In tissue engineering sodium alginate is commonly used as a synthetic extracellular matrix material (Rowley et al., 1999). Inspired by this, we took a look at sodium alginate to use as a scaffold material. Sodium alginate is a carbohydrate polymer which can be fairly well dissolved in water, but in contact with calcium ions (or other divalent cations) the polymers are connected via electrostatic interactions forming a hydrogel. Made for instance from LB, this hydrogel could provide bacterial cells with everything they need for weeks and keep them alive. Furthermore, jellification is a reversible process by complexing the calcium ions with citrate and replacing it again with sodium ions (Rowley et al., 1999). Thus, we had found a substance ideally meeting our purpose of being initially liquid, capable of rapidly turning into a viscous gel and reversing this process again.
Strains
The strains used for our project are described here
Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 PRO ΔcsgA ompR234
This strain of Escherichia coli, used in previous studies of amyloid fiber production in bacteria, is characteristic for having knocked-out the CsgA gene. However, it has all the other genes required for formation of the curli structure.
We have used this strain for our project as the main organism for the printing process. As the bacteria cannot express csgA, we transformed our strains with a plasmid containing this gene under the control of an inducible promoter. Consequently, we can modulate where and when the amyloid fiber will be formed! (Chen, A.Y., et al. 2014)
Figure 3. Photograph of some cells of the strain Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 PRO ΔcsgA ompR234 visualized with TEM, after they were transformed with a plasmid containing the genes necessaries for producing CsgA.
Escherichia coli Top10
This strain was used exclusively for highly efficient transformations. We used this organism for cloning experiments, plasmid isolations and other basic steps of our project.

In 1796, the term ""vaccine"" was introduced when Edward Jenner found that cowpox virus could be used as vaccine to prevent smallpox, a global epidemic disease. Before smallpox vaccine was found, around 400,000 people in Europe died of smallpox every year. Many more people were blind or disfigured due to smallpox infection. However, this life-threatening disease has been completely eradicated after development of the vaccine more than 200 years ago. The discovery of vaccine also helps to ensure that infectious diseases, such as poliomyelitis, measles, and hepatitis B, are under control.
Nowadays, researchers are still struggling to find more suitable vaccines for other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Huge amounts of resources were invested to develop and improve vaccines production. Because most vaccines are used in developing or undeveloped countries, the cost of the vaccine should also be considered. The value of vaccine industry is highlighted in Investing New: “the global market for vaccines may only comprise about 2% to 3% of the total pharmaceuticals market but this sector has, and continues to experience a stellar growth rate of 10% to 15% per year versus the 5% to 7% seen in the overall market, according the World Health Organization (WHO). Totaling just US$5 billion in 2000, today the global vaccine market is worth an estimated $24 billion and is projected to rise to $100 billion by 2025.”
Acknowledging the importance of vaccines, the CGU_Taiwan 2016 iGEM team wants to know more about the vaccine industry. In the meanwhile, we would like to understand whether Leijuvant, the new concept of adjuvant, will provide a new approach in vaccine research and development.

We found that expression in E. coli was not very strong and Esp failed to show bacteriolytic activity or clear inhibition of biofilm formation by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in our setup. However, Esp was able to significantly detach established biofilms of both species. You can read more about our findings on the results page on the registry .

Expression and purification using IMAC
Conjugation to Spider Silk
Defensin is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that contributes to the innate immune response and is present in both vertebrates and invertebrates. It is highly abundant in tissues involved in the host defense system and its amphipathic character allows it to penetrate and disrupt the integrity of pathogenic microbial membranes for destruction. Honey-bee (Apis mellifera) derived defensin-1 was shown to successfully reduce the viability of biofilm-encapsulated wound pathogens, including P. aeruginosa and our main target, S. aureus [22] .
The function of defensin is to lyse the pathogenic cell by permeabilizing the plasma membrane. The surface of defensin has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Upon binding to the microbial membrane, defensin causes the formation of small channels, disrupting the integrity and increasing permeability of the membrane. This results in efflux (outward movement from cell) of vital components in the cell, thus killing it [23] .
Figure 7: Defensin interferes with the integrity of bacterial cell membranes.
As our primary target in chronic wounds is the infectious bacteria S. aureus and considering that defensin has successfully been shown to have a negative effect on membranes of pathogenic organisms, [24] defensin was considered a great combat protein candidate. The well-studied, honeybee-derived defensin-1 part BBa_K1104301 , from the Bee.coli project designed by 2013 NYMU iGEM Team-Taipei, was ordered for usage in SMITe and expressed. A successfully produced and functional defensin would optimize the disintegration of several bacterial components of the chronic wound model by killing S. aureus, amongst other pathogens in the biofilm structure.

Lane 4 is PstI and EcoRI digested pSB1C3 with the original Plac-INPNC-YFP construct. Lanes 5 and 6 are undigested Plac-INPN-YFP and Plac-INPNC-YFP respectfully.
Design 2
Given lack of significance displayed by the first model, we spent some time looking at the original design and noticed a large region between the LacZ promoter and the INP N-terminal which was composed of a truncated, and non-functional, LacZ gene. This coupled with our speculation that there may be a mutation in the promoter itself, lead us to move the sequence into the plasmid pBAD under the control of an arabinose induced promoter. Design 1 was used as the template for this design and yielded construct INPN-YFP.
Primers were designed based on the desired deletion of the LacZ promoter and truncated LacZ gene.
Our pBAD vector was transformed into LMG 194 cells
Induction with arabinose
Results
This design resulted in the deletion of 622 base pairs yielding a 1448 base pair construct of INP-N-YFP as evidenced by gel electrophoresis (figure 11). No fluorescence was detected in this design.

In this way, we can not only spread the idea of joyful experiment, but also record our team's best memory of youth. Himalaya FM, as the initiator of audiobooks, has great influence in China. We rely on this platform to introduce synthetic biology to our readers on the basis of the book Synthetic Biology and Applications written by Dr. Markus Schmidt. Through all the new mediums we talk above, we are able to achieve a more diversified level of promotion work, which is an important reason for our use of these. By popularizing synthetic biology in a way popular with the mediums, we can achieve the final goal of human practice: to let more people understand synthetic biology, and really let synthetic biology come into the general public. In return, some audience commended our efforts on these media. We felt encouraged by these comments and all our efforts seemed to be recognized by the public. Although this process is fulfilled with obstacles and setbacks, we even wanted to give up for several times. As long as what we do is helpful for the welfare of human beings, we will devote all we have to this career.
Contribute our love
To memorize our project, we designed our team logo and project logo. Also, we designed a moral for our project. We gave lectures to high students from 12 provinces/cities and 13 middle schools across the country participating in the summer camp. We introduced our projects to these high school students and recommended them to engage in the high school competition. We volunteered to Yanji geracomium to contribute our love for the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival. We gave a voluntary physical examination and gave speech on the prevention of HF. The elderly there were satisfied about our job. We helped to solve their confusion on how to exercise and go on a healthy diet. Through this trip, we recognize that prevention is much more important than treatment. Only stay a healthy lifestyle, can we lower the risk of HF.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," idea why trachoma is such a big problem especially in Ethiopia?
Dr. Keenan:
No, actually people really don’t know why. I mean, the poverty there is pretty intense and people's personal hygiene is not great [like it is in other places] like for example Indonesia where we work. Probably that is because it is Muslim [unlike ethiopia] and there is just more focus on cleanliness and washing. There is definitely a difference. […] But I don’t know why Ethiopia is just that bad. […]
Daniel C.:
I found a paper of the WHO that dealt more or less with the estimated prevalence of chlamydia in African countries and on the top of the list was actually South Africa.      7
Dr. Keenan:
But you are talking about sexually transmitted chlamydia?
Daniel C.:
No, I am talking about chlamydia trachomatis in specific.
Dr. Keenan:
Talking about chlamydia, there are different serotypes. A, B, C that cause trachoma and there is G to K that cause sexually transmitted disease. There is no trachoma in South Africa. I am not sure about that paper. I am sure they have the sexually transmitted disease and you can get the sexually transmitted disease in your eye. But that’s not like a public health issue so much. It’s more like: „Uh oh, I have conjunctivitis and maybe a new sexual contact with chlamydia.“
Daniel C.:
I was thinking that people there are maybe more accustomed to going to the doctor and getting diagnosed so that they are treated before they actually get trachoma.
Dr. Keenan:
Well, I think there is definitely something to that. With development alone. For example: Europe, the US. We had trachoma and it went away by itself. It went away before we had antibiotics. A lot of people think it is because of improved hygiene and just better public health that it petered out and went away by itself. So development basically is the key to cure trachoma. So if you achieve to make everywhere developed, trachoma would go away on its own. And no one really knows why is that. Some people say it is the electricity, because if you have lights in your house you can see at nighttime so that you can wash your face. And some people say it is the roads, because they make water more accessible. One theory of development is that you get more access to antibiotics through development. And then you are taking antibiotics for other stuff, not"

Penn,2011,Team:Penn State#HumanPractives_-_-_TEXT.html," the same so that accurate statistical comparison could be made under the same conditions. Questions were eliminated to ensure that only the same questions got compared. Overall, we had 18 participants in the study; however, one of the participants did not fill out the pre-video survey and another backed out of the study. Their data was removed from the data set, so only 16 participants counted. Of those that were counted, 1 was 50 years and younger, 2 were 71-75 years old, 2 were 76-80 years old, 4 were 86-90 years old, and 3 were 90+ years. 7 of the participants were male and 8 were female. 1 had a high school diploma, 3 had a bachelor’s degree, 4 had a masters degree, 5 had a doctorate, 1 had post-doctorate experience, and 2 had other educational backgrounds. Occupationally, 1 had background in engineering, 2 in education, 5 in science, 3 in liberal arts, 4 in medicine and health, and 1 in another field. As you can see, a wide variety of people we sampled in this study, to account for background differences in the study. Each filled out a pre-video survey regarding GMOs in certain situations. Then, after the video was presented, they filled out a post-video survey about how each participant felt in those same situations. Each of their responses was quantified into numbers, 1 for strongly agree to 5 for strongly disagree. Each of the responses was averaged for each participant, and those averages were averaged again to find general views of genetic engineering before the video and after. The mean value for pre-video data was 2.35 (STD = 0.61), and the mean value for the post-video data was 2.28 (STD = 0.63). This indicates that the video did have some effect on influencing the general views of the participants. However, the statistical analysis yielded insignificant results, indicating that these results could just be due to chance (t = 0.31, p-value = approx. 0.35). This shows that while our video might have slightly influenced the results, these influences were not significant enough to show that change in opinion had occurred. We feel that this might be due to several reasons. One might have been the quality of the way we presented the video. Many complained of not being able to hear the video. Other participants talked about how our video did not go too in-depth in the topic. For future projects, a video"

In each situation, using their own culture and morality, a community can decide what to do. Knowledge of contamination provides a community with the power of choice. The biosensor is preventative; it provides knowledge. This awareness allows action, and decision making, which is empowering. The argument that a community should remain in the darkness if action cannot be taken is an argument for passivity.
The ASU iGEM team has decided that the decision to share knowledge of a contaminated water source with a community that may not have the necessary resources is ethical. Awareness of the issue leads to action and decision-making, which leads to empowerment. The ASU iGEM team wants to empower communities in developing countries.
Policy Implications
One of the main focuses of the ASU iGEM team is being able to design effective methods for how our biosensor could be implemented. When designing our biosensor, it was important that other countries would be able to use our device with ease. If our project was able to be used in developing countries how would this affect their healthcare? What kinds of implications would our biosensor have on the communities where our biosensor was used? These are important policy and ethical implications that need to be discussed in order for our biosensor to be used effectively.
About $14 billion dollars a year are spent by Western countries that provide healthcare interventions to prevent and cure illness in developing countries (England 2008). The way that these governments distribute this money is via two different methods. The first method is called “horizontal aid” which seeks to distribute money to improve the overall healthcare system within a country (Newkirk 2008).  The second method is “vertical aid” which also seeks to target specific diseases of interest (Newkirk 2008).The “horizontal aid” option incorporates the entire infrastructure of the country which should be improved. The drawback to implementing the ASU biosensor in tandem is that the entire implementation process could take much longer. When integrating this new technology, like a biosensor, with an already established healthcare system, developing countries will require that it meets the needs of their people. In some cases this requires expanding the country’s healthcare system to incorporate the new technology.
The technology being under control of the government runs the risk of the “dual-use dilemma”. This is where the government can abuse or misuse their control of the technology (POST 2009). An example of this would be if the government prevented which areas of the country would have access to the technology or to charge an exorbitant fee to use the technology"

How Biodesign draws lines
    We use Quartz 2D to develop the line part. See a detailed introduction of Quartz2D below or Google it!
    The major type of path we use is cubic Bézier curve.See Fig.1. Four points P0, P1, P2 and P3 in the plane or in higher-dimensional space define a cubic Bézier curve. The curve starts at P0 going toward P1 and arrives at P3 coming from the direction of P2. Usually, it will not pass through P1 or P2; these points are only there to provide directional information. The distance between P0 and P1 determines ""how long"" the curve moves into direction P2 before turning towards P3.
Fig.1 Draw lines
    The explicit form of the curve is:
    
    In Tinkercell, users can change the shape of the curve by dragging the control points, as shown in Fig.2. According to the habits of iPhone users, we use the movement of touches to control the shape change. Since the cubic Bézier curve has two control points, up to two fingers can be used with each one corresponding to one control point. When the number of finger touching is one, both control points will respond to the same movement.
Fig.2 Two fingers (represented as two gray dots) to control the line.
Introduction to Tinkercell
    TinkerCell is a computer-aided design software tool for synthetic biology. It combines visual interface with programing API (Python, Octave, C, Ruby) and allows users to share their code with each other via a central repository.

Thus the focus of our hosting laboratory is biomedical engineering whereas our iGEM topic shows no intersection with this topic.
The single negligible exception is that we used a higher engineered anticalin (<partinfo>K1159003</partinfo>) to bind fluorescein in our BioAccumulation subproject, compared to the conventional BioBrick (<partinfo>BBa_K157004</partinfo>). This higher engineered version has three additional amino acid exchanges and exhibits a 75-fold higher affinity for its binding partner (fluorescein). It was not essential to have this higher engineered version for our project but we wanted to supply the registry with this improved part.
Beside this plasmid, we also obtained a plasmid for the TEV protease from the chair which we have used to generate the Split-TEV protease ( BBa_K1159100 , BBa_K1159101 and BBa_K1159102 ).

1-2 適切なプロモーターの選択
では実際にどのようなプロモーターが適切なのでしょうか？ 人為的に発現量を調節するには、刺激や誘引物質が必要です。刺激や誘引物質の中でも手軽に使用することが可能で、閾値をもつプロモーターが複数あるものを私たちは始めに考えました。さらに、iGEMで未だ扱われていないもの、将来の医療の向上にも役立つようなものという観点も加えて探索しました。そうして、今回タンパク質発現の調節に利用したのが活性酸素です。活性酸素は、好気性細胞の通常の酸素呼吸によって生じるものであり、反応性が高く酸化力が強いものです。そのために生体内で過剰に発生すると核酸・脂質・タンパク質と結合し酸化させ、生体成分に損傷を与えてしまいます。これは様々な疾患の原因と考えられています。しかし、好気性生物は進化の過程で酸素の有効利用を獲得するとともに、酸素の利用により発生する活性酸素への防御機構も獲得してきています。今回私たちが利用したのはその防御機構です。

Unfortunately, the voter participation was rather low, which rendered the result not representative (and the donations barely enough to order a pizza).

CIEI-BJ,2016,Team:CIEI-BJ#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"omer of tanshinone, tanshinone II A, has been demonstrated to prevent atherogenesis, cardiac injuries and hypertrophy (Gao et al., 2012). Now, Salvia miltiorrhiza and the tanshinone extracted from it are clinically used as the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (e.g. coronary heart diseases) (Luo et al, 2015).
 
Extraction of Tanshinone from Salvia miltiorrhiza: Trials and Tribulations
The quality of Salvia produced through traditional cultivation degrades seriously, and the production costs are very high (Chen and Peng, 2006). Unfortunately, Salvia miltiorrhiza is the only source of tanshinone available in nature, and the skin of its root is the only tissue to contain tanshinone. Furthermore, extraction efficiency of tanshinone is very low (1.23%-10.4%) (Table 2) (Zhang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2006). Based on all these reasons, the production of tanshinone is far away behind the rising demand for it. Adding Ag+ and other nutrients may enhance tanshinone production in plants (Zhang et al., 2004), but such method cannot bring about fundamental changes to the situation.
 
Our Solution & Design
Our solution
As a result, using synthetic biology to produce tanshinone should be a more ideal way for mass production, because comparing to traditional cultivation of Salvia miltiorrhiza , bacteria production would be much faster. Furthermore, using bacteria to produce tanshinone will also avoid the great difficulty in tanshinone extraction from Salvia miltiorrhiza . The product’s purity could be increased, and the production cost would be reduced.
 
Synthesis of Tanshinone in Salvia miltiorrhiza: A Blind Watchmaker
How did such a compound come into being? Who “designed” it and manufactured it? The credit belongs to Salvia miltiorrhiza…
 
The biosynthesis of tanshinone in Salvia miltiorrhiza is complicated.
 
Knowledge on the enzymes involved and techniques for manufacturing these enzymes artificially are crucial for synthesizing tanshinone outside the plant. Tanshinone is an abietanoid diterpene (Yang, 2013; Wang and Wu, 2010). All abietanoid diterpenes are derived from isopentenl diphosphate ("

Intracellular glutamate concentration, fluorescence intensity of GFP and the OD600 were measured. FI of GFP was normalized against OD600. Data indicate mean values ± standard deviations from three independent experiments performed in triplicates.
2. High intracellular glutamate concentration promoted tetA expression
To test the expression of tetA, we tagged it with the fluorescent reporter GFP-coding gene ( BBa_K2705004 ), whose expression was detected by microplate assay (395nm\509nm). The intracellular glutamate concentration and bacteria concentration (OD600) were also examined, respectively. (See Figure 2.) It could be concluded that with the increasing glutamate in medium, intracellular glutamate concentration went high, and tetA of PopQC was upregulated to express. The results suggested that the system can help individuals with higher intracellular glutamate concentration express more TetA, so that be able to survive in the tetracycline condition.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Project#module2_-_-_TEXT.html," binding proteins (FABPs) are lipid-binding proteins that regulate fatty acid uptake and transfer between extra-and intracellular membranes. There are 9 different FABPs identified with tissue-specific distribution, including FABP1 in liver. Some, such as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR), are believed to transport fatty acids from the plasma membrane to intracellular receptors, and as such have a selective cooperation with the receptor to activate gene transcription.
2. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) Promoter
The peroxisome proliferator – activated receptors (PPARs) function s transcription factors to regulate expression of genes. The expression of PPAR-alpha can be up-regulated by increased fatty acid concentration in mammalian liver cells. The promoter of PPAR-alpha has a basal expression level. However, when it is stimulated with an extracellular palmitate concentration of 150uM, the activity of the promoter will increase by over 4 folds within 48 hours.
3. Glucose Regulated Protein (GRP78) Promoter
GRP78 (HSPA5) is involved in the folding and assembly of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). High concentration of fatty acids disrupts cell homeostasis, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). This in turn will activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) that consists of three trans-membrane proteins: IRE1, PERK and ATF6. The signals from these three proteins, when integrated together, will activate the GRP78 promoter. Other factors such as NF-Y, ERSF, YY1, which are normally acquired from the normal stress response followed by UPR, also play a role in activating the GRP78 promoter.
4. Fatty Acid Metabolism Regulator Protein (FadR) and FadBA Promoter
FadR is a bacterial transcription repressor that regulates lipid metabolism and determines the bi-stable switch between fatty acid biosynthesis and beta-oxidation. The binding of FadR to the operator is inhibited by fatty acyl-CoA compounds, which are intermediates of fatty acid degradation. When the cellular environment is deficient in fatty acids, FadR binds to Pfad (promoter of operon fadBA) and shuts down the beta-oxidation pathway while turning on the biosynthesis pathway.
Cell Viability
We are working towards to introducing an inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake regulated by fatty acid concentrations. To test our"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Continued working on d3.js models. Incorporating a way to let users dynamically alter experimental parameters.
Managed to plot a single line with angular controller to capture constants.
KP (weekly update)
Managed to change size/shapes of nodes in CyNetShare (available shapes for nodes are rectangle, round rectangle, ellipse, triangle, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon & star). ~This information is important for visualization (would like inputs from the database team about this).
Reading up on this new and amazing Angular UI Bootstrap source: http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/
Has a nice carousel option to display images.
Will try to use a carouse within CyNetShare to display multiple images when multiple nodes are selected by the end of the week.

Among all the intestinal tract diseases, diarrhea, bellyache and stomachache are the most common ones. In this part of survey, we mixed intestinal diseases and tract diseases intentionally, and we are surprised to see that only 50.69% of participants can distinguish one from another. However, people know about detailed intestinal diseases, i.e. 70.6% heard about IBD . They also know about common treatments of these diseases. 60.44% know about dietotherapy, 66.21% know the Chinese traditional treatment. Medicine and operation are the most known. 26.37% are conscious of fecal bacteria transplantation, along with the strict test it needs to run, which could be considered a disadvantage. The other advantages of tradition treatments mentioned by participants are pain (58.52%), immune system disorder (53.57%), drug allergy (52.2%) and others (i.e. slow effect). 64.19% of participants never came into contact with any propaganda or advertisement on intestinal diseases, and most (95.87%) of them feel it important to strengthen people’s comprehension of intestinal diseases.
In the second part we asked about gut flora. Most of participants believe the relationship between gut flora and intestinal to be symbiotic. Nearly all of them heard about Escherichia coli, while 49.18% knows Enterococcus faecalis.
In the third part we started propagating our project and gain feedbacks.
In conclusion, the result gives a proof of our initial conjecture that people are unconsciousness of the severeness of intestinal diseases, while they have been suffering from such things greatly. Besides propagating our project, we managed to make respondents aware of the differences between tract diseases and intestinal diseases and the detailed treatments to these. Consequently, we keep popularizing the knowledge in this field, as we always do.
Social Media
People nowadays spend a lot of time on social media, gaining information fragment by fragment. Subscription account on WeChat is a very popular form of social media in China. In the previous survey, our team found out that most Chinese know little about intestianl diseases and much more superficial about synthetic biology, many of whom having no idea what it is.
In order to create a window for our team to communicate with the world, our team applied and managed a WeChat subscription account, trying to share the knowledge of synthetic biology and trending news about medical treatment responsibly. This account recorded our progress and interesting comments about synthetic biology. The articles"

Interviewing Ming Ding
We had a great talk with Ming Ding, professor in orthopaedic surgery at the Southern University of Denmark, about how we can use our plastic as coating for implants and how the material can be used for slow release of antimicrobial peptides. Mr. Ding’s team is currently working on some experiments with release of E-vitamin from implants in animals. This method could also be tested with combining our plastic and antimicrobial peptides. Especially since our plastic is biodegradable, which is a requirement for this type of coating. Mr. Ding also pointed out that it would be an advantage if the material would be able to stimulate blood vessel formation and thereby increase the speed of wound healing. This is some of the qualifications that our spider silk contains, so the silk could also be worth considering when working with implants. The interview gave us information about the possibilities in our project and reassurance of the great potential there is in developing new biomaterials for implants.
Interviewing Coloplast
We presented our project to Coloplast with the intention of getting their point of view on our project as a whole and in relation to our three sub elements. They believe that our spider silk and bacteriocins are the most interesting and relevant elements in relation to a commercial product perspective of our Bacto-Aid. The reason why PHB is not the most relevant, is that the use of plastic materials in wound care dressings are low compared to other uses of plastics. Instead, the topic of biodegradable polymers is more relevant in other areas and applications. Coloplast are already aware of the great qualities of recombinant spider silk and bacteriocins, however the idea of combining the two elements are completely new to them. They see a big opportunity in this idea and encourage us to continue the work on this project. Their feedback really helped us finding our focus in relation to future development of our product and in relation to how we could improve our project.
Upcoming meeting with LEGO®
We have been in contact with LEGO® in the weeks up to our wiki deadline, and they were very interested in our sub project with producing PHB. Due to a Danish holiday it was not possible to meet up before the deadline, but we have already set a meeting with LEGO®'s director of materials for when we come home from Boston. LEGO® has a large division with research and development of materials from whom we can learn a lot. LEGO® could also end up being a future consumer of our plastic.

Modeling
We developed several models to help design our biosensor to maximize output variation (i.e. the difference between a person with cancer and a healthy person) and to maximize the overall output so the fluorescence can be detected more easily with cheaper equipment, which would drive down net cost of using our sensor in a medical setting.
These include:
NUPACK modeling : Used NUPACK to model the secondary structures of the toehold switches in their closed and open states to maximize dynamic range.
Mass action kinetics modeling : Built a mass action kinetics model to identify the most important parameters to optimize in our design. We ported this model to JavaScript to make it easier for our design team to use and to explain the model to others.
Stochastic modeling : We collaborated with Oxford to validated our mass action kinetics model, by stochastic modeling of the uncertainties of the parameters.
We also built a cost model to provide insight into using our device as a mass-screening tool, which we tied into our human practices work.
NUPACK model
NUPACK is a software tool that can model the secondary structures of RNA systems. [1] We used NUPACK to optimize the design of our toehold switches.
We ran our simulations at 37°C, with 100 picomolar of miRNA, 20 nanomolar of DNA and 500 picomolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.

For the creation of the survey, we carried out a test run at “Die lange Nacht der Forschung”, a special event where the public is invited to visit research groups at universities and museums all around Austria. There we talked with about 100 people about our alpha survey and tried to improve the questions in consideration of the occurring reactions and occasionally misunderstandings. After that night, we discussed our ideas with Codecheck and created a final draft with their help.
To sum up, we learned a lot about the target group of conscious consumers and gained knowledge about the need for information among a very interested part of consumers. For further steps we need to intensify the clarification on prejudices about genetic engineering.
Stearin
We also talked with Stefan Thomann from the European Candle Association ASBL. He told us about the interests of candle manufacturers and their need for stearin. As our project not only esterifies fatty acids, but also tries to produce them, we should set another focus on this promising application for the candle market. As Mr. Thomann told us, the most important qualities for usage in candles are the smell, melting point, combustion point and soot. Candles are a lifestyle product that’s why colour and smell are the two most important qualities. If we try to produce stearin, it has to be as colour and smell neutral as possible. The price is also an important point. So a scale-up would be very interesting for potential investors from the candle sector to predict the price coverage. At the time the main resource for candles is mineral oil, so if we might be able to create an alternative source for stearin, we would also have an impact on the fossil oil market. Through this interview, we learned  more about the importance of lifestyle products and another application for a possible outcome of our research. As a result we added another task to our project: the biosynthesis of stearic acid in yeast.
FFoQSI
As we are an Austrian Team, we naturally were curious about the point of view of researchers on the interface between science, industry and commerce.  FFoQSI (short for Feed and Food Quality Safety and Innovation) is an Austrian research association in the sector of the holistic value chain of food and feed. In cooperation with various partner companies they search on topics in demand of the needs of Austria’s economy. We talked about the future perspectives, economical influence on Austria’s native oil market and consumer acceptance for applications in Austria, but also about the bad image of GMO"

The Evry iGEM Team 2016 was created by students enrolled in the M2 Systems and Synthetic Biology (mSSB) , during the very first months of lessons. By getting motivation and advices from ex-iGEMers, the team quickly started doing weekly Journal Clubs - to speak about science and share synthetic biology knowledge. Later, it expanded to third-year students in Life Sciences and Bioinformatics, and a student in Law. On January, the Brainstorming session started, organized solely by the students. In late March, and after several project discussions, the ""Let's PLAy"" idea was presented to researchers on the Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (iSSB) in Evry, and was finally chosen. From that point on, we kept designing the project and the real wet-lab work started at the beginning of July.
Ideas development, lab work, modeling and human practices have all been conceived and done by the team members, with the help of two advisors.

We can see that the spikes in 2006 and 2013 are completely due to the two special issues, including the sole issue of The Institute of Engineering and Technology Synthetic Biology and an issue of The American Chemical Society Synthetic Biology. Aside from the special issue articles, iGEM papers reached a high in the early 2010s.
A graphic depicting the publishing team’s region and year of competition is below.

Here we can see with the exception of North American dominance of the special issue of 2006 the regions have been generally balanced. Publication Rates
In 2007, iGEM began awarding teams gold, silver, bronze, or no medal based on the quality of their project. Starting in 2006, several finalist teams and one grand prize winner were selected. A chart depicting publication rates for the different medal statuses and finalists is below.

The publication rates for teams that do not fall into any medal status is higher than we would expect because  many 2006 teams were published in the special issue, before the medal system began. Aside from that, we can see that gold medal winning teams and especially finalist teams are more likely to have their work published, to the point where nearly half of finalist teams have their work published in some form. Out of 62 papers published by teams who competed after the medal regime began, 58 were published by teams that won gold.
While Björk and Solomon (2013) note that delays between article submission and acceptance in the biomedical sciences are about 6 months, iGEM papers were published an average of 1.66 years after the Jamboree. Removing papers published in the two special issues, which featured articles on projects done in the previous year, raises this figure to 2.18 years. This implies that"

ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Model#Environment Sensing#parameter fitting_-_-_TEXT.html," implement this whole process
de novo
but we can focus on the cost function that will be used for the fitting. We built it taking the chi2 test of goodness of fit as a basis, to be able to tell with precision whether our fit is significant or not, obtaining on top of that the uncertainty of the fit of our parameters which arise from experimental variability.
Cost function based on the chi2 test
The most simple way to measure the distance between simulated model data and experimental data is the sum of square of the difference between each couple of point. However, the statistical meaning of this value is not obvious, and it is hard to say from it whether the fit is statistically significant or not. This is why we have implemented a more sophisticated cost function based on the chi2 test of goodness of fit, using the the chi2inv function provided by Matlab. This cost function takes into account the experimental uncertainty to evaluate whether a fit is significant or not. The cost function is then, with theo being the vector of simulated data, exp the vector of experimental data, and σexp the vector of the standard deviation for each data point (computed from triplicates):
\[\begin{aligned}        \text{cost}(theo, exp, \sigma exp) = \frac{\sum_i^N\frac{(exp_i-theo_i)^2}{\sigma exp_i^2}}{\text{chi2inv}(0.95,N)}        \end{aligned}\]
When this cost is below 1, the fit is considered to be significant, taking into account the experimental uncertainty of the measures. Therefore, the set of parameters corresponding to the lowest obtained cost value will be the center value of the parameter, while the maximum and minimum possible values of the parameter will be the maximal and minimal ones satisfying the condition that the cost is below 1.
Assumptions
We assumed fixed the following parameters of our model, which are considered known well enough from previous characterizations:

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," protocol named PREDCEL (for phage-related discontinuous evolution), which uses simple batch-wise, manual transfer of the evolving phage gene pool (Figure 3). In essence, PREDCEL reduces the entire complexity of PACE to simple, standard laboratory procedures, all the while gaining entire flexibility to easily swap conditions (strains, inducers etc.) between individual rounds of evolution. We also provide an optogenetic tool for simple adaptation of the selection pressure during PREDCEL runs.
To validate our PREDCEL method, we performed directed evolution of split T7 polymers towards improved auto-reassembly (i.e. protein interaction of the split domains). Having laid the required, solid foundation, were then able to outline a simple, fully generalizable workflow for directed evolution enzymes and successfully tested it by re-directing the catalytic activity of a promiscuous cytochrome, Cyp1A2, towards a naturally unfavored product . Key to this workflow is MAWS 2.0, a software originally introduced by iGEM Team Heidelberg 2015, enabling the in silico design of aptamers and corresponding riboswitches (Figure 4). We demonstrate the functionality of the improved MAWS 2.0 software, by successful design and validation of a riboswitch detecting an organosilicon product synthesized by us in vitro using an engineered cytochrome C. These riboswitches are then used for detecting the desired reaction product and mediate selection pressure during evolution by controlling the expression of M13 geneIII essential for M13 phage reproduction (Figure 4).
Figure 4: A fully generalizable Workflow for Engineering of improved and novel enzymes using AiGEM-mediated in silico evolution interfaced with PREDCEL-mediated in vivo evolution.
In summary, we implemented a unique in vivo – in silico evolution cycle highly accelerating the directed evolution of protein for human benefit. Our standardized PREDCEL protocol, PREDCEL parts collection , online Toolbox guide and accompanying RFC smoothly deliver our evolution toolbox to the end user. Our finalized project design is summarized in Figure 5 (a fully interactive version of this project overview figure is available under project overview ). Our Results Page guides you through all subprojects carried out to establish, validate and apply our evolutionary toolbox. Taken together, we provide a foundational advance by introducing an innovative in vivo and in silico evolution interface as novel engineering paradigm to synthetic biology.

Human Practices
NRP 59
creative representation of the article
To approach human practices in a different way, we decided to inform about a topic that science, politic and society recently focused on in Switzerland:
In August 2012, the results of a five year long national research project (NRP) on genetically modified plants (GMP) were published and likewise raised the attention of public, politic, press and scientific community. The title of the NRP was 'benefits and risks of the deliberate release of genetically modified plants'.
We want to take the unique opportunity that emerged with the end of the NRP this year to tell about the ‘Swiss story’ of genetically modified plants in the framework of the iGEM competition. To do so, we have interviewed two key players of plant biotechnology in Switzerland and reviewed the results and the press review on the recent publication of the results of NRP.
How does this relate to iGEM and our project?
The discussion on genetically modified plants relates as follows to our project: at some point, our genetically modified organisms that form the basis of E.colipse should be brought to their purpose: protecting human skin from dangerous UV radiation. We believe that the discussion about genetically modified organisms that are produced by the rapid progress in synthetic biology as well as each year by iGEM teams all over the world will be similar to the one about genetically modified plants. With our article, we give an overview how"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Conjugation Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," large amount of DNA in Hfr matings appears to enhance the killing."" [ 6 ]
By knocking out the trbK gene we may be exposing our cells to lethal zygosis. If this is indeed the case than knocking out one of the critical mating pair formation genes (trbB, trbC, trbD, trbE, trbF, trbG, trbH, trbI, trbJ, trbL) from the trb operon would prevent this. The gene would be placed on the signal plasmid so that once a cell contining the helper plasmid has also received the signal plasmid, it will have all of the genes necessary to conjugate the signal plasmid further. We selected the gene trbC due to its small size and position on the operon. trbC is known to encode for the pilin subunits needed for pilus formation. So without this gene present the cells will not conjugate and will thus not be succeptible to lethal zygosis. We proposed to do the trbC knockout as out final knockout if lethal zygosis was shown to be an issue.
Conjugation Testing Plasmids
Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 K175005
A map of conjugation testing plasmid 1 K175005
The first testing plasmid simply consists of constitutively expressed GFP and oriTR. The GFP expression allows simple recognition of transconjugants in a conjugation test on the macroscale, or visualization of the signal propagation on the microscale with an epifluorescence microscope. The oriTR enables the plasmid to be transmitted.
These are the BioBricks needed to assemble Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 :
BBa_I13522 (pTet-RBS-GFP-term-term)
BBa_I714031 (oriTR)
pSB4C5 low-copy backbone (selected to be compatible with Self Destruct)
Conjugation Testing Plasmid 2 K175006
A map of conjugation testing plasmid 2 K175006
The second testing plasmid is similar to the first plasmid but also contains the trbK entry exclusion gene. This prevents redundant transfer of the plasmid and reduces lethal zygosis issues.
These are the BioBricks needed to assemble Conjugation Testing Plasmid 2 :
BBa_J13002 (pTet-RBS)
BBa_K175001 (trbK)

Behavioral Experiment Results
Fig.1 Control the C. elegans by the light. We used the optical fiber to form a light spot and the worm can follow the spot.
For the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms and str1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP worms we induced them to do some specific behaviors by the blue and red lights on the NGM plate. We could induce the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worm to crawl a circle on the NGM plate by the blue light (Fig.1).
Then, the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms were trained by the alcohol. We added the alcohol with different concentration on the NGM plate to form a liquid film and we stimulated the C. elegans in the plate at the same time. After 2 hours we washed the plate to recover the worms in M9 buffer and put the mixture on one side of a new plate. Finally, we put the alcohol on the other side to see if the worms have the tropism of the alcohol.
Then we observed that some of the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms could swim to the alcohol but the wild types could not sense the alcohol (Fig.2). We could get that the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms (experimental worms) after training had the tropism of the alcohol (Fig.2 B).

Presentations at schools
We made presentations introducing genetic engineering to students of class 11 and 12 (equivalent to high school sophomores and seniors respectively) in 5 different schools across 3 different cities.
Broadly, the presentations had 3 parts:
a. Definitions of some basic terms used in genetic engineering such as gene, promoter, operator, inducer, reporter etc and how to put together these modular components in constructing genetic circuits.
b. A simple, binary framework for quantitatively analyzing the outputs of simple genetic circuits.
c. Introduction to iGEM, our project and some previous years’ projects.
In enhancing the awareness of high school students about genetic engineering and iGEM, most teams undertake some form of a. and c.; however, we think we stand out by including b., a technique by which students would be able to quantitatively predict the output of the circuits they construct. The objective was to convey that genetic engineering is a diverse area with inputs from biological and more abstract areas of science and engineering.
The presentation was followed by a questionnaire presented to the audience to see how the presentation changed the audience’s knowledge of the topics (related to our iGEM project) and their views about the importance of the question addressed by our iGEM project.
The collaboration was during the presentations in Chennai, the city in which our collaborating college, SVCE is located. The point of the collaboration was that the iGEM projects of both the teams could be presented to the students and since our projects were quite different (ours was basic while theirs was applied research) and we could give the students exposure about the challenges in both these types of projects.

Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," software/back-end-- we’re doing so much more than just coding, which I’m glad about- I love this design and brainstorming bit and I want to learn more about what has to go about for an entire exhibit to come together.
Now set in the storyline of creating bacteria that can help the user survive Mars, the deep sea, and Antarctica, we began furthering our ideas of the actual interface on a MultiTaction.  Romie and Anja presented us with a paper prototype they had used for a separate museum exhibit to give us an idea of the look and function of a paper prototype.  We then started created our own paper prototypes-- we sat on the ground, crowded around a single piece of paper, discussing and sketching, and the entire time I just felt my heart was rising up in excitement.  I’m very interested in education and teaching STEM subjects from a young age, and creating an interface introducing synthetic biology that is tailored to be accessible and understandable for young children merges all of these dreams.  The experience was even better because I was around really passionate, intelligent, down-to-earth people all just as committed to making this project the best it could be.
From now until Friday, our team has to actually create a paper prototype, test it on some young children (probably Orit’s kids!), start actually programming the back-end, and come up with a presentation to share our project at the iGEM meetup this Friday.  Wow.  This all sounds like a lot, but I am also thinking of previous times/projects where it seemed like I could not possibly get everything done and it all worked out-- and now, I am working with a very dedicated and lovely team, so I know we will work it out.  I plan on going to bed early tonight and coming in fresh and rejuvenated tomorrow morning!
6/17/2015: Day 13
Today we focused on creating our paper prototyping.  Even though right now, it doesn’t look like much, actually creating the prototype initiated a lot of conversations and discussions.  We had to chat about many aspects of how our application would run that we hadn’t considered before.  It was my first experience creating a paper prototype, and I really enjoyed it!  Looking forward to introducing it to Orit’s kids tomorrow.
6/18/2015: Day 14
Today was a busy day!  We worked all morning on finishing up our prototype to show Orit’s kids Ben and Daniel.  Once they came in, we ran through a couple of test scenarios on paper.
They were both very engaged and interested"

Evaluation: All samples were good. pSB1K3 plates with RFP inserts are less red than pSB1A3 and pSB1C3. Re-streaking of the successful transformations from 2011-07-28. The same people who did the transformation proceeded with re-streaking.  Cph8 had no colonies at all, neither on the 1x or 10X dilution plate. Apparently there seems to be a problem with cph8. Thus, cph8 (red sensor) had to be redone due to failure in the first attempt.

Re-streaking of the transformants from 11-06-29 and started overnight cultures from the re-streaked plates from the previous day (11-06-28).
Evaluation: Most transformations succeeded. However, cI inverter gave very little amount of colonies and cph8 failed again. It’s time to use another approach. We got one single colony on the transformation"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," BabbleBrick (20$^{th}$) has positions 96 to 100. A scaler $\alpha$ has been included to     increase the range of results. To ensure multiplications don’t result in a null result     the value of each base had a value of 1 added to it. The first checkemethod of one     BabbleBlock can be defined as:
$M_1 = \sum_{n=1}^{bp}(bp_n + 1) . \alpha . bp$ $M_1$: Frequency of CheckMethod 1
$\alpha$: Scaler ($\alpha = 5$ in this example)
Fig. 3. The frequency of checkmethod 1 for all possible bits of information in a babbleBlock system containing two BabbleBricks.
Fig. 4. The frequency of checkmethod 1 for all possible bits of information in a babbleBlock system containing three BabbleBricks.
This method results in Fig.3 and Fig.4 for a 2 and 3 BabbleBlock system respectively,     which shows a large improvement over the original checksum method. The maximum frequency    of a single checksum has been significantly decreased whichwill lower the probability of    a flase positive occuring; this is largely due to the large range of results available to    the method. However, there is still room for improvement as the shaded area of the graph    indicates that on a smaller scale the frequency of checkmethod 1 varies between high and low    values. Eliminating this fluctuation would allow for the data to be spread out more evenly.    To improve this     method a second layer of multiplication will be implamented, each digit will     now be multiplied by a constant depending on its relative position in the BabbleBrick.
$M_2 = \sum_{p=1}^B \sum_{q=1}^{5}(bp_{(5B_p + q)} + 1) . q . bp$

SAFETY
From the very moment we made this our project, we were repeatedly asked the same question: “how can you make sure enough AMPs get to the bee larvae?” This is a valid and crucial concern. After all, one of the key elements to our project’s success is that the antimicrobial peptides reach the bee larvae with a high enough peptide concentration to inhibit pathogenic bacteria. The method we chose was PLGA nanoencapsulation.
Therefore, in order to measure the final amount of AMPs that will be delivered to each larva, we model the amount of peptide released from the nanoparticles in their path through the insides of the nurse bee and into the jelly fed to larvae. The model we developed will help us to determine the initial dosage of AMPs necessary to reach their final destination in desirable concentrations.
Theoretical Foundation
Given previous research that confirms antibiotics supplemented to nurses in food get to the brood1, the nanoparticles must travel through the nurse bee's body along with the artificial food. Therefore, it is important to examine the alimentary canal as well as the hemolymph system, since this is the path we postulate the nanoparticles will travel.2
The cellular layer secretes juices and enzymes and the resulting products of digestion are absorbed by the peritrophic membrane and travel through the stomach walls to the hemolymph. Therefore, nanoparticles will go to the blood or hemolymph system. Once they are in the hemolymph, they will circulate through the body by the single and slender blood vessel that extends from the back abdomen through thorax and ends at the head.2
The abdomen segment of the vessel tube is the heart and by rhythmic pulsations, it makes the blood circulate. The blood with the nanoparticles will travel to the aorta and will irrigate all the structures of the head, including the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands. The hypopharyngeal glands synthesize the royal jelly that will mix with the secretions of the mandibular glands and the PLGA nanoparticles. This mixture will then be delivered to the larvae through the excretory ducts"

The Petri dishes were incubated over night at 33 °C. 5. The colony with the fastest swimming behavior was identified according to the size of the halo. 6. The yellow Eppendorf pipet tip was cut at its first mark with sterilized scissors. 7. Agar pieces at the marked sites were cut out using a shortened tip, respectively. 8. The pieces of agar were placed in a glass test tube or an e-cup with or without the tip. The cultures were incubated for at least one hour at 37 °C with 180 rpm. 9. The cultures were spun down for 10 min at 1.5k X g. 10. 8 x 12 cm plus one control Petri dish were filled with 0.3% tryptone swimming agar, a 2 x 2 cm Whatman paper was soaked with an attractant and placed in the center of the agar plate. 5 µl of the resuspended (as described above) pellet was dropped on the agar three times, the strain containing the parent plasmid was dropped once and marked as “Ref.” 11. Steps 5 to 10 were repeated another two times. 12. A 10-2 dilution of each culture was plated on LB-agar containing chloramphenicol and incubated over night at 33 °C. The clones were used to inoculate an overnight culture from which a plasmid preparation was conducted. The plasmid DNA was sequenced subsequently.
In figure 2B, exemplary pictures of a round of selection are shown. Swimming on tryptone agar could be observed every time after one overnight of incubation at 33 °C, but the observed halos at the different attractants varied in size. The halos had mainly a roundish shape and no direct chemotaxis effect towards the attractants could be identified. The reference strain, containing the parent plasmid of the mutagenesis library, also swam but never as fast as the cells containing the library.

Based on the interpolated Absorbencies from the BCA assay the concentration of our 8/7 silk is approximately 0.78 mg/ml in around 12 ml of solution, giving a conservative 9 total mg of protein for a 300 ml culture.
This is an improvement over the 7/29 purification where we got around 1.6 mg/ml in only 0.75 ml of solution from a 100 ml culture."

A highly specific test will have lots of false negatives but few false positives. Switch to high sensitivity .
The sensitivity and specificity of a screening tool depend on the cutoffs used on a Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and as one increases the other is likely to decrease. Depending on the type of screening we want to do, we can alter the cutoffs on the ROC curve.
For a high-risk screening (e.g. heavy smokers for NSCLC), we would set the cut-offs at 100% sensitivity so it would always pick up NSCLC, and compromise on the specificity which would be at 84%. For mass population screening, we would use a 100% specificity cut-off which would cause the sensitivity to be 56%. The cutoffs here are based on Hennessy et al.'s ROC curve for miRs-15b-5p and 27b-3p in diagnosing NSCLC. [3]
The ROC curve for the two miRNAs we are using is shown here. The area under curve (AUC) of 98% represents the accuracy of the test.

Graph reproduced from data provided in Hennessey et al.'s paper [3]
The choice to use high specificity for mass population ensures would minimize false positive rates for cost efficiency necessary for population wide screening. However, the low sensitivity means that some people with cancer may not be referred for further testing, and are thus left untreated. Through using many miRNA signatures in tandem, we would try to reduce the rate of false negatives.  The goal of mass population screening is also to pick up as many people with a cancer, as early as possible, not everyone, meaning the lower sensitivity would be acceptable.
In the case of high risk screening, the low specificity (and thus higher false positive rate) is less problematic than it may seem, as the ratio of positives to negatives in the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset"

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html,"oglucinol (DAPG), produced in Pseudomonas fluorescens.  In this system, fusaric acid is able to induce the phlF repressor that is then able to suppress expression of the adjacent phlA gene. Concentrations of 500uM completely repress transcription, 300 uM produce some inhibition, and 100 uM have no effect. In 2015 Glasgow combined the characterized operator of the phlF sensitive promoter native to P. fluorescens and incorporated it into a strong E. coli Anderson promoter. We will use both the repressor and synthetic promoter in our design to make our bacteria sensitive to fusaric acid. The DNA following this part will have suppressed transcription in the presence of fusaric acid.
The natural system follows the sensing of F. oxysporum with inhibition of the next component, which was opposite of the circuit we wanted. Therefore, we created an intermediate step in the circuit that turned inhibition into activation by having the phlF repressor act on a gene responsible for repressing the killing mechanism in normal conditions.
The killing mechanism required us to produce an antifungal that will target F. oxysporum. For this part, we chose to incorporate rice thaumatin-like protein (TLP) into our design. Plant TLPs are defense pathogenesis related proteins of family 5. Rice TLP has shown antifungal activity both when over-expressed in the rice plant and also when expressed in E. coli. The exact mechanism is still being studied, but TLPs are suspected to disrupt the cell walls of fungi by binding to glucans and acting as glucanases. β-glucan is the most abundant polysaccharide found in fungal cell walls and its degradation destabilizes the fungal cell wall. TLP may also provide resistance to fungal disease as a xylanase inhibitor, inhibiting an enzyme that breaks down a component of plant cell walls. Because literature sources have confirmed the antifungal properties of rice TLP, as well as its ability to be produced by E. coli, we chose to use this protein as our fungal attack piece.
Amounts of 5 ug of rice TLP extracted from recombinant E. coli were enough to inhibit fungal growth of 7 mm mycelial discs and concentrations of 500 ug / mL of TLP showed over eighty percent inhibition of spore germination of F. oxysporum f. sp cubense.
From the components we had gathered through research, we created three initial design ideas.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Ontour_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM Meet-up in Marburg
The first big German iGEM meetup took place in Marburg on Friday the 22nd to Sunday the 24th of June. Nearly all German teams were present in Marburg.
We arrived at Marburg in the afternoon and were welcomed by the local iGEM team. While enjoying the great weather we build our tent for the weekend. After everybody had arrived we were split up in smaller groups and explored the small city. This was an awesome opportunity to get to know the other teams and their members.
The following day started with a great breakfast and a welcoming talk. After this we had some great talks from Steffano Vecchione and Daniel Frank and a poster session where each team presented their project. We learned a lot from the other teams and were able to exchange helpful tips with each other. Moreover we received great input for our own project. This made it possible to plan future collaborations with other teams. For example we did find out that we could help the iGEM team from Hamburg “Reagents of S.H.I.E.L.D” with their work with cyanobacteria.
Standing at our poster and explaining our project to other people was a great preparation for the Giant Jamboree in Boston. It gave us helpful insight of how the poster presentation there is going to be.
At the end of the day we had a barbeque and cheered for the soccer teams at the world cup in the match Sweden versus Germany. It was an amazing weekend. Getting to know the other teams with their projects and working together with them is a wonderful part of the iGEM competition.
European Meetup Munich 2018
For the European Meetup four members of our team went on a trip to Munich. We began our travels very early at 4:30 am on friday in order to arrive in Munich during midday.
After our arrival we quickly had to check-in at our hostel and then continued to the meetup immediately. Luckily, we were greeted with a nice goodie bag and a cup of coffee - and to be honest, we all needed that coffee after such a long drive.
Right before the meetup started we placed our poster on the wall and prepared ourselves for the first talks and the poster session on Friday afternoon. Over time more and more teams arrived and we were happy to finally meet some people we were texting with in person.  At the beginning of the meetup a warm welcome speech with a presentation on the schedule for the weekend was held.
friday afternoon was filled with talks followed by a poster session. Within the breaks we rushed to get more coffee - we were"

Hydrolases
Hydrolases are hydrolytic enzymes, biochemical catalysts that use water to cleave chemical bonds, usually dividing a large molecule into two smaller molecules. Examples of common hydrolases include esterases, proteases, glycosidases, nucleosidases, and lipases. Hydrolases carry out important degradative reactions in almost all organisms. These enzymes have a catalyze reactions in a multitude of biological processes including digestion and neurotransmitter degradation in animals, bacterial cell-wall growth, and extracellular degradation of cellulose, xylan, and chitin, in fungi. 1,2

The E.coli’s running time trun is a random number from N(<τrun>,σrun);
The mean duration time <τrun> can be derived from formula (1) and (2), given the value of C and dC/dt;
The specific duration_time of a single bacterium changes in the same pace with the changes of the statistical distribution’s mean (relying on C and dC/dt). (Fig. 5)
Fig. 5
For a single bacterium, its surroundings decides the statistical distribution of its own running time. In other words, the discrepancy doesn’t change:
where trun is the specified starting and stopping time for a single bacterium. τrun2 is the current mean duration time and τrun1 is the mean duration time at last second; both are derived from the function (1) and (2).
Tumbling
E. coli reorient between two runs.In modeling this process, we assume:
E. coli do not change positions as they are tumbling;
the direction after reorientation is randomly chosen.
Fig. 6 Schematic drawing of a tumble, from [2], page 45
The angle dθ is not strictly random [1,5,6] (its distribution shown in Fig. 7). However, the distribution is not formularily clear and would require too much effort to build a random number fitting this distribution, thus we roughly regard it as a random process.

""I started on the Field Team with an interest in finding and identifying Haloferax species that contain cellulases, enzymes that break down cellulose. The process of screening archaea for cellulases took the majority of the summer so I promptly  switched towards developing a synthetic halophilic cellulase. Using a vast array of computational tools, I developed a pipeline for determining a model cellulase which we will test for expression in Haloferax volcanii. My computational work culminated in the discovery of conserved rare codons in specific gene regions across domains of life, leading towards the development of F.O.C.U.S, our computational strategy for determining rare codons in gene sequences. I hope to soon publish my work as well as continue developing useful computational tools for researchers and future iGEM teams.""

L. monocytogenes is a dangerous pathogen; however, B. subtilis is a safe bacterium. With the lysis device installed in it, B. subtilis cells lyse after entering the eucaryotic cells. Since both of the bacteria are gram-positive, gene expression should undergo without obstructions. The plasmid also carries the GFP coding device which will help us to determine the success of our experiment. After the lysis of B. subtilis cells, GFP will be released and the measurement of its fluorescence will give us the idea of how the experiment worked out.
The mechanism of invasion of mammalian cells by bacteria leading to delivered gene expression
1. Adhesion
2. Internalization of the bacteria by the cell and subsequent phagocytosis
3. Expression of listeriolysin present on the B. subtilis construct lyses the phagosomal membrane and bacteria escape from the phagosome
4. Release of the vector due to the installed lysis device in the bacteria
5. Replication and expression of the mammalian vector induced by oriP
The next step was creating a vector capable of replication and gene expression in mammalian cells. After the lysis of B. subtilis cells, the vector would be released directly into the cytoplasm, and then act just as mammalian DNA molecule. The EBNA1 gene from Epstein-Barr virus is essential for oriP to work properly. The vector would carry RFP, whose fluorescent activity measurement would prove the success of the presence, replication and expression of the vector within the mammalian cells. Due to safety measures, we never placed this plasmid in the bacteria cells.
The last step was creating a shuttle vector which would be capable of replication and gene expression inside the eucaryotic cells. The vector will carry RFP coding device, and it will be RFP flourescence measurement which will confirm the presence of the vector in  mammalian cells and GFP in bacterial cells. However, due to safety reasons, we did not combine the two steps of our experiment. Each of the systems is tested separately, with all the safety precautions. In the future, when all the safety issues are resolved, these systems might be able to help a great deal in gene therapy. Delivering certain genes right into the malfunctioning cells would be a tremendous help in treatment of complicated diseases.

PROOF OF CONCEPT
We set out to determine whether or not protein Hfq is required for sRNA-mRNA hybridization in Staphylococcus aureus. Use of a fluorescence polarization (FP) assays demonstrated that wells containing only sRNA compared to wells containing both sRNA and mRNA successfully showed that the RNA was hybridizing; therefore, we concluded that sRNA mediated gene silencing is possible in Staphylococcus species without the inclusion of Hfq on the vector delivered to target cells. More can be read here.
As our project has been developed in a multi-stage plan, we designed a successful qPCR assay for future use in measuring gene knockout efficiency in vivo. More can be read here."

Below are my notes on how a biobrick primer must work in detail, and how they must be constructed.  Silver lab and the Paris team have very similar methods for primer construction.  My prefix and suffix sequences are Silvers, but they are exactly how they should be put on the 5 prime end of the primer.  Someone should check, but I think this is it.
