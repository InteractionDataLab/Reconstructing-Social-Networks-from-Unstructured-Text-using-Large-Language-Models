UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,"ycopene cells is more pronounced, clearly showing that the mNARK-Lycopene devlice mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells from dying. This results in a greater optical density being achieved and, by extension, greater lycopene production.
From the above data, we can deduce that our biobrick will produce more lycopene when there is more oxidative stress in older people there creating a regulatory feedback system.
Hence, we have characterised our silver BioBrick.

Our projects
This summer, our team is aiming to engineer bacteria for supplement and absorption of autoinducer-2 in the natural environment. We mainly design two cell machines: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecular level; AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of AI-2 controllers, we hope to directly control the population behaviors of bacteria in group levels.
What's more, biosafety is further taken into account in our project. By applying gene circuits to control essential gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions, we can blocks essential gene expression to kill the cell upon loss of the biocontainment signal.
Our goals
AI-2 Supplier
To enrich the AI-2 concentration in the nature or artificial environment, we constructed two AI-2 Supplier Devices by overexpression of the components responsible for AI-2 production (luxS, mtn).
AI-2 Consumer
To 'quench' AI-2 signal in the nature or artificial environment, we constructed six AI-2 Consumer Devices by overexpression the components responsible for AI-2 uptake(lsrACDB), phosphorylation(lsrK) and degradation (lsrFG).
AI-2 Response Device
We successfully constructed two devices that could respond to AI-2 by producing GFP, to provide an independent means to use AI-2 Controller to alter heterologous gene expression. we show that a 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 suppliers activated QS-activated GFP expression from the control group. And 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 consumers could significantly depress QS-activated gene expression from the control cells.
Biosafety Considerations
This summer, we plan to mf-lon ssrA tag into 5 essential genes by using CRIPSR/Cas9 technology. By applying gene circuits to control mf-lon protease expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions, we can blocks essential gene expression to kill the cell upon loss of the biocontainment signal.
Demonstration of Experiment Results
We demonstrate utility of AI-2 Controllers by modulating"

Biofilms
Objective: To clean biofilms and to make new ones to continue testing.
Procedure:
Cleaning Old Biofilms
August 25th biofilms were cleaned using 3.2 mL of Mr. Clean, GreenWorks Cleaner, and Lysol in 2 35x10 mm Petri dishes each. Water was put into a seventh Petri dish of the same size to be used as a control. The cleaning solutions were left on for 15 minutes and then were rinsed.
The Petri dishes were then put into the refrigerator for 24 hours at 4˚C.
Making New Biofilms
New biofilms were made by putting 21 mL of total volume of LB media, RFP culture, and KAN in a 50 mL falcon tube. The RFP culture was added in a 1/100th dilution and the KAN was added in a 1/1000th dilution. 3 mL of this solution was then pipetted into seven 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
These were put in the incubator for 24 hours at 37˚C.

Final Labwork, Wiki, High School Presentations, Mutant Paper and Reporter/Mutant Testing!
This past week has been focused on finishing final constructions and testing, adding stuff to the Wiki and getting our DNA ready for shipping.  Earlier this week I finished construction of B0034-LuxOD47E, ran a colony PCR with the B0034 primer and sent this down for sequencing. I also started construction of B0034-LuxOD47E-B0015, however due to a lack of colonies on the plates, it doesn't look like this will be ready in time to send to the registry.
Reporter/ Mutant circuit testing was finished this week.  We did measurements twice on Wednesday as well as on Thursday.
This week I 've also been working on writing more for the Human Practices section of our Wiki.  I've been focusing on some of the research symposiums that we've presented in as well asour collaboration project with UChicago and Illinois.  I've also been finishing up my paper outlining the construction of"

I looked at the protein database sequence of the protein cage and brainstormed sites that were void of any secondary structure. From here the different sites were visualized on Pymol to check for any steric hindrance that might not allow for the ligation to happen.
My sites:
318-321(KNTD)     (KNLVPRGSGTD) This was chosen because there was no secondary structure formation and contained no bends and turns. When viewed on pymol it was not sterically hindered.
351-354(VPSE)        (LVPRGSGE) This was chosen because there was no secondary structure formation and contained no bends and turns. It is not sterically hindered when viewed on pymol. Its also sticking out quite a bit from the protein which means it may not be key in the formation of the cage.
123-129(ASLEPFL)     ASLVPRGSGEPGL  This was chosen because there was no secondary structure formation but when viewed on pymol it was sterically hindered.

The Tohoku University team aims to design a biological system for ANTI-IBD and CRC prevention through the use of engineered Probiotics. Because the concentration of NO in the intestinal tract of IBD is about 100 times than that of normal people, NO molecule acts as their inflammatory signaling molecule, and probiotic Escherichia coli (nissle 1917) is selected as their chassis organism. The project consists of two sets of devices, one of which is an anti-inflammatory device, which includes a sensor for detecting inflammatory signals, a high-efficiency enhancer, and an effector that secretes interleukin (IL-10); the second is an anti-cancer device, which is expressed through engineered probiotics, which is derived from a cross-flowered vegetable ( Cruciferous vegetables (myrosinase), which converts the natural component of Thio-glucoside (sinigrin) from a cross-flowered vegetable into a turnip (sulforaphane).The product of radish is a kind of organic molecule with anticancer activity, and it can inhibit oxidative stress (oxidative stress), so it can also inhibit the intestinal inflammatory reaction. In addition, they use cold-shock kill switches (cold-excited expression lysis and Maz-ef) to prevent their engineered bacteria from escaping into the environment and causing DNA contamination.
Members of the Northwestern University team introduced their project background that saline soils may affect the growth of crops such as wheat and rice. Because traditional saline soils are difficult and inefficient, they have decided to address this global challenge in new ways. Several parts of the bacterium are designed to reduce the concentration within the range. Their project is to modify potassium channels by using non-natural amino acid d-alanine,and they obtained a new channel protein, which allows K + to be considered in a high concentration of K + and allows Na + to be considered in a low concentration of K +. Because of the use of d-ala, a part of the introduction of unnatural amino acids into bacteria was established. They analyzed proteins and tested them by molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry, and established mathematical models of the relationship between cells and salt concentrates. They will use patch clamps and a new method to test proteins and bacteria in the solution. After their cell experiments, they will use it for agricultural"

Students and Alumni
We made a progressing, three-stage plan of  introducing synthetic biology and iGEM to students and alumni.
For various  reasons, we deem this part the most important of the three. First of all, we  are dealing with educated and intelligent young people much like ourselves who  can fully grasp the concept of synthetic biology. Second, they are the most  likely to be attracted to a competition like iGEM where they can push their  limits and show their talents. Third, many talented students from majors other  than biology did not realize they had potential in the field of synthetic  biology, where not only biologists, engineers are sorely needed as well. Last  but not least, we hope to influence at least some people into taking up  synthetic biology as their future career, and boost the development of the  field in our country.
With  this in mind, we made a progressing three-stage plan of introducing synthetic  biology and iGEM to students and alumni:
Stage 1 is a general introductory phase where we  attempt to attract as much attention as possible for future stages by posters.
Stage  1 is a general introductory phase where we attempt to attract as much attention  as possible for future stages. We needed students to know that we exist and we  are looking for people to join us; we needed to get their curiosity up so they  would come to see who we are and what we are doing. To do this, we printed  posters ourselves and some of the future events planned, and put them up on the  poster boards in dormitories and classrooms along with other posters. Since  students regularly check these poster boards for information on lectures, club  meetings and such activities, we are sure to get a broad audience. We  especially marked that what we were doing needed talented people from all  fields, even such seemingly disparate fields as computer sciences.
Stage 2 is a more detailed introductory stage,  where we introduce the concept of synthetic biology, history of iGEM and  Tsinghua’s participation, etc by science fair.
For this stage,  we needed a place where people would come and actually spend time listening"

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Background
Historical Background
For centuries, humans have fascinated over silk. The earliest known production of the material dates back to the Yangshao period as early as 3000 B.C. Over the years, the process of sericulture, the growth of silkworms to rear silk, has evolved time and time again.  Silk as a material was at its height during the famed Silk Road period, where the lucrative Chinese silk trade dominated much of transcontinental trade. Long after, however, the idea behind silk processing still remains the same: growing silkworms, from which silk is extracted, cleaned and further processed.   For our project, we intend to take this a few steps further: instead of growing silkworms in factories, we want bacteria to be our microbial factories, producing silk proteins as it would any other.
Biochemistry of Silk
The mechanical properties of spider silk are a result of its primary amino acid sequence. Although the   amino acid sequences for various types of spider silk are well documented, it is still relatively unknown   how these amino acids aggregate and contribute to the strength and stability of silk. Silk proteins are   composed of repeats of short amino acid sequences (approximately 33 amino acids). These repeats can   be referred to as monomers. Each monomer consists of a glycine rich stretch, followed by an alanine   rich stretch. It is hypothesized that these hydrophobic alanines form beta sheet crystals with other silk   proteins, and contribute to the strength of the silk fibers. The glycine stretches are thought to form   alpha helices and contribute to the flexibility of the protein. This monomer sequence is repeated many   times in one protein, and allow for strong interactions with other silk proteins. These simple motifs   repeated over and over are the key to the formation of one of the strongest materials known to man.
Applications
Silk is a naturally strong and flexible material, and so it is a unique fiber that can be used in applications that require the normally contradicting qualities of tremendous strength and low weight. It could be woven into thick cables for"

User Guide
For new users whom want to interest with synthetic biology and for experienced scientists, in our program you have two options for Input Output properties ;
To find input-output related biobrick parts or larger constructs! If you want to provide specific chemical or physical inputs from external environment, you may choose these inputs from the list. if you want other specific inputs which will be expressed from a coding sequence, the list can provide these specified protein names.
Wanted features of outputs can be selected by either from list or entering individually into text boxes.
Then click on the “Show Parts ” button.
Then the program will show you the parts have specified I/O properties
To see the properties of a part just click on it.
After clicking, you will see a highlighted pathway on the 2nd graph. Which are the subparts of the clicked part. Showing the sub graph in network.
Human Practices
iGEM’s parts registry is the only current database that holds information     and DNA for over 3000 standard parts for the use of synthetic biology     community. BioGUIDE is the first designed software that organizes the     parts in iGEM spring 2010 distribution as possible atomics parts to     build new biological device and systems for specific input and outputs     based on graph theory. We are the first group who has applied a novel     algorithm to search for input/output relations between the parts to     reveal possible construct assemblies. This new approach will chance     how the parts registry is used by the scientific community. And the     availability of software implementing our algorithm with a very user     friendly graphical user interface will allow all the users of the parts     registry to explore new and novel constructs according to their parameter     with ease. Additionally as the BioGUIDE software is an open source ware     , any user can contribute to the development of the application. So,     BioGUIDE will be improving with a collaborative effort, which will make     it even more widely used among the synthetic biologists.
We also had many collabrations with the teams such as, INSA-Lyon,     Lethbridge, WashU through our survey and WARSAW as we have participated     in their survey"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated HP_-_-_TEXT.html," biomarkers is not far off.
All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective primary prevention for NSCLC [6] , as smoking is responsible for 90% of cases. [7] In the UK, the government has implemented numerous policies to reduce rates of smoking. These include heavily taxing tobacco, banning TV advertising and requiring cigarette packets to have “smoking kills” branding.
Rates of smoking are declining [8] , although they are still sufficiently high for lung cancer to remain as prevalent it is. Primary prevention to secondhand smoke has also been implemented as far as impossible - with smoking banned in enclosed workplaces, public buildings and on public transport. [9] However, no further measures can be taken to avoid exposure by going outside.
The other risk factors for cancer are less well known - as there are a myriad of carcinogens in the world we live in - the food standards agency works to minimize carcinogens in food, drugs and cosmetics, [10] while NICE ensures that medical radiation exposure is minimized.
The screening test should be simple, safe, precise and validated
As we are using a cell free system, our test is safe. Our test would comprise a blood test, followed by miRNA purification and fluorescence measurements which are all relatively simple. These steps do not require the expertise of radiologists that are needed for CT scans. However, for our test to be shown to be precise and validated, further characterisation is required with the miRNA biomarkers and validation with a large data set of patients.
There should be evidence that intervention at a pre-symptomatic stage leads to better outcomes
NSCLC is far easier to treat in its earlier stages. The same is true for almost all cancers, as once a cancer has metastasized it can only be treated palliatively. Early stage tumors can be surgically excised and treated adjuvantly with curative intent.
The test should be acceptable to the target population
From a patient’s perspective, our sensor would just be a blood test. As such there should not be any issues with it. We are using a cell free systems which is sterile and abiotic - there are no bacteria involved which could potentially give rise to objections.
There should be a policy on further diagnostic investigation of those with a positive test result.
There should be agreed policies covering which individuals should be offered interventions and what the the appropriate intervention offered is assurance standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE"
Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PHA_-_-_TEXT.html,"thenate kinase stringently controls amount of coenzyme A produced in E. coli because the pantothenate kinase produced by E. coli is significantly inhibited by coenzyme A and its thioesters (such as acetyl-coA). Therefore, since we wanted to increase coenzyme A synthesis, we had to find a way to get around this negative feedback inhibition. Fortunately, the pantothenate kinase made in Staphylococcus aureus does not experience feedback inhibition from coenzyme A or its thioesters [5]. Indeed, this allows S. aureus to accumulate high levels of coenzyme A. We ordered the S. aureus pantothenate kinase sequence from IDT and inserted into the backbone PSB1C3 in front of the phaCAB operon designed by the Tokyo Tech iGEM team in 2012 with the hybrid promoter designed by the Imperial College iGEM team in 2013. The results section below shows that inserting the gene for pantothenate kinase allows for higher levels of P(3HB) production in E. coli.
(2) Facilitating P(3HB) Extraction
Since bacteria that naturally synthesize P(3HB) use the plastic as an energy storage mechanism, the plastic is produced inside the cell and stays there. Currently, the isolation of P(3HB) from the cells and culture media is one of the main bottlenecks in the P(3HB) production process – and the main source of its high cost of approximately $4-6 USD [6]. Traditional isolation methods include the use of large amounts of chemicals that can be hazardous to human health and the environment, such as chloroform and sodium hypochlorite, or other problems such as large volumes of waste water produced or impurities in the polymers [6]. Since one of our team’s goals has been to reduce up-mass of materials on space flights, we wanted to minimize the amounts of harmful (and heavy) chemicals that would need to be brought up as payload to extract the P(3HB).
We sought to accomplish this by introducing a lysis device into the PSB1C3 plasmid that contained the phaCAB operon and the gene for pantothenate kinase. The lysis device was developed by the 2008 Berkeley iGEM team. The device contains T7 phage antiholin under a weak promoter, and T7 phage holin and endolysin inducible under (L)-arabinose. This lysis device was not reported to kill entire populations of"

Burger mama:
”Well, I couldn’t really prevent your burger from containing bacteria either, since there are  bacteria everywhere. If we imagined a bacteria free or sterile burger, this would be ruined  already after your first touch and breath on it, since bacteria is a big and important part of  the environment on your skin and in your mouth. Source: Microbiology online: Bacteria. (Link)
In addition to this, you would have to lose the cheese in cheeseburger. The cheesemaking  process, apparently, involves fermentation of milk, which is performed by lactic acid  bacteria. These converts milk sugar into lactic acid. When the lactic acid accumulates, the  structure of milk proteins changes and this causes texture of the product. Source:"

Public Engagement
Use of Relevant Social Platforms for Public Engagement
Social media has become one of the most effective platforms for promoting certain causes to the public. Thus, our team decided to use  this method to promote synthetic biology and its applications in a wide variety of sectors within the community.
Our team decided to create a Facebook page dedicated to iGem in order  to enhance the understanding of the public regarding synthetic biology.  As well, the page was created to inform the public about current topics and advancements that might t be of interest to them. Planned workshops were also posted on the page and on the personal social accounts of the  team members to cater to a wide variety of audience that might be  interested in synthetic biology.
Survey the Public
Our team wanted to know the initial opinions of the public regarding synthetic biology. As a result, our team conducted a general survey testing the overall understanding of the public about the field, its uses and the various applications that exist today and will possibly exist in the future. The results are illustrated in this section.
Synthetic Biology Workshop
Based on the prior survey conducted, our decided to host a workshop to further educate the public about synthetic biology. Most people knew about synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms, however, most people were not aware of its various uses and thus, could not form a solid opinion on their use in the manufacturing and production of materials. Our workshop consisted of a presentation headed by one of our team members and included an engaging activity that allowed the attendees to work with their peers to get a general idea of the process behind the field of synthetic biology."
SCU_China,2017,Team:SCU China#HP#Silver#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," exhibition together about transgenic technology. We aimed to make the                                         visitors understand what is transgenic technology and get some advice about our                                         project from the visitors.
     Eventually, SCU_WestChina got in touch with Chengdu Library successfully.                                         Chengdu Library is a leading city center library in west China, receiving 1,010                                         million readers in 2016. After several conferences with other three teams, we chose ""genetic modification and health"" as the theme of the exhibition. And then                                         we discussed the content of this exhibition and designed the posters together.                                         The exhibition was composed of four parts: disease treatment,                                         biopharmaceuticals, disease detection, and environmental management. Each team                                         was responsible for one part. And teams from Sichuan University and team from                                         the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China completed forewords                                         and conclusion respectively. We printed the posters a week ahead of the                                         exhibition, and laid them out in Chengdu Library one day in advance. The                                         exhibition lasted for 7 days. On the first day, the four teams went to the                                         library early to distribute leaflets and small gifts to the public in the rest                                         areas and outside the library. We introduced our theme to those readers,                                         answered their questions, had discussions with them on genetic modification, and                                         collected suggestions from them. The audience was very absorbed, and many said                                         they had a more objective and comprehensive understanding about genetic                                         modification, which makes us feel very rewarding. The four teams worked on the                                         maintenance, publicity and explanation of the exhibition for the following days,                                         and removed the posters and cleared the exhibition hall together on the last                                         day.
     The library exhibition achieved our expectation. Lots of visitors said they                                         obtain much knowledge about transgenic technology from this exhibition. For                                         example, people used to see chemicals produced through transgenic technology as                                         a kind of toxin. But now, they know that the chemical nature of these products                                         doesn’t change. With our explanation, many visitors removed their prejudice and                                         misunderstanding about transgenic technology.
     In the library exhibition, we cooperated with other three teams very well. The                                         team SCU_WestChina contacted the Chengdu library and told them our thoughts                                         about the exhibition. And we four teams made the posters which were very                                         important in the library exhibition together. As we divided the theme into four                                         sections, each team was responsible for one poster. In order to make the poster                                         more clear and intelligible, besides responsible team, other three teams also                                         participated in discussion and gave their suggestions about"

Glass tops such as LB jars can be run under the flame, however plastic eppendorfs cannot so working around the flame is sufficient.
We found it easier if the person pipetting held the eppendorf as they can see what they're doing better.
Prof. Aldridges lab uses sterile beads to plate ourt rather than plastic spreaders, these are a bit fiddly so it may take a while to get used to tipping the right amount out!!
Our serial dilutions were prepared as follows:
Spreading the diluted cells across the agar surface using sterile glass beads
Using the waiting times within our procedure we set up 6 labelled eppendorf tubes with 900µl of LB, ready for the series dilution.
We took 100µl of our incubated cells and put them in tube 1, mixed the solution briefly and then proceded to take 100µl of the diluted cells and tranfer them along the line of eppendorfs, resulting in eppendorfs containing 10-1 to 10-5 solutions for both the control and 'transformed' cells.
We plated all 6 transformed E.coli solutions onto LB+amp agar plates, and the controls we plated onto both LB+amp plates(to check for contamination) as well as plain LB plates (in order to later calculate transformation frequency).

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," forces with the iGEM Team Manchester to create a video for their series about modelling, which is very appropriate and useful for beginners.  In our video we are discussing in detail why we have chosen to do our modelling on R instead of other programs like Matlab, Python, COPASI and VCell. You can find it on YouTube .
Collaboration with the iGEM Team Copenhagen
We have also made a video for the iGEM Team Copenhagen's initiative to aid future iGEM teams by starting a YouTube series called Bricks of Knowledge. Our video is called ""How to insert a gene"" and explores the topic of cloning in broad terms. It provides a general overview of each step of the whole process as well as information about the things that you have to bear in mind while performing the experiments. It is suitable for people, who like us have struggled with cloning (that is why we have decided to share our wisdom on the topic). Find the video on Youtube
Collaboration with the iGEM team Purdue
We have participated in a Google+ chat with representatives  from many iGEM teams and we have discussed Purdue's idea of creating a universal standard, in which all new parts that are submitted to the iGEM registry should be characterised. We fully support this cause as we believe that it would be beneficial for the iGEM teams if we characterise all parts in the same way.
Collaboration with Microryza
We have joined forces with the people working behind the crowd funding platform called Microryza, who tried to promote our project and help us raise funds as well as awareness of our idea. We have also made a YouTube video about our project and iGEM in general in order to promote ourselves as well as the competition. Find it here

Safety
Safe Practices in the Lab
Our team conducted the research at the University of York, in the teaching laboratories of the Biology Department.  All work was conducted in a biosafety level (BSL) 1 laboratory. We used Escherichia coli DH5a, BL21 and K12 wild type, which are well characterised and do not constitute a threat to the environment. Shewanella oneidensis and Salmonella enterica typhimurium  serovar 14208s were not used (as we had the genes synthesised, instead of amplifying them from the genome). Before gaining access to the lab space, team members were required to"
Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli produces elevated levels of OMVs due to NlpI-mediated destabilization in the outer membrane attachment to the underlying peptidoglycan layer 5 .
Having obtained this cell line, we transformed our initial periplasm-directed Cas9 devices (Figure 1) into JC8031 and filtered the cultures with 100 kDa Millipore filters in order to concentrate OMVs for protein expression.
Protein Expression
Once we built our constructs and separated the periplasm and OMVs from the rest of the cells, we ran Western blots with antibodies against our His6 tag to look for Cas9 expression in OMVs, periplasmic, and cytoplasmic fractions. Total protein concentration in each sample was normalized to 5 µg using a Bradford assay . We used a well-tested, his-tagged ClyA-GFP fusion, also supplied by Dr. DeLisa, as a positive control for expression in the periplasm and in OMVs.
Nuclease Activity Assay
To test the functionality of our saCas9-compatible guide RNA device, we co-transformed our saCas9 part in pSB1C3 and our gRNA device in pSB1T3 into TOP10 E. coli cells. Once the cells took up both plasmids, they would produce both Cas9 and a targeting guide RNA to make a double-stranded break in the mRFP gene and disrupt protein function. We tested this hypothesis by reading fluorescence of OD-standardized cultures with a plate reader at 555/584 excitation/emission, using a guide RNA device with a non-cutting template sequence and a Cas9-expressing device with no guide RNA as controls. Our hypothesis was that the culture containing guide RNA against mRFP would show decreased fluorescence.

Julien CAPIN (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
I discovered the iGEM competition thanks to TV. Back then I was just in high-school and I did not know what to do for my studies. I was literally fascinated to see hundreds of students presenting all more ambitious than the others. I think it was the sign and that is why I am now an engineer student in biotechnology, and of course, an iGEMer!
Geoffrey DE OLIVEIRA (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
The biotechnology field is fast-growing and progresses at an exponential level since a few year. It is separated in different fields like synthetic biology. It allows the conception of biological devices by modifying bacterial genomes for food-processing, therapeutic or environmental goals. It is also applied to other very interesting fields. The diversity and complexity of organisms bring more and more knowledge to researchers and engineers, allowing the conception of new technologies always more powerful thanks to synthetic biology. The worldwide contest iGEM hosted by the prestigious MIT allow us all, students, to create our own synthetic biology project and to share the generated knowledge and our passion with other students from all around the world. This competition is before everything else a human experience. For me it was also a huge opportunity to live a real research experience with a dynamic and multidisciplinary team, allowing me to confront the real challenges met by a biotechnology engineer.
Cassandra Sabas (1st year of Master’s degree in Biomaterials and Medical Devices)
I’m 23 years old and I’m currently finishing my studies on biomaterials and medical devices at the University of Bordeaux. I heard about iGEM competition while I was looking for a facultative internship for my master. A friend of mine, who was a member of past iGEM Bordeaux’s team, talk to me about the project of iGEM Bordeaux for this year  and I was really excited about it, I wanted to be a part of it so here I am !
Gilles KREMBEL-SAUTOT (2nd year of Bachelor’s degree in Biology)
In my 3rd undergraduate year in biology, I always was interested in sciences. I discovered the synthetic biology two years ago by reading some articles or talking around, and I immediately enjoyed this field. Synthetic biology allows us to resolve some modern problems by genetic engineering. In my opinion, it is really awesome to think that a common bacteria could purify water, create polymers or some other crazy projects"

Construction
The TEF promoter, the Cup1 gene, and the Ura3 terminator are ligated together, integrated into vox-ura3-vox system by homologous recombination. 5-FOA plate helps us to screen the correct cell. Similarly, the LIMT gene and the Ura3 nutritional label are integrated into the synthetic chromosome V, too.
PCR is used to check if we successfully completed the molecular biology construction.

Fig.5-1 the results of PCR. We use 2k plus Ⅱ as the marker. On four parallel lanes of the gel (number 1,2,3,4), run were four set of DNA molecules of known size ( 319bp for number 1, the LIMT; 186bp for number 2 and 3, the Cup1; 3114bp for number 4,the whole sequence contained Cup1). From the DNA band of number 1, we could analyze that vika has been expressed to delete the Cup1 and its terminor, so we can get the LIMT. From the DNA band of number 2, 3 and 4, we could delightedly prove that the fragments (TEF promoter, Cup1 and ura3 terminator) have successfully transformed to synthetic chromosome V.
Accumulation
Firstly, S.C-Cu, S8 (screened by SCRaMbLE) and BY4741 are cultured in YPD liquid media for 24 hours. Then add the 430 mg/L copper ions solution. Cells are cultured for another 45 hours (30℃). Atomic absorption spectroscopy is used to measure the concentration of copper ions in the supernatant every 5 hours. We depict the adsorption curve of copper ions.

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Aimtest2_-_-_TEXT.html,"of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA), for overexpression of specific genes resulting in increased stearic (and palmitic) acid output. Initially our modelling team were struggling to obtain kinetic data for FabA, and as this was unfortunately not an existing BioBrick component we decided we would create the FabA BioBrick in conjunction with our other submitted BioBricks. We then hoped to be able to use the data we would gather from FabA expression to help our modelling team by providing the kinetic parameters of this enzyme. The FabA BioBrick we submitted included His tags in the N-Terminus of the protein product to help with purification of this protein. FabA was also the only gene in the ‘FAS Module’ not present in the BioBrick library, we therefore felt this should be submitted as a useful tool for future iGEM Teams.
Why did we choose to knock out FadD?
Preliminary research showed that FadD was involved in the start of the beta-oxidation pathway, which breaks down fatty acids for energy. From this, we decided to attempt to knock-out the FadD gene in E. coli, replacing it with a marker for chloramphenicol resistance. Our Modelling team also explored the impact of removing enzymes that could potentially be involved in the breakdown of our products. They saw that the protein product of FadD has a negative impact on the accumulation of the longer chain fatty acids that we aim to produce, therefore supporting the experimental work.
One batch to rule them all?
Initial ideas surrounding our project led to us wanting to attempt to produce all 4 of our chosen fatty acids within the same cell. We believed that this would be advantageous for a number of reasons. Firstly, having all components produced within the same batch of bacteria would potentially reduce the running costs of the project on an industrial scale, as all vats within the setting would contain the exact same bacteria. This would also decrease the likelihood of any cross-contamination occurring. Another reason for the proposed one cell approach was that the products of the naturally-occurring mechanism for fatty acid biosynthesis (palmitic and stearic acid) could be overexpressed and then used to feed the following reactions; that of delta 9 desaturase (oleic acid) and delta 12 desaturase (linoleic acid). This would lead to all four components being dependent upon the production of the others, and we hypothesised that this pathway could be tuned so as to give different ratios of each fatty acid in the fatty acid profile seen."

We synthesized a series of RIOT sensors which is repressed by LldR and activated by L-lactate. Among them, Construct 7 and Construct 8 exhibited an increased sensitivity to lactate compared to the original sensors (namely, Construct 1 and 2).
To enhance the specificity of our RIOT system, we inserted Construct 7 in a low-copy plasmid backbone to fine-tune the expression of ALR. This may reduce their growth in the bloodstream and keep them from attacking healthy cells, which do secrete some concentration of lactate.
BACKGROUND:
Due to the ability to deregulate normal cellular energetics, cancer cells are found to undergo aerobic glycolysis, followed by lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol, resulting in the elevated production and accumulation of L-lactate in the surrounding environment (Chen et al., 2007; Vander et al., 2009; Alfarouk et al., 2015). In our group’s effort to specifically distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, we designed a collection of RIOT sensors which are responsive to L-lactate concentrations.
With specialised promoters from our collaborator, team
2015 ETH_Zurich , our RIOT sensors contain an alanine racemase (ALR) gene under the control of a lactate-sensitive promoter ( Figure 1 ). ALR is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of L-alanine ⇌ D-alanine. D-alanine is an essential amino acid that is required for bacterial cell survival (Walsh, 1989). One of our goals is to make the RIOT sensor activated in the presence of high lactate concentration, which enhance the survival of the bacteria so that they are able to attack the cancer cells more efficiently while leaving normal cells unharmed.
Fig 1. Mechanism of RIOT sensor. (A) In the absence of lactate, lldR binds to two operators in the promoter region and inhibit the expression of Alanine Racemase (ALR). D-alanine is an essential molecule for the cross-linkage of the peptidoglycan layer in bacterial cell wall. Therefore, without ALR, a lack of D-al"
Rutgers,2011,Team:Rutgers#Etch a Sketch_-_-_TEXT.html,", which should prevent the conformational change that releases the Jα-helix, was shown to abolish binding to DNA in the presence of light. As this cysteine is crucial in the function of LOV2, this result suggests that the observed light sensitivity of the DNA-binding activity is due to LOV2.
Mechanism of Action:
Taken from Strickland et al.
Dark state-DNA dissociated: The shared helix contacts the LOV domain and trpR is in an inactive conformation.
Photoexcitation occurs at 470nm (represented by the FMN chromophore going from yellow to white) causing the contact between the LOV domain and the shared helix to be disrupted. trpR now binds the helix and assumes its active conformation (represented by the helix going from blue to red).
The active trpR domain of LovTAP binds the trp operator
Cessation of light causes the LOV domain to return to its dark state, dissociating LovTAP from the DNA and reinstating contact between the LOV domain and shared helix.
iGEM & LovTAP
EPFL
LovTAP was initially cloned into a BioBrick and characterized by the EPF-Lausanne 2009 team. Strickland et al. measured only a 5-fold change in DNA-binding affinity from dark state to light state in LovTAP. Though this change is relatively small (in biological scales), the EPF-Lausanne team found that there is a significant change in transcriptional output in response to 470nm light. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the EPF-Lausanne team found two mutations that were predicted to improve LovTAP’s function by increasing the stability of the light state and decreasing the time it takes to flip from dark state to light state.
UNAM
A new LovTAP part was synthesized by the UNAM 2010 team via the alteration of EPF-Lausanne’s LovTAP. Primary changes include the removal of two 2 PstI restriction sites from the coding region of LovTAP and the addition of one of the point mutations that was proposed by the EPF-Lausanne team.
Our Project
For our circuit we will be using UNAM’s modified LovTAP, K360127. For the trp promoter and operator, we will be using our own ptrp, based on ptrpL K360023.
Possible issues

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes of leaf nodes could uniquely determine a tree structure. With help of Huffman codes, it is simple to compare the forest structure after and before exchange of both chains.
To go further, we must define the preference of each forest structure due to exchange of chains: compare each node of the first tree by their Huffman codes and weights in the same way as comparison of strings and if equal, compare the next until difference appears or to the end of either forest. If one is less than another, it has higher priority. With this definition, the order of those equal chains in the first-stage sorting is determined by the one which generates the forest strucuture with highest priority among all possibilities. By performing this algorithm for all groups of equal chains obtained from the first-stage sorting, we could find both the unique order of the chains and the groups of equivalent chains (exchange of the order fo several chains in the same equivalent group will not change the forest structure). The figure illustrates this idea graphically.
It is easy to compare two structures with help of chain sorting. We only need to compare first the chain list in order, chain by chain, and if equal, compare both associated forest structures. If two structures are same, the comparison must be equal since chains and trees are all in their unique order. If the comparison is equal, they must be the same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the chains as well as its associated forest structure.
Structural pattern match of template species
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template"

With 1 out of every 5 adults suffer from cardiovascular disease.
b. Chinese cardiovascular mortality
Cardiovascular disease mortality in rural and urban areas in 2013 is 293.69 / 100,000 and 259.40 / 100,000 respectively ( figure 1 ) ; death of cardiovascular diseases account for residents of diseases constitute 44.8 per cent in rural area and 41.9 per cent in cities, ranks first in the various diseases, higher than the tumors and other diseases.
c. The upward trend of cardiovascular mortality
The upward trend of cardiovascular mortality is due primarily to the increasing of ischemic heart disease (IHD). National disease surveillance system 2004-2011 mortality surveillance data shows that people over 35 years old of IHD mortality rates showed a clear upward trend in various parts of the China, IHD mortality annual rates for men 5% women 3.65%. Rural residents increased IHD mortality is fast, whether male or female, rural residents in IHD mortality are rising in 2004 to less than city residents as 2011 years higher than that of urban residents.
According to the data，we know the grim situation of ischemic heart disease, at the same time，we know more about the current conventional therapies such as drug treatment for ischemic heart disease (nitrates, and antithrombotic drugs, calcium channel blockers, etc), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Based on these data, combined with our expertise, we have decided to utilize synthetic biology to the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia.
B. Obesity
Obesity is among the ten chronic diseases than determined by the World Health Organization. With the increasing level of living, obesity can lead to various diseases and is closely linked to lifestyle. Being dependent on the United States, time magazine reported that over the past more than 30 years, obesity rates have been high around the world.

Part 2: THU-E Tryptophan-sensor Part
Aplasmid  used for performance test of our novel tryptophan sensor.
The sensor  was derived from one regulation sequence upstream of tryptophanase(tnaA) operon  in wild type E. Coli [3] . This sequence codesone 24-residue nascent peptide. Following  this nascent peptide sequence stands one transcription termination factor (Rho)  recognition sites. When certain amount of tryptophan exists, it is recognized  by the nascent peptide. This leads to the hindering of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro  from being cleaved from ribosome. This peptide-mRNA-ribosome complex blocks Rho  factor’s access to its binding site which is just adjacent to termination codon  of nascent peptide so that initiate the transcription of downstream sequence. As  far as we know, this novel mechanism has not been utilized before as tryptophan  sensor.
As a proof of  principle, we cloned beta-lactamase gene lacZ downstream of wild type nascent peptide and Rho interaction sequence. The  assembly was cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pTrc99A vector with  IPTG induction.By measuring the activity of beta-lactamase activity (the  protocol has been described in detail in our note, please refer to it) after  induction and 21-hours culture, we obtained our expected tryptophan dependent  beta-lactamase activity increase with dynamic range up to 3mM tryptophan.

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#BiobrickConstruction_-_-_TEXT.html,", MetA- +YFP, and also wildtype with the fluorescent genes. Recently, we switched backbones for the 13M RFP to Psb1C3, for we do not know the history of our current psb1C3 with rfp (we suspect it might be on the lac promoter, as per the registry guidelines), and we also put the GFP on the psb1C3 instead of a kanamycin resistant plasmid, because we were transforming into kanamycin resistant auxotrophs.
We are trying to grow the ArgC- and the ArgE- together in M9 to see if anything results, with negative controls for both. We also trying to grow the wildtype with the TrpB auxotroph with rfp to look for qualitative red fluorescence.
We miniprepped 4/6 of the biobricks that we ordered from the registry. We intend on sequencing them in the near future. We, lacking LB amp plates at the time, plated one on an M9 plate, but we now think that the strain the registry sent us is auxotrophic for something. We replated on LB amp after making new plates. The last one that we ordered did not arrive.

July 17
Today, we made dh5a and k12 competent cells. We also ran a cPCR on our biobrick colonies, and the results showed that they did not have an insert of the proper length.
As said yesterday, we grew the two arg auxotrophs together, and they grew substantially more (~0.15 OD600) than the negative control. The wt grew to an OD of about 1. We are growing them for another night to see if the OD of the mix increases at all.
Since sequencing confirmed a MetA biobrick, we transformed K12 cells with the remaining stock of our plasmid, so we could amplify it.
All relevant transformed strains from yesterday grew well on the plates.
- Jacob Toth
July 19 We miniprepped our metA biobrick (so we have enough to send to the registry and use for experiments), as well as new potential candidates for other biobricks (tyrA and ArgC).
We have, in the past few days, designed a plasmid that will aid in the testing of biobricks.
Concerning the kill switch plasmid parts, we want to take the psb1C3 plasmid, add a constitutively expressed LacI gene, and a lac promoter and rbs immediately"
TU_Delft,2010,Team:TU Delft#Lablog_-_-_TEXT.html,", this mineral medium is also known as P1. Find the original medium composition here .
Second, we decided to keep the MT stock solution because, alkB2 (one of our biobricks) requires certain minerals. Without this cofactors the protein won't work, however we lack of CuCl2 and MnSO4. So, we changed those salts for CuSO4 and MnCl2, we kept the molarity of the ions Cu+2 and Mn+2 (we made calculations and everything!). With these changes we hope to save some money and keep the richness of the medium intact (ish).
Lab work
BioBrick stocks
We got the first colonies, and they're red! Hurray!
Yesterday we grew colonies containing the vector backbones (which contain RFP). Today one colony from each plate was picked and cultivated in liquid (4 mL LB + 4 μL antibiotic) as well as solid LB medium (+20 μL antibiotic) with the corresponding antibiotic to grow overnight.
Thias purified the PCR products.

Today we tried to revive our strain. We added some water to the lyophilized powder. And we plated some microliters (100 ul) from the dispersion obtained on LB agar, E2 agar with octane and E2 with glucose. Let's hope for the best!. Growing temperature: 30º C

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html," the Biological Weapons Convention in  Geneva. We designed new primers for the target meningitis site, and for the homologous flanking sequences. One large sequence (3kb) used as our mock target DNA, and two smaller flanking regions (1kb each) that will be ligated to the repressor operon. LacZ and the Pxyl+comK sequences are being BioBricked. The lacZ currently in the registry (found here ) is of poor quality and not available beyond the 2012 iGEM distribution plates. Pxyl+comK will allow for other teams to create super-competent B. subtilis cells. Although technically it isn’t increased competency, rather, it is competency that is induced by xylose.
Week 12: Aug 11 - 15
Most synthesized sequences have arrived, preparing to ligate reporter coding sequences to the synthesized genes and use them with the standard BioBrick vector plasmids. Since we have had a lot of trouble ligating the small RBS parts, we will be using the reporter genes as the genes for the repressors - all that is necessary is a constitutive promoter, we only need to make sure that there will be no overlap with the repressor/operators innately in B. subtilis. The promoter/operator/repressors C1-434, C2-P22, and C1-lambda originate from bacteriophages and so we do not expect activity in B. subtilis. Conversely, lacI is a common gene and according to our searches it exists in both B. subtilis and E. coli
Week 13: Aug 18 - 22
We continued working on assembling our reporter with the synthesized promoter/regulatory constructs. RFP is being used for now because it is readily available and familiar, but lacZ will be used as soon as it is available in BioBrick form. We are also planning on ligating the repressors to the synthesized constructs - we have not been able to assemble the repressor genes manually due to poor success with cloning the RBS.
We also worked on our collaboration with Colombia - developing and testing a “homebrew” method of making competent cells using reagents and equipment available outside of a laboratory. We will first attempt to use tap, bottled, and distilled water with calcium added via over-the-counter supplements.
The isothermal PCR kit from TwistDx has arrived. We are now preparing to i) individually test the isoPCR kit and the Blood PCR kit for efficacy with our mock pathogen, under standard conditions (i.e."

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Notebook.html_-_-_TEXT.html," gold peptides and gold sensing device adding the rest of prefix and suffix. It all worked but the gel is really really hideous thus it will not appear up in here. We leave the rest for tomorrow.
August 15th
We extract the plasmids from overnight cultures using NucleoSpin Plasmid(Macherey-Nagel) and digest them with ThermoFisher's FastDigest enzymes:
Every triplet is: 1st the control, 2nd PstI digest and 3rd the EcoRI & SpeI digest. It is obvious that there is nothing near the size of 5kb visible. However, the 1kb fragment that is visible in double digest shows us that it is actually the template we used for pSB1C3 backbone amplification. 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, 1kb ladder(Invitrogen) (on the right).
So the solution is simple: we digest the Gibson reactions we had with DpnI(Promega) thus removing the background and then repeat the transformations.
At the same time we continued working with other sequences. Amplified gBlocks (peptides,the gold device) were purified with QIAquick kit, digested with EcoRI & PstI and then purified again using the same kit - this step frees our samples of small 2-6bp long fragments making the ligation easier. We also digest the linearised plasmid from iGEM HQ with the same enzymes and purify it as well. Even though this leads us to a very low concentration of pSB1C3, it is still enough for transformations as long as there are no problems with ligations. So we then make the reactions with T4 Ligase(Thermo Fisher) and proceed with the transformations.
August 16th
The day of GoTaq colony PCRs. So basically Gintare marched to the lab to do PCR of 44 colonies (and we are all aware of how annoying it is). Results were pretty straightforward with the peptides and gold sensing device parts. On the left gel below first four are BBa_K1127000 , then BBa_K1127001 and BBa_K1127003 . On the second gel: BBa_K1127002 , followed by two constituents (which we join together later) of BBa_K1127008 and then BBa_K1127010 which was not submitted. Two colonies of each were cultivated overnight.
However, the results for mtr complexes were weird. So we picked a few cultures and grew them overnight for further analysis"

High Fidelity PCR
To amplify the dxCas9-Linker-Tn5 (5655 bp) Tn5-Linker-dxCas9 (5660 bp) coding sequence from the ligation product, high fidelity PCR was done. The template DNA is the ligation mixture and the primers that are used are the combinations 001 & 006 and 002 & 007 respectively. Two 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol .

The protein models showed low alignment, high disorder and low sequence coverage, this is due to the fact there are few proteins with high sequence homology that have crystal structures resolved for the proteins UKC were working with. The models we produced were the best possible approximation of these proteins structures from homology based modelling. Thus, giving our attempt at modelling their structures gave them a rough indication of what their proteins could look like.
Figure 2: Mam X soluble cleaved protein model . Intensive search of UKC’s Mam X soluble-cleaved protein on Phyre2 to try model a 3D structure of the proteins.
The intent behind this modelling aspect of the collaboration was to use our knowledge of homology protein modelling to help UKC approximate the structures their protein models after they attempted to remove the transmembrane region. Simultaneously, they helped us in observing the adherence of S. oneidensis to potential cathode materials. The results on both ends were not what was expected in that while the bacteria did adhere to the graphite they did not adhere to iron, and we did not manage to take these experiments further to start optimising biofilm growth conditions. We demonstrated however that S. oneidensis will adhere to graphite, and this informed our demonstration experiment. Similarly, for UKC we have attempted to model their protein structures to the best possible approximation.

Overview
In this country profile, information about of synthetic biology in Japan has been compiled from on-line sources. Searches were conducted only in English media. This country profile contains information about different aspects of synthetic biology in Japan, including regulation, perception, and organization.
Synthetic biology in Japan is somewhat artificially underrepresented because very few researchers identify their work as related to synthetic biology. Most researchers instead classify their work using more established terms, such as ‘systems biology’.  This also could be related to very few people in Japan recognizing the term “synthetic biology” (Mori & Yoshizawa, 2011). Nonetheless, Japan is one of the leading Asian countries in synthetic biology. It is the Asian country with the most entries on the SynBio map (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). Also, Japanese universities have regularly participated and gained high achievements in the iGEM competition.
Synbio Map
SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in synthetic biology research (""Synthetic biology project:,""). It is a good tool for comparing the growth of synthetic biology around the world. This map was created by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Japan is a leading Asian country in synthetic biology. It has a total of 22 entries. Synthetic biology research is focused in or near the capital, Tokyo. Around half of the entries (13) are from this region. Other regions listed in the map include: Kyoto (5), Osaka (1), Sapporo (2), and Nagoya (1) (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). It is notable that in comparison with China and South Korea, Japan has more private companies participating in synthetic biology research. In fact, one third of"

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Notebooks Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," a 5 mL culture of the AE Blue-CBD-His tag, I tried to test the CBD. First, I used the sonicator to lyse 2 mL aliquots of the AE blue-CBD-his tag culture then I added 1 mM  of EDTA (3.5 uL added from the .138 mM stock solution). After this, I dropped 15 uL of the lysate onto a cellose sheet and onto a glass fiber sheet. The intent was to wash each sheet with water after dropping 15 uL and then to check how much of the protein had stuck to the sheet, but I determined that the color wasn't concentrated enough for me to see if the CBD was working. Next time, I'll either use extracted protein or spin the culture down and resuspend in far less media (like 1 or 2 mL).
●
After allowing the chromoproteins tested on Friday to dry on the benchtop over the weekend, I put them on the heating block and heated them to 70 °C for 30 min then they were let to cool on the lab bench instead of rehydrating. The color still came back.

After being allowed to cool for 1.5 hours.
●
To further investigate whether or not the observed color change in the chromoproteins comes from dehydration or from the heat (or both). I spun down cultures of Prancer Purple and Scrooge Orange then put 20 uL of each type of color into two PCR tubes. I then added 30 uL of water to one of the two PCR tubes per color. This was done to test if the chromoproteins would lose their color in the presence of water. I placed these PCR tubes in a PCR machine and set it to cycle up from 50 °C to 75 °C every 5 minutes at 5 °C intervals. After this, I observed no color change in any of the tubes (those that had the additional 30 uL of water looked the same as those that were just the cell clumps). After this, I replaced the PCR tubes into the PCR and set the machine to run at 80 °C for an hour. When I removed the tubes, again I found that there was no color change.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," two proteins resulted in a target specific transposition. As a proof of concept, we showed that our fusion protein is target specific with an in vitro targeted integration assay, that was verified by visualising the amplified integration products with gel electrophoresis. Once we established the functionality and optimal conditions, we implemented the fusion protein in the established rapid next generation sequencing library preparation protocol from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We replaced the original transposase, responsible for random integration of the sequencing adaptors, by our novel fusion protein. In our case, a specifically designed sgRNA will guide the fusion protein to the exon-exon junction target site and prepare only gene doping DNA for sequencing. Additionally, we developed a sgRNA model which identified the optimal exon-exon target site by searching for the least sgRNA’s required to cover all possible variation of the target sites due to synonymous mutations of EPO coding sequence. A sgRNA array of the resulting 12 sgRNAs can be used in a single library preparation, utilizing the multiplexing capability of dxCas9 ( Cong et al., 2013 ). As a result, we could simultaneously test for the gene doping variants, improving the efficiency of our method.
Figure 5. Targeted integration by our fusion protein. The sgRNA loaded dxCas9 binds to the target DNA via complementary matching. The transposase integrates sequencing adapters next to the target site.
Further, we implemented multiplexing with barcodes to improve method efficiency, reduce cost, and expand the throughput. We created a barcoding webtool to generate unique barcodes, which are integrated into the adapter sequences that are ligated to the target sequence. This  allows us to sequence samples from multiple different athletes in the same run and trace the output sequence back to corresponding barcode ( Bayliss et al., 2017 ).
4. Targeted sequencing
After library preparation, we sequence the samples using a MinION, portable real-time sequencing device, from ONT. Only targeted sequences with adapters are translocated through the pores of ONT’s via the nanopore motor protein. The remaining untagged DNA will not be sequenced. By making a simple enzyme substitution, we transformed ONT’s established next generation sequencing platform into a targeted next generation sequencing platform .

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," 2070bp. No contamination is observed in the negative control without DNA  No unexpected sized bands are seen. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Figure 17.Verification digest of transformed mutated and non mutated new TALE B target sequences in Top10 E. coli cells. All of the TALE target sequences lanes show bands at 500bp and 2100bp, the TALE target sequences and backbone are expected at 501bp and 2070bp. No contamination is observed in the negative control without DNA, the positive control shows bands at 1100bp, 2100bp and 3100bp; the RFP gene, backbone, and uncut plasmid are expected at 1100bp, 2070bp and 3170bp, respectively. No unexpected sized bands are seen. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
The results of the BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B sequencing were back. However, we realized that TALEs have a Kozak sequence at the beginning, which increases the distance between the promoter and the start codon of the gene. Therefore, a primer (TALseqF) was designed  to take out TALE A and TALE B without the Kozak sequence. The PCR performed with forward primer TALseqF and reverse primer BBK R on TALEs was successful.
BsaI enzyme finally arrived. So the constructions of construct 10 ( BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +linker+K coil) and construct 9 ( BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE B +linker+K coil) in Golden Gate reaction were performed. The ligation reactions were run on the gel and expected bands were observed. However, the transformation was unsuccessful because of the new competent cells which were not properly made.
The PCR products of TALE A and TALE B without the Kozak sequence were run on a 1% gel and contained a lot of non specific amplification.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
The 5 TALE B target sequences were sequence verified and are good.
We repeated PCR of TALE A and TALE B without the Kozak sequence and it worked (Figure 18), so the PCR products were ligated with BBa_J04500 and successfully transformed. Subsequent colony PCR showed some positive results (Figures 19 and 20).
