Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference
On September 16th, we are invited to Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference & Meet-up by UCAS-China . We presented our projects and discussed the current and future collaboration between member teams of this brand new Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance. In addition, we communicated with teachers from the Institute of Biophysics. After, each team presented a small souvenir as the symbol of their team, put it into the collection case UCAS-China prepared for this conference.
We hope the league would promote communication and cooperation between us.
With OUC
We help they characterize the effectiveness of their first system, miniToe, proving that their system has the same trend under other experimental conditions. As the figure shows, the orange line refers to the system which is induced while the blue line is the control group, The big difference in expression level between two line indicate that the system is working well as a switch.
Figure.1 Their minToe system worked well in our lab.
With XMU
With the same interest in KaiABC oscillator, we kept close contact with XMU at the very beginning. Apart from communication in design and modeling, we had shared our plasmids that respectively carried RpaA, SasA and CikA with them as soon as we heard their problem.
With TJU-China
We were glad to help them prepare the part backbone, pSB1C3 since they had too many biobricks to submit and the vector always run out.
They generously helped us measure the degradation of the origin with improved NanoLuc in 3 hours, proved our improved part could work effectively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741.
Figure.2 The part they characterized for us.
With HUST-China
We were glad to help HUST-China contact with experts they required. In the course of project researching, they read a paper from Tianjin University and sought assistance from us. Our teacher answered their questions about the paper and made some new suggestions. In late August, their team's student, Cheng Long, came to communicate with their iGEMers in 2015 about their project which was focus on Shewanella as well. Moreover"

Another signal molecule we are fascinating with is D-Dimer. What we have found is the crystal structure of D-Dimer (PDB ID: 2Q9I), and the amino acid sequence of D-Dimer scFv. SWISS-MODEL helps us to model the structure of D-Dimer scFv. Next is docking, finding out the interface.
Figure 14. D-Dimer scFv local docking RMSD
After rounds of docking, finally we found the interface (Figure 14). As has mentioned before, this RMSD plot shows a reliable result of docking. The final step is RosettaAntibodyDesign. Here, we made a bold attempt, execute the command -random_start. This will start graft design with a new set of CDRs from the database, not biasing the run with native CDRs. The result is successful. The binding energy has been optimized from -31.561 to -54.875 (unit:REU). Since the CDR region is totally different after mutation, we can claim to create a new antibody. Merely, the position of interface is the same.

We can also redesign DNA sequence. Here is an example, a promoter and transcription factor complex, tTA. In fact, the structure of tTA has not been tested through experiment. However, TetR, another transcription factor that has the same sequence on the protein-DNA interface, has known structure (PDB ID: 1QPI). So it is equivalent to redesign the interface of TetR.

The transcription factor is colored to show its electrostatics distribution. It should be mentioned that the area with less electric charge is always hydrophobic.

background-FACTS AND STATISTICS
Celiac Disease A worldwide problem
Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune disease that damages the villi of the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food. According to National Foundation for Celiac Awareness (NFCA) one out of every 133 Americans has celiac disease, equivalent to nearly 1% of the U.S. population. Unfortunately, 83% of the 3 million Americans living with celiac disease remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Celiac disease is a genetic disorder, in some cases, stressful events such as pregnancy, surgery, infection, or severe emotional distress can trigger the onset of the disease. Damaged villi make it nearly impossible for the body to absorb nutrients into the bloodstream, leading to malnourishment and a host of other problems including some cancers, thyroid disease, osteoporosis, infertility and the onset of other autoimmune diseases.
Unfortunately,6-10 years is the average time a person waits to be correctly diagnosed. (Daniel Leffler, MD, MS, The Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center) 5-22% of celiac patients have an immediate family member (1st degree relative) who also has celiac.
The celiac disease diagnosis rate may reach 50-60% by 2019, thanks to efforts to raise public awareness of celiac disease. ( Datamonitor Group, 2009). 
Beyond the health difficulty and dealing with the illness, and the associated symptoms, an additional problem of celiac disease families is keeping up with the cost of celiac-free food.
Over a four-year period, people with undiagnosed celiac disease cost an average of $3,964 more than healthy individuals.  ( Long et al, 2010)
Gluten-free sales reached more than $2.6 billion by the end of 2010 and are now expected to exceed more than $5 billion by"

Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial#Core repressilator_-_-_TEXT.html," could be controlled. The bacteria were grown in a trapping chamber, and when the flow rate through the main tube was increased or decreased, the quorum sensing molecules diffused away faster or slower, altering the oscillation period (see Figure 2 ).
Figure 2: An oscillator in a flow chamber. By increasing or lowering the flow rate of water through the tube, the autoinducer (AI, which promotes transcription when bound to LuxR) diffuses more or less quickly out of the chamber, allowing control of the oscillation rate.
Image: Danino et al. (2009)
Strategy: The core repressilator
Our original intentions were to build upon this pre-existing work on the familiar and famous repressilator system, replacing the unwieldy quorum-sensing systems with a more elegant light-based solution. Communication via light would not only eliminate the need for chemical signalling, but also produce a highly visible and easily recognisable means of viewing and verifying the system in action. These dual advantages would hopefully serve as a proof of concept for a methodology that would have wide-ranging benefits throughout synthetic biology.
The overall oscillating design of our system would be composed of two parallel networks working in the same direction as an associated repressilator, with the addition of red, blue, and green light as a signalling mechanism. The inner network would function in the same manner as the repressilator designed by Garcia-Ojalvo and Elowitz in 2004, containing three genes in an ordered circular fashion (lambda-cI, lacI, tetR). The outer network, on the other hand, would consist of the three light sensors and their associated light producers.
The integrated network ( Figure 3 ) could thus be considered in terms of its three separate components:
Component 1: red luciferase, LacI, red sensor.
Component 2: blue luciferase, TetR, blue sensor.
Component 3: green luciferase, lambda-cI, green sensor.
Figure 3: A diagrammatic representation of the repressilator coupled to the light sensing and production pathways.
Within each component, the light (the luciferase of the associated wavelength) and the repressor would be both either active or inactive at the same time. For example, in Component 1, high levels of lambda-cI would repress the activity of both the red luciferase and LacI; as soon as the levels of lambda-cI begin to fall, the concentration of red luciferase and LacI in the system would increase in tandem.

Heavy Metals' Enrichment
overview
Our HPers have conducteded research in Shanxi Province. They found factories directly choose to deal with only one main kind of the heavy metals, then abandon others. The convenient treatment obviously can't satisfy the environmental requirements. Thus, we demand a type of bacterium to handle two types of heavy metal ions together.
The genetic circuit based on the Vika-Vox system enables stepwise treatment, owing to a switch from the expression of Cup1 (copper accumulation) to LIMT (cadmium accumulation). We grow our yeasts and measure the concentration of heavy metal ions in the supernatant"

Project Description
Overview
GUPPI is a system to induce gelation. In the last few years, quite some papers have been published about gelation and liquid-liquid phase separation. [1-4] The consensus throughout literature is that gelation can be achieved by using protein structures that can undergo multiple interactions. These proteins are known as multivalent proteins. The influence of multivalency on cluster formation has been evaluated in both intra and extra cellular applications. This is shown by both experimental and in silico work. [5-7]
Based on this information, we have designed a novel system based on a well studied protein-protein interaction. In our project, we have created two multivalent constructs that interact with each other to form a network of proteins, the basics of a gel. More information about the principles and proteins can be found in the ""Background"".
The System
Our designed system is named GUPPI, after Gelation Using Protein Protein Interactions, see also ""Design & Parts"".
Just as the iGEM team before us, we will use the 14-3-3 protein as basis of our designed system. Last year, the 14-3-3 protein was used as scaffold and they mutated many different sites to tune the interaction strength. This year we will go back to one type of 14-3-3, and instead of mutating sites of the monomer, we will use it as building block for a very large protein, consisting out of multiple monomers. The 14-3-3 protein naturally forms a dimer with itself, and thus has a valency of 2. We increased the amount of monomers via DNA design, which led to a valency of 4. However, studies [5-7] have shown that a valency ratio of 3:4 shows promising results in creating gel structures. Therefor a simple DNA mutation in the last monomer of the construct has been performed, we blocked the functionality of the last monomer, leading to a functional valency of 3. The structure of this construct is shown schematically in Figure"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#OSCAR#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Corrosion of pipelines leads to higher maintenance costs as well as the grim possibility of these and other toxins leaking into the environment.   There is a need for methods to degrade NAs that are not prohibitively expensive or that would result in production of other hazardous chemicals.
The main goal of OSCAR is to turn toxins like these into useable hydrocarbons by removing the carboxylic acid group(s) (Behar & Albrecht, 1984).   Since NAs from petroleum deposits are a variable mixture, an enzymatic process with broad specificity is necessary. With the removal of the carboxylic acid moiety, we aim to produce alkanes suitable for use as fuel. The goal of this subproject was to find one or more suitable pathways to accomplish the decarboxylation of compounds such as NAs with the broadest specificity.
The PetroBrick
The 2011 Washington iGEM team developed the PetroBrick ( BBa_K590025. ), a BioBrick consisting of two primary genes. These include acyl-ACP reductase ( AAR ), which reduces fatty acids bound to ACP to fatty aldehydes, and a second gene called aldehyde decarbonylase ( ADC ), which subsequently cleaves the entire aldehyde group and results in a hydrocarbon chain (Sukovich, 2010). Essentially this allows for hydrocarbons to be produced from glucose.  What we realized though, is that the fatty acids that the PetroBrick targets, have a very similar structure to NAs.
Figure 1: A comparison of the structure of fatty acids and naphthenic acids
We predicted that the PetroBrick may have the potential to turn NAs in to hydrocarbons and be a perfect solution to remediating NAs!  First though, we needed to show that the PetroBrick did in fact work as expected.  We had some difficulty with the DNA from the registry and had to request the constructs directly from the Washington team.  Once we had the PetroBrick, we needed to verify that the PetroBrick would work in our hands as it did for the 2011 Washington team .  Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate the function of the PetroBrick.
Figure 2: Gas chromatograph of the differences in peak composition between an E. coli control and the PetroBrick. There was a large increase in a peak with a retention time of 12.25 min, suggesting that the PetroBrick was producing a new hydrocarbon compound.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Our team used a Golden Gate based DNA cloning system, called GoldenBraid in order to construct the different DNA parts of our project. Unluckily, GoldenBraid 2.0 and BioBrick standard parts are different. The parts of the two systems have different flanking recognition sites and the overhangs obtained upon digestion are also different. Therefore, we needed a strategy to convert GoldenBraid standard parts to BioBricks.
We sent 7 Parts to the registry. Four of them, the coding sequences from AtrΔ11, HarFAR and EaDAcT (Biosynthesis) and the TA29 promoter (Biosafety) were converted to the Biobrick standard in collaboration with the NRP-UEA-Norwich team, who very kindly provided us with their Mo-Flippers . These were modified pSB1C3 plasmids altered to include GoldenBraid restriction enzymes recognition sites.
In addition, we designed a new vector that can be used to convert GoldenBraid multigenic assemblies into the BioBrick standard. This new vector is a modified pSB1A3 plasmid with two BsmBI recognition sites leaving upon BsmBI digestion overhangs that match the GoldenBraid 2.0 grammar (Figure 1). We called this new vector ""omega undercover"" as it works as the GoldenBraid 2.0 omega vector with a pSB1A3 backbone. This vector was sent to the Registry, so it can be used for future teams using Golden Gate based cloning strategies.
Figure 1.""Omega undercover"" vector.
Using the omega undercover plasmid we constructed the remaining 2 Parts that were sent to the Registry (Figure 2). These were two biosafety devices that consisted of two modules, a male sterility module ( See Biosafety"

The supernatant of these samples was then tested via SDS-gelelectrophoresis. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain any clear results from the SDS gel and thus could not verify the expression of subtilisin E.
Testing the folding and activity
Day 1
As we were not able to detect the expression of the modified proteases via SDS gel, we proceeded by executing a skim milk assay on agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotics. Therefore, we streaked the cells containing the modified expression systems on these plates and incubated at 30°C for three days.
Figure 1: Skim milk plates assay. Cells producing the native protease (picture A-C, left) in comparison to either cells containing the empty backbone (picture A, right) or cells carrying the SDM 3-modified (picture B, right) and the SDM 1-modified expression system (picture C, right) after incubation for 3 days at 30°C.
Neither the empty backbone nor the SDM 1-modified expression system did seem to cause a proteolytic activity. A clearance and therefore a proteolytic activity could only be observed for the native protease (as demonstrated before) and the SDM 3-modified expression system.
Via SDM 1 we exchanged the targeted serine in the active site against a bigger amino acid, namely tyrosine. By demonstrating that this modification doesn’t result in a clearance of the skim milk plates, we were now able to prove that serine is essential for the proteolytic activity of the protease and that exchanging it would inactivate the enzyme.
SDM 3 has been executed to exchange tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site against tryptophan, a bigger amino acid. As seen on the pictures above, a clearance has occurred for those modified cells and a proteolytic activity could be assumed. Contrary to our former beliefs, it could now be deduced that exchanging tyrosine doesn’t result in a change of activity. Consequently, tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site is not essential for the activity of subtilisin E.
Conclusion
We were able to proof that serine in the active site would result in a loss of activity. Hence, we demonstrated that exchanging serine against a photo-labile, non-canonical amino acid will inactivate subtilisin E and therefore proved the principle of our project.

SDS-PAGE shows the expression of fumarate reductase in E. coli KRX  under control of the T7 promotor ( BBa_1465102 ). Fumarate reductase with a total molecular mass of 121 kD consists of four subunits. There are two large catalytic and water-soluble subunits, flavoprotein (66 kDa) and iron-sulfur protein (27 kDa). Two small membrane associated subunits (15 and 13 kDa) are not detectable in SDS-PAGE . ( Iverson et al., 1999 ).
Figure 8 shows the result of the SDS-PAGE of isolated membrane proteins via cold osmotic shock of E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 . Membrane protein fractions at different times after induction of BBa_1465102 are displayed.
Figure 8: Results of the SDS-PAGE of purified membrane protein from Escherichia coli BBa_1465102 via cold osmotic shock . Expected size of fumarate reductase subunits A and B are 66 kDa and 27 kDA respectively. Increasing band at 66 kDa could be recognized attributable to subunit A. Increasing band between 40 and 55 kDa could be referable to dimer or trimer build-up by subunit B, C and D.
SDS-PAGE shows a significantly higher protein concentration in membrane extracts from E. coli overexpressing frd under control of T7 promoter ( BBa_1465102 ) after induction. This is caused by usually higher membrane protein concentration of cultivated cells attributable to higher optical density. Nevertheless, a strong overexpression band can be observed at the expected Frd size (subunit A) of about 66 kDa for BBa_1465102 , which can be traced back on the strong expression and overproduction of Frd. Besides an overexpression band can be recognized at a size of about 45 kDA. This could be explained by dimer formation of two or three Frd subunits, for example subunit B (27 kDa) with subunit C oder D (13 and 15 kDA). That implies that subunit B build up stable dimers with small membrane associated subunits C and D of about 40 kDa respectively 42 kDa. There seems to be no dimers of subunit A with other parts of the Frd.

Economics + Energy markets
The growing application of blue energy and changing regulations on GMOs in the European Union results in media attention from all over the world. People are interested in blue bio energy setup at the Afsluitdijk and research centres that work on the implementation of new ideas by using genetic modification. Investors see the rising potential of blue bio energy and the numerous other applications involving synthetic biology, and start to invest in it. Countries outside the EU are on the one hand sceptical about the new developments, and are worried about the environment, but on the other hand they see the benefits of the application of synthetic biology. Certain countries decide not to allow for the import of GMO products, but in general the new technological possibilities sell well on the world market, stimulating the economy of the producing countries in the European Union. Also in the EU itself people are keen on buying the latest gadgets. In industry, new factories are set up that use the increased efficiency in the conversion of biomass to fuels and platform chemicals. In addition, the pilot plant of blue energy at the Afsluitdijk is replaced by a fully operational installation with the modified biofilm. Competition by these new ways of generating electricity, of which blue bio energy is one, causes a drop in energy prices. Consumers can choose where their electricity comes from, and the surplus of electricity generated in the Netherlands is sold to other countries. As a result, the global energy market is less dominated by oil-producing countries and more by concern about GMOs.
Politics + Globalization
The risks concerning the use of GMOs are of global importance. The use of synthetic biology in everyday applications in the EU raises awareness internationally, as genetically modified bacteria in the blue bio energy installation could end up in the environment, thereby posing danger to the ecosystem. Some political parties are against the use of the genetically modified organisms, but the majority believes that synthetic biology can very well be used in applications as long as the risks are small. Besides the Netherlands, other EU countries start using blue bio energy installations where fresh water flows into the sea or where dikes between fresh and salt water are present. The use of solar energy and CO2 capturing is used worldwide to reduce the greenhouse effect. The United Nations Climate Change conference held in 2040 tells, for the first time in years, a positive story, as the perspectives for the future are good.

Socio-technical
This cluster is about how technical details and performance of your project integrate to socially important aspects.
Ethics: here statements related to “unnaturalness” and “playing for god” are considered. Another important aspect in the bioethics is about patenting/open source and whether the technology is beneficial to everyone.
Biosafety: did your team added enough information on how to work safe with your constructs and how you prevent a microorganism spreading through the environment in the project? And did you provide sufficient solutions to that?
Biosecurity: are people afraid that the project could be used for bioterrorism for example?
Socio-economical
This is more about whether people will accept your developed technology/end product and see the importance in the project.
Achievement goals: does an outsider think your end product/technology solves an important problem? Also: is your team capable of communicating about these goals?
Acceptance: are there extra regulations required for your technology/end product and do they actually accept the way you are achieving your product goals.
Market performance
Functionality here you can actually test whether the outsider thinks your promises can become true.
Project Management
Project Management
We discovered that teamwork is not always easy and therefore we decided that the tool would also be useful in guiding the teamwork. To have successful project management, we considered both the technical and personal aspects related           to the project.
Technical aspects
Nationalities/expertise: we did not define this as a direct risk, since a mixture of people and cultures could be beneficial for the project. However, every team member has to be aware that differences in background or culture could               cause communication problems.
Supervisor: every successful iGEM team has a supervisor. Not to tell the team exactly what to do, but to educate them, provide technical details and also to keep the team on track. Therefore, a low score in this part could be signal               that some things should change.
Trust: in teamwork it is very important that team members trust each other. If there is a low score in trust, we advise you to have a constructive talk with each other.
Personal
Skills: first of all, it is the question whether every person has the skills to perform his/her tasks. Moreover, it is about the totality of skills present in the team necessary to achieve the project goals. Also experiments are part                 of almost every project and therefore it is important that the team trusts the persons in the"

We use C++ as our programming language, cmake to manage our project, git to reversion control , yacc and lex to build our model file input assistant tool, Qt4 to build the GUI, Oracle dbxml as our Database manager system. Other wise, several 3-rd party open source software or tools are used in our iGame source code. Libsbml is used to deal with sbml file operations. Qwt and Qwtplot3D are used for simulation data visual system.  At the early stage of our project SBML Ode Solver and Sundials were our main ode solver to produce the simulation data from our sbml model file, because the latest SBML Ode Solver is 1.6.0, developed in 2005, which is out of date and fail to support the newest sbml Level 2 Version 4 standard. We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

Introduction
In order for bacteria to be successfully cultured, they must be grown in the appropriate media. LB, also known as Lysogeny broth, is a nutrient rich broth that is a standard for culturing Escherichia coli, as it allows for quick growth and high yields. Therefore, the proper preparation of LB will be crucial to maintaining our bacterial stock throughout the summer. Furthermore, addition of agar to LB broth creates a gel for bacteria to grow upon, and is therefore used for plating bacterial cultures on petri dishes. ** WATCH THESE VIDEOS BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS PROTOCOL*** Making LB agar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Ndr9AVowM Pouring plates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4L16Vu5MSk BASIC TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS Agar vs. Agarose: Agar is used for making petri plates to culture organisms, while agarose is used for making gels, in the likes of SDS-PAGE and gel electrophoresis SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets. PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back. Autoclave: The autoclave should only be handled by leads and managers. ***Note that any autoclaved materials may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.

We noticed during the meetup in Munich that we our both teams had a good foundation for a coopartion. We skyped several times discussing our projects and how to exactly work together to bring our both teams forward. We also had the pleasure of meeting Micheal face to face when he spontanously showed up in Freiburg.  In addition, we met again at the Aachen meetup and finalized the collaboration. Team Aachen helped us by providing us with laser-cutted photomasks for 384 well plates that made it possible to generate QR-codes on 384 well plates.  They also started to generate an app for us that is able to scan a cell culture plate and read out the gained data-matrix. The Application is based on Windows Phone 8. Michael programmed it for us and was very helpful during the trouble shooting process. However, as we started the collaboration a bit too late, the app could not be finished. Nevertheless, it could be shown that in principle, a data matrix can be read by the app. The app acts intuitive, quick and easy and promotes various application areas in the future.

We returned the favour by validating their measurment  device for the ascertainment of optical densites. As we knew that they generated their data for procaryotic cells and they had no possibility to work with mammalian cells, we measured the OD for mammalian cell suspensions.
We made dilution series of a murine cell lines (NIH3T3) with a starting cell number of 10^6 cells per ml, what is a realistic working density and measured the transmission of light with a prototype of their device. In parallel we measured the optical density (OD) of each sample with NanoDrop. To verify the data we performed the experiment with biological as well as with technical triplicates. Cells were diluted in completed growth medium to simulate realistic conditions. Providing these data for Team Aachen they could calculate the true OD value of each sample. The Team incorporated our measured data in their project.

Decatecholization
Catechol is a toxic compound found in tailings ponds that is a by-product of polyaromatic hydrocarbon metabolism (Vaillancourt et al., 2006, Schweigert et al., 2001)).   The chemical properties of catechol allow it to react with biomolecules, causing cellular damage including DNA damage, enzyme inactivation and membrane uncoupling (Schweigert et al., 2001).
Catechol is characterized as having a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups at the 2,3 position.   It can be converted to 2-hydroxymuconic acid by the enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, encoded by the xylE gene on the Tol plasmid of Pseudomonas putida (Nakai et al., 1983).

Thanks to Henrike's expert eyes, we were able to harvest many colonies from the chloramphenicol pSB3C5 plasmid as well as many for the J61002 plasmid and the kanamycin plasmid. Since the chloramphenicol plasmid seemed closest to the p23019 plasmid for which we already had primers, it made sense to pursue the Gibson strategy for that plasmid. Alessandro and Vincent made culture tubes and put those in the incubator overnight. In the meanwhile, primers were designed for the next phase of Gibson assembly (i.e. the new pSB3C5 plasmid with the old TetR piece).
Gel from the tetR mutants PCR. 1000kb ladder.
We ran the PCR on the tetR linear template, using Clara's primers for PCR mutagenesis.
Six PCRs were run. The first amplified the common sequence of the mutants: everything up to the mutated sites. The six other reactions amplified the second half of the gene, inducing specific mutations in tetR.
The fluorescence traces are insufficiently clear for accurate conclusions, therefore the PCR and gel will be repeated with different concentrations on Monday.

Vincent came in to pick up the J61002, pSB3C5, and pSB3K1 cultures from the incubator. He found that all the J61002 cultures were pink (as expected since they have the RFP gene). Both kanamycin cultures were pink, and two of the three chloramphenicol cultures were pink (though not as strong a pink as that of the J61002 plasmid). He went ahead and mini-prepped all the cultures, using hot water (55 C) instead of warm TE buffer during the elution step. He then made glycerol stocks (50% cell, 50% glycerol) and placed them in the -80 freezer. Finally, he measured the concentration of the resulting DNA after the mini-prep:

How does this part work?
Our SaCas9 can be programmed to cleave specific target sequence followed by the PAM sequence (5’-NNGRRT-3’).
To express SaCas9, it requires suitable machinery such as promoter, RBS,and terminator.
To programme SaCas9, you need to design guide RNA (tracrRNA [2], 21 bp spacer flanked by direct repeats [2] ).
Advantages of SaCas9 compared with the conventional Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9:
Smaller size (1053 amino acids against 1368) resulting in an easier expression/delivery
Different PAM sequence recognised (5’-NNGRRT-3’ ) increasing the usability
Higher efficiency of SaCas9 over SpCas9 [2]

Worldshaper-Wuhan,2017,Team:Worldshaper-Wuhan#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," miR-21 as the new biomarker to be used in diagnosing and treatment colorectal cancer.
What is the miRNA Sponge?
miRNA Sponges contain complementary binding sites to a miRNA of interest, which inhibit miRNA activity[14]. Currently, miRNA Sponges served as inhibitors for many miRNA in research[15]. When perfectly matched, RNA sponge site will bind to the target miRNA preventing it from binding to their target mRNAs and to perform mRNA silencing. This mechanism gives rise to our idea of fusing a sponge RNA with binding sites complementary to the sequence of miR-21 to a plasmid that has reporter gene, EGFP-C1 for instance, which will monitor the expression of miR-21 in the cells.

The last constitutive promoter is Kan resistant.  Vanessa Yanez and Alberto looked for induced promoters and Shannon and Margueax looked for RBSs.  After locating our parts we transformed them and let them sit over night.  Unfortunately the parts that we transformed did not work after the plasmid prep.  We had low values for the concentration and realized that the cultures that did grow in the LB and amp solution was not E coli.  In order to confirm our suspicions we looked at the culture under a light microscope.  My cultures seemed to have string like cells which we concluded to be contamination.  Only 1 culture worked out of the 18 that were performed that week.  Finally we met together to figure out how we wanted to split up the work and what exactly we wanted to do as a team.  Margeaux and Alberto did mini prepreps, restriction digest, gel extraction, ligations, and finally transformations for GFP and terminators. The rest of us redid all the old procedures in search for the reason for the contamination.
6/12/2011-6/17/2011
In order to decrease contamination we autoclaved the pipet tips and used aseptic techniques where applicable. We redid the plasmid preps for the same parts.  This time we grew the Ecoli in just LB solution and then in LB with Amp.  The next morning we discovered that the cells in the LB and Amp solutions did not grow while the cells in the LB solution did.  This proved our suspicion that the plates were our problem.  On Monday we prepped the UV inducible promoter for the QiaCube. The UV promoter was the only transformation and plasmid prep that worked. We did the transformation on the existing Amp plates but this time we used a negative control.  After incubating the transformed cells we discovered that the negative control did in fact grow colonies.  This lead us to making new Amp plates and redoing transformations and plasmid preps for the chosen parts.  For our transformations we had two of our Anderson Constitutive promoters grow red colonies.  When we did plasmid preps however they did grow in the LB and AMP solution.  These parts had concentrations values ranging from 9.6 to 56.6 ng/microliter. In the meanwhile, Alberto and Margeaux cut and ligated more GFP and terminator B0015.

Integrated into the project
After the conference, we received some feedback from the audience. Based on their suggestions, we made some changes to our project. For example, we decided to change the UI design to improve the user experience. And we wanted to  build a community like GitHub, in which synthetic biology researchers can exchange their thoughts, share their experiences, and avoid the mistakes if some researcher has done the experiment before.
Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
Motivation
We attended the International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference, held by National Chung Hsing University from July 30th to August 3rd, 2018. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 5 members of our team were sent to Taiwan. We hoped to review our work in a more objective way and learn about projects of other teams.
Integrated into the project
We have learned from other teams that the steps we provided are not enough for them to finish most of the reports. So we designed that users can create new steps and processes. And users can insert texts, pictures, lists, and tables freely in the result section."

What is your opinion of the field of synthetic biology?
""I don’t have as much of a concern as some other people seem to have. I imagine with people it can be very helpful, with medicine and a lot of bad diseases. I guess it could be used in strange ways too, you know, maybe you can make me into the next Olympian!""
Ithaca, NY | Applefest
Scientists have recently genetically modified apples so that they can no longer brown, potentially cutting the price of selling sliced apples by 40 percent. What is your opinion on that, or towards genetically modified foods in general?
""I think on a semantic level, GMOs aren't any different from artificial selection. At a basic level, ""genetically modified organisms"" could apply to any organism selected for some trait. Traits often come about from mutations and I personally don't see any difference from waiting for nature to mess with DNA and us messing with DNA. I'm sure that there are scientific ways to show that there are issues that come from tinkering around with organisms, but I am also sure that there's evidence to show that it doesn't matter otherwise.""
uOttawa iGEM | Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
How would you define synthetic biology?
""Synthetic biology is the discipline that is going to change the world as we know it. Never before have we been able to design such complex biological machines; this one discipline alone opens to us the possibilities of producing green biofuels, targeting diseases in unprecedented ways, and making other planets habitable - simultaneously. SynBio is one of the most rapidly expanding fields in the world of science, and it's exciting to wonder where we'll be able to take all of this in the upcoming years.""

""I wouldn’t buy them. But I actually do because it’s everywhere. Lately I have been trying to buy organic foods because this all seemed to come out of nowhere—it was just last year that I noticed it. So now you can find a lot more products that are non GMO.""

Ethical problems are based on our representation of life and new biotechnologies, hence exchanging with people became obvious to advance toward a generally accepted solution, especially with a non-scientific public. These issues were discussed at the French iGEM Meetup and during some public events.
If you are interested in learning more about one of the three following events, just click on the name of the event!
French Meetup
Our team co-hosted the French Meetup along with Bettencourt and Evry, from 2 August 2014 to 3 August 2014. There were 5 teams in total: Bettencourt, Bordeaux, Evry, Lyon, Saclay. We learned a lot about the different projects and exchanged ideas, notably about ethics during our workshop.
Curiositas
Curiositas , held at Orsay, is art-and-science festival that took place on October 4th to 9th. During a dynamic and constructive debate about bioart and bioethics, our teams talked with Marion Laval-Jeantet, artist and promoter of the festival, the Parisian iGEM teams (Paris Bettencourt and Evry teams) and the audience.

Week 14 (October, 24-28)
It seems that protocol integration in S. pombe genome didn't work, because there is no growing colonies in the selection replicated plates.
Digestion with  AscI didn't work very well, so I tried a new one.
Anyway, there is no time to finish the experiments. Time is running out. Maybe next time.

But frist of all, how to make the protein import into its own station and work smoothly?  Fortunately, we find some leading peptides to be our “guides”. As we know, different locations need different “guides”. This summer, we have constructed 6 leading peptides successfully in the yeast. In other words, we have 6 another possibility to take advantages of the micro environments.We chose those 8 membrane from a list of about ten candidates based on the following factor:1.It can be easily targeted in yeast.2.Less reaction over it is not allowed.3.Visible distinction from others.So far，we have found the following leading peptides.
1.Erv25p
We characterized a novel protein termed Erv25p that have benn discovered on ER-derived transport vesicles, and it is required for efficient ER to golgi transport. Erv25p is a single membrane spanning segment derived from yeast, and a 12-amino acid N-terminal sequence exposed to the cytoplasm.
Figure 3丨Direct targeting of proteins to ER丨The gene Erv25p( BBa_K1462940 ) was obtained from S. Cerevisiae genome by PCR technique.BFP was fused to its C-terminus as reporter.The biobrick is constructed as follow to verify this leading peptide.
2.CTS1-1A N-terminal 12-amino acid serve as a typical cleavable signal sequence. The targeting sequence derived from yeast can be located at cytoderm.

The PCR Lisa and I did Friday only worked for the pBAD promoter, not for the pBADAntO or pBADAntT. So today I redid the PCR using each primer set on both pSLD20 and 22 just in case Sebastien messed up the labeling of the plasmids. I also restreaked the pSLD 20 and 22 on plates with CAM and KAN to verify whether Sebastien did indeed mess up labeling. Patrick will run the products on a gel, and place the photo on our desk today. If the PCR is still not working we should talk to sebastien about alternative ways of amplifying the products.
I also transformed the ligations Lisa and I made Friday, and hopefully you should see colonies tomorrow. If there are colonies you should restreak them on new plates tomorrow, so that we get more clean colonies.
The terminator group is still working on amplifying the GFP as the GFP without RBS didn't work. Apparently the plasmid is gone, or they can't find it, so they are redoing one of the PCRs using the PCR product with the RBS as a template.
I made a new box in the freezer for our group, so that we now have a box with verified PCR products and minipreps, and one box with stuff that are not necessarily going to be saved (working box).
One thing you could also do tomorrow is to have a look at that excel sheet called ""Parts and plasmid list-repressor group"". We need to past in plasmids that we have purified and constructed.

Gel of the purification of G1, G2, GR1 and GR2 looked good, we did ligations of these parts with the plasmid pSB1C3 - these ligations should be transformed monday (20-09-2010).
Plasmid purification of overnight cultures with plasmids pSLD20 and pSLD22 also looked good, so we did a PCR to obtain the pieces pBAD, BADZ1 and BADZ2. These PCR products should be checked on gel monday - finally we made glycerol stocks of the overnight cultures (pSLD20 and pSLD22).

Worldwide obesity has nearly doubled since 1980, while in 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight.               In particular, many low- and middle-income countries face “double burden” of under-nutrition and obesity. Rates of malnutrition is much higher in low income countries, while there is a greater exposure to high-sugar, high-fat, high-salt foods which are low in cost and nutrients. Such dietary patterns result in low levels of physical strength and sharp increase in childhood obesity with under-nutrition existing side-by-side.
2. In obesity, fatty acids delivered to liver may outpace fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes, resulting in triglyceride accumulation. Obesity leads to health hazards, including cardiovascular disease - mainly heart disease and stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints, and cancers, such as endometrial, breast and colon cancers.   Combined: http://www.healthcentral.com/common/images/1/19473_13187_5.jpg Cardiovascular: Obesity and other health conditions associated with obesity, including hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, are risk factors of cardiovascular disease.  http://www.beltina.org/health-dictionary/obesity-cardiovascular-disease-bmi-table.html Diabetes: Patients with type 2 diabetes are insulin resistant, in which high levels of blood fats, cholesterol and triglyceride levels inhibit cells from absorbing blood sugar needed.  http://www.bubblews.com/news/560642-cause-of-type-2-diabetes Musculoskeletal disorders: Those with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 26.4 had rate of osteoarthritis of the knees 6 times greater than those with a body mass index of less than 23.4. (Ref. J. Rheumatol. 20 (2) 331-5) http://pharmaworlds.com/obesity-a-growing-burden-for-physicians-and-patients/
The fundamental cause of obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and expended. To increase expenditure of fatty acids (calories), HKUST 2013 Team aims to introduce glyoxylate shunt as an artificial futile cycle in HepG2 cell.

So far, it seems that Arendt's lectures on Kant's political philosophy in fact agree with the need to publicize and popularize the findings and workings of synthetic biology in order to enable the public to judge these developments and also to close the gap between the knowledge of the scientist and the knowledge of the public. It changes the role of the public from a nuisance that obstructs the progress of science to a useful check that if informed properly can function as a distanced observer monitoring the ethical and social relevance of scientific research. Moreover, the standard of progress and the gains for future generations by which recent developments ought to be judged seems to provide a standard that scientists working in the field of synthetic biology can agree with. At the same time the judgment of the public is not informed by dogma's or higher authorities such as the government or the church. However, we did not yet discuss the importance that Arendt attributes to the common sense in order to reach a judgment. As will become clear this notion of common sense introduces some questions as to how the public can adopt the concepts and ideas within synthetic biology.
Common Sense?
Arendt argues that judgments are matters of taste and of opinion, in contrast to matters of reason and ethics. This means that one judges something according to how it affects one's taste. Normally one would argue that one cannot discuss about taste. As Arendt says “[n]o argument can persuade me to like oysters if I do not like them” (Arendt, 66). But what value do judgments on the ethical worth of developments in synthetic biology have when they are purely subjective and cannot be shared and discussed with others? Arendt answers that there are in fact two factors that make judgments inheritable communicable (Arendt, 66). The first one is called the imagination and is the ability to make something present even though it is absent. This means that one can judge certain developments in a laboratory even though one is not present (given that one is acquainted with the ideas and concepts that are needed to grasp these developments). This ability to judge whilst not being involved in the process has been discussed above. The second factor is common sense, which relates to the ability to take other perspectives into account. Arendt writes that a judgment is only possible if we are a member of a community. There is no reason for"

CRISPR Interference Model
Motivation
We decided to create a model of the CRISPR system for two main reasons:
Identifying the parts of the network that could be targeted by our lab team to improve repression efficiency
To approximate time-series mecA repression data for use in modelling the overall vulnerability of a S. aureus population
Model Construction
After a literature review we were able to construct the CRISPR interference system network. The targeted single guide RNA (sgRNA) associates with nuclease-deficient Cas9 protein (dCas9) to form a complex that binds with the DNA complementary to the sgRNA target
. The bound complex prevents transcription elongation by RNA polymerase, repressing YFP mRNA expression
. The chemical network is shown below:
IMG: reaction netowrk
Using standard mass-action kinetics, the network simplifies into the following set of differential equations:
Differential System Here
The choice of a largely first-order model is supported by findings of several recent studies
. To simplify the model further, we made a quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) about the formation of  of the dCas9-sgRNA complex b. That is, we assume that dCas9 and sgRNA associate on a faster timescale than the other reactions (i.e. transcription, translation and the binding of the complex to the DNA). Therefore, we disregard the kinetics of the complex formation reaction and assume that it is always at steady-state relative to the other time-dependent species concentrations.  Under the QSSA, the concentration of the complex is given by:  see latex 4 equation  This is the same assumption made by previous teams
. Our model then simplifies to:  see latex 4 equation
Modeling Incomplete Repression
A recent study by Bikard et al
. found that maximal repression (on the order of 100 fold) was achieved when the promoter was targeted. However, targeting the promoter is not viable in this project since an essential promoter from elsewhere in the genome has been harnessed to produce the fluorescent promoter. Instead, we model the incomplete repression (ranging from 6-fold to 35-fold) observed when the off-promoter regions, specifically on the non-coding strand, are targeted.
There are two possible approaches for modelling the incomplete repression,"
Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Pre study_-_-_TEXT.html," the implication of non-genetic factors in vitiligo etiopathogenesis is supported by morphological and functional evidence that vitiligo is a disease of the entire epidermis with biochemical abnormalities within keratinocytes that influence the ability of melanocytes to counteract the reactive oxygen species (ROS); the morphological alterations of keratinocytes in the skin were believed to alter subsequently the production of the specific melanocyte growth factors and cytokines that coordinate melanocyte activity.17 The in- creased levels of hydrogen peroxide found in affected epidermis are supposed to lead to membrane damage.17 Moreover, oxidative stress may lead to hypopigmentation by me- chanisms that include a microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent downregulation of melanogenic enzymes; this is in good agreement with the deficiency of MITF-M described in vitiliginous skin.31 In addition, cultured keratinocytes and melano- cytes from depigmented vitiligo epidermis have been shown to have a reduced enzymatic antioxidant capacity,17,32,33 thus making the melanocytes abnormally susceptible to im- munologic cytotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by ROS.27  A growing consensus supports the hypothesis that genetic factors and environmental triggers lead eventually to autoimmune melanocyte destruction.2,14 The altered environment of vitiligo skin, apparently rich in ROS17,34 and having an imbalanced cytokine network, may also contribute to additional melanocyte cytotoxicity and further enhance the pigment loss.“ - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo
“Furthermore, vitamin D and its chemically engineered analogs are supposed of being involved in the control of multiple intracellular pathways responsible for the melanin synthesis and melanocyte survival and in the suppression of the immune response. All these findings encouraged clinicians to further investigate the effects of treatment with vitamin D compounds in vitiligo patients, thus opening new perspectives in the therapy of depigmentation.” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, pp. 18-19
Nina: This seems to be a good vitamin to take into vitiligo skin, however if would be great if we could find any article about vitamin d production in bacteria such as e.coli or lactobacillus.

USTC-Software,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," data for all sets of input states. The thick line is for the [111] set of inducers.
Our results
Based on the logical relationship between the output and inputs, we summarize it into a truth table and BioBLESS will design a gene circuit. Stochastic simulation with different parameters, namely the combination of 0/1 of inputs, will be carried out to give predicted performance of different input states. The peak value of concentration-time figures based on different input states will be arrayed in an ascending order coincidently similar to the order shown in Fig. 0(b). When all three inputs are present, the output of the designed gene circuit rises all above other situations. Sets with aTc present but not all present shares similar outputs. These outputs are evidently higher than those sets without aTc whose outputs stay in low levels.
Further analysis
There is no clock that synchronizes the progression of the signal between gates. There are delays at each layer which can lead to transient errors in the output, known as faults. A fault may occur when a signal is divided and  one branch skips a layer (for example, in Fig. 0(a) the pTet input signal skips the first layer). Because the on signal reaches the next layer faster than the other, the gate at the second layer will transiently respond to the wrong state of input signals. One characteristic of the designed three-input AND gate is that the existence of aTc can evidently increase the output. A comparison between set [110] and [001] will shed light on this point. The transmission of aTc signal doesn't have as much layers as IPTG or Ara. Our software presets same parameters for same gates and biologists can employ their experience to fine tune parameters to fit in different situations. The result shows the transient errors.
Especially when we switch the state [111] to [000], a well-behaving gene circuit should ensure that the output will switch off quickly. Thus one protocol of parameter selection is that the decay rate of protein or small RNA, especially those functioning as a medium, should be higher than corresponding transcription and translation rates.
PART 3
In this part, we will design a more complicated logic circuits and show that our simulation fits the original truth table well.

Our BioBrick BBa_K1585321 for polycistronic expression of glycogen synthesis genes is a composite part that combines all 3 glycogen formation enzymes. The ADP-glucose pyrophophorylase (GlgC) forms ADP-glucose from ATP and glucose-1-phosphate, the glycogen synthase (GlgA) elongates α-1,4-linked chains and the branching enzyme (GlgB) catalyzes the formation of α-1,6-linked branches. This construct is an extension and improvement of the Part BBa_K118016
In order to upregulate the whole glycogen synthesis pathway, the polycistronic plasmid was built. The glgC coding sequence is based on the part BBa_K118016 from Team Edinburgh 2008, but the RBS B0034 was added to the existing Biobrick. The construct was confirmed by sequencing. The expression of all three enzymes GlgC, GlgA and GlgB was tested in BL21 Gold (DE3) strains containing BBa_K1585321 in a pSB1A30 expression vector.
SDS-PAGE of glgCAB in pSB1A30
glgCAB in pSB1A30 was expressed in BL21 Gold (DE3) strains and IPTG induced. The small arrows indicates the expected bands for all three enzymes . The BL21 Gold (DE3) wild type was used as the negative control.
The combined functionality was characterized by iodine staining (see picture below). It was performed with Lugol's iodine which dyes glycogen in a brownish color. If more glycogen is"

BUDS contains a serious of academic practices for participants, including the poster session, oral lecture and visiting Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University. During this symposium, we presented a poster about our project and received a lot of feedback about experimental design and workflow. Our poster was chosen as the best poster in this symposium.
Communication with Beijing Genomics Institute(BGI)
Shenzhen China, 8.7.2017
We visited BCI, which is one of the best institutes of synthetic biology in China, and communicate with their director and researchers. Though this activity, we learned more about the development of synthetic biology in China and received some valuable suggestion for our project.
Conference of China iGEMer Committee
Fuzhou, China, 8.23-24.2017
During CCiC, we communicated with other teams about the experimental design, experience and future direction of iGEM in China. We also took part in poster session to introduce our project to other teams and learned projects of other teams. We received “certificated participant” award.
Communication with other teams
With SZU-China
Team members from SZU-China told us something about bio-microcapsule, which is quite inspiring for our product design.
With XMU-China
XMU-China proposed that microfluidics might be a useful technique for AFT detection.
Survey on citizens
To know what the potential customers want and what they can do, we designed a questionnaire and spread it in neighborhoods in Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Guangdong and so on.
Considering that glucometer is the final procedure of our biosensor, we surveyed how many citizens own glucometer. As it turned out, 28.7% of surveyed citizens have a glucometer. Though not that much, it indicates that"

He also provided insight on optimizing our hardware for Ugandan farmers. He suggested that we use solar power for our hardware since its use is rapidly growing and would make it cheaper. In addition, he mentioned that he would not want to check his field very frequently. However, it is worth noting that farmers in the area tend to their crops every day to ensure the quick detection of pests. If the testing strips were made easy to gather, collecting them would not be too much of an extra burden during their usual activities.
Tree Life
We were also able to speak with James, the executive

director of Tree Life, to learn more about their work and facilities. Tree Life is a Christian community development organization located just outside of Iganga. They train farmers, educate pastors, conduct skill classes for women, and help improve local education. They place a large emphasis on their education platform, teaching farmers and children how to seed and maintain crops effectively. Along with discussing Tree Life with James, we were able to visit students at a local school supported by Tree Life, speak with a women's empowerment group, and tour their demonstration farm.
Tree Life’s main farming focus is centered around education and community organization. James raised concerns about the general lack education as it results to the use of fungicides and other chemical applications, showing a chemical rash/burn on his own hand as proof of the dangers they pose.
James showing rash on his hand
He stated that farmers rarely get advice on what to apply, sometimes applying the wrong thing or applying a solution too potent for the area of their plot. The burn/rash on his hand was from mixing pesticides and is far from unique from other farmers in the area.
Tree Life’s education initiative encourages farmers to adopt safer farming and application practices. They are trying to develop training to allow farmers to apply fungicides effectively and develop their own irrigation systems to combat climate change. They encourage farmers who can afford for regular fungicide application to spray every ten days, even though James admitted that he has seen some diseases take whole crops in a matter of a few days or even just twenty hours.
James mentioned that our device could greatly improve fungal detection times since farmers rely on visible cues to diagnose a fungal infection. For instance, many times they wait for the leaves to curl together, for spots to form, or for ants to climb the plants.
Tree Life works to improve community organization among farmers to allow them to better information and resources. James has found that farmers are more successful when they don’t have to worry about accessing expensive"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," organism.
Let’s begin with the importance of this risk. Mycobacterium avium is sometimes responsible for serious infections in humans. But, as noted by Willy Rozenbaum, ""it is a bacterium that is ubiquitous, it is found in tap water, we are almost all contaminated"" but this contamination has rarely consequential effects. The cases reported involved immunodepressed patients, for example. We also planned to analyze the effects of infection on tumors. Anyway, Willy Rozenbaum believes that ""all that is not very annoying”. In addition to numerous tests and simulations that have to be conducted before the use of our treatment, this statement is justified by the fact that bacteria are lysed when there is a release of the phage, it does not persist in the body.
Francois Le Fevre has legitimately questioned about the possibility that the phage infect other bacteria already present in the organism. We have therefore explained to him that our cell vector encapsidate only the therapeutic plasmid, not its genome. If it infects bacteria of the commensal flora of the organism (which may be limited by changes in protein internalization), the bacteria will receive just the therapeutic plasmid, and the phage will not be able to multiply We can also worry about the drifts, and abuses of the transgene integration, as the risk of homologous recombination or risky integration. Lluis M. Mir supported us about this idea, that our phage is a prokaryote, but cells of human body are eukaryotes. It can therefore be no risk of homologous recombination or integration between its genome and our cells genome, as they do not belong to the same ""world"": ""there is no possible integration. That's the real advantage of being at the crossroads between eukaryotic and prokaryotic.
Furthermore, Willy Rozenbaum reminded ""this type of subject is very well controlled today in terms of security"": the product would obviously not be marketed until being subjected to numerous tests to check its innocuousness. Organizations as Afssaps, in France manage the safety of  health products. If we consider that the risk is not negligible, we must ask whether it is worthwhile to be taken into account. Thierry Magnin gave a translation of the principle of responsibility made by Hans Jonas: ""Before trying to estimate the risk, I'll try to work up on the most serious risk."" Does the targeted disease justify it? According to Bernard Baertschi, ""Cancer is an extremely serious disease, for which we accept to take risks"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html,"D1). The results showed that CFPS reactions using extract from the same batch that was used to build the model (B1) did indeed increase the CFPS activity of that extract, and the activity was within the confidence intervals (CIs) predicted by the model (Figure 7a). For systems using a separate batch of extract (D1), the new supplement solution caused a decrease in activity (Figure 7b). This backs up previous research which suggests that each batch of cell free extract requires its own optimal conditions for high protein synthesis activity. It also shows that a multifactorial Design of Experiments approach can easily determine important factors in CFPS systems, and accurately predict optimal supplement amounts.
Figure 7: CFPS activity for two CFPS systems utilising two different cell extract batches prepared identically. A) Results for a system utilising the same extract batch used to test the SRD. B) Results for a system utilising a new batch of cell extract. The blue lines show systems using the normal CFPS supplement premix, and the purple lines show the systems with supplement premix with ‘optimised’ magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate as identified above. The system utilising extract from the same batch used in the SRD testing had a higher CFPS activity with the ‘optimised’ premix (purple) than with the original premix (blue), whereas the system utilising extract from a separate batch had higher activity with the original premix.
Screening Design for CFPS Supplements
Following the success of using a DoE approach to optimise CFPS systems focusing only on salt supplements, the JMP software was used to create a screening design for all 15 components of the CFPS supplement solution. The 15 components were made into 13 factors for the design, with UTP, CTP, and GTP being combined. The experiments determined by the design are shown in Table 3 The experimental design was performed on two different extracts; one with a moderate CFPS activity (D2), and one with a low CFPS activity (B2). For this set of reactions, cell extract was added such that 1.5 mg (30 mg/mL) of total cell extract protein was present in each CFPS reaction. This was done so that the factors predicted as being important could be compared between cell batches, without any small differences in total protein concentration potentially affecting the results. Figure 8 shows the contrast values (used here as an estimate of a factor’s effect on the response) for each supplement in CFPS systems using the moderately active cell free"

Our chassis
The chassis we used are E.coli DH5-alpha and E.coli BL 21 Rosetta. E.coli DH5-alpha is in the safest part in DSMZ and so do BL 21 Rosetta. They have no disease risk to human or environment. Competent DH5α cells are purchased from TransGen company. We ordered the part DNA from Genscript. As for BL 21 Rosetta, competent E.coli BL21 Rosetta cells are purchased from TransGen company. And we order the part DNA from Genscript, and we use E.coli BL21 Rosetta to express our ion channel. E.coli BL21 Rosetta strain is a derivative of E. coli BL21. And from our hyperlinks we can see that the risk group for E. coli BL21 is 1，so that it is in biosafety risk group 1.
Parts
Our parts are all taken from the RISK LEVEL 1 organisms. The RISK LEVEL 1 organisms are safe to healthy adults. The protein expressed by our parts is not toxic and do no harm to the organism.
Expected protection mechanism
In order to prevent the bacteria we use from escaping from our laboratory, we strictly followed the disinfection process before and after the experiment, and we sterilized any experimental tools and wastes that may have been contaminated with GM bacteria in our experiments.
Safety practice
Before our project start, we summarized common mistakes students usually made and trained new members in order to avoid these mistakes.

When designing the whole CO2 utilization system, we met some                                             problem during cost evaluation and carbon footprint. We were lucky to find                                             our friend, UESTC-China, to work together and end up building a completely                                             eco-friendly system with negative carbon footprint.
We were delighted when we found out someone who will be                                             able to resolve our problems. UESTC-China, an iGEM team that focused on                                             degrading straw into useful raw materials, which are glucose, xylose,                                             ferule acid, and lignin. In addition, they aimed to convert glucose into                                             butanol and hydrogen. As xylose is the main carbon source for our                                             engineered E. coli, we came up with a collaboration idea by                                             integrating our system at the downstream of their system. Xylose is one of                                             the side product produced during straw degradation, it can be extracted and                                             utilized in our system. Concerning the synthesis of xylose may produce                                             greenhouse gas and chemicals, we would like to obtain xylose produced via                                             biological method.
Straw was a biowaste in agriculture while it wasn't easy                                             to decompose. UESTC-China solved this problem with                                             synthetic biology successfully. Through our collaboration, they can not only produce                                             bioenergy, but have another powerful application in CO2 emission                                             problem. NCKU-Tainan provided them a valuable application way and helped                                             them design a draft of device. The xylose's source from straw was really                                             important to E. coli CO2 utilization system which changed                                             the positive carbon footprint into negative carbon footprint. This                                             collaboration solved both the energy problem and environment problem.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 1_-_-_TEXT.html," built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009

Participants
Economically disadvantaged girls attending high school in an underserved part of Houston come to Rice University each summer to participate in a series of STEM immersion            experiences. Additionally, the program organizes college preparatory activities and exposes students to career paths in STEM. The bioethics debate organized by Rice iGEM           was incorporated into these activities. This year, all of the participants in the debate were 12th graders from Cesar Chavez High School.
Selected Readings
The participants were provided with an “evidence packet” which included excerpts from various readings, including:
Gregory N. Mandel, Gary E. Marchant “The Living Regulatory Challenges of Synthetic Biology”. Iowa Law Review.
Civil Society Working Group on Gene Drives. “The Case for a Global Moratorium on Genetically-engineered Gene Drives.”
Jonathan B. Tucker, Raymond A. Zilinskas. “The Promise and Perils of Synthetic Biology”. The New Atlantis. 2006. Pp32-3.
Carter, Sarah R., et al. Synthetic biology and the US biotechnology regulatory system: challenges and options. No. DOE-JCVI--SC0004872. J. Craig Venter Institute, Rockville, MD (United States), 2014.
Berlinger, Nancy, and Mary Crowley. ""Birth to death and bench to clinic: The Hastings Center bioethics briefing book for journalists, policymakers, and campaigns."" Chapter 35, Synthetic Biology. The Hastings Center New York, 2008. 163-167.
Zhang, J., Claire Marris, and Nikolas Rose. ""The Transnational Governance of Synthetic Biology: Scientific uncertainty, cross-borderness and the’art’of governance."" (2011).
Significance
The debate participants presented well-reasoned arguments in support of and in opposition to existing synthetic biology regulation measures. Exposing these high schoolers to new, complex ideas sparked curiosity and interest among the participants. This excitement is essential to support our next generation of college undergraduates and researchers. Even if they decide not to pursue a STEM career, exposure to these controversial synthetic biology topics will prepare them to participate in in well-reasoned public discourse.
Participant Feedback
The girls each filled out a survey at the end of the activity.
100% of the participants indicated that they “have a better understanding of synthetic biology after participating in the event”.
Over 70% of the participants indicated that “the event inspired/encouraged [them] to learn more about synthetic biology”."

-Diluted the RNA scaffold in IDTE buffer to make a final concentration of 50ng/uL. Transformed the scaffold into DH5a cells and plated on an ampicillin plate.
8/22/12
-Inoculated four tubes of 5mL LB with DH5a RNA Scaffold cells. Miniprepped the four tubes and received low concentrations so inoculated a 500mL flask with 20mL of LB.
8/23/12
-Miniprepped 10mL of the flask inoculated last night and received very low concentrations. Miniprepped the remainder of the inoculation using N3 buffer instead of P3 buffer and received 650ng/uL.
8/24/12
-Digested 6.5ug of the miniprepped RNA scaffold with PstI for 7 hours. Ran a gel of the digest to gel purify and received a large smear in a range of unexpected lengths. Ran a gel to confirm plasmid integrity and showed expected structure therefore digestion will be ran for less due to star activity. Inoculated 50mL of LB with DH5a RNA scaffold transformed cells.
8/25/12
-Miniprepped 10mL of the 50mL inoculated flask and received 72ng/uL. Miniprepped in RAL and received a similar concentration of 82ng/uL. The concentrations are too low to get 6ug of DNA so made a 20mL inoculation of the RNA scaffold cells for tomorrow.

I am very glad to join the game of IGEM in last few months. I gain lots of fun in the process of the game and I made many new friends from the game. We were always work together in the lab from morning to night. Even very tired but we find pleasure in it. Because of game we need a lot of knowledge of molecular biology, so we spent so much time to search the knowledge of molecular and learn how to design a experiment. At last we let our knowledge bank abundantly. In the game, I am in charge of the part of promoter, we need to gain the P43 promoter from bacillus subtilis and guide into escherichia coli. In the process we faced many times of failure, but through our attempted we found way to solve the problem at last.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

After obtaining and isolating the open/closed regulated pIV porins, we would have to test the secretion of a selection of easily detectable proteins present in the periplasm but not able to go through the second membrane of E. coli. If those proteins can be detected in the extracellular environment only in the presence of such a mutant in the right ion conditions than we achieved our goal. A new verified biobrick could be proposed as a universal aspecific regulable secretion tool.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," more floods, tsunamis, tornado, etc. and this could lead to the extinction of human race. [9]
Luckily, we have taken several measures to make sure that the cells cannot overgrow the environment, as stated above. We engineered E.D. Frosti to induce cell death slowly when encountering cold temperatures. Even when the cells are dead the proteins remain attached to the cell membrane and carry on their function during an acceptable amount of time. After some time, the proteins will degrade and the effect of our engineered bacteria will stop. This safety mechanism ensures that the apocalyptic scenarios above won’t happen. After the first stimulus of arabinose or lactose (transcription and translation of the ice nucleating protein or the anti-freeze protein), the DNase activity is induced when the cells encounter low temperatures. The DNase activity degrades the DNA and the cell dies. Thus, as mentioned before, the cells only function as a physical carrier for the proteins and most of the cells will die when exposed to a cold environment.
Deep ocean water has average temperatures between 0-3°C. [10] At these temperatures ice nuclear proteins are able to crystalize water. [11] However E. coli is unable to survive or multiply at low temperature and moreover the cell death mechanism of our E.D. Frosti will be induced. The same goes for E.D. Frosti expressing the anti-freeze protein that could reach the cold arctic. With this information we conclude that the probability of both the ""everlasting ice age"" and the “final meltdown” scenario, happening are small. The amount of bacteria needed for either scenario are that huge that the only way this could happen is if it were to be done on purpose. This is a biosecurity problem.
4. Safety and the public
Apocalyptic scenario 3: Freezing from the inside out.
During the winter, after a heavy snow storm, salt is scattered to clear the roads. This salt induces corrosion of car parts and when it floods into the surrounding natural environment, the change in salinity of the soils can greatly impact the local fauna and flora. Instead of using salt, our bacteria E.D.Frosti could be used.  This is environmentally friendlier than salt. A disadvantage however is that bacteria with their proteins remain in the environment for some period of time and could contaminate the water. If we ingest the bacteria and the ice nucleating protein is still active, ice crystallization in our body could cause organ damage.
If we assume the E.D. Frosti spreads throughout someone’s body and if that person drinks a lot of"

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"1; in this way Probe 1, having on the contrary exactly the same sequence as the gRNA, should have never been targeted by this new gRNA.
As from the template gRNA above (5'-[scaffold]-[reverse complement of miRNA]-3'), the spacer was therefore modified to bind (with perfect match) to the large loop of the amplicon of probe 1.
Two different designs were tested, one  - referred to elsewhere as ""S_1"" - binding to the whole large loop and to the first 4 bases after the large loop (for a total of a 20 bases-long spacer), and one - ""L_1"" elsewhere - binding only to the large loop (16 bases-long spacer).  The complete sequences are the following ones:
5'-(UAAUUUCUACUAAGUGUAGAU)UAAAGGGAGUCGGCGGAACU-3' [gRNA sequence - S_1]
5'-(UAAUUUCUACUAAGUGUAGAU)UAAAGGGAGUCGGCGG-3' [gRNA sequence - L_1]
The comparison between the mode of action of the previous, original gRNA and the ""new"" ones is better explained in Figure 12:

Our detection scheme
We envision a  follow-up based on repeated liquid biopsies in order to track the sequences that have been identified using our bioinformatic software, amplified by either PCR, isothermal amplification or RCA, and finally detected directly in the plasma using our Cas12a based system.
Figure 13. Representation of our detection scheme: from a single drop of blood we collect the plasma in which reside our biomarkers, ctDNA and miRNAs. Depending on the follow-up assay (vaccine monitoring or relapse detection), we will amplify specific target sequences that we will detect afterwards using our Cas12a assay.
In the following example, the patient receives our treatment based on a cocktail of neoantigens presented on the surface of the encapsulin. The target population decreases with time, which suggests a response to our immunotherapy-based vaccine for a certain period of time but, due to the emergence of resistance or the survival of another cell population, the patient relapses. Chromosomal rearrangements and miRNAs are then the object of our detection, and would suggest in this particular case a potential relapse. It is then strongly recommended for the patient to"

Safety Procedures
Lab techs wore nitrile gloves to protect themselves, and to prevent contamination of samples. All lab waste was disposed of properly, through decontamination procedures (i.e. autoclave, disinfectant, etc.) or hazardous waste disposal.
We followed the strict rule to not eat and drink in the lab. Food was always left on the shelf in front of the lab to prevent the accidental ingestion of chemicals.
Any team members wearing shorts, or working with dangerous materials, wore lab coats. This protected them against accidental chemical spills.
The lab sub-team leader, Keshava, taught team members how to properly use the equipment. He had participated in iGEM on the 2017 Cadets2Vets team, so he was a great resource to learn about the safety features of lab tools!
Safe Lab Work
The most significant hazard in our project was the use of chemicals containing arsenic.
Pure arsenic is not only toxic to humans, but it can also be highly toxic to aquatic life, with lasting environmental and ecological effects. Sigma Aldrich warns that arsenic may also cause cancer. To work more safely, we used sodium arsenate and sodium arsenite. They are the inorganic derivatives of arsenic and have been shown to be significantly less toxic than pure arsenic.
When using sodium arsenate/sodium arsenite, we engaged in a series of stringent safety practices. Safety glasses were worn to protect eyes. For hand protection, our team wore nitrile gloves equal to, or exceeding the required layer thickness (0.11mm). Contaminated gloves were disposed of with proper glove removal technique (without touching glove's outer surface). To protect the body, our team wore lab coats during all arsenic-related experiments. We considered the use of air-purifying respirators but deemed this precaution unnecessary as we used a biosafety cabinet when working with sodium arsenate/sodium arsenite. Arsenic waste solutions and powders did not enter drains or any location outside the lab."

Guidance
At the beginning we contacted Peshawar iGEM group because we discovered that both projects deal with detection.            When we realized that the Peshawar group is the first team to represent Pakistan in iGEM we decided to share with            them the knowledge that was accumulated from past Technion iGEM teams.  The first step was to open a joint Facebook            group, so each team member from every group would be able to find his colleague on the opposite team.            Later, we had Skype sessions regarding mathematical modeling, Human practices and Cloning.
Mathematical modeling
We modeled Peshawar iGEM group's system using differential equations and logic gates. The aim of the work was           to predict the expression of the reporter protein when the concentration of the inducer is given. צריך לבקש מנופר שתעבור על זה
Human prctices
We shared with Peshawar iGEM group the layout of our educational program.            In addition, we gave the team advices regarding an appeal to the government with a            request to promote the education in the field of Synthetic Biology.
Cloning
Peshawar had issues with the transformation of plasmids into competent cells.            They elaborated on the exact steps they did in the lab and we tried to debug their procedure.
We also shared with team Peshawar our protocol for chemical transformation(3) and the protocol for producing competent cells(4).
After following our instructions the Peshawar team managed to perform a successful transformation.

Please see the Registry Contribution help page for help on documenting a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT come from your team's 2016 range of part numbers.
We began piloting the Protein Cages project during the 2015 season and were largely unsuccessful. This year, we were able to improve upon several previously submitted biobricks, namely BBa_K1763421 , which coded for a mutant of the PC Quad protein cage (insertion of a thrombin cleavage site) that was unable to be expressed and purified. This year, we were able to modify the part and select a new insertion site for the recognition sequence from thrombin protease, thus producing BBa_K2068001 . This part is highly functional and has been extremely well characterized; we were able to express and purify this mutant cage as well as experimentally validate that it fulfills its intended purpose.
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
We have substantial evidence that our project works as we intend it to! We have successfully expressed mutant protein cages that can be cleaved by thrombin protease, and have demonstrated this through Dynamic Light Scattering and SDS-PAGE. To see our Proof of Concept, please visit this page ."

Interpretation of datas
Although some say art is an end in itself, science-art might surely have a variety of goals, for example sensitizing the public to current scientific debates or gifting the public with a different perspective on scientific world. We decided to ask this and other questions to more than two hundred high school and university students and the outcome was very impressive! Many people agreed with the fact science-art mission is to bring the public nearer to science and that such goal is at least sufficiently achieved (88,37% of positive answers). Other goals can be achieved though, as someone suggested, and science is still far from being as known as we think it should be; someone suggested science-art could simply be useful in making people have fun while getting in touch with science, others thought it could instead give a more personal and subjective cut to a field usually seen as absolutely rational and objective.
Many students, 88,78%, stated that they think it is useful to invest resources on science-art, but when it comes to decide which biological processes and techniques should be taken in account, we noticed a change in subject’s opinions; in fact while only 15% of the interviewed declared themselves as absolutely opposed to the usage of any kind of organism in science-art, a quarter declared they would be against science-art made with superior organisms (e.g fishes, plants, mammals etc..); even more interesting is the direct correlation between the number of those who answered negatively to the usage of animals and organisms in science-art and the number of those who wouldn’t take advantage of any organisms neither for scientific purpose (10% of the interviewed wouldn’t use microorganisms, 22% wouldn’t use superior organisms for scientific research).
Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, there is a clear similarity in the percentage of those who think science-art is useless or is failing its goals and of those who wouldn’t support a scientific progress gained through animal usage. This latter query brings us to another central question: have we, thanks to our project, succeeded in getting in touch with the most important public of high school students, or in other words, next generation of potential scientists? We directly asked them what were they thinking of our project and our outreach activities and we got a 92"
