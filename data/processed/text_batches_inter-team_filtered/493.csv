Notebook Summary
Crash Course
At the start of the summer we had a two-week crash course in synthetic biology. Having lectures from a wide range of experts and practicals in the afternoon including electrical engineering, Gibson Assembly and tower construction, we learnt a lot about synthetic biology and engineering. It was also a great way to get to know each other, our supervisors and all the other students that also attended the course.
Brainstorming
After a successful crash course in synthetic biology we spent a couple of days days generating as many ideas as we could, and then whittling them down to a final four - Turing Patterns, Bioluminesence, Quiesence and HIV Diagnosis. After a few more days of research we decided to focus on bioluminescence and quiescence, splitting the project into three parts - luciferase optimisation and luciferin recovery, luciferin synthesis, and turning quiescence into biobricks, and presented our ideas to our supervisors.
UK Meetup
We went to Newcastle to meet other UK iGEM teams and present our ideas to each other. We had good fun with the team building exercises and listened to some useful lectures.
Research
Now we had a more concrete idea of our project we spent several days gathering as much literature on bioluminescence as we could, and consulted with people with prior experience of working with biouminescence. Dr Summers helped us with our plans on quiescence and discussed IP"

William
Freeze stock was made of NCM17 strain.
Vilde
Tested the function of the pfu Turbo enzyme. The enzyme was forgotten at RT for 48h. I therefore tested if it was still functional by running a pcr on genomic DNA with Actin primers. I used the pfuTurbo protocol 600410. Results: No bands. The PCR was repeated with different primers and substrate but still showed no results. We concluded with that the enzyme is not functional anymore.
Izadora
One colony of NCM17 strain was picked up and incubated in a test tube by O/N incubation following the same protocol. The plate was stored at 4°C.
There were no colonies from transformation of 11.07, but for part 17O.
For sample 17O, O/N culture with chloramphenicol (Adgene®, working concentration = 25μl/mL) was prepared as before.
Tuesday
William
O/N culture of bacteria transformed with 17O was miniprepped.
Vilde
Cleanup-day in the lab! We tested all the minipreps we got in the freezer. Used Takara enzyme and general reaction mix. Tested them all on PCR and run a gel afterwords. We found out that all our plasmids contain the gene we expected.
Izadora
The gel electrophoresis was performed in agarose gel (o.7%) with digested and ligated parts.
The fragment-sizes were like as expected just for ladder and LacZ-alpha and -beta Non Stop digested products, but not for pSB1A3 and pSB1C3.
A PCR test was performed in all miniprep that we have so far using TaKaRa® enzyme and following its protocol with VF/VR2 program.
Using the Promega Wizard Plus SV miniprep kit, a miniprep was performed in O/N cultures with part 17O, storing it at -20°C. Frozen stocks of cells were prepared for O/N cultures with 60% Glycerol (1/1) and stored at -80°C.

Reaction (3) described transcription through leakage, i.e. transcription from a repressed promoter. Reaction (4) describes translation. Reactions (5) and (6) describe mRNA and reporter protein degradation respectively.
This system of reactions leads to the following system of ODEs:  $$  \frac{d}{dt} [P_{R}] = \ -k_{on}[P_{R}][DNT] \ + \ k_{off}[P_{A}] \tag{7.1} $$  $$  \frac{d}{dt} [P_{A}] = \ k_{on}[P_{R}][DNT] \ - \ k_{off}[P_{A}] \tag{7.2} $$  $$  \frac{d}{dt} [DNT] = \ -k_{on}[P_{R}][DNT] \ + \ k_{off}[P_{A}] \tag{7.3} $$  $$  \frac{d}{dt} [mRNA] = \ s_{A}[P_{A}] \ + \ s_{R}[P_{R}] \ - \ d_{M}[mRNA] \tag{7.4} $$  $$  \frac{d}{dt} [R] = \ s_{P}[mRNA] \ - \ d_{P}[R] \tag{7.5} $$  A system of ordinary differential equations like this can be solved numerically, with the MATLAB function ode45. The result of this will be a set of curves describing the concentration of each compound in time. However, when choosing parameters with an realistic order of magnitude, the time needed to reach steady state, i.e. when the reporter protein concentration does not change anymore, is so long that the script turns extremely computationally intensive. Because time-dependence is not relevant when imitating the dose-response curves from the Yagur-Kroll paper [1], we decided to discard the ODE method and switch to analytic steady state methods.
The goal of this steady state approach is to find a relation between the concentration of reporter protein ([R]) and the amount of DNT ([DNT]), with as few parameters as possible. To obtain such a relation, we started from equation (7.2), which describes the change in time of the concentration of activated promoters. We used a steady state assumption to simplify this relationship, which means that we assumed that the concentration of active promoters does not change in time, i"

⇒ After two days of assays, the 3a ligation's plating has been screened with a 24-sample colony PCR.
No band corresponds to an expected product. Two days have been spent with the same set of ligation mixtures; this was probably a bad idea. It appears some non-specific products are ligating in instead of the expected bands; it must be noted that the kinetics of 3A construction are very low, and nonspecific products containing cut sites to close the plasmid are far more likely to ligate together then two different ligations.
It is not known if continuing this experiment is necessary. I will return to backbone-based ligations, ligated and transformed with the 3A method or normal.
⇒ Stocks of J04500 plasmid were cut with XbaI and PstI in an attempt to insert Gli-I and Zif-I based OmpA fusions that way. The digest was completed for 7 hours, an unusually large amount of time, to ensure complete digestion. OmpA-GliI and OmpA-ZifI are both leftover PCR stocks from the previous 3A ligations, so this reaction will probably fail. Ligation uses 1µL plasmid/corresponding ratios of insert, in a change from previous ligations which utilize 2 or more. This modification allows DNA stock to be preserved, and can still be transformed using heat shock followed by a 45min-2hr phenotype expression period.

⇒ Plating from the previous night's ligation has colonies, but colonies are very small and seem to be slow growing. Colony PCR was set up for 16 colonies, 8 from each ligation, and 4 from each plate. Transformation efficiency seems to be very low, as the ligation from last night was only run for 1 hour.
∴ Future ligations will be attempted with a 10µL reaction mixture instead of 20µL, as this will use less precious DNA stock while preserving DNA concentration."

Proteins are part of the building blocks of life and fulfill a variety of essential functions. But what could one protein alone achieve? Mostly proteins interact with partners or in complexes to fulfill their function. A general goal of science is to understand all biochemical processes that enable life as we know it. Thus, the understanding of protein interaction partners becomes more and more important.
It is crucial to have methods investigating interactions between different proteins since most proteins do not act alone but in complexes with other proteins. This circumstance is of central interest since it can reveal a lot about the function of a protein and the processes that it is involved in.  Using those methods, one can study interactions of specific proteins but it is also possible to screen for potential interaction partners using a library of genes. The latter one was already used by the iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec in 2016. In their project they established their own method to do interaction assays to screen for proteins with an innate affinity for a specific target          ( Click here to learn more about the Bacterial-Two-Hybrid assay developed by iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec ).           This shows that interaction studies can not only be used in basic research but could also play an important role as an application in synthetic biology.
Protein interaction studies can be done by several methods:
Biochemical Methods
e.g. Co-immunoprecipitation
Biophysical and Theoretical Methods
e.g. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
Genetic Methods
e.g. Two-Hybrid Systems
A lot of these methods still need a lot of time to be carried out. This can be done faster! Therefore we created our third strain: VibriInteract. A strain which can be used for protein interaction studies.
For Two-Hybrid Systems, the chassis organisms Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are used in a Bacterial Two-Hybrid (B2H) and Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) system, respectively. The Y2H assay was a novel genetic system at that time used to detect protein-protein interactions heterologously in yeast               ( Fields & Song, 1989 ). 9 years later, a new system was proposed. Instead of S. cerivisiae, this system uses E. coli as chassis organisms               ( Karimova et al., 1998 ).              That this genetic test is carried out in E. coli greatly facilitates the screening as well as the characterization of the interacting proteins.  Moreover, it accelerated this assay"

TEC-Costa_Rica,2016,Team:TEC-Costa Rica#Project#System#Signal_-_-_TEXT.html," we wanted to have versatile BioBricks, we ordered them without promoter nor RBS; reason why we had to assembly the BioBricks with the corresponding promoter and RBS. Based on the Anderson collection, we selected the J23101 to express constitutively the BioBricks and the LacL regulated promoter R0010 for the one we wanted to induce.
We assembled devices of BioBricks K1903010 (RFP-Intein N DnaB), and K190312 (Intein C DnaB), with the promoters R0010 and J23101 respectively, shown in figure 3. We tried to assemble both of the devices in one construct, BioBrick K1903014, but we didn't validate the construct size as detailed also in figure 3.

Protein analysis
Although we didn't where able to confirm BioBrick K1903014 assembly, we analyzed the proteins expression by an SDS-page. In this gel, there are two strong bands. One near 30kDa and another one near 20kDa. The weight of the RFP with the intein is 27kDa, so it is probably the band close to the 30kDa marker. The weight of the RFP without the intein is 25kDa, but there is no band near this size. The 20kDa band might be the DnaB IntC fragment, with a size of 18kDa.

For further results we need to validated the intein C DnaB's (K190312) protease activity, reason why we need to re-assemble K1903010 and K190312. By analyzing this construct’s function, we would proof the intein release mechanism of our system.

Each RIOT sensor consists of a promoter with RBS, followed by a coding sequence and a terminator.
The promoters with strong RBS (BBa_B0034) consists of:
p70: obtained from team ETH_Zurich. It is their favourite performer in terms of sensitivity to lactate (BBa_K822000).
p62: a wild-type lldPRD operon promoter from E. coli (BBa_K822000)
J23100: a high expression promoter in a high constitutive cassette (BBa_K314100)
We obtained the coding sequence of ALR from the Biobrick plasmid (BBa_K1172901). The coding sequence of sfGFP and the sequence of lambda t0 terminator were received from  team ETH_Zurich.
Each individual components including the promoter, the coding sequence (ALR) and the terminator is isolated and amplified by PCR. After obtaining all the individual components, we ligated them by PCR overlap or 3A Assembly (Fig 1). A second stop codon was added at the end of ALR sequence to enhance the efficiency of the translational termination.

Fig.5: Luminescence Reporterassay of the strain W168 lacA::PxylA-agrCA; sacA::P2/P3-luxABCDE
Using the strategy outlined in design, we tried to induce the AgrC-IIA two-component system, with synthetic AIP-II. The synthetic peptids have been dissolved in 100% DMSO to 1 mM concentration and further diluted in dH20.  The constructs have then been induced with a range of different concentrations of AIP-II at an OD600 of 0.1.  The result is shown in Figure 6. Unfortunatly we were not able to show induction of the system by addition of AIP-II. Several other approaches like the addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail to the growth media, several washing steps, using LB instead of MCSE or inducing with 50 µM AIP-II did not change this observation.
Fig.6: Luminescence Reporterassay of the strain W168 lacA::PxylA-agrCA; sacA::P2/P3-luxABCDE induced with AIP-II
There are several possible reasons why the induction didn't work as expected. One idea is that the extracellular proteases produced by Bacillus subtilis destroy the synthetic AIPs. So we tried adding protease inhibitor cocktails to the growth media and using the protease deficient strain Bacillus subtilis WB700. We successfully transformed the WB700 strain with the reporter construct pBS4S-PxylA-agrCA. However the reporter constructs pBS3C-P2/P3-luxABCDE refused transformation. All in all this set of constructs needs several further protocol optimisations and testing.
S. pneumoniae Sensing
First, we optimized the BioBrick <bbpart>BBa_K316018</bbpart> encoding for the comC promoter [4] by sending our BioBrick <bbpart>BBa_K1351024</bbpart> to the registry. For the previous version, no DNA was available.
The BIG result we obtained in the night of the wiki freeze performing a luminescence assay with different constructs in B. subtilis Pxyl - comDE PQS - lux based on BBa_K1351016 . Three different PQS were tested: PcomC, PcomAB, PmreA. The comDE operon expression was induced with 0 %, 0,02 % and 0,2 % xylose. Adding"

Ligation of pSB1C3 with indC(ccdB) was performed over night in a 10 ul reaction with 4 ul fragments each.
Transformation of ligation mixes were performed with 5 µl each in TOP10. Additionally 5 µl of ligation mix of pRB19 was transformed into OneShot cells.
Colony screenings showed following results:
We prepped pRB15, 17 and 18 and repeated the assembly of pRB16 from scratch. Therefore we used RB13/14 for amplification of svp from an S. verticilllus ATCC15003 liquid culture. Afterwards we reamplified this PCR gel extraction with RB29/30 and performed a restriction digest with BamHI and NheI to ligate the fragment with pSB3K3 (BamHI; SpeI).
Reevaluation of old MP pRB15-18, pRB21
Because we could observe small colonies with darkgray center on cotransformed pRB21 with all PPtases constructs (plates of 2013-08-27), we conducted a colony screen and a retransformation with 1 µl of previous MP of pRB15.2 (Konrad) and pRB16-18 (Ralf) and pRB21 (Ralf). Additionally a cotransformation with this old pRB21 MP with the old pRB15.2 as well with 2.5 µl of newly assembled pRB15 was performed.
The colony screening was performed using the primers VR and KH5 . If the gray colonies carry two plasmids with indigoidine synthetase and activating PPtase separately an amplicon of size ~1.3 kbp. Otherwise if for some reason the PPtase and indigoidine synthetase are still on one plasmid, we could expect an amplicon of 2.1 kbp.

The Ethanol Project
Cyanobacteria have the capability to harvest the energy from the sun and convert it into other forms of energy. The natural way for these organisms is to store it as sugars or other carbohydrates in a way similar to plants. By introducing a casette of genes, we would like to obtain ethanol production with cyanobacteria, in particular Synechocystis sp PCC6803
The idea to produce ethanol with the use of cyanobacteria was originally proposed and already accomplished by Ming-De Deng and John R. Coleman. [1]
The source of carbon for the ethanol production is pyruvate which is also oxidative decarboxylated to be used in the Krebs Cycle. To obtain a higher ethanol yield, it might be sufficient to increase the pyruvate pool . By inhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase the usage of pyruvate for the Krebs cycle is reduced and the accumulating pyruvate could be used for ethanol production instead.
We from the Uppsala iGEM Team decided to try to improve the production of ethanol by interfering with the metabolic pathways of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by an Antisense RNA and a protein-mediated approach. Hence we build a construct that encodes for ethanol production in our host organism.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Integrated practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"! This is based on the thought that if spider silk can be coupled with S. aureus combat proteins... why not others?
Could SMITe be applicable in a clinical setting? With the caveat of passing safety testing and toxicity trials- why not?
Is it acceptable in principle to patients to have a dressing of this nature? If maggots are an acceptable option, we think this is more benign, and possibly preferable if it is successful.
Could it be cost effective? As with any new, novel concept in therapeutics, recouping expenses is a necessity. However, with the added benefits of avoiding protracted inpatient stays for surgical debridement and dressings if it were to be effective, an appropriate but higher price than conventional dressings might turn out to be cost saving. Additionally, any new treatment able to provide an alternative to repeated antibiotics is an important weapon against this global threat and is therefore worth it's weight in gold!
Clinical Feedback:
The comments below were communicated to us following discussion with an endocrinologist-in-training, Dr Muhammad Fahad Arshad. Being on the front line in treating patient with these types of chronic wounds, we were interested to know how realistic he thought SMITe may one day be!

1.1.Solitary confinement with toxic Zeocin
We put our prisoner in  a solitary confinement to see what will happen to this poor man. This will help us understand how powerful the punishment is as well as tell us how much Zeocin we should use to create a temperate environment stress.  As we can see from this figure, the antibiotic leads to a quick death of our prisoner. Without help the prisoner can hardly get out of it fate.
2.2. Solitary confinement with environmental AHL to help neutralize detox Zeocin
Environmental AHL could detox the cell from Zeocin by inducing the production of Zeo-R protein. The relationship between the AHL concentration and cell growth in solitary represents the key measurement of cell-cell collaboration. In order to quantify it, we vary the 3OC12-HSL concentrations , and simulated the final B cell concentrations. Alternatively we vary the 3OC6-HSL concentrations , and simulated the final A cell concentrations. In either case, there is only one cell type to isolate the effects.  These results tell us some critical elements of the system such as whether there exists any sensitivity difference of AHL between the two cells.  It could provide us with better understading of the cooporativity between these two cells. For instance, as shown in the figure below,  there is a steep curve indicating the sensitivity to the AHL concentration at around 12.8. Once AHL goes above 12.8, the growth constrains caused by Zeocin is quickly neutralized.  Such nonlinear response curve provide almost switch-like sensitivity to the density of the other cell type in the mixed population, which should provide very different behavioir with shallow relations such as linear.
3.3.The classic prisoner’s dilemma
Scenario 1: Cooperativity: mutual benefit
If both of our prisoners help the others by producing AHLs, in the end both will grow to high cell density even though they sacrifice them self by expressing tetA and bring in toxic Nickel. This produce the best outcome for both cells.
Scenario 2: One traitor: punish the good guy
If one of our prisoners decides to defect the other guy and still get help from the other,he may be well benefited at first
However, with the cooperator gradually dies off, the amount of AHL it produces decreases. While each cell are still in the spirit of helping the defectors, the dwindling population results in effective defects and cause the fast growth defector to lost Zeo"

ZJU-China,2013,Team:ZJU-China#Project#TheGhostKit#GhostSensor_-_-_TEXT.html," was based on split GFP and the other split β-lactamase. Our inner-membrane scaffolds consisted of three fusion parts. The split proteins were linked to the periplasmic ends of scaffolds and streptavidin to the cytoplasmic ends. We chose phosphatidylglycerol:: prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) as our transmembrane protein because its function has been well identified by 2012 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai iGEM team. ssDsbA is the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent signaling sequence of DsbA. ssDsbA-tagged proteins are exported to the periplasm through the SRP pathway. With ssDsbA fused to the periplasmic terminal, fusion proteins with Lgt are expected to be anchored onto inner membrane of E.coli.
For the first set of membrane scaffolds, two residuals of GFP (BBa_K738006, BBa_K738007) were fused to the periplasmic ends and streptavidin were fused to the cytoplasmic ends. When 19-mer and 25-mer biotin-modified aptamers are added to the solution and thrombin is present, aptamers act like a bridge linking streptavidin-fused membrane scaffolds and thrombin. In this way, two molecules of membrane scaffolds are dragged together and the two residuals of GFP will approach each other in close proximity to become an integrity part capable of giving green fluorescence. With this design, it is believed that we can detect the existence of any protein through fluorescence.
(The upper figure illustrates the construction of the second set of membrane scaffold. We cloned the FA- and FB-scaffold genes into pCDFDuet-1 vector to obtain optimal expression. )
For the second set of membrane scaffolds, we want to see the results with naked eyes instead of fluorescence to expand its application in everyday life. So we fused two residuals of TEM-1 β-lactamase (BBa_K1054010, BBa_K1054011) to the periplasmic ends. Likewise, when 19-mer and 25-mer biotin-modified aptamers are added to the solution and thrombin is present, aptamers act like a bridge linking streptavidin-fused membrane scaffolds and thrombin. In this way, two molecules of membrane scaffolds are pulled together and the two residuals of β-lactamase will meet each other again to become an integrity part with enzym"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," such as “How can a genetically modified microorganism be recognized among natural relatives?”. Some questions we did not expect, for example, here are a number of questions about how the genetic modification was established. We would expect these questions when talking about the ethics of genetically modified microorganisms, and not necessarily when determining the risks of using it.
Another interesting aspect of the application of synthetic biology is responsibility: If our engineered bacterium would be commercialized, who would be responsible for any adverse effects? In our opinion, scientists are responsible for thoroughly and objectively investigating and reporting possible risks. Companies in turn should monitor whether the technology is sufficiently researched. Companies should also make sure that user manuals are correct and clear to understand, even to people with little experience with comparable technology. Users of the product, the beekeepers in our case, are responsible for using the product in the intended way only and following the user manual provided with the product.  Our movie ends with some open questions regarding safe by design, both in general and within our project. Examples are “what should be done to actually realize the insights that are gained by safe by design?” and “should there be more focus on the positive aspects of using a genetically modified microorganism when judging a permission request?”. We don’t know the answer to these questions, but think they are important nevertheless.
Concluding our collaboration with the RIVM, some members of our team, as well as the other dutch iGEM teams attended a meeting organized by the RIVM and the Rathenau institute, with the theme: “Veilig verder met synthetische biologie”, or “Making safe progress in synthetic biology”. During this meeting, researchers, policymakers and policy advisers brainstormed, discussed, and presented their ideas about how synthetic biology should be handled in the future. We gave a short presentation about the topic of our project and how we integrated “safe by design” through toxin specificity, controlled expression of the toxin and confinement of our product to the beehive. During a short information market, we:
Got to talk more in depth with people who were interested.
Presented the movie we made for the RIVM.
Made the ""Resource from the future"" in collaboration with Synenergene.
We learned a lot from the talks about further handling safety in synthetic biology both from a political and a societal point of view. An interesting point that comes to mind was made by a speaker about how feelings of the public concerning synthetic biology can be a useful source of questions on the ethical aspects of our work. She also mentioned how art can be used to connect people to synthetic"

The questionnaire also shows many people lack basic knowledge about hearing loss. Hence, we printed booklets and also set up several public media accounts to make the public focus on things about hearing loss people including news, scientific education, welfare, etc.
In the future, we plan to join these organizations and call for more people to participate. Also, we recommended SUV to collaborate with them and create more chances for SUSTechers to help people with hearing loss.
Also, due to the considerable people who showed their interests to learn sign language during our investigation, we will propagandize sign language teaching on our social media constantly.
Company cooperation
Notably, in the questionnaire, some interviewees suggested that there could be some applications (APPs) on cellphone, functioning to simplify the communication between normal people and hearing-impaired people, and thus make people with hearing loss convenient to contact.
Luckily, the Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Activities (IETA) was held in Shenzhen on Oct. 13-15th. There is a software company fulfilled this proposal. It is worth mentioning that two leader of their team are people suffering from hearing disability. The application, named Deaf Life, can help with real time communication for hearing-impaired people and thus improve living quality of them. It was said on their website that, Deaf Life is not only a way for more people to pay attention to the hearing-impaired group, but also to attract more hearing impaired people to express their own ""voice"", to display their own talent and highlights. It also allows them to live better in our society, to the world, when communication with other groups is no longer an obstacle.” (See more at http://www.deaflife.cn/ ).

Week 4
Wet lab work:
The work on our parts is going super tight for the wet lab team. The terminator of our scaffold construct has been added to the list of our parts ready to be sequenced. We're now going to start assembling parts together. We also started working on the chromoproteins we'll use to test the scaffold, and the first component of our expression vector is ready. A new order for IDT primers and GBlocks was sent during the week for the next steps of our project. Finally, we are currently discussing how to test and characterize our parts to present our results.
Dry lab work:
A lot has been done on the dry lab side too. Our sponsorship package is finally complete and will be sent to potential sponsors within a few days. We also started doing reading on the different aspects of our project to get ready for our final presentation.
Week 5
Wet lab work:
Only one of our parts is not ready for submission , but should will be ready soon. We started putting the scaffold components together this week. With the latest IDT order having arrived, we are now able to prepare our test enzymes as well as our Biobrick expression vector.  As some of us continue getting the constructs ready, the rest of the team is going to train on manipulating Lactococcus lactis and on protein purification. We are currently also discussing what to do with the scaffolds and the best ways to characterize them.
Dry lab work:
Our sponsorship package has finally been sent to companies who can potentially help us develop this project. The common design for our wiki, poster and presentation is starting to be discussed and we're hoping to see its first drafts soon. We are still looking for other iGEM teams who would want to collaborate, possibly testing our two projects together.
Week 6 & 7
Wet lab work:
Our main construct is only a few cloning rounds away now ! Our efforts are focused on both the scaffold and the enzymes fusions as we decided to test six different enzymes to illustrate three proofs of concept for our project. The iGEM compatible expression vector that we designed had also been constructed and will help us express and purify our enzyme fusions. We will soon start working with our model organism Lactococcus Lactis and manipulating proteins. Although we have discussed testing of our constructs, some precisions are being explored as how to assay and measure specific enzymatic activities.

We found that biologists concentrated more on the whole biological function of the designed protein, whereas the chemist focused more on the structure and chemical properties of the designed protein. However, since the structure and chemical properties of the protein are essential factors of function studying, once we can perfectly combine the study methods and ideas of biology and chemistry, the synthetic biology studying will grow with leaps and bounds. 2.In the College of Life Sciences of WHU

VI) Conclusion
There are multiple variable intrinsic to the design of the modeling experiment that we'll have to control for. These include phage speciation (particle size, infection rate, lysis rate, etc), agar concentration, adsorption time, bacterial density, and incubation time.
For actual experiments that model phage plaque size against phage particle size we will have to control for all variable apart from phage speciation. This implies that we will have to make top agar solution with a volumetric flask, measure adsorption time, use OD to determine bacterial density, and measure incubation time. It will be easiest if we can standardize adsorption time, bacterial density, and incubation time so that we can compare results between different experiments.

Introduction to Model
Designed gene circuit in cell A and cell B
In our project, we designed a quorum-sensing oscillator which consists of two types of cells. The expression of the reporter genes (GFP of one cell type and GFP of another) of the cells of the same type can fluctuate synchronously and certain designs were made to adjust the phase and the period of oscillation. To understand the property of our system, we built a mathematical model based on ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) and DDEs (Delayed Differential Equations) to model and characterize this system. The simulation results helped us to deepen into further characteristics of the system.

Original Full Model
Firstly we described the system thoroughly without leaving out any seemingly unimportant actions and factors. As a result, the description of the system contains every possible mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the parameters were got from literature. The model was represented and simulated in the Matlab toolbox SIMBIOLOGY, but too many parameters make it difficult to do further analyses, So here we only listed all 19 ODEs  and a reletive parameter table( see attached pdf file ).

Simplified DDE
Simplified DDEs
original model contains too many factors for analyzing the general property of system. To understand the essential characters of the oscillator, we simplify the original model according to certain  appropriate assumptions, like Quasi-equilibrium for fast reactions.
After series of derivation based on those assumptions, we came  up with the following set of DDEs (Delay Differential Equations)  which contains only 6 equations, see the figure right. And it   would be much more convenient for us to do some neccessary analyses  and research into the mathematical essence of our model.
Figure shows all variables are oscillating
We coded the system by DDE description in MATLAB and did simulation analysis accordingly. The result showed that the system could oscillate under certain parameters.
To further understand what parameters could make the"

This two-component system has been described in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and due to the homology relationship with the EnvZ-OmpR system, it might possibly be functional in E.coli.

Signaling Cascade
When our device is struck by green light, the following cascade will ensure:
Photon input
CcaS switches to Green conformation
Kinase activity starts
Phosphorilated CcaR concentration builds up

Blue Emission
Description
Blue Emission is composed of a series of enzymes that generate light by the oxidation of a substrate. Our sub-device has 6 enzymes (LuxA, LuxB, LuxC, LuxD, LuxE, LumP), two catalyze the oxidation step (LuxA, LuxB), one adjusts the emission spectrum (LumP), and three generate and recycle the substrate (LuxC, LuxD, LuxE). We plan on having the adjusting enzyme, as well as the 3 regenerating enzymes expressed constitutively. We would then only use the oxidation enzymes as reporters for whatever event we are observing.
While the oxidation per se does not generate light, it does generate an intermediate molecule in an electronically exited state. When said molecule returns to a basal energy state, a photon is released. Likewise, LumP does not actually shift the spectrum, but the enzyme generates a substrate that does.
As you may imagine, these genes (sauf LumP) constitute an Operon. This is the Lux Operon from Vibrio fischeri.

Blue Reception
LovTAP
Description
Blue Reception is composed of a slightly complicated system. Firstly, we have a quimeric sensing protein (LovTAP). This protein is composed of a sensing domain (a Light-Oxygen-Voltage domain) as well as the DNA-binding domain of the TrpR transcriptional repressor from the Triptophan pathway.
LOV domains bind a flavin-mononucleotide (FMN) or flavin-adenine-dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, which are used in a wide variety of metabolic pathways as cofactors in redox reactions and are available in most organisms. The cofactor has a broad absorption spectrum"
UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," learned that in order to have an industrially acceptable project, we needed to differentiate between the different stages of bioprocessing, specifically upstream processing and downstream processing.
The upstream process is the primarily lab-based component. This involves the step in which microbes are grown and engineered to produce the substances of interest. Factors contributing to upstream processing include growth rate, typical duration of fermentation, production rate, medium cost, and strain development costs.
Factors contributing to downstream processing are harvesting and extraction of a purified product. Typical difficulties include treatment with chemical solvents and expensive techniques to harvest the substances . The lab suggested that we look into ways to minimizing costs of these features because these can account for up to 75% of overall costs in a system.
By doing so, the lab also suggested that we could think about the different kinds of bioreactors and think about how we were going to house two different types of organisms, one photosynthetic and one non-photosynthetic. They also suggested that we do research into existing solutions, which we have documented on the Applied Design section of our website.
Deliberation
We decided against using a single space to enclose both organisms because there would be no way to really control and optimize growth control for both of these organisms if they were in a close proximity to one another. Instead, we decided that a separate two-compartment design would be more ideal and help us maximize the potential of our system.
To make our system commercially viable, we realized that another component to this project (not the focus for this year) would be to engineer a transport mechanism for tagatose out of the cyanobacteria. At the current stage, lysing the cell and checking with HPLC would be sufficient, but we thought that a transport mechanism would make the bio-production platform more cost-effective. Thus, the entire scope of our project now included a 3 step cost-reduction strategy:
Reducing long term costs and increasing sustainability via the ROBUST method
Using a co-culture design to start the first metabolic production pathway
Genetic engineering to help transport the tagatose directly into the growth medium for the E. coli and make a more sustainable platform
Point 10: Factors to Consider for the Upscaling of Cyanobacteria
Rationale
Although E. coli expression platforms have been popularized in biotechnology over the last several decades, even a cyanobacteria model organism such as S. elongatus has only recently become noticeable for purposes of genetic manipulation. We realized that the scale of the work we were doing in the lab was not even close to the industrial scale we were envisioning, so we"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," young scientists from the most prestigious universities and research institutions in Mexico and the United States. Each summer, the organization carries out the week of CdeCMx in several cities in the country with the partnership of multiple institutions.
As well, each year, different researchers carry out a program for their Club so students can apply and attend to it. One of the best things this organization has to offer is that every Club is free thus everyone who is interested in science has the opportunity to attend.
This is a project that involves 9 different sites in Mexico. It has over 162 Clubs, 300 instructors and 2200 students within the country. In Chihuahua, our university, the “Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Campus Chihuahua” was one of the sites in Mexico for this important event.
The campus hosted 120 undergraduate students from different institutions along the city who were advised by 12 professors that shared their knowledge and applied it to theoretical and practical lessons.
6 Clubs took place in our campus throughout the week; “Aprende a usar tu gimnasio cerebral usando nanopartículas” given by Sylvia Ortega from the University of Chicago and Linda Lucero from the Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua (UACH), “Combatiendo el cáncer con plantas medicinales” given by Loria Hijar from UACH and Andrés Moya from the University of Chicago, “Material Science: it looks like magic, but it is real” given by Fernando Valenzuela from the Research Center for Advanced Materials (CIMAV) and Nicole Bakker from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), “Del fotón al electrón: Tecnologías solares para todos” given by Jesús Valdiviezo form Duke University and Nora Sánchez from UACH, “Building low cost technology for social impact” given by Safinah Ali from MIT and Luis Orona from the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), and last but not least “El mundo real de la biotecnología” given by Laura de Lorenzo from Kentucky University and Isui García from UACH.
For iGEM Tec Chihuahua 2018, as well as CdeCMx, is very important to wake up interests for science in students, so it spreads a little more every time. That's why we decided to support one of the Clubes given at our campus which was “El mundo real de la biotecnología”.

UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB,2017,Team:UChile OpenBio-CeBiB#Collaborations#iGEMManchesterCollaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,". US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.
For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products. To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.
In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seem to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.
The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.
Answers by country
1. What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
European Union
European Commission is the institution responsible for proposing and implementing legislations applying to all member countries. Member countries may additionally restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMMs in their territory. This possibility, however, is regulated by Directive (EU) 2015/412 adopted by the EU.
United States
Stemming from research from the University of Virginia and EMBO, the J. Craig Ventor Policy Center Team has concluded that the United States lack an agency that specifically focuses on enforcing laws regarding GMMs. Instead, legislation such as the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology and the President's Commission for studying Bio-ethical issues, which was established by Barack Obama. As of now, the regulatory agency with the most regulatory control on issues regarding synthetic biology is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Australia
In Australia, the use of GMMs is regulated under a nationwide legislative framework consisting"

Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program. In addition, process of products generating is not as easy as just creating a new species with specific name, too. Their structures are required to be constructed under rules defined in MoDeL at the same time. The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break up the task to several parts:
Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file;
Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species;
For each template species found matching, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both at the same time;
For each template reaction found possible to occur, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction;
For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied for given constraints, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
Go to step 2 until the end of the species list;
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
Figure 1: Algorithm Flow Chart
Special reactions and volume strategy
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions. The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. It means number of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute"

Modeling
We developed several models to help design our biosensor to maximize output variation (i.e. the difference between a person with cancer and a healthy person) and to maximize the overall output so the fluorescence can be detected more easily with cheaper equipment, which would drive down net cost of using our sensor in a medical setting.
These include:
NUPACK modeling : Used NUPACK to model the secondary structures of the toehold switches in their closed and open states to maximize dynamic range.
Mass action kinetics modeling : Built a mass action kinetics model to identify the most important parameters to optimize in our design. We ported this model to JavaScript to make it easier for our design team to use and to explain the model to others.
Stochastic modeling : We collaborated with Oxford to validated our mass action kinetics model, by stochastic modeling of the uncertainties of the parameters.
We also built a cost model to provide insight into using our device as a mass-screening tool, which we tied into our human practices work.
NUPACK model
NUPACK is a software tool that can model the secondary structures of RNA systems. [1] We used NUPACK to optimize the design of our toehold switches.
We ran our simulations at 37°C, with 100 picomolar of miRNA, 20 nanomolar of DNA and 500 picomolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.
Using NUPACK, we"

Among them, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) have a large correlation with \(\theta_2\), but have little                         correlation with \(\theta\). From the experimental data, it can be given that \(\theta_2\) meets                         the requirements when it reaches 0.5~0.7. Under the preconditions, relation (8) and Fig. 4 can                         be derived:
$$\frac{[R_{T0}]}{A_0}=K\theta_2+b\tag{8}$$
Fig.4 The relationship between the optimal ratio of antibody                                 antigen concentration and θ2
There are then two scenarios. Scheme 1: immobilized antigen, test substance and antibody mixed                         detection. Scheme 2: After the antigen is fixed and the excess antibody is added, the test                         substance is added for competitive reaction. These two options need to be compared.
At present, the gray scale model and the dynamic model are discussed in the first scheme.
When determining the residual antigen concentration and time relationship when immobilizing an                         antigen and the residual antibody concentration and time relationship when the antibody is                         attached, the model can be used to give an optimal concentration ratio of the immobilized                         antigen and the antibody by combining given \(θ\) and \(θ_2\).
At the same time, it can be concluded that the proportional relationship is closely related to                         the expected \(θ_2\) and has no obvious relationship with the expected \(θ\).
The relationship between the Grayscale value and the reaction time of the liquid to be                     tested
When inspecting the finished product, it is desirable to obtain the shortest test time to                         determine the credibility of the test results. Therefore, the relationship between the test                         results and time is completed. The reaction \(\mathrm{γ}\) and the pattern diagram ω3 are as follows:
$$R_TA\overset{K_{d1}}{\underset{K_{a1}}{\rightleftharpoons}}A+R_T$$
$$P+R_T\overset{K_{a2}}{\underset{K_{d2}}{\rightleftharpoons}}R_TP \tag{ γ }$$
Fig.ω3 Detection mode diagram
For detection, it is assumed that the immobilized antigen is not easily detached outside the                         reaction, and the amount of free antibody during the reaction is very small and remains                         substantially unchanged.

However, for some individual positions in the chip, we recorded a response consistent with our expectations: we can observe the increase of RFP expression even if the population of cells decreases in time. This might suggest that the experiment actually worked and these cells respond to a certain concentration of TetR as shown by the following pictures.
This expression of RFP was recorded at position 193 of our scan which corresponds to the 29th chamber of row 5 (see bellow). Using this, we could in principle calculate the distance from TetR source and the time it took to induce RFP expression to obtain the concentration at which this happened by using a simple diffusion equation. However, these results appear to be quite random due to the fact that a great majority of chambers indicates a loss of cell activity.
Clearly, the results are not as conclusive as we would like them to be, but this experiment was complementing another experiment we did that consisted in induction of RFP by addition of TetR using a multi-well plate and a plate reader.
Cell patterning
Our main experiment is yet to be conducted as we are still waiting for the completed plasmid. However, we can already expect that the cells will have difficulties growing inside the chambers. One possible solution that we can try during this experiment is to close the buttons from time to time and flow in some new LB medium to provide sufficient nutrients for cell proliferation.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," munitions are weapons adhering to the no distinction principle, which means that they are not aimed at a specific target, but kill people, soldiers and civilians alike, at random. Also, when sub munitions of a cluster bomb do not explode, they turn into de facto landmines. Because of that, it is logical that the ICBL and the CMC combined their efforts.”
Because landmines are not such a hot topic in the news anymore as a couple of years ago, we asked if the issue is as good as solved. “In the run up to the Mine Ban Treaty, the problem was huge. Over 20.000 people  died per year, as a direct result of landmines. However, the BMT is near universal now, so most countries do not have, produce or use landmines anymore. The near-universality of the treaty also impacts the unaffiliated countries, since landmines are a stigma nowadays; there is a universal norm not to use landmines. You can compare it to the attitude towards chemical weapons: when Assad decided to use these, this was universally disapproved. This stigmatization is why the universalization of the cluster munitions treaty is of the utmost importance.”
The success of the Mine Ban Treaty however has not caused eradication of the use of land mines. “Still every year people die because of landmines. The numbers are not comparable to those of before the landmine treaty, but every casualty is one too much. Landmines have recently been used in the conflict in Syria, by the FARC in Colombia and in Yemen. We have also received reports of the use of landmines and cluster bombs in the conflict in Ukraine. However, these are not verified and it should be noted that there is a propaganda war going on there as well: because of the stigmatization, claiming that the opposing party uses landmines is great propaganda.”
We also discussed the particular position the United States have with respect to landmines: “The US haven’t signed the Mine Ban treaty, despite years of encouragement. However, they are by far the world’s biggest donor for landmine removal and victim aid. They don’t use and produce landmines for years, and they even stated that it is their goal to sign the treaty ‘in due time’. I speculate that the fact that they want to reserve the right to use them is related to a possible conflict between North and South Korea.”

A coding sequence of iRGD peptide and position it outside the membrane.
Usage and Biology
iRGD is a tumor-penetrating peptide that can increase vascular and tissue permeability. Importantly, this effect did not require the drugs to be chemically conjugated to the peptide. To enhance the accuracy of drug delivery system and improve targeting index of drugs, iRGD peptide was displayed on the surface of the exosome containing our previously designed siRNA, allowing us to target recipient cells in vivo efficiently. Lamp-2b is a protein found specifically abundant in exosomal membranes. So we connect iRGD with Lamp2b by a glycine-linker, and promote the expression using cmv promoter. We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express iRGD-Lamp2b fusion protein. Therefore, the iRGD exosomes (iRGD-Exos) are endowed with site-specific recognition ability and were purified from cell culture supernatants and loaded with Dox by electroporation.
Characterization
The iRGD-Lamp2b expressing vector was thoroughly described in Tian’s article (Yanhua Tian, et al. Biomaterials, 2013). He showed that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, could deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to αν integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to αν integrin-positive breast cancer cells in"

OBJECTIVES
Introduce genetic engineering and its difference with biotechnology
Describe how genetic engineering is related to our society
Explain iGEM and our project, Tristable Switch
Demonstrate basic wet-lab techniques such as standard assembly and PCR
Conduct basic experiments such as restriction digestion and ligation, and more advanced experiments such as colony PCR
FEEDBACK
The flow of the two-day lab experience was smooth and it was pleasing to see that the students were willing to learn. However, time did not seem to be sufficient to give a proper pre-experiment explanations for the students before each experiment, thus materials regarding wet-lab were explained post-experiment.
Fortunately, the students were capable of following the processes of the experiments and could appreciate the principles behind iGEM’s synthetic biology. The teacher hoped that there would be more workshops to be organised, giving more opportunities for secondary school students to gain exposure in synthetic biology."

4. Formation of electro-transforming competent bacterial cells
Vaccinate the bacteria from step 3 at 1% concentration and culture for 1 hour at 30 degrees centigrade. Then add in L-arabinose (2% as final concentration) to induce for at least 90 minutes, forming electro-transforming competent bacterial cells. Add 10% amount of glycerol and make sure the total volume is under 100ml.
5 Electro-transformation
Chill down the electro-transformation cup in advance, and thaw the competent cells on the ice. Then add in the regenerant of gel extraction in step 2, mix up, move onto the ice in electro-transformation cup, stay for 10 minutes, and then start the electric shock.
[Notice] 1. The amount of the regenerant added into the cells depends on its concentration. Generally we add 2 to 6 microlitres, the higher the concentration is, the less we add. 2. Act rapidly when perform electrotransformation.
6. Screening for strains.
Spread bacterial fluid on chloramphenicol plate at 30 degrees centigrade, and pick single colonies into liquid culture medium, shake for 8 hours. Then adjust the temperature to 42 degrees centigrade. Continue to culture for 6 hours, and then perform PCR to figure out the possible aim strain, and use glycerol to conserve. Figure out the aim strain by sequencing.
7. Analyzing the concentration of indole and methylindole in the aim strain with HPLC
Results:
Diagram1. PCR screening of the aim strain
Diagram2.centration curve of indole（mutant：blue line& wild type：yellow line）
Diagram3.bacteria growth curve （mutant：yellow line & wild type：blue line）
Discussion:
RED recombination system is capable of achieving effective knocking out of tryptophanase gene, and the concentration of indole and methylindole are both evidently declined after the knocking, leading to the improvement of the smell. Yet meanwhile the quorum sensing among the bacteria is weakened as a result of the lack of indole as indole works as an important signal molecule between different individuals of the bacteria, so the drug resistance of the mutant strain has declined."

Alternative Selection System
Overview
While our main approach, the bacterial two-hybrid system , is the optimal approach for our selection, we proposed two alternative systems to apply positive selective pressure towards generation of functional Evobodies. In contrast to the bacterial two-hybrid system which relies on the expression of a selection marker, these methods work independent of transcriptional regulation. To screen bacteria in vivo for protein-protein interaction we proposed the usage of a split-protein system. For our split-protein selection system, we focused on two major kinds of split-protein selection systems that are both working with fusion proteins. The first one, later referred to as “split-protein system”, is realised by splitting a fully functional protein in two parts, fusing one half to our binding protein and the other half to our target protein. The second approach is known as “Hitchhiker-system”. It is based on a beta-lactamase, that is missing a transport signal, fused to the target protein and a transport signal fused to the binding protein.

As a selective marker gene we chose the ampicillin resistance gene (amp) coding for TEM-1 beta"

Lab Work conducted at Cayetano University
All lab work was completed in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Guerra at Cayetano University in Lima, Peru. The lab provided all necessary materials beyond what iGEM supplied. Dr. Daniel and his Master's student, Keren Espinoza provided us with training and lab space to conduct our experiment.
Dr. Daniel Guerra and Ms. Keren Espinosa
Dr. Daniel and Keren provided us with training on synthetic biology concepts and lab skills. They helped us troubleshoot our project, discussing with us each day we were in the lab. Additionally, Keren would sometimes help fill in the gaps when we were rushed for time for example by making gels ahead of time for us or rerunning a gel that wasn't clear. She also helped us with the initial growth of bacteria cultures so they were competent when we arrived on site.
Mentors
Dr. Nina Markham organized the iGEM team and recruited the help of Dr. Daniel's lab at Cayetano. She has accompanied us to the majority of our Cayetano visits and helped push us to learn the concepts and work on the different aspects of the iGEM project, including our Wiki and presentation and poster. Mr. Bob Oddo was with us at the beginning of the iGEM season and accompanied us to T.A.S.A. Cayetano and helped in focusing our project.

Intellectual Property, Next steps and our financing approach
Intellectual property
We performed a prior art search to potentially build Intellectual Property. We talked with the Technology Transfer Office of our university. We identified a way to apply a patent for one specific application of our project.
The next steps
Wh talked with Deep Science Venture, a life-science incubator based in London. Depending on our lab outcome they proposed us to invest £100k to further push this venture. The program starts with a first three months validation period. At the end of this period, the entrepreneurs/scientists pitch their project to investors to rise money. After the contest we have planned a meeting with them. Our Lab and Research leader and Team leader and other members are truly considerate to integrate this program to switch our adventure to a research project to a startup venture.

We quadrupled the amount of private sponsoring compared to the previous year. We decided to prior smart money. This way pitch our project in front of decision maker of large pharmaceutical companies. That gave us a certain project maturity, it was great exercise, that give us tools and experience to convince investor for much larger investments in our venture. This way, we anticipated the possible after-contest outcomes to use the momentum generated by iGEM.
We were also financed by the Brussels Public Institute Innoviris with a startup proof of concept grant. This sponsorship was a first step that opened the door for another financing opportunity if we keep going the project after the contest."

Human Practices were an essential component in the development of our project. The work that we accomplished this year varied in many aspects. We conducted many sessions on how synthetic biology could change our view of life and science, especially among school children and college students. We had an active interaction with the community in order to educate the public about synthetic biology and the ethical issues in synthetic biology. We have also ventured into policy-making by creating a GMM legislation proposal to help advance the laws and regulations of GMMs around the world.
Apart from this, we took our knowledge to the grassroots by conducting educational programs in the Hindi language to teach younger generations in rural areas about science, engineering, and biology. Safety and security risks were also assessed by us. We actively considered how our project will affect our environment and the public perception by conducting surveys and interactions.
Being a  more of a foundational advancement project in the field of synthetic biology the impact over the society was not very straightforward, however, it was more concerned with the present-day research development in multiple disciplines. We therefore integrated human practice considerations into the design and execution of our project by interacting with professors and researchers from multiple disciplines to know how our project poses to be a potential application in their respective fields and to be an integral element to solve scientific challenges for years to come and to better understand their needs and use these findings to influence our team decisions.
EDUCATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
The main aim we had before going out and spreading awareness about the field of synthetic biology was to be able to make a significant change in how people around us perceive Synthetic Biology. We really wanted to present a perspective to all of these impressionable minds around us that fills them with a passion for this"

BroadRun-NorthernVA,2015,Team:BroadRun-NorthernVA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," of this and the fact that our school lab did not have the resources for an iGEM project, Marissa Sumathipala and Adriel Sumathipala, who had prior interactions with BUGSS through their own research activities, contacted Dr. Lisa Schiefele and Dr. Tom Burkett of BUGSS. BUGSS, a citizen scientist biology hackerspace founded by Dr. Burkett, that had sent an community lab iGEM team to the 2014 iGEM Jamboree, was very supportive. After working out various aspects of such an effort, from teaching an introductory synthetic biology lab course by Dr. Schiefele to those team members that had not had prior lab experience needed for the project,  safety and ethics aspects of the project, and logistics of doing the research at their lab, BUGSS came on board. We have since been mentored by Dr. Schiefele and Dr. Burkett and have conducted all our lab work exclusively at BUGSS. As BUGSS continues to grow and become known in the Baltimore and greater Washington area and also nationally, with a focus on synthetic biology, both as a place for creative engineering and educating adults and a generation of youth, our collaboration with BUGSS as an iGEM team is also advancing their vision for youth education and engagement. Together, we are bringing synthetic biology to the forefront of education, public awareness, and creative problem solving.
Rockridge High School iGEM Team, Loudoun County, VA
From the inception, we have been in continuous dialog with Mr. Saavedra, the instructor of Loudoun County’s only other iGEM team at Rockridge High school. Also being a first time team like us, we maintained communication and correspondence via phone voice calls, emails, texts, and at least two visits to Rockridge. These dialogs covered diverse topics from fundraising ideas for registration fees and jamboree fees, equipment, lab resources, research topics, project implementation approaches, and details of lab work.   On August 13, two of our team members, Marissa and Fionn, and our instructor, Nina Arendtsz, visited the Rockridge team at their school. We met and talked to the students working on the project, discussed issues with writing code for the wiki, and learned a lot more about their project including observing some of their preliminary results of gels. Their team offered us lab resources to incubate cultures and we offered them to use the electroporator at BUGSS lab, a piece of equipment not available at Rockridge. We spent over an hour and"
TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Modeling#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," our model or our data. As the name already suggests, the prior gives the option to incorporate prior knowledge about the distribution of the parameters.
Relation to least squares
If we do not know anything about the parameters, e.g. they all have the same probability we can omit the prior. This means that the posterior is equal to the likelihood.
Now if the likelihood is a Gaussian distribution, maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood, as function of the parameters, is the same as finding the least squares approximation.
Monte Carlo Methods
Usually it is not possible to give any closed expression for the posterior distribution. When working with high dimensional posteriors where the location of the support of the distribution is not clear, interpolating the posterior will be very hard. Hence alternative methods are necessary to get an idea of the shape of the posterior distribution. The book by David MacKay [ MacKay, 2003 ] gives an good overview of available algorithms.
The general idea of Monte Carlo methods is to draw random samples and accept or reject them, in such a manner that the samples will eventually be drawn according to a certain, evaluable distribution.
We will use the Metropolis Hastings algorithm as it is easy to implement and sufficiently fast to sample our posteriors.
Identifiability
What is the problem?
Another problem that was not yet addressed is the question of identifiablity. When it is only possible to measure the cumulative amount of the two A and B where the system is governed by the equation
the measurement will, apart from errors always produce the same value. This means that it is impossible to infer the value of the measurement b. As all values of will b produce an equivalent fit, all results of optimization routines will be meaningless.
In actual inference task we will most likely not deal with such extreme non-identifiabilities but it could happen that for example only the ratio between two parameters is identifiable but not the individual values. Such behavior can be visible in marginal joint distributions generated by Markov Methods, but one will have a hard time spotting more complex non-identifiabilities from joint distributions.
Profile Likelihood
In that cases one normally looks at the profile likelihood of the distribution. The profile likelihood is generated by maximizing the likelihood/posterior for a set fixed value of one parameter with respect to the other remaining parameters. When this profile likelihood for one parameter is flat, all changes to this parameter can be balanced by a change of the other parameters and the examined parameters is not identifiable[ Vanlier et al., 2012b ].

We intend to use this strong interaction between biotin and avidin to immobilise our fusion protein to a column containing some sort of biotinylated surface e.g. biotinylated beads. By expressing an Avidin protein as part of our fusion protein, we can attach our expressed fusion protein to any biotinylated surface.
The avidin used in this project is derived from the Single chain avidin (Scavidin) part from the 2016 TUMunich team (BBa_K2170205). A ribosome binding site was added to the Scavidin part to ensure a high expression of the desired fusion protein.
To test that components of the different snake venom do not cleave or otherwise inhibit the function of Scavidin, we constructed a composite part consisting only of our Scavidin and amilCP part.
The oligopeptides found in both our AMC experiment and our High Throughput screening experiment were used to design protein linkers for our fusion protein. Beside the linkers we found through testing and screening, we have tested an empirical linker molecule. The FRET linker with the peptide sequence RPPGFSPFRQ has previously been used on the venom of different Bitis sp., to test the neutralizing ability of newly developed antivenoms [14].
We aimed to design our own flexible linker that would allow for our two major protein domains to move independently from each other. Empirical flexible linkers found in fusion proteins usually contain either Gly or Ser/Thr residues [15]. Ser/Thr residues have the advantage of being hydrophilic residues that allow linkers to be in contact with water, enabling them to come into contact with proteases. The linkers designed by our team generally had a lot of Gly residues, in order to ensure the aforementioned flexibility. To increase the chance of cleavage, repeats of the same cleavage sequence were introduced in some of our linkers. The resulting rationally designed linker, with the ALK/ sequence identified by our AMC experiment, was submitted to the registry as BBa_K2355001.
Amplification step: Introducing β-galactosidase
In order to lower the incubation time needed in our prototype, we wanted to add an amplification step to the device. This was done by using an enzyme as a reporter instead of using chromoproteins.
By cleavage of the linker molecules by snake venom, the enzymes would be released from the A"

After some wash steps all other proteins should be removed and only the bounded protein should be left in the column. A buffer with DTT activates at last the self-cleavage of the intein-tag at our protein and the protein disengages from the column and can be   collected in a new tube.
The Bradford-Assay of our purificated proteins revealed a very high concentration. Compared with a standard series of different BSA concentrations   we calculated a protein amount of 15 mg⁄ml for the HA4-RpoZ fusion protein and 20 mg⁄ml for the SH2-cI fusion protein (figure 1). These results coincides with the SDS-PAGE .   There is a strong band on lane in the gel indicating proteins of about 25 kDa for SH2-cI and about 22 kDa for HA4-RpoZ, respectively. These results a very similar to the results from the expression control and show that the two proteins you can the    see in the gel are definitely the two fusion-proteins. Therefore, it is sure, that the purification worked very well.
Affinity Chromatography
After the purification has worked it was necessary to proofe if our controls are interact with each other. The first attempt was an affinity chromatography with these two proteins. For an affinity chromotography it is important that you immobilize   one of your proteins. Therefore, the IMPACT experiment was repeated only for the SH2-cI fusion protein. The headed discoveries demonstrated that it is possible to bind a protein with chitin binding domain at the chitin column.   Therefore, we used this to immobilize our SH2-cI protein at the chitin beads of the column. But before we induced the self-cleavage of the intein-tag of our protein we make a additional step with adding also purificated HA4-RpoZ in the column with one additional washing step.   No interaction of HA4 and SH2 would lead to total clean up of our HA4 from the column after washing it. However, a binding of HA4 with our designed SH2 domain would hold some HA4 back in the column. After self-cleavage of the intein-tag the bounded HA4 proteins would also be detectable    in the purificated protein solution.
To prove this adoption we measured both purificated proteins SH2-cI and HA4-RpoZ and our affinity chromatography protein solution in the MALDI-TOF(Matrix"

Fig. 8 The relationship between the fluorescence/OD600 and the concentration of arabinose
From this diagram, we can get the conclusion that the concentration of arabinose have a positive correlation with RFP intensity/OD600.
3. Employed plasmids with different copy numbers and simulated the concentration of plasmids losing on different levels.
In order to know the concentration of inhibitor changing with number of plasmids, we chose three types of plasmids with different copy numbers to achieve this.
Three kinds of plasmids are listed below.

In order to detect the inhibitor protein more easily, we replace the inhibitor with RFP like circuits below (Fig. 10)
Fig. 10 The fragments constructed on different plasmids
Then we construct two fragments in the Fig. 11 on different plasmids with different copy numbers.
At first, because it’s hard to control the number of plasmids, we use the model to simulate the relationship between the plasmids number and inhibitor protein (Fig. 11).
Fig. 11 The relationship between the protein intensity and the number of plasmids.
From this curve, we can clearly know that the relationship between number of plasmids and protein intensity. The concentration of arabinose have a positive relationship with protein intensity in a proper range. In the previous section, we think when protein intensity above the 24.42 units, the in-promoter will be repressed fully, so the threshold of the number of plasmids is calculated to be 210 copies.
In the wet lab, the strains containing different plasmids copy numbers separately overnight (16 h) growth in the LB medium.

After 16h growth in the LB medium, we measure the RFP intensity of seven groups. Then we calculate the relative RFP intensity by subtracting the negative control
Table. 5.The RFP intensity of different circuits on different plasmids
From the table. 5, we can know that different plasmids copy numbers will lead to different RFP intensity. More plasmids copies, more RFP expressed.

RPU of PBAD in different cell strains
In order to solve the discrepancy between Groningen 2011 and Cambridge 2011, we have calculated the Relative Promoter Unit of the PBAD promoter in three different cell  strains across increasing arabinose concentration. The three strains that were chosen was: DH10B, BW25113, and DH5α. Groningen 2011 used cell strain DH5α to obtain the 3-D graph  while Cambridge 2011 used BW27783. Unfortunately, we did not had access to the strain, so we had to use another strain, BW25113, which is commonly used by synthetic biologists.  Only DH5alpha has araC in its genome. All other strains have deletion of araC (and other genes in the L-arabinose operon).

Relative Promoter Unit of PBAD promoter was calculated in three strains: DH10B, BW25113 and DH5alpha.

Detailed Description
Signed by 150 government leaders at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the Convention on Biological Diversity is dedicated to promoting sustainable development, Mexico is one of the countries that signed this Convention. The Conference of the Parties is the governing body of the Convention and advances implementation of the Convention through the decisions that take place at its periodic meetings. The Fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) will be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, 17th - 29th November 2018.1
""MOP"" stands for ""Meeting of the Parties"" of the protocol. This year will be COP-14 and MOP-9 of the Cartagena Protocol. Later, will be the MOP-2 of The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing and the MOP-1 of The Nagoya - Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress.
Biotechnology is being promoted as a better way to grow crops and produce medicines, but it has raised concerns about potential side effects on human health and the environment, including risks to biological diversity. In some countries, genetically altered agricultural products have been sold without much debate, while in others, there have been vocal protests against their use, particularly when they are sold without being identified as genetically modified. In response to these concerns, during the past two decades, two Protocols have been adopted by the Parties to the CBD. In January 2000, the Parties approved the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. This Protocol seeks to ensure the safe handling, transport, and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from biotechnology. To that end, the Protocol establishes procedures that allow countries to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of LMOs into their territories.
More recently, the Parties adopted the Nagoya Protocol. It reaffirms each nation’s sovereignty over its genetic resources and calls for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic materials. By ensuring benefit-sharing, the Protocol seeks to create incentives to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity. The Nagoya Protocol entered into force on October 14th 2014.3
One of the issues discussed in the Nagoya Protocol is the genome of"
