UNBC-Canada,2017,Team:UNBC-Canada#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," replied no. With this new information, we looked further into current and projected methods and found consistency in what the lab technicians informed us of. Therefore, we decided not to pursue this arm of our project and direct our focus on Hfq and gene silencing.
Dr. Andrea Gorrell
After conceptualizing our RNA based system, we had multiple conversations with Dr. Gorrell about how to execute our project. Being the protein expert at UNBC, she suggested that we first attempt to solve the ambiguity surrounding Staphylococcus Hfq; namely, whether or not it is necessary in RNA hybridization. This gave us the plan to express and purify Hfq, and subsequently test the binding affinity of Hfq to RNA using fluorescence polarization.
Dr. Keith Egger
When we began our project design, we originally thought of engineering E. coli to carry conjugative F-factor plasmids with our genes of interest and co-culturing these E. coli with Staphylococcus aureus to allow for plasmid transfer between bacteria. Our rationale for this was ""using the same way resistance is spread to ultimately destroy resistance"". We then approached Dr. Keith Egger, a microbiology expert at UNBC, to inquire if this would be possible. Dr. Egger provided us a vast amount of information pertaining to the issues around the concept. Although it sounds great in theory, we abandoned the idea and, under his recommendation, turned our focus to phage delivery of sRNA as a future avenue for our project.
Safety First - Important Considerations
Lydia Troc
We approached the biosafety officer at UNBC, Lydia Troc, for advice and guidance on dealing with MRSA, a level 2 pathogen. Through our discussions with Lydia, we changed the path of our project in the following ways. First, we decided to utilize Staphylococcus epidermidis, a level one bacteria that is a very close relative to S. aureus, rather than MRSA itself (level two), in order to test our system before proceeding with the more pathogenic, expensive MRSA. Even though we decided to use S. epidermidis, Lydia advised that we still apply for safety approval to use MRSA in the Level Two facility at UNBC. Therefore, we did apply and gain approval to work with MRSA, but will only do so if our system works in S. epidermidis. Furthermore, Lydia helped to ensure we were knowledgeable on stringent safety procedures while we worked in the lab.

From single to array
We have demonstrated that our Paired dCas9 (PC) reporter system works well in bench and could be applied to the detection of MTB genomic DNA. Particularly, when combined with PCR, our PC reporter is as sensitive as to confidently detect only 1 genome copy per tube.
However, in the clinical practice, the situations are much more complicated considering the fact that strain mutation, sample difference and other environmental factors would cause misdiagnosis for single test. So we got an idea of designing a diagnosis array to extract more sequence information for on our PC Reporter to test multiple sites on the target genome at one time, thus  to guarantee reliability of diagnosis.
The core and also the first step of array design is to enumerate all the dCas9 binding site (PAM site) through the entire genome of MTB and to identify MTB-specific PAM sites as markers via SSPD. After computational screening, we totally obtained 2791 MTB-specific markers. 72 sgRNA pairs was designed according to 72 markers out of 9 fragments on MTB genome (Figure 12). Then we utilized Oligo Generator to design oligos for Golden Gate Cloning in a high-throughput manner, built sgRNA Generators for cell-free transcription, and finally obtained 70 sgRNA pairs (2 pairs failed during cloning).
Figure 12. 72 target sites (MTB-specific markers) out of 9 fragments on MTB genome, screened out using SSPD.
Then we performed array-based high-throughput measurement using PC reporter system (See Methods). Two separated assays were carried out using MTB and a control bacteria (E. coli), respectively. By data analysis, the results were presented as heat maps below (Figure 13). We can easily discriminate the results of MTB from that of control strain. Note that among 70 successfully constructed sgRNAs, 59 exhibit a significant performance for the detection of MTB; 11, however, fail to be positive. This is consistent with our concern that some factors might disrupt the performance of individual single test of PC reporter.  Reassuringly, the array-based PC reporter detection solved this problem (Figure 13).

To validate the results in a quantitative way, we selected Wilcoxon Rank Sum"

After contrastation of the results, we make glycerol stocks of the liquid cultures of KatG_b, FMS1_b, Ahp_1, J23_4 and Atoc_1 (the promoters still present some irregularities regarding their size)
Different colonies of K2M cells were extracted from the Kn dishes labeled #1 to #4. They were distributed in different liquid mediums (using the same colony for each pair, to see if the Cm resistance was lost - and thus the pCas9 plasmid):

The following DNA digestions were performed:
J23_4, AtoC_1, Ahp_1 and Ahp_2 were E-S digested
FMS1_b, KatG, GFP(24B) and OxyR were X-P digested
Lethal pAK plasmid was E-P digested
The ligations of the fragments was carried out as follows:
J23_4 - FMS1_b - pAK
Ahp_1 - KatG - pAK
AtoC_1 - 24B - pAK

Figure 25: Streptavidin affinity chromatography for NanoLuc
Therefore the NanoLuc was synthesized as a BioBrick in RFC[25] and was produced in E. coli using the pBad expression system with a C-terminal Strep-tag. After the production (2 l of LB-media for analytical and 12 l for preparative preparations) the cells were disrupted using sonification and the lysate was dialysed against 5 l of 1x SA-buffer. Afterwards the lysate was applied to a Streptavidin-Affinity (SA) column and was subsequently washed using SA-Buffer until a baseline was reached and the protein was then eluted using 5 mM of biotin (Attention: These are special columns which are not availible commercially. If you are using commercial colum material you have to use d-Desthiobiotin because usual biotin will elute your protein but you will not be able to regenerate the column after your chromatography). After the SA-chromatography the protein was concentrated using centrifugal concentration units (MWCO: 10 kDa). The concentrated protein was then applied onto a Superdex S200/75 size exclusion chromatography. The chromatogram of both preparations show a single peak in the chromatogram which elutes at an expected elution volume of 15 ml. The absence of any notable aggregation peak shows the high stability of this protein and the ease of production.

This meetup was indeed a great learning   experience, and has geared us up for the grand finale at Boston!
8. Strategy discussions:
After our institute re­opened post summer vacation, we have had a series of meetings amongst  the team members. They were mostly aimed at focusing on the design of wiki and all other stuff   regarding  meeting  the  necessary  requirements  for  a  proper  website.  Apart  from  that,   discussions on the design of poster, banner and video were also held. Proposals for community   participation were also entertained. On  the  3rd  of  August,  our  team  had  a  major  strategy  discussion  meeting  covering  all  the   pressing issues with regard to the pending work for the grand competition finale at Boston.The   entire  team  actively  participated  and  contributed  to  the  discussion,  several  beneficial   suggestions were put forth, and updates on all the completed tasks were made. It was definitely   a very productive session, and tasks were assigned hoping to execute our re­defined strategies   in the best way possible! On the 15th of August, some of our team members met for the iGEM project modelling related   discussion.Equations hypothesizing the reaction rate kinetics of our system were put forth, and   the required biochemical assays for each of the entities were discussed. The kinds of graphs to   be made and associated modelling to be done were finalized.Post all the technical discussion,   we ended the session on a lighter note by deciding a catchy tag­line for our project!  On  the  22nd  of  August,  we  had  a  meeting  regarding  sponsorship  and  media  outreach.  We   discussed important methods to be undertaken to increase awareness of our project. An article   was written by Jugal to be sent for media purposes and we also put forth ideas for the making of   a brochure.

SCUT-China_B,2016,Team:SCUT-China B#HP#HP2_-_-_TEXT.html," is lack of hospital beds in public hospitals and it causes more than 1000 yuan per day in private hospitals. There is still a long way to go for hospice care in China. Fortunately, more and more people become aware to the importance of hospice care and there are NGOs and universities working for it especially in well-developed cities.
(2)Why hospice care
It might sound strange for us to choose hospice care as one of the theme of our human practices. Our project is mainly about gene therapy for cancer in another word we are trying to “cure” cancer but we believe that we work not only for a cure but also for the patients themselves. It is patients’ feeling and living condition that should be focused on in search of a new cure. That is what we mean by “to cure and to care”. Most of the patients suffered from lung cancer are in terminal stage when they are diagnosed. It means that they can hardly be cured when then are found ill. So they need care on their heart and soul rather than the useless and painful effort of treating of their body. They need relief from the pain that they are suffering rather than to cure the illness. It is usually difficult for patients to accept the fact that they are suffering from really server illness and it will pass away soon. They need psychological help to face the situation and cooperate to treatment. All above are what hospice care can provide, and thus we want to work on hospice care.
(3)How to promote: Diary of Our Hospice Care Project
We didn’t know much about hospice care until we did this iGEM project. In our project, we attempted to induce the apoptosis of A549 cells, which cause adenocarcinoma of lung. Adenocarcinoma of lung is a kind of lung cancer and there are countless people who are suffering from stage IV lung cancer which can hardly be cured. In this stage what patients need are relief of suffering and care of their feelings but not only a cure and these are what hospice care for. We believe that a completed iGEM project should not merely focus on treatments, so we chose hospice care as the theme of human practice in order that we can make our project completed.
We do this in 7 steps.
Firstly we learnt about hospice care, what it is and what it can do.
We searched online and read some literature about hospice care ,therefore we have had some basic understanding about it. We have learnt that hospice care doesn’t provide cure to the illness itself but relief from symptoms and anxiety.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Purcell, he told us that this took up a large chunk of time during development.
Our Solution
To combat this issue, we have created a synthetic promoter library which a large number of substrates that don’t have a known binding sequence can be screened against. The screening would find a promoter that was induced by that substrate. This takes the focus from the biological knowledge and onto the engineering of the biosensor. Also, we have developed an adaptor module, which can link a substrate like the ones above into our system by breaking it down into a compound that has a known binding sequence.
Issue #3: Legislation
“The main problem with using biosensors outside the lab is legislation” - Dr Chris French
The Issue
The use of synthetic biology based biosensors is limited in the field due to restrictions around the use of genetically modified organisms outside controlled areas. Speaking to Dr Chris French on this matter, he told us about his experience with this issue when trying to get clearance for the use of the arsenic biosensor in the field. It became clear that this was the only hurdle in the arsenic biosensor project and that it was the reason the project has come to a stand still.
Our Solution
During our discussions with Dr French, he pointed us in the direction of the Workshop on Biosensors that took place in April 2017. This report said that “a possible solution to getting around legislative restrictions is the use of cell free systems”. After reading this and along with our discussions with experts, we went forward and created a mixed cell free system, informed by a design of experiments model to be able to implement our system in a cell free manner, in the future.
Issue #4: Extensive Optimisation
“Optimisation of a system is another time consuming step in development” - Dr Chris French
The Issue
Tighty coupled whole cell biosensors require extensive genetic engineering to optimise the system, for example breaking apart the components and reassembly including changes to optimise the system.
Our Solution
Our development platform allows the interchangeability of parts across the full biosensor, and the modularity aids easy optimisation. This is because changes can be made to one part if necessary, or the part can be swapped out for another, by relating it with the new device in a different cell, then reculturing.
Issue #5: Uptake of Technologies
“Only the top 5% of an industry will pick up new technologies, and we rely on them feeding it down"" - Dr David George

Overview
In recent years, a series of cases of cadmium pollution in our country have triggered wide concerns among Chinese people. Irrigating water was contaminated by cadmium raw sewage discharged from industry, then it caused the high levels of cadmium in farmland, while the rainfall worsened this process by releasing cadmium trapped in soil polluted by industrial solid waste. Considering the properties of heavy metals, unable to decay and thus a different kind of challenge for medication, we have constructed this bacteria designated as Nanocrystal E. coli Flocculation Units. The designed bacteria in our project consists of three modules in function. The first function is a detecting system that displays the presence of cadmium ions. The second function is a recycling system that synthesizes the cadmium sulfide nanocrystals to recycle ions. The last function is a flocculating system to increase the flocculent activity of the bacteria containing cadmium sulfide nanocrystals so that we can easily collect the nanocrystals formed by our engineered bacteria, as well as to avoid secondary pollution. Eventually, we can realize our double-win goal, safeguarding our environment by removing heavy metal ions and yielding available nanocrystals.
Background
Cadmium, with symbol Cd, is a soft bluish-white metal. It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann. The average concentration of Cd in the Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm).
The element is mainly used in Ni-Cd batteries and protective coating and enters the environment through both natural and numerous anthropogenic sources [1]. Currently, about three-quarters of Cd usage goes into the production of batteries and most of the remaining quarter is used for pigments, corrosion resistant coatings and plating, and as a stabilizer for plastics. During the 20th century, the production of Cd increased tremendously, especially after World War II. Although it went through some ups and downs, the overall trend is still increasing.

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Human Practices Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," high school state competition sponsored by Tech Square Atlanta to encourage innovative thinking and to determine the future of technology such as Artificial Intelligence.
High school teams from across the state of Georgia were encouraged to propose a solution to the challenge question: “How do you propose we use artificial intelligence by 2030 to fundamentally alter how we address one of these societal needs: education, health, or sustainability?”
Lambert iGEM’s software committee proposed our machine learning model “CALM” (Cholera Artificial Learning Model). CALM predicts cholera outbreaks a month in advance and informs healthcare organizations and civilians in developing nations to allocate resources in advance to provide a timely solution to an incoming outbreak.
Our CALM team won the overall grand prize, top public vote, and runner-up in best pitch video bringing $2000 in awards.
On May 5th, our CALM team was invited to the AI Day One Summit in Tech Square Atlanta where we presented our idea to a panel of technology experts, who gave us feedback on our model. They introduced us to public health professionals and machine learning model experts. This challenge has allowed Lambert iGEM to connect both the scientific and technology communities in order to make solution for the ongoing cholera outbreaks.
Experts in the fields of epidemiology, finance, and public relations provided highly valuable insight to the CALM team. The specific data flow between the SMS bot and the model itself were clarified during extensive discussion. Additionally, several experts pointed out that locals in many countries may not find answering health and sanitation surveys a practical use of their time, that not all data is necessarily accurate, that the knowledge of the project will require time to spread, and that there needs to be concrete, real-world actors for implementing CALM in health practices.

Compounds boxed in the orange are those lacking accompanied aromatics-response proteins. All these compounds can be bridged by metabolite enzymes boxed in red. This inspired us to employ metabolic enzymes as the “Adaptors for biosensors” that transform originally undetectable upstream intermediates into detectable downstream aromatic compounds.

With Adaptors like XylC and NahF transforming aldehydes to acids, aldehydes can be detected. Likewise, with Adaptor XylB transforming alcohols to aldehydes, alcohols can also be detected.

B. subtilis strain 168 with GP35 or lambda beta inserted in amyE or mutS knockouts were made electrocompetent using protocol found here . amyE and upp were electroporated with the oligoes shown in Table 1. The cells were electroporated at 2.0kV using 0.2cm cuvettes. Prior to the screening the electroporated cells were grown over night on 5y neomycin + LB agar plates, and following restreaked to respectively screening media, e.i.  5y neomycin + 1% starch + LB for or minimal media with 25uM 5-FU using the minimal media protocol . 
 
Results
The amyE screening proved to be insuficient to produce clear results and therefore this selection was abandoned. The 5-FU plates were incubated for three days before colonies were visible. To confirm that strain could grow on 5-FU, the colonies were restreacked onto new 5-FU plates. The bacteria could not grow after four days of incubation.
The methodshowed to be inadequate to prove the MAGE method in Bacillus.

Mistic Fusion Protein
Self-inserting Bacillus subtilis protein called Mistic (MstX) is originally involved in biofilm formation1. It is thought that MstX might directly chaperon the membrane insertion of potassium ion channel YugO. Together these proteins create a positive autoregulatory feedback loop that assists biofilm assembly in a population of cells and is mediated by a pathway involving potassium ion efflux2.
MstX comprises 110 residues that are arranged into a four-helix bundle exposing numerous polar and charged amino acids. This α-helical protein is characterized by an uncommonly hydrophilic surface. Until this day there is a great debate on how MstX is able to autonomously associate with a lipid bilayer despite its hydrophilic surface 2. It is known that three of the four MstX helices are much shorter than transmembrane helices of canonical integral MPs. In general, the four helices of this protein show no apparent differences in hydrophobicity or charge distribution among each other.
MstX was identified back in 2005 by Rooslid and colleagues. Interestingly"

THE ETHICS GUIDE BOOK
While preparing the actual lab project for the summer, we kept stumbling upon the general “ethics” topic. We felt that we lacked the proper tools to fully and properly investigate an issue that is so important and yet so neglected in biological sciences. So we came up with the idea of writing down some helpful ethical guidelines ourselves, where the experience from our academic background came together into four parts of ethical question sets that we find important to address: intellectual property, work ethics, biosafety with genetic engineering and social responsibility.
We consulted Heidi Howards from the Centre for Research Ethics and Bioethics and to our delight she agreed on helping us with her professional input for setting up guidelines. Our ambition is to motivate each and every iGEM team to accept their manifold ethical responsibilities and be able to state an elaborate declaration regarding their specific work. All of this boiled down into a booklet that introduces these four types of ethics every researcher will be confronted with, and summarizes it with a few questions that every iGEM team, in our opinion, should be able to answer. By this we want to contribute to the need of responsible researchers and a dearly needed open discussion.
To improve our work, we held online discussions with 15 other iGEM teams, where we could test our drafted questions and were lucky to receive great feedback, allowing us to develop the topic further. We also held a Reddit AMA to answer user questions regarding our specific topic and, as expected, were also confronted with ethical questions that the non-scientific audience might have. We incorporated every input we could collect and are proud to present the results of a summer’s work on bioethics in The Ethics Guide Book .
ONLINE DISCUSSION
While creating The Ethics Guide Book we stated the importance of communication and addressing important ethics issues. So instead of only saying this, we decided to start an actual discussion. This was also a perfect opportunity to connect to other iGEM teams and thereby contribute to the community with collaborations.
Since iGEM teams are spread out all over the world we concluded that the best way to do this was over the internet. We set up a structure for online discussions using Google Hangouts. We planned for three occasions, with topics based on the chapters in The Ethics Guide Book. All discussions were closely related to what we consider important"

July 16 – 22, 2012
Finally the primers necessary for biobricking ADF-3 arrived! And we have got other important material: we talked with Dr. Hugo Olguin, and he is willing to share with us his anti-FLAG antibody. Furthermore, he allowed us to do the western blot in his laboratory.
Additionally, we achieved significant advances in the wiki, especially in the section Human Practices.  Unfortunately, we still lack of salmonella.
July 23 – 29, 2012
After some research we found the promising projects of the Japanese iGEM team HokkaidoU 2010 and 2011. They used the E. Coli (k-12) strain SGSC4024, from Salmonella Genetic Stock Center(SGSC) in University of Calgary, Canada  ( http://people.ucalgary.ca/~kesander/index.html ). This strain carries a pBeloBAC11 vector encoding a genome fragment of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 which covers the SPI-2 region [B_STM07H21 SGSC4024 1464540～1562427]
We asked the iGEM team members of HokkaidoU 2011 if the E. Coli (k-12) strain SGSC4024 is capable of secreting proteins to the external environment. But unfortunately it seems that is only capable of injecting molecules into other cells, and that is not what we need.
In the lab we did PCR to amplify ADF-3 and ADF-3+ (i.e. ADF-3 with the tags included in the plasmid that Christopher Voigt sent to us). Unfortunately the PCR did not work.
The next day we tried to amplify the backbone pSB1C3, ADF-3+ and ADF-3 with touch-down PCR. The two first amplicons seemed to be all right. Nevertheless, later we purificated and digested the DNA to verificate if the amplicons corresponded to our parts, but the size sequences resulted to be incoherent. We have to try again.
July 30 – August 5, 2012
This week we did PCR of the backbone pSB1C3, ADF-3+ and ADF"

The idea of a paper-based arsenic sensor came from our ECBC partners and military team members. Service members put their lives at risk every time they deploy and we have a responsibility to ensure that we can provide them with the best equipment and protective measures possible. As we learned more about arsenic, we realized how big of a problem arsenic contamination is in the Tacoma area. Cadets2Vets felt that this project was a perfect fit to address both the needs of the military and the needs of our community. As we worked to share information about our project during Public Engagement and Outreach events, we met many people who would share personal stories about the history of arsenic in the area or their struggle to find access to arsenic testing. Hearing these stories made us feel that our vision of the arsenic circuit was one that would be truly appreciated by the public.
We started our research by first talking with our advisors, Drs. Hirschberg, Lux, and Emanuel, and Mr. Brisbin, and then reading literature published by peer-reviewed journals, reports by federal and state environmental agencies, and local newspaper articles. A select number of publications are listed below. We started with these articles and searched for more literature to follow up on additional questions we had about ArsR, GFP, different ways other people created biological sensors, and different types of sensor materials. The iGEM website itself was very helpful in finding information about DNA sequences and protocols.
The wet lab team started working intensely during the summer months on experiments to test their repeat experiments with purpose, clarity, and speed.

As she drifted back into sleep she thought of the blue-green world that was her home, and knew, it was well taken care of.
The end of microbe-based production of chemicals?
With general tools for genetic modification becoming commercially available, how do we tackle the arising problem of microorganisms being modified for destructive ends? Certainly, many commercial goods available today can be used for destructive means, after all a regular automobile is a 2000-pound projectile in the wrong hands. But, it could be argued that no product available today have the potential destructive capacity of a highly contagious bioweapon in the form of a genetically engineered bacterium or virus. How should questions of regulation be handled to prevent such a future?
The year is 2116. The world is threatened by a plague! Not a human plague, but a highly resistant bacteriophage threatening to eliminate the microbe-based production of food and medications that the sustainable world has become reliant on.
How could this happen?
50 years ago, there was barely any hope left for the planet Earth. The majority of the population of the Earth was shuttled to Mars, which then was more habitable than our planet. Due to this, the carbon dioxide emissions slowly began to decrease. However, this decrease was nowhere near the pace that was needed in order to save our planet. People were scared. Any solution would do. During the last three decades, a microbe-based production of chemicals using atmospheric carbon dioxide had drawn a lot of interest. Even though it showed great promise, the fear of using genetically modified organisms for production of any everyday product was even greater. But now, even the most skeptical people have agreed. Anything to save our planet.
Today, in the year of 2116, the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are back to the normal level. It’s too good to be true. Or is it?
Due to the availability of using this production system, anyone today is able to use the system for production of everyday products. Limiting legislations were made since it was implemented during such chaotic circumstances. The public was not well-informed of the potential risks of using this system and the importance of using it as intended.
Due to misuse of the system, a highly resistant bacteriophage has arisen. The solution that saved our planet also became a weapon that now threatens to end all human life on Earth. Is this the end of the Earth?

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," bistable switch it was out of the scope of this project to construct the entire switch. Therefore focus was put on characterizing the key regulatory subparts needed for successful switch function. Characterizing subparts also enable future teams to use them in other contexts.
Figure 1: A simplified illustration of our bistable switch.
Design of our switch
We have set up the complete design for a bistable switch. The main design criteria has been that the switch should be able to toggle  back and forth between states, stay in its induced state until it receives another input and remain stable through subsequent generations. These criteria imply that:
It should be designed without induction by UV-light.
It should not be based on essential native regulatory mechanisms.
It should be possible to incorporate into the genome for stable replication, and function in subsequent generations.
A simplified version of our switch design can be illustrated using a basic  SR (Set-Reset) flip flop circuit used when representing electronic circuits. It provides feedback from its outputs to its inputs and is commonly used in memory circuits to store data bits. The term flip-flop relates to the actual operation of the device, as it can be ""Flipped"" into one logic state or ""Flopped"" back into another (reference) . For further description on the logical behavior and requirements of switches see the modeling section .
Figure 2: SR flip-flop switch.
The switch design is based on phage regulatory systems. We used the repressor/anti-represor system from the Gifsy phages and an anti-termination system from the lambda-phage.
The switch has three levels of regulatory mechanisms to ensure a stable expression and tight control and thereby creating a robust bistable switch (see Figure 3):
The first level is negative feed back control - repression of the uninduced state of the switch.
The second level is a positive feed back mechanism with a threshold level that when triggered will induce the third level of regulation - antitermination allows third level to be induced.
The third regulatory level is a positive feed back mechanism stabilizing the expression of the winning state by, anti-repression of the repression from the loosing states.
Figure 3: Simplified representation of the regulatory mechanisms: [1] negative feed back control of opposite side. [2] positive feed back trigger mechanism for side commitment. [3] positive feed back mechanism, by canceling the opposite sides repressor.
For an in depth description of the function and origin of the regulatory parts have a look into the switch section.
One important feature of the switch is the strength of the promoters. For the switch to work properly we"

It is not the big pharma companies that will develop the desperately needed new generation of antibiotics that can even cope with multi-resistant bacteria such as MR"
Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". Depending on the research done in animals the results are potentially unadaptable. Thanks to the Harvard Wyss institute and other inspired research groups there might be the chance to find a better solution.
Microfluidic chips that are utilized to simulate organs, organ systems or even whole organisms are on the horizon. Inspired by the neat design of Wyss institutes lung-on-a-chip, we could produce a similar device to test our method in an environment that is at least like a human lung. Including human cell lines, including alveolar and endothelial cells and the mimicry of the breathing movement. Depending on the results to come we might have been able to simulate an infection in a chip and cured it with our newly derived method.
Salicylate Siderophore Cluster, Pch, Ybt Mbt
We utilized two different siderophores and multiple derivatives during our biosynthesis and the toxicological experiments. They all have a single thing in common, the biosynthesis starts with salicylate and mostly proceeds with cyclized cysteine. Therefore they are chemically similar. We coined the selection of salicylate based siderophores: salicylate cluster. In this defined space we could find another siderophore, mycobactin, which belongs to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the biggest player among multiresistant bacteria. [10]
Tuberculosis (TBC) claims 1.4 Mio lives every year, including about 500 000 people dying to multiresistant TBC, the therapy becomes less and less effective and involves multiple therapeutics and the treatment often takes months, months were the affected essentially must be under quarantine.
A design concept easily applied to new strains
Another goal during our design process was to derive a method to test any siderophores-gallium compound in conjunction with their corresponding bacteria. Therefore, we developed standard testing strains to simulate the uptake by including all the transport systems but no synthesis pathways to measure specific uptake rates. Additionally, we introduced lung-on-a-chip devices to the University of Hamburg, providing novel test methods for lung environments to prolong the usage of animal models and potentially generate hints if human cells are damaged by the tested compounds and to find out if anything related to the novel therapeutics passes into the bloodstream.
By combination of both methods scientists should be able to easily replicate our findings and to effectively apply different siderophore-gallium therapies for lung infections.
How does our interdisciplinarity affect our design?
This year’s iGEM team Hamburg was very diverse including students from many unexpected faculties. We had a psychologist monitoring our work, helping"

The third regulator was delta activator from phiR73 phage BBa_I746352, which can induce strongly PO promoter BBa_I746361 from P2 phage.
 (Reference: https://2009.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/Project/Amplification/Characterisation ).
Test
We also built some bigger constructs to test the function of Riboregulator and PhiR73 activator .
We ligated PO promoter with mRFP1 to create BBa_K1087018 so that we can test the basal level of PO promoter.
We also ligated “TetR promoter + lock3d” with phiR73 activator to create BBa_K1087007 . Then, we assembled BBa_K1087007 with BBa_K1087018 to create BBa_K1087022 .

F factor and its incompatible plasmid
Functionality
F plasmid was intended to be constructed in G+, and would be transferred to P- when conugation.The RiboKey on F plasmid would be open the Ribolock on the plasmid in P-.Then ,the phiR73 activator would be expressed and induce PO promoter on the “Controlled DNA Invertase device”. Finally,the DNA sequence between Lox sites would be inverted to the original state. Cells returned to the state of un-differentiation (called G cells).
 
Design
We intended to modify F palsmid using RED sysytem (reference: [3] ).
 
And we intended to make use of the stardard biobrick plasmids (reference: [4] ) that were incompatible with F Factor.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2014,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#Parts# 2000_-_-_TEXT.html," double restriction digests were carried out accordingly:
Restriction digests with EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI was performed to linearize the vector and to confirm the existence of unique restriction sites, as required by the iGEM biobrick Assembly standard 10 rules. Double restriction digests with EcoRI plus PstI and XbaI plus SpeI were performed to separate the inserts from the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. Digests were incubated at 37oC for 2 hours and analysed by gel electrophoresis. Theoretical maps were used to calculate the expected sizes of the fragments and to compare them against the gel electrophoresis results.

c.  Sequencing data and plasmid map
The plasmid was sequenced by the DNA Sequencing Services at University of Dundee. Sequencing analysis was further performed on BBa_ K1352000 with the following sequencing primers:
Assembly of the sequencing data was performed manually using the CLUSTAL OMEGA multiple alignment program. The resulting sequence (query) was then compared against the sequenced BBa_K759001 (subject) using BLAST Pairwise sequence alignment viewer:
Data suggests that the removal of the 6 additional sites through Site-Directed Mutagenisis from the coding region of Ag43 within BBa_K759001 is confirmed by sequencing.
The ExPASy Translate Tool has been used to translate the nucleotide sequences of both the BBa_K759001 and BBa_K1352000 constructs. The protein BLAST alignment tool has consequently used to compare the open reading frames of the two constructs. No indels were observed within the coding sequence of the BBa_K1352000 construct.

b) construct 11: pSB1C3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A -link-Blac;
c) construct 10*: pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 - TALE A -link-Kcoil.
The gel for construct 10* and 11* showed bands in the expected size. After gel purification and DpNI treatment, they were transformed in Top10 cells. Colony PCR showed  right-sized bands for constructs 11*.
We did PCR on BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A with primers 1 and 8 to use it as our vector in Golden Gate Assembly of construct 11. The gel showed right-sized bands but PCR purification had low yields (20.4ng/uL) and low purity. After Antarctic Phosphatase treatment, we set up Golden Gate Assembly of construct 11. The gel showed no bands.We repeated the procedure, and PCR had nonspecific amplification. Gel purification also had low yields and low purity. After that, we did PCR with less amount of DNA (10ng/reaction) which showed no bands. Another attempt was performed with different DNA concentration (5 to 45ng/reaction). Some of them had no bands and some of them had non-specific amplification.

USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html,") as described above which means the time for signal induction does not account for a large portion in the total time for nicotine degradation.
The recycle rate of nicotine
The final goal of our system is to transform nicotine from tobacco waste to 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine which is a valuable intermediate for chemical synthesis of medicine. Because some portion of nicotine is catalyzed to 6-Hydroxynicotine to operate the sensing system, not all nicotine is transformed to 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine. We need to evaluate the extent of end product production with certain input of nicotine to validate the efficiency of degradation system. To describe the transformation rate, we define a concept called ‘Recycle rate’ calculated as below:
Equation 4 Definition of recycle rate
In simulation, we define the nicotine input in the interval of [1e-5, 1] M and promoter1 strength s1 in the interval of [0, 1]. To make sure that 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine reaches the maximal concentration, the simulation time is set to 300000s.
Figure 13 Product max with s1, nicotine
Figure 14 Recycle rate vs s1, nicotine
From figure 13, it is transparent that the relation between 1og10 nicotine input and product concentration follows the exponential function. But the amount of final product is not so strong related to promoter1 strength. Only when nicotine input is in high concentration, product amount tends to decline with the increase of s1. It is expectable because stronger promoter1 expresses more Vppa which transformed more nicotine to 6-Hydroxynicotine rather than 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine. About the recycle rate, we notice that when nicotine input is more than 0.01 M, stronger promoter1 leads to the attenuation of recycle rate. The maximal recycle rate is nearly 100% with small s1 which means that our system is efficient in transforming nicotine.
Conclusions
According to the results of simulation, with defined promoter3 strength, promoter3 strength, plasmid 1 copy number, plasmid 2 copy number, the systematic properties mentioned above is significantly affected by the concentration of nicotine input. Only with high amount of nicotine input, the influence of promoter 1 strength is amplified to an observable extent. We can acquire many valuable information about the rough value or interval of these properties, then these data can be used as reference for exact experiment design such as the choice of sampling time or nicotine input amount.

The transformation did not grow. We must pick new colonies and sequence confirm they have the right Gibson CBA parts in order to resupply our stock of Plasmid 1. This will be used as the backbone for the insertion of dCas9 and Lambda Red Recombinase.
Sunday, June 29, 2014
Picked 10 colonies for overnight growth from the second 4-part CBAR of Plasmid 1, which was digested with Dpn1 to ensure no contamination by original plasmid DNA.
Sam digested gblocks and pFTV again using Cla1 and Pst1, purified, then ligated them together, purified again, then transformed cells and plated them.

Plasmid prepared 10 colonies. Digested them with AatII and XbaI, which are restriction sites only contained in the final Plasmid 1. These 10 digests were run on a gel, of which 4 showed the correct bands at approximately 1 kb and 3 kb.
No colonies observed on plates from Sunday. Attempted to use ligation product from Sunday to transform another batch of cells, because of sudden fear that our electrocompetent cells may not be good. Not enough ligated product remains to attempt this.
Tuesday, July 1, 2014
Ashlee and Emily prepared tubes of primers and four purified digestion products to send for sequencing.  They continued their work on the website and tried to find more html help for certain aspects.
Goal of the day is to transform some more cells, and use different ratio of insert to backbone during ligation in hopes of getting colonies to grow. Attempted to re-ligate digested GFPs and pFTV but not enough remains from Sunday to attempt this. Calculations ran for re-doing digestions and ligation. Digestions completed. RBS calculations from 6/26 analyzed, found that even using no initial condition (only N's followed by Pst1), sufficiently high TIR can be discovered. Need to use calculator algorithm on either Dr. Salis or Iman's computer so that a dRBS can be constructed using an initial condition that is followed by a non-mutable"

Partnership with Healios
June 4th, 2018
For our project, we had an opportunity to partner up with Healios, a biotech company in Japan that works in the field of stem cell regenerative medicine. The CEO of the company, Dr. Kagimoto, gave us insights on how we can integrate this new field of stem cells to our project. One idea of how this may work is to take patient derived stem cell, fix the gene, then place it back so that it would regenerate in the human body in the right location. Since this year, we were able to confirm that CRISPR Cas9 works on fixing the mutation of the disease in a living system, we are hoping to develop our project further in the future to ultimately apply CRISPR Cas9 on animal, and eventually human stem cells. In fact, there was a recent paper written by Chu-Qing Song and Dan Wang that was  published in August this year that already demonstrated this proof of concept in a murine model, a mammalian system. (Song, 2018) Promising results like these further validate the potential of gene therapy in treating patients of A1AT Deficiency along with range of other mutational diseases.
Contact with Dr. Seyama
August 14, 2018
Another expert we were able to contact was Dr. Seyama, who is a researcher on A1AT Deficiency in Juntendo University in Japan. What he provided us was further insight on A1AT Deficiency itself especially regarding the mechanism and progression of the disease as well as the current clinical treatment applied to patients. This kind of insight helped us reinforce our understanding on why a treatment using CRISPR Cas9 and stem cell would be more beneficial compared to the treatment we have as of now.

Inspiration
Our team wanted to work with a synthetic biology system aimed at improving access to medicine in areas of the world lacking in strong medical and shipping infrastructure. While searching for ideas in this sphere we came across the notion of Cell-free expression reactions on a shelf stable paper substrate (Pardee, et al 2014, Pardee, et al. 2016). We were struck by the notion of circumventing the cold-chain and excited by the idea of building our own cell-free expression systems to produce medications for the developing world. As we sunk our teeth into the literature we realized that it would be difficult to find a realistic candidate for a medicine which was:
Limited by cold-chain shipping and storage
A simple enough compound to be produced in a cell free context
Would have important medical impact for the developing world
We decided to focus our attention on the problem of complexity and decided that rather than focus on the medicinal aspect of the problem we would focus our efforts instead on characterizing and improving cell-free reaction platforms in order to produce more complex biologics. Specifically we wanted to focus on post-translational modifications. Expanding cell-free reactions with post-translational modifications for important functions like glycosylation or cleavage and subsequent rearrangement to occur; offering the chance to produce complex biologics like antibodies or insulin in a cell-free context (Knorre et al. 2009).
Model System
The space of post-translational modifications is huge, and so the team needed to focus on a specific set of molecules and a set of post-translational modifications. We decided to work with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) -- short peptides which exist as part of the immune system in many kinds of derived eukaryotes (Izadpanah et al. 2005). These were an ideal choice of model for several reasons. Groups had already worked with AMPs in a cell-free context using reaction preparations that were feasible for us to recapitulate in our lab and there is a large amount of diverse research on AMPs in general (Hancock et al. 2006, Pardee et al. 2016, Wu et al. 2014).

Durante séculos, os alquimistas acreditaram na existência da Pedra Filosofal, uma substância misteriosa, não só capaz de transformar metais comuns em metais preciosos, como a prata e o ouro, mas ainda capaz de cumprir os desejos derradeiros da humanidade: rejuvenescimento e imortalidade.
Embora a Pedra Filosofal nunca tenha sido encontrada, a sua procura levou alquimistas a testar em laboratório inúmeras substâncias e as suas interações, construindo um sólido conhecimento que constitui hoje em dia as ciências da química, metalurgia e farmacologia.
Vivendo no mundo orientado para a pesquisa do século XXI, a nossa crença na Pedra Filosofal desvaneceu-se. No entanto, estamos, agora como sempre, ainda em busca, à procura de soluções, não só para ajudar as pessoas a viver uma vida longa e saudável, mas também para resolver os problemas ecológicos que nós mesmos criámos no curso da modernização. Ao contrário do que acontecia no passado, agora acreditamos que não devemos simplesmente procurar substâncias mágicas escondidas algures na natureza, mas sim sermos inspirados por ela e criar novos instrumentos para enfrentar ativamente os desafios da nossa sociedade.

MAGE round 3 samples:
94 sent out for sequencing (numbers go A1-H1, etc.)
Thio kan-ZFB results:
PCR run out on E Gel: not successful.  We do not know what is still causing our PCR to fail.
pSR01-transformed selection strain:
We discovered that hisB is a two-function protein, with the N-terminal region acting as an HPase and the C-terminal region as an IDPG. His3 only complements the IDPG activity, so even if our MAGE worked, it might destroy our selection system.  The two aa deleted in hisB are in the C terminal region, so maybe they do inactivate it.  We emailed Keith Joung whose lab made the selection strain to see how HisB was deleted.
In case this mutation is correct but lambda red in the selection strain still eludes us, we designed MAGE oligos for use in EcNR2 to either delete the two aa or put 3 stop codons after the HPase region.
culture PCR results: cultures 3-4 had a strong band (and 2 and 5 weak ones) around 850-1000bp.  It is interesting how different these results are from yesterday's colony PCR gel.
pSR01 culture and thio kan-ZFB PCRs 7/12/11
Sequencing results: The sequences sent from Genewiz aligned well with the pSR01 plasmid sequence and covered pretty much all of URA3. This implies that the cells did indeed take up our plasmid.

Possible reason behind failure is that one, we may not have been reading the results correctly or two, the MAGE oligo had all three stop codons right next to each other in the oligo and may have needed to be separated by three nucleotides each in order to maximal annealing

Through the generosity of Synthetic Biology Australasia and the foresight of the USYD team, two of the SECA NZ team, Alastair and Jess, were able to attend the SBA conference in Sydney. This was the first time a New Zealand team was represented at an international meetup, something we hope becomes a traditional meetup in years to come.
This was an amazing experience in which our team got to share ideas and discussion problems with the Macquarie and Melbourne teams as well. This was also a fantastic opportunity to prepare for the preparation for Boston. Each team was given a 10 minute slot to present on their project in which we were able to present the major problems, applications and experiences of our year so far. Following this we were able to provide feedback which should result in more effective presentations from both teams. We can’t thank the hospitality of the teams and generosity of SBA enough. This was an amazing experience for all involved, creating strong connections between our teams which will be continued for many years to come.

Transposition Characterization
Characterization of miniTn7BB-Gm function
In order to characterize the function of the miniTn7BB-Gm minitransposon, we performed a set of experiments aimed to (i) determine whether miniTn7BB-Gm can transpose efficientely in an enterobacterial host (E. coli DH5α) and a non-enterobacterial host (P. putida KT2440), (ii) measure the transposition frequency when miniTn7BB-Gm was delivered by elctroporation, chemical transformation and mating, (iii) determine whether insertion occurs site-specifically at the chromosomal attTn7 site, and (iv) determine whether flipase expression in trans can excise the drug resistance marker in the chromosomal copy of miniTn7BB-Gm.
Transposition of miniTn7BB-Gm in P. putida KT2440
In order to demonstrate miniTn7BB-Gm transposition into the P. putida KT2440 chromosome, pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm was transferred to this host by two different means: (i) co-electroporation with the helper plasmid pTNS2 [pTNS2 is not replicative in P. putida, but transiently produces the Tn7 transposition machinery ( Choi et al., 2005 )], and (ii) tetraparental mating, using DH5α/pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm as the donor, DH5α/pRK2013 as helper to provide the Tra functions, DH5α/pTNS2 to provide the Tn7 transposase and P. putida KT2440 as the recipient.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"
LZU-China,2015,Team:LZU-China#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"As riboflavin's structure shows, there is a transfer of two electrons from hydrogen and hydrid ions, so riboflavin can be regarded as a electron shuttle and even a kind of redox mediator. Though riboflavin is very important in mediator-driven bioelectricity generation, the detailed mechanism on electron transfer has not been precisely investigated yet[10].
Researchers find that increase of riboflavin biosynthesis can profounfly enhance extracellular electron transfer in bacteria and then improve the efficience of MFC. For example, the increase of riboflavin biosynthesis by Shewanella at the alkaline condition underlies the improvement of the electricity output in MFCs(Fig 2)[11].
Fig 2  Increased riboflavin synthesis underlies enhanced electron transfer in Shewanella.
We draw the conclusion that increased riboflavin synthesis can improve the MFC's production.
So riboflavin became our star. Since it can be expressed in bacteria, we can combine riboflavin and MFC to improve the electricity output of MFC. And it is easy and mature to measure the concentration of rirboflavin in aqueous solution based on the technique of OD (optical density). The peaks of absorbance occur at 223, 266, 373 and 445 nm(Fig 3)[12]. P. Drossler etc. investigated a wide range of pH values from pH -1.1 to pH  13.4 and made the absorption spectrum curve over different pH value(Fig 4)[13].
Fig 3 Absorption spectrum of riboflavin in aqweous solution. And the peaks of absorbance occur around at 223, 266, 373 and 445 nm
Fig 4 Absorption cross-section spectra of riboflavin in aqueous solutions at various values of pH. The riboflavin concentration used in the measurements was around 10-4 mol dm3
In our laboratory, we used the multi-spectral scanner to analyse the optimal absorption wavelength and finally found absorption peak at 444nm is the optimum in pH 1.17. And our optimal absorption wavelength corresponds with previous researches. In order to make pH 1.17, we mixed 2ml 0.1mol/L HCl with 1ml riboflavin aqueous solutions extract from engineering bacteria. Then it is able to detect the concentration of rirboflavin by OD value.
There are many methods to get riboflavin by microorganism. In E.coli"

VP16-CRY2-UAS-miRNA vector was obtained by synthesizing the miRNA precursor sequence and linking it to the UAS sequence of pDh124-VP16-CRY2-UAS vector.
The final pDb124-BD-CIB1 vector with Paromomycin resistance and the pDh124-VP16-CRY2-UAS-miRNA vector with Hygromycin B resistance will be used for the transformation of C.reinhardtii.
3.Transform expression vectors into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
The chlamydomonas reinhardtii we use in our project is CC-849(bought from Chlamydomonas Genetic Center, Duke University，Durham，NC27708 USA). This kind of Chlamydomonas has some defect in cell wall,so we can have a higher transformation efficiency.
We transformed the two expression vectors into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by glass bead method.
First, the pDp124-BD-CIB1 vector was transferred into C. reinhardtii CC-849 by ""glass bead"" method. The green clones were obtained by Paromomycin resistance screening. PCR identification of the transformants, genomic DNA and sequencing of the PCR products yielded real Positive clones. The full - length sequences of GAL4 BD and CIB1 were amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of the transformants as template, and the bands were sequenced.
Next, the pDp124-BD-CIB1-positive strain was re-transformed into the pDh124-VP16-CRY2-UAS-miRNA vector by ""glass bead"" method. The green clones were screened by Hygromycin B resistance, and PCR was carried out again by transforming genomic DNA Identification and sequencing of the PCR products yielded positive clones containing both"

Participants will have the chance to extract banana DNA and also paint with bacteria using bacterial paints we’ve made over the summer for the Summer Camp.
The 2nd event will be held at Neptune Stadium on the 20th of November. This community centre is based in the North side of the city which classifies as a “disadvantaged area”. The presence of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) participating schools shows that due to the socio-economic stance of the area, the education level here is poorer compared to other parts of Cork City. With our stand on basic information on iGEM, synthetic biology and Leishmaniasis in Honduras, we hope to encourage and invoke an interest in synthetic biology among the students and the locals. Our key focus will be on the emphasis of the importance of further education.

The European HQ is based in Cork which is known as the “Carbon Valley” of Synbio. IndieBio is short for Independent Biology, a new way for scientists and entrepreneurs to shape their own destiny and make something that matters. It provides seed funding and mentorship to drive this transition in only three to four months.
At the start of June, the CEO of Spira, Elliot Roth got in contacts with us. He invited us to the lab where he was working, to introduce us to his company. During the visit we learned a lot about how and why Spira as a company came to be. It not only gave us an insight into different ways of how a company might start, but also taught us that if you have an idea anything is possible. All you have to strive for is the desire to make your idea happen.
Spira are making a fast, convenient food in the form of a nutrient shake packed with protein using spirulina, an ancient microalgae grown by the Aztecs. On our first meeting, we also had the chance to look at the process of making Spira, and give feedback with regard to the aesthetics of the product.

Indeed all the teams’ projects have relevance to biomanufacturing and to creating  biologically synthesized useful substances at a commercial scale. Thus, gathering perspectives from people involved in these fields will enable us to better understand our subject as it is complex and controversial. To do so, they created a document where the 5 teams could add their questions, complete others issues and add their opinion. From all these questions, they created a Global Perspective Outreach survey that we shared on our Facebook page. Finally, we were sent the collected data which we used for our Human Practices.

Collaboration with Team Dusseldorf-Köln
Both our teams met at the meet-up organized by Delft team in Delft in The Netherland. We talked together about our projects and realized they had something in common: they both include an optogenetic system. After that we kept being in touch through e-mails and skype sessions.  As our project went on, we had a hard time finding a way to emit the specific wave length we needed. Therefore, we asked Düsselforf-Köhln team for help and asked them how they managed to do it. They generously gave us the schematics for 3D-printing their lightning box so that we could 3D print our lightning system.

Human Practices
Synthetic biology is about more than just slaving away in labs, mixing together tiny amounts of colourless liquids. In particular, our project lends itself well to making an impact on the wider public. Addressing such an important issue as the global energy crisis is a cause worthy of public engagement, which we indeed strived for over the course of the project. It turns out that countless hours spent talking to parents of students at school, writing articles for the school newspaper and presenting talks about our project were not wasted. Mr Zivanic’s Twitter prowess and Jake’s endlessly enthusiastic rambling about our project did not go unnoticed, and by the time Jamboree came around students, teachers and parents alike were engaging with members of our team all the time, asking probing questions about where our money was going as well as raising some of the more serious ethical and moral issues surrounding synthetic biology. Science is meant to be shared with the public and made accessible to everyone, and we believe we have succeeded in this with the human practices side of our project.

Risk Assessment
Our BPV is unlikely to pose any significant health risks to the consumer or other possible users as modified cyanobacteria and E.coli (standard laboratory strains DH5alpha and DH10, ACDP Hazard Group 1) do not pose a threat to humans or other animals or plants. Moreover, our project is likely to have little to no effect on biodiversity since it will be kept independent from local ecosystems. In terms of modifying the bacteria during experiments, appropriate precautions have been taken to minimise any risk. For instance, liquid and solid waste has been autoclaved with 100% expected degree of death, enough to ensure appropriate disposal of waste (autoclaves are examined and validated annually) . Moreover, Virkon disinfectant has been used to deal with any spills in the laboratory. Our genetic modification does not change the infectivity of the microorganisms or allow them to persist in the environment and although the plasmids used in the cloning procedures contain an antibiotic resistance marker that can be used for selection, the antibiotics used are not the same ones used in"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the"

Hi everyone! My name is Jinqi Chen (Kathryn) from RDFZ Grade 12. This is my first experience in International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition, and there is no doubt that I’m pretty excited about it. Here, I’m responsible for designing Wiki page, mathematical modeling, and doing experimental work. I love STEM competitions and research programs, and I have a basic understanding of synthetic biology theoretically and experimentally. My dream is to do engineering as my future career, and right now, I’m taking baby steps towards it. Needless to say, I wish to learn a lot from my teammates. Hard work and flawless cooperation are important for whatever our future majors might be.                     Hope we can win! Hope we gain best from our effort. Hope we all run towards the daybreak frontline!
Daichen Liu
That is Liu Daichen, a 11st student from RDFZ. It is the first year for him to take part in IGEM. He might have a little bit talent of art design and handicrafts. However, he chooses Biology as his lifelong mate. This man still need to learn a lot. He is totally a new entrant and gonna start his nightmare in next couple of months. Hope he can gain something after this competition.

I’m Yishen Shen from S2C3. Last year I worked with seniors in 2017 IGEM RDFZ-China for a few month, where I reinforced my understanding of this field.  Although preserving an inexpressible passion for art, I’ve made up my mind to carry on with Biology, a cute yet tough subject. I’m very flattered to be cooperating with our intelligent teammates and I’m looking forward to contributing more, gaining more in IGEM this year, continuously refining my comprehension in synthetic biology without any regret.
Ruochen Liu
Hello! My name is Ruochen Liu or my English name is Alexei. I am a 10th grader this year and I come from the International Curriculum Center of High School Affliated to Renmin University of China. I am keen on biology and fond to learn new biology information in my spare time. This is my first time in IGEM and I will cherish the process of the competetion and study synthetic biology. Collaboration and communication also will be a main content before and during the competetion, I wish I can contribute to the group as much as I can.

Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.
In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour in the tourist center of the city and ended up having dinner with a picnic in the Parc Guell. A viewpoint that have views of the entire city at night.
During the morning of the last day, to close the meet up, we were able to attend to some enriching expert talks. They offered us their views on synthetic biology and they explained the works in which they are immersed today.
Back to Meet up Index
Organization of a Meet Up: Another European Meet Up
Reason
After attending two meet ups we realized that these meetings are very enriching experiences in preparation for the Giant Jamboree. One of the main reasons for these meet ups is to get to know and know the project of other teams. Other reason is that its also serves to practice the presentations of the project and its results. And finally serve to open the network of contacts beyond the contest itself.
We realized that the events to which more teams come are usually the first ones to be organized, and in these although if they serve to obtain collaborations, do not fulfill so much the function of practicing to present the results of your project due to at the beginning of the summer there are no results.
This year the European meet up was on July 20. Date in which novice teams, without sufficient contacts do not yet know how to deal with these events and do not have the necessary funds to attend. And teams with more experience do not yet have conclusive results. With this context we proposed this ambitious project: Make another European meet up. We invited all the teams of the continent in mid-September. A date that was supposed to be the best for the organization of new teams and with the possibility of simulating the final event.
Event
The event was organized between September 14 and 16. Although this event was given as much publicity as possible and contact was made with all possible teams in Europe, attendance was low due to several factors:
- Spain is geographically at one end of Europe and travel is expensive.
- The teams were short of funds and were saving for the trip to Boston.
- The event was announced at the beginning of September, many teams did not have room to maneuver in their organization to attend.
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
