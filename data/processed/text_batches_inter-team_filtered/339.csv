UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

As most synthetic biologists and iGEM teams work with Escherichia Coli, the use of other model systems can create confusion. We hope to ease the legibility of our project descriptions by creating eukaryopedia, an overview about transcription factors and cell lines we used in our studies, as well as general molecular biology issues that affect our work. We hope it can help you find guidance in the jungle that mammalian molecular biology is at the moment.

The last three bullet points summarizes my approach to iGEM.  I am here to listen to and learn from others.  Although I feel fortunate that my qualifications earned me a place on the team, I hope I can expand beyond my existing skill set; I hope I can grow to be an even greater asset to the team.  On that note, I am somewhat curious about the wetlab work.  Time permitting, I would like to visit the wetlab more often.

At the dry lab meeting today Doug mentioned that I should do the following:
Finish the Sequence View- Doug wants the tool to be deployed to the wetlab and the anderson lab as oon as possible.  Remaining things to do for the Sequence View:
Fix dialog boxes
Write documentation, emphasize why Sequence View is a superior tool
Import ApE features
waiting dialog
Clotho data management
remote vs local connection
Draft proposal about deleting from database
I need to design a primer design tool within a week.  I should plan to talk to the wetlab either tomorrow or on Friday.
Time permitting, I may work on a J5 client that interacts with Spectacles
I also need to find time to implement parts of my proposal for a better Clotho tool.  I've drafted a rough proposal here: Media:New_Clothotool_Specifications.pdf
Swapnil mentioned an interesting invertase puzzle today.  A way to design a sort of sorter.  For a given sort of inputs, this sorter would produce one result.  All other inputs would produce a different defined result.  This is related to prior work done in this paper .  It looks fun.

After the visualization process and after the completion of Round 3, we can say we have a better understanding of probable mishaps that can happen with our design, as estimated by the scientific and clinical community. Moreover, we have a better view of our design's strengths. We made the following observations and took specific actions:
1. Great public concern might be generated due to the use of genetically engineered E. coli, with a more than average level of certainty as indicated by the experts' answers. That's why we created a visual lingua franca to communicate our integrated design to the greater public, independently of the various social groups' interest and educational level.Check out BUILDING A VISUAL LINGUA FRANCA TO REACH OUT TO THE WORLD .
2. There is a strong basis that supports the beneficial nature of RNAi-classifiers to human health applications, like cancer therapeutics. However, we want to further explore this potential, by tackling technical complexities and creating pANDORRA, an open-source toolkit with basic Parts to build various multi-layered cell-type classifiers .
3. We noticed that there is a blurred line regarding the applicability of anticancer E. coli, however there seems to be a group consensus regarding their health and environmental risks. To tackle this widely spread issue we put great care into developing a therapeutic approach with serial fail-safes. Moreover, the last fail-safe, the inclusion of the cancer selective toxin named Apoptin was added after discussing with Prof. JD Keasling about the therapeutic efficacy of complex engineered circuits. Check our system here .
In this journey, we also had the chance to have in-depth discussions with other various experts, who kindly provided us with technical feedback which we developed in different iterations of our project.

In order to create a modular system that can be compatible with various assembly platforms, we've contacted Stamatis who has extensive experience on the expansion of current tools for chassis and circuit engineering. He was extremely helpful and eager to collaborate with us. We had an exciting back-and-forth interaction where he argued about the compartmentalization of the building blocks of circuits in synthetic biology, even in complex systems like mammalian cells."

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," BalticServers)
The iGEM team Groningen 2016 thinks it is about time to develop     a safe and novel data transmission system. Especially as scientists     we are in the urgent need of that. As our team consists of     biologists as well as computer scientists we developed a     multidisciplinary approach. Safe encryption of digital data,     conversion into a DNA sequence and integration into a bacterial     genome: This approach provides a system with multiple digital and     biological safety layers. DNA is an infinite resource and in a     spore it is safe from environmental influences.
Storage of data in DNA has been proposed as early as the 1960’s,     but has only recently become a hot topic [7] . This is in part due     to the ever-growing demand for data storage, as well as     advancements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. Our goal     is to create a system for long-term data storage and data transfer     which cannot be hacked by digital means. Digital methods of     encrypting information and converting it into binary code are well     established, and data storage in DNA has already been demonstrated.     Our project combines these two approaches by first converting     information into binary code, encrypting it, and then storing it     safely in DNA.  Additional measures based on molecular biology will     prevent unauthorized access, ensuring the safety of the stored     information.
Our system will be useful for the kind of information that     should be stored and transferred in a very secure manner, but does     not have to be accessed within seconds. It will be possible to     obtain the message in about 24-48 hours; however, this timeframe is     likely to be reduced as new sequencing technologies are developed.
DNA is a far more stable data storage medium compared to     magnetic and optical media, remaining intact for at least 700,000     years at -4 °C [8] . Even in harsh environments, DNA has a half-life     of over 500 years [9] . In contrast, current storage technology is rated to    last only up to 30 years [10] . Given the stability and compactness     of DNA, our system could also be adapted to serve as a time capsule     for human knowledge. Additionally, DNA storage will soon become a     cheaper alternative for data storage as DNA synthesis and     sequencing costs drop. It is estimated to become a cost-effective     method for long-term data storage within approximately ten years [11] .

Our goal is to use the tools of synthetic biology to make a biological machine capable of antibody discovery. To do this, we have decided to learn from our own immune system by porting its own antibody discovery strategies into an engineered strain of yeast. This yeast will be capable of screening a library of antibodies against a target antigen, recombining the antibody gene in vivo and then either secreting or surface displaying the resulting antibody protein for a variety of purposes.  Our hope is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the yeast cell not only as a vessel for antibody discovery but as a streamlined processing unit that can discover and also begin production of new antibodies - all in one test tube!
Project Details
Our plan for this year's competition is to construct an easy-to-use yeast strain capable of intracellular antibody discovery. The current dominant mode of microbial antibody discovery requires cellular surface display and high-throughput fluorescent screening.  Instead of using this method, we wanted our cells to be able to sense if the antibody they are translating will bind the target antigen.
Using a modified form of the yeast two-hybrid screening system, the yeast cells are able to sense the amount of antibody::antigen interaction inside the cell.  When the antibody binds the target antigen it anchors the VP16 transcriptional activator near our response system. VP16 then increases the level of transcription of a reporter gene. If this gene encodes a nutritional marker, such as Ura3, only cells experiencing antibody:antigen interactions can be selected using selective media. Using this method the original population of our yeast strain will be able to, in essence, screen itself and our resulting yeast population will contain only antibodies that bind our antigen.
In a research setting, once you have discovered the antibody you wish to use you must then reclone the gene for it into a secretion vector for production of pure antibody protein. This involves taking the plasmid out of the yeast cell, excising the antibody gene, ligating it into the second vector and then transforming it back into a suitable yeast strain.
To make this process faster and more easily accomplished, we have incorporated a recombination-based architecture into our system that will allow the cells to modify the antibody plasmid in vivo. Using this system transcription of"

We asked the lab of Dr. Heino Büntemeyer if we could use their HPLC detector to verify riboflavin concentrations. We prepared some samples and overviewed the measurement. The HPLC-method itself was friendly carried out by Jana Heinrich. It yielded significant results and allows the quantification of riboflavins in our samples.
Table 2: HPLC measurement results for riboflavin concentrations in supernatant (sn) and cell disruption (cd) samples after 72 hours and 12 hours of cultivation respectively.
Table 2 shows the produced amount of Riboflavin. After 72 hours of cultivation in M9-D5 the concentration of riboflavin in supernatant and cell disruption samples of E. coli KRX+<bbpart>BBa_K1172306</bbpart> was 60fold higher than in E. coli KRX wild type. Even after 12 hours, the riboflavin producing strain had generated ten times as much riboflavin as the wild type.
Figure 5: Results of the HPLC measurement shown as graph. For better clarity only one supernatant sample per strain and cultivation time is shown.
Figure 6: Results of the HPLC measurement shown as graph. Figure 6 was centered on the riboflavin peak for a better view.
The wrong M9 medium had been the reason for unsufficient riboflavin production. This fact rendered our first (LC/MS) measurement innocuous. We were able to organize another measurement of some of our samples with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) . We prepared supernatant samples of a wild type KRX after 72 h, the <bbpart>BBa_K1172306</bbpart> strain after 36 h and 72 h in M9-D5 and after 72 h in a wrong M9. In the following we put the samples in the LC-MS-system. The measurement procedure was carried out by Lena Sinkel.
Figure 7: LC/MS results presented as list depiction.
Figure 8: LC/MS results presented as overlay depiction.
It is clear, that the <bbpart>BBa_K1172306</bbpart> carrying strains produce a much higher amount of riboflavin compared to the wild type KRX strain. The LC/MS results do not allow for a statement on how much more riboflavin our strain produces, because from this method we can´t know if the relation between the amount of vitamin"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Prediction of Signal Peptides
Figure 1: Prediction and analysis of signal peptides
Introduction
A first analysis was performed to identify signal-peptides, which are bound by the cellular signal recognition particle and lead to the translocation of the bound polypeptide into the endoplasmic reticulum. Afterwards the signal peptide is cleaved by a signal peptide peptidase at a specific site. The analysis for signal peptides was done by using the SignalP 4.1 Server .
Results
The program was run for different receptors and will be illustrated for the three examples mentioned above (see fig. 1).
The figure shows the N-terminal sequence of the receptors, together with three scores:
(1) The C-Score (raw cleavage site score) in red.
(2) The S-Score (signal peptide score) in green.
(3) The Y-Score (combined cleavage site score) in blue.
The C-Score shows the most probable cleavage site identified by the peptidase. It was possible to identify the most probable cleavage site for all shown receptors with ambiguous cleavage sites for the SERK-receptor. The amino acid with the highest C-score is predicted to be the first amino acid of the primary structure of the cleaved receptor.
The S-Score was developed to identify amino acid sequences which appear in a signal peptide and others that belong to the matured receptor. The course of this parameter is high for the first 23-28 amino acids of all receptors, identifying these residues as signal peptides. The amino acid residue, which lies at the greatest decrease of the S-Score, is the predicted border between the N-terminal signal peptide and the receptor.
The Y-Score results from the geometrical structure of the protein and the previously determined scoring parameters. It illustrates that the two first parameters show a good fit for the identification of the signal peptide in all three indicated receptors.
Discussion
Summarizing these parameters, it can be concluded that all three pictured receptors seem to contain a sequence acting as a signal peptide. For many of the predicted receptors in the genome of Physcomitrella patens the prediction did not yield a positive result. With respect to the signal"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If"
DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project improving araBAD_-_-_TEXT.html," available on campus. Indeed, this highly parallel micro fermentor allows testing 24 colonies at a time with minimal human interference. As a consequence, we sought for an existing PBAD regulated GFP or RFP within the registry as their activity can be measured by our machine. We turned to BBa_I746908 created by the Cambridge team in 2008.  A rapid look through the sequence of BBa_I746908identified two unique restriction sites that could be used to levitate the existing wild-type promoter and replace it by engineered variants, BamHI, located immediately upstream of the -35 box and KpnI, within the GFP gene.  A PCR primer (SRS57) was designed to anneal downstream of the KpnI and amplify the 3' end of GFP in conjunction with 5 different primers designed to overlap the arabinose promoter and introduce defined changes in the -10 and/or -35 box (SRS56-1, -2, -3, -4) while SRS56-SPL created a bank of promoters with highly variable spacer sequences (see Figure 1). SRS56 also features a BglII site in place of the natural BamHI site so that proper mutants could be easily screened out after ligation and transformation.
Detailed description of the experiments, including information on primers used, can be found in notebook .
Figure 1 Overview of the changes introduced in the original arabinose promoter. For primers 1-4 the capital letter indicates which nucleotides has been mutated. For the SPL, capital N indicates the randomized nucleotides. BamHI restriction site, -35 and -10 sites are marked.
Figure 2 The arabinose promoter was improved both by rationally changing the -10 and the -35 part of the promoter, and randomly by generating an SPL from the wild-type promoter.
Results
As seen on the accompanying figure, SRS56-1 aimed at bringing the -10 box to consensus (TACTGT-->TATAAT), -2 brought the -35 box to consensus (CTGACG-->TTGACA), while -3 and -4 modified both -35 and -10 boxes in order to bring them closer to consensus. Several correct clones were found for each rationally modified PBAD and roughly analysed in a fluorometer. They all displayed similar fluorescence levels induced or not and only 1 of each type was kept for further analysis in the biolector in order to make room for as many PBAD-SPL clones as possible. After verification of BamHI resistance, 18 randomly chosen clones from the SPL were"

To demonstrate that our test would be cost effective as part of a screening programme we built this cost effectiveness model. To do this it combines cancer prevelance data, the sensitivity and specificity values of our test, our cost analysis data and treament cost data.
We used Tammemägi et al.’s model to calculate the probability of someone getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. It is more sensitive than the simplistic criteria used by the National Lung Screening Trial, and thus a better way of selecting individuals for screening. Tammemägi et al. showed their model would be more cost effective method as more cancers were detected per number screened as it missed fewer cases of cancer. [16]
Although Tammemägi’s model was for lung cancer as a whole, we assume the risk factors put you at equal risk of non-small cell and small-cell lung cancer. As the miRNAs on which our test  is based do not indicate small cell lung cancer, we have built the model around NSCLC. All other figures are NSCLC specific.
A quality adjusted life year (QALY) represents one year in perfect health. The ‘quality adjusted’ part accounts for the quality of life for that year, for example 2 years with a 0.6 quality of life score would be 1.2 QALYs. QALYs can be used to measure the benefit a treatment provides (if any). Treatments costing less than £20,000 per QALY are deemed cost effective by NICE. Treaments between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY may be decided to be cost effective by NICE if there is a high degree of certainty in the cost per QALY or when there are substantial benefits not captured in the cost per QALY figure.

Problem:How can we quantify promoter activity?
When characterising promoters today it is done by proxy of protein, this can result in unwanted variations caused by translation and folding efficiency or excess cellular stress. Another important issue is the lack of a standard for measurements of fluorescence as most characterisations are done using fluorescent proteins such as GFP. As a result, most characterisations are done in relative units making it complicated or impossible to compare measurements between labs, strains and growth conditions. READ MORE (LINK to background)
Solution:Spinach RNA allows us to measure RNA concentration using fluorometry
The Spinach RNA is an aptamer, which can bind to DFHBI to create a fluorophore that resembles GFP in spectral properties. This provides a way to easily quantify RNA concentration and allows promoter activities to be calculated in units Polymerases Per Second. (Modelling link). The possibility of measuring promoter activity in absolute terms will enable researchers to share and compare results obtained in different labs, and better characterise the function of promoters. READ MORE (LINK to experimental design)
Results:We have developed a method that can be used to measure absolute promoter activity
Using RNA transcribed in vitro we created a standard series which can be used to determine the concentration of Spinach given a fluorescence intensity. We also designed an experiment to determine the degradation rate of the Spinach RNA in vivo. Combining these two experiments with the growth rate and fluorescence of a Spinach-expressing culture it is possible to determine the promoter activity using. READ MORE (LINK to results)

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Human Practices Video Project
In order to provide a better view of synthetic biology from a less lab-based, and more of a thought-based approach, we talked to Professor Laurie Zoloth in the Northwestern Department of Bioethics. We gained some helpful insight on synthetic biology, and would like to share the experience with our visitors.
This project is part of a collaboration project with various other iGEM teams to create a bank of video topics on synthetic biology.
Below is a documentary of sorts. The format follows readable text and an interview with Professor Zoloth. Text is added to communicate what questions Professor Zoloth is addressing and what the iGEM team took from her statements on synthetic biology.
The iGEM team interviewed Professor Zoloth about what synthetic biology means at a higher level than just the application. Professor Zoloth has been on many governmental, educational, and other panels that have dealt with the issue of bioethics and synthetic biology before. Here's how she defines synthetic biology.
Synthetic biology is a revolutionary new field. Work on establishing the basis for this type of research is only just recently been completed. New, innovative, and powerful things are moving at breakneck speed in this field. With all of this progress, what should worry people about synthetic biology?
If science is able to focus and create these norms within the practice, what challenges face synthetic biology? Who decides these norms and its focus?
How science is done is meant to be questioned. Peer review is a large part of this; however, that system is not perfect. A strong norm of truthfulness and teamwork should run deep within the scientific community to be completely honest and truthful with their research. In order to ingrain such a powerful message into future scientists, it must be instilled at a very early age. This is one aspect of iGEM. The positive qualities Professor Zoloth looks for in good scientists can be thought of as instilled by the iGEM competition. As a team, iGEM members go through a rigorous research project that makes them rely on each other and produce the most honest portrayal of their work at the various jamborees.
Because the products of synthetic biology have a marketability, science"

Finally, we are taking measures to get LearnSynBio incorporated into actual classrooms: We have established a          collaboration with the high school team Broad Run iGEM (see Collaborations page) to incorporate our modules into          their advanced science classes and after-school science clubs. Additionally, we are working with some of our former          high school teachers to introduce LearnSynBio to VAST, the Virginia Association of Science Teachers, for incorporation          in classrooms all around the state. Lastly, it is our hope that the presentation of LearnSynBio at the Jamboree          will encourage the spread of LearnSynBio to schools all around the world!
BwB
In addition to LearnSynBio, we also completed several public outreach events. We were awarded a grant from Building            with Biology  to host public outreach events over the course of the iGEM 2016 season.
We held a science workshop          targeted at at local children and their parents which allowed them to get some hands-on experience with the exciting          world of modern biology. We had more than 70 people in attendance and together we extracted DNA from strawberries,          learned about synthetic biology and the benefit of standard biological parts, and discussed our questions and concerns          with GMO food.
We also held a forum on the topic of Genome Editing targeted at the general public. At the forum, we briefly discussed          the implications of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool and explored various ways that it could be applied to real          world problems. Among the topics discussed were: stabilizing the Honeybee population by increasing expression of          ‘hygiene’ genes, engineering yeast for efficient biofuel production, and using CRISPR to decrease human susceptibility          to HIV infection. We had over 30 participants for the forum and we received great feedback from our attendees!

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#project Fine-regulation circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html," kind of recombinase found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It can recognize the FRT sign site. Flp and FRT form the Flp-FRT system. The function of Flp-FRT system is the same as Cre-LoxP system’s. FRT site has the similar structure with LoxP site (Fig.9) [35].
Fig.9 The sequence of FRT site
Cre-LoxP system and Flp-FRT system can be used in Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) [36][37], so we use the principle of RMCE and design the first kind of our fine-regulation circuits (Fig.10).
Fig.10 The gene circuit of Cre/Flp-mediated recombinase circuits
In fermentation process, the environment usually turn acidic, so we produce alkaline substance(γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) [38] in the primary state. And alkali-induced promoter P-atp2 and acid-induced promoter P-asr are employed to produce the recombinase Cre and Flp respectively. When the pH of environment reaches the P-atp2’s responsive range, Cre would express and recognize the LoxP sites at both sides of strong constitutive promoter J23119 and it would be inverted. Therefore the bacteria stop to produce lactate[39]. Similarly, when the pH of environment reaches the P-asr’s responsive range, J23119 would be inverted again. The bacteria will produce GABA again. Through the combination of multiple LoxP sites and FTR sites, we can realize multi-regulation and fine-regulation function.
To prevent gene from wrong inverting, we designed two kinds of sRNA to inhibit Cre and Flp’s function respectively. When one of recombinases expresses, the sRNA for the other recombinase will be produced at the same time. The sRNA would inhibit the translation of the other recombinase and we can avoid the wrong inversion. sRNA consists of two parts, the scaffold structure MicC and a target-binding sequence. Target-binding sequence, an anti-sequence about 15~20 bp, can inhibit the translation through binding with mRNA [40][41].
These circuits is used when the functional acid and the alkali are both medium.

The Bxb1 integrase is a DNA recombinase, more precisely a member of serine recombinase family. Bxb1 could be divided to two parts, gp35 and gp47. The gp35 part could recognize specific sequences, called attB"

Here we had the opportunity to introduce for the first time synthetic biology to local beekeepers and important members of government associations. We made some posters to explain attendees this science branch, from which a lot of people got interested and got close to try to learn more about it.
We discovered we woke up people's curiosity and decided to open their panorama by giving an example of synthetic biology application in bees so we presented our project. Thanks to this, everyone understood this new scientific approach and could give us their feedback. The public shared their opinions and their concerns about synthetic biology, but more than that, we solved peoples confusions and established conversation to spark new minds into synthetic biology.
“With synthetic biology, are you going to genetically modify the bees or the larvae?” this was the question that was asked the most. We noticed that beekeepers were really concerned about this method, which gave us a chance to explain detail by detail the difference between genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
We were able to impact positively more than 300 hundred people including beekeepers, concerned citizens, and respected government authorities. Also, we could inspire beekeepers to try biotechnological products on their apiaries after getting well informed on how they would work in their beehives.
We know not everything stays in the lab or just in words for theoretical explanations, that's why we decided to make some field work. On the last day of the forum, beekeepers invited us to attended to different local apiaries, where we learned everything bees had to teach us and received great knowledge every beekeeper shared with us.

Project-Specific Safety Concerns
Working with electrical equipment can be dangerous if not used properly. We aim to educate users on safety within the lab.
It is essential to ensure that devices are plugged in and not exposed to liquid, especially since liquid cultures are vital to the setup. Improper use of the device may be fatal.
Broken glass may also harm the user if the setup were knocked over. It will be necessary to place the setup away from potentially hazardous objects on a flat and dry surface. In the case that broken glass surrounds the lab, proper disposal procedures should be taken.
Dealing with hazardous waste such as yeast and synthetic media exposes the scientist to harmful or possibly fatal wastes. While Violacein has not fully been investigated, it is declared non hazardous according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. (""Violacein 548-54-9 MSDS, Safety Technical Specifications _ MSDS"").
General Safety in Our Lab
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
Our project is BioSafety Level 1. We work with common lab strains of yeast and E. coli, which are kept in closed containers and always handled with gloves. Closed-toe shoes are required in our lab. We autoclave all biohazard waste. When running gel electrophoresis, we use Sybr Safe, which is a mutagen. To minimize exposure, we wear gloves and work in a contained space (fume hood) and use equipment that is not used for other experiments. Chloroform is occasionally used in a hood to contain fumes.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
If developed into a commercial product, engineered yeast could be released into the environment, with unknown consequences. Although we expect that our"

Team
We are the first iGEM team from the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg. The participation was initiated by three students of the Master's program Cell and Molecular Biology: Adrian, Filip and Sabrina. Fascinated by the idea, five additional students joined the team. Following their lead, the instructors Prof. Uwe Sonnewald and PhD student Marlene Pröschel of the Division of Biochemistry (Department of Biology) were convinced to support us. Early during our planning process we decided to use the model organism of S. cerevisiae, which brought us together with Prof. Christian Koch of the Division of Biochemistry.
Who are we?
PI
Prof. Uwe Sonnewald
Professor Dr. Uwe Sonnewald is the head of the Division of Biochemistry. He turned out to be the first person to support our iGEM vision. Giving us our lab spaces and getting the Department of Biology behind our project was an enormous help to us. Regularly, he checks up on us to ask if everything is going all right. In addition, he helped us with lab materials and financially. Through Professor Sonnewald we had the chance to work with Marlene Pröschel, who was a huge help in the lab. At the moment his main research is concentrated at the Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology group. These groups investigate the regulation of the primary metabolism of plants and try to improve biotechnological approaches of crops.

Before starting the growth curves in the patch, soak the 3D printed models in 70% ethanol overnight
Tuesday, August 9th
Tiffany started the overnight cultures for the growth curves in the falcon tubes
Nelly and David made patch prototypes today. The procedures are as follows:
Materials:
Strips of release liner ( 5cm x 13.2 cm )
Strips of EVA membrane ( 5cm x 13.2 cm )
Square cut outs of backing layer
BIO PSA adhesive
Cylindrical metal bar
Masking tape
Scissors, marker, ruler
Flat plastic surface
Iron
Syringe + needle
Procedures:
Preparation of the adhesive layer
Have the materials ready. Perform the process under the fume hood as the adhesives contain heptane. Heptane is flammable and create vapor trails that may cause fire.
Note that the coated side of the liner is where the adhesive will be applied. In case you cannot figure which one is the right side, grab a marker and try to write on both sides of the liner. If the ink stayed permanently on the liner, you wrote on the uncoated side. The side where the ink just slipped through would be the coated side. It would be recommended to write which side is which to avoid confusion.
Draw a horizontal line on one end of the release liners (1cm from the end) with a marker. This end will be taped to keep the liner in place when the adhesive is being applied.
Draw three 3cm x 3cm squares on the release liners. Make sure to leave ample amount of space between the squares. Draw 1cm x 1cm squares inside the initial squares.
Take all the materials under the fume hood. Tape the end release liner on the flat plastic surface.
Apply the adhesive on the line initially drawn. Apply a constant pea-size amount on the line.
Using the metal bar, spread the adhesive onto the liner. Spreading using a metal bar will form a thin film of adhesive on the liner.
Wait for about a minute before placing the EVA on the layer.
Carefully place the EVA membrane strip on the adhesive layer.
Lightly tap the membrane to stick.
Wait for the adhesive to completely dry (1 hr - 3 hrs).
Cut out the squares.
B. Heat sealing the patch
Set the iron to the heat sealing temperature that was previously determined.
Place the backing layer on the prepared adhesive-membrane layer.
Carefully iron the sides of the layer. Avoid ironing parts of the 1"

Although, this does not characterize the biobricks, it shows that the RBS is exposed and GFP is expressed. In a positive scenario, this might indicate that the lack of repressor allows the expression of the keys, which interaction with the lock release the RBS and hence allows the expression of the protein downstream the RBS
On the other hand, the construction of a LacI generator K175028 with constitutive promoter was designed in order to assembled together with the biobricks and test them. However, due to the lack of time the attempts to construct this part were unsuccessful. It remains as the most promising solution that should be tested further.

Figure 8. Western Blot PVDF membrane showing our recombinant protein had a                       functional His tag that could be detected in immunological assays.
We feel very pleased about what we achieved during this experimental                       part because we were able to characterize two new and different signal                       peptides that will be useful not only for us, but for everyone else who wishes to                       perform secretion-related experiments and projects using E. coli. We did not                       just contribute with these new parts, but made and tested a whole experimental                       design with both positive and negative controls that made our results more                       valid. Moreover, we incorporated in our designs the possibility of using                       different purification and detection methods such as affinity chromatography                       or Western Blot by the use of histidine tags. However, we are aware that                       further studies need to be carried out to now test the efficiency of this                       proposed secretion mechanism.
Plan A and Plan B optimized for E. coli
In order for Lactobachill to help with the treatment and prevention of both                       depression and anxiety, it needs to block the IL-6 trans pathway. As stated                       before, to do this we propose two different strategies. The first one consists on                       the secretion of the IL-6 soluble signal transducer, sgp130, which will bind to                       the IL-6-soluble receptor complex and prevent it from attaching to the cell                       membrane; thus stopping this unspecific inflammation pathway. The genetic                       design that will enable Lactobachill to synthesize this molecule is found in                       Figure 9. Again, we decided to test this strategy first using our model organism                       E. coli, so this construct is optimized for it.
Figure 9. Plan A genetic construct optimized for E. coli. First we find the PBAD                       constitutive promoter that enables the translation and transduction of the NsrR                       repressor protein that will attach to the PyeaR promoter and modulate its                       expression. Next to the NsrR gene we find the iLOV reporter that will be                       synthesized at the same time as the repressor and will help us keep track of its                       expression. After the terminator we find the inducible pyeaR promoter that                       starts the expression of the soluble signal transducer. Attached to sgp130 we                       find the NSP4 secretion peptide as well as another reporter protein: mCherry.
The genetic design for plan A was successfully synthesized and cloned                       into the pSB1C3 plasmid, which later was inserted into E. coli. To test this, a                       PCR for the"

Feature of the level: There is enemy which can move around in the scene, and if players touch it, the game will come to an end. The background of this level is a city with many factories. The platforms for jumping become invisible, and player can jump on the ground or roofs freely to collect genetic fragments, making people get the feeling for trying hard to seek solutions of scientific problems. The environment about factories and pollutions are related to the problem we want to solve in this level ——detect Aromatic substance, which is an environmental pollutants

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the test to high risk individuals for whom the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of their cancer could lead to an increase in the rate of survival: in the case of NSCLC, this could be carried out by offering the test to those with a certain smoking history. To determine which individuals had a sufficiently high risk of developing NSCLC, for our sensor to be cost effective, we have designed a cost model - take a look below.
He also proposed that if the concept of our test were to be proven and a variety of miRNAs could be detected as biomarkers for a range of cancers, then our test could be used as a screening tool for anyone over a certain age, due to the increase in cancer prevalence with age. His comments led us to research the required criteria below for our sensor to be used as a screening tool. His advice on the high sensitivity and specificity required fed into our need to create a second series of switches.
Dr Sujal Desai
We discussed the use of our sensor for high risk population screening with Dr Desai, a consultant chest radiologist. He informed us that lung cancer rarely presents before age 40, and to maximize the test’s value it should be offered to those aged 55 and above, with a smoking history - so that we would not waste money offering the test to too many people who were very unlikely to have cancer.
To integrate their advice, we worked with our our modeling team to work out who would we should screen. Tammegami et al.’s probability score is the probability of an individual getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. [2]
Using our model which combined this with the data for our project and standard NSCLC treatment, we worked out for what probabilities it would be cost effective for us to screen. The model showed that our tool could be cost effective at cost per QALY - saving lives and saving the NHS money. It shows that even if our sensitivity was lower than we expect, our sensor would be extremely cost effective.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#pages#Testtext_-_-_TEXT.html,", a method for the generation of randomized promoter libraries
File:HD09 rapcr.jpg
Figure 1: The method of RA-PCR. The combination of oligos added to the PCR reaction determines the specificity and strengths of the synthesized promoters. If knowing the response elements for the transcription factors of a pathway, any promoter can be assembled by this method.
We have developed a standard method (termed ""Random Assembly PCR / RA-PCR"") for the construction of randomized promoter libraries. We modified Assembly PCR [12] to create promoters with randomized spacing and frequency of Transcription Factor Binding Sites. It relies on using different oligos containing a transcription factor binding site (or random DNA) plus two annealing sequences (see Fig. 1 for a comprehensive explanation of the method).  We use two sets of oligos, one for the top strand, one for the bottom strand. The oligos for each strand have the same annealing sequences (which are complementary to the annealing sequences of the other strand). If these oligos are pooled, they will randomly anneal to each other, thus generating randomized repeats of the transcription factor binding sites of interest at varying spacing. In order to be able to clone the construct, we also add two stop oligos (termed stop 5' and top 3') which contain only one annealing sequence, plus a cutsite (SpeI 5', HindIII 3'). Double-stranded DNA is created by running a seven-cycle PCR, and amplified by a  25-cycle PCR. Then, the resulting (proximal) promoter is cloned 5' of a core promoter (we used the core promoter of JeT [10] ) by inserting it into pSMB_MEASURE ( Part:BBa_K203100 ), the promoter measurement plasmid we developed (from there, it can be excised like any standard biological part in a submission plasmid). Thus, a mixture of different promoters in the same plasmid backbone is generated. These can then be transformed into bacteria. Each colony represents a single putative promoter, which can be transfected into mammalian cell. 24 hours after transfection cells are exposed to the conditions of interest and control conditions, serving as a reference. Promoters active under the desired conditions, but not under control conditions, are selected for further characterization.

The parts have been validated by sequencing and demonstrated to be expressed and bind to the fluorophore DFHBI-1T in E. coli. These two parts                   are registered as BBa_K1330000 and BBa_K1330001 and they are listed at our parts wiki page.
Furthermore we intended to streamline the Anderson promoter library by                       transforming promoters formerly present in plasmid J61002 into the iGEM standard                  backbone pSB1C3. This includes the promoters J23105, J23110, J23112 and J23116, now registered as BBa_K1330002 , BBa_K1330003 , BBa_K1330004 and BBa_K1330005 respectively.                  This will be a great advantage for future iGEM teams working with the Anderson promoter Library.
Silver Medal Requirements
In addition to the bronze medal requirements the requirements for silver medal have been achieved as stated below.
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part works as expected:
The Spinach2 fragments has been transformed into E. coli. Original Spinach2 and Spinach2.1 containing two point mutations to remove an internal SpeI                   restriction site, have been demonstrated to fluoresce at equal levels. Spinach2.1 can be applied in our developed method for measuring promoter activity. The parts                 have been demonstrated to fluoresce only after addition of the fluorophore DFHBI-1T. Furthermore the fluorophore was proved not to cause significant fluorescence signal without the spinach. See our experimental results for more information. This validates that the novel BioBrick works as we expected, and thereby we have opened up for our new new method for measurement of absolute promoter activities                     with the Spinach technology.

Face to face interaction with doctors and patients at Peking University First Hospital
We paid a visit to Peking University First Hospital in Beijing and discussed with the doctors and patients.
“Diabetes Mellitus has become the main concern of public health in China in the past 30 years, especially the type II Diabetes Mellitus.”said by Doctor Wang of the Endocrinology Department. There are various causes for the increasingly high morbidity: high-fat diet, reduction in physical output, high pressure and environmental pollution. However, Dr. Wang holds a positive attitude towards the treatment for this common disease and highly supports the development of potential gene therapy, which may bring evolutionary changes.
In the hospital, there are posters for regularly held lectures about diabetes, which help to build a community between patients and specialists. Also, there are free devices like self-service rapid glucometer that make it convenient for the patients to monitor their condition.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

The ability of the system to stably express the target gene was further judged. In practice, the GFP gene can be replaced with any target gene to produce the desired product. In the control group, the plasmid we transferred contained only the lactose operon, GFP and ampicillin resistance genes. By comparing the single cell fluorescence  ii.values of the experimental and control groups under the same conditions, we can analyze the effect of the T7 final part. In order to prove that our system can prevent the non-expression of the target gene and the loss of the plasmid due to unstable plasmid structure without antibiotics, we set the control conditions for adding antibiotics (ampic acid) and no antibiotics. On the other hand, since the plasmid backbone we use contains the lactose operon region, the lactose operon may affect the expression of GFP to some extent. So we set the control conditions for IPTG induction and no IPTG. The two control conditions of the group were combined to form four different culture conditions: no IPTG without ampicillin, IPTG without ampicillin, no IPTG with ampicillin, and IPTG with ampicillin. We simultaneously cultured the E. coli of the experimental group and the control group under these four conditions, and measured the fluorescence intensity and OD value every hour.
Specifically, we transferred the two plasmids to the strain containing no T7 RNA Polymerase, and picked the monoclonal in 20 mL of LB liquid medium supplemented with ampicillin, and cultured at 37 °C at 200 rpm overnight. When the OD600 reaches about 3, the bacterial solution is inoculated into the new ampicillin-resistant LB liquid medium and the LB medium without ampicillin according to the final OD600=0.1, and cultured at 37 °C at 200 rpm until the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 in the range of 0.5~1.0, it takes about 1~2 hours). At this time, part of the culture solution was added IPTG to 1.5 mM , and the other was not added, so that both the experimental group and the control group contained the above four different culture conditions. This time was recorded as time 0, and the bacterial liquid in each bottle was quickly taken in 96 hole plate. In the plate, each bottle added"

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," discovered during the summer that the team from METU High School in Ankara was working on the same subject as us, the fight against Varroa destructor. We had a Skype conversation with them about the way we could help each other out.
Skype conversation with the Ankara team. Even if the connection was poor, we exchanged a lot of ideas and the discussion was fruitful.
Based on their idea we decided to create a survey to be launched in Turkey and France in order to have a better idea of the extent of beehives’ infestation by varroas. The results of this survey are presented below.
From France
We wish to underline the fact that in France there are few professional beekeepers, most of them are amateurs and own only a few hives. Thus there is no unity between these beekeepers, nor any syndicate. Hence the beekeepers that answered our survey were already interested in our project and aware of the problem caused by Varroa. We would like to kindly thank them for their participation and their help:
Matthieu Bourgeois,  Michel Rives, François Sénéchal, Daniel Goubert, Lauras, Sébastien Bernard, Henri Martin, Marie Nadau, Michel Muller, Charlotte Bompard, Bruno Frémont, Gérard Corvée, Jean Rouquet.
As said previously, all beekeepers having answered the survey know about varroa and other ailments of the bees, such as American/European foulbrood,  varroosis (caused by varroa), mycosis, chronic paralysis, nosema, sacced or chalk brood, deformed wings virus, colony collapse syndrome, acariosis or other dangers like the Asian hornet (a predator), pesticides or mold.
Impacts of Varroa’s presence:
Varroa itself acts both as a parasite feeding itself of the bee’s hemolymph, which weakens it, but also as a vector of pathogens like viruses that spread in an already weakened colony.  A beehive’s infestation by varroa is visible through:
The presence of bees with deformed or atrophied wings
The decrease of honey yield
The weakening of the colony
In the most serious cases, the death of the queen and total loss of the colony
Beekeepers observed an exponential growth of varroa population in the colonies during summer. Infestation stays at a bearable level during the summer, and it increases tremendously at the end of it, leading to the death of the colonies during fall or winter.
Needless to say, this infestation has"

He loved it so much that he sometimes SLAMMED the cover to make sure it’s closed, then Raul would be jealous and said ""DON’T SLAM THE CENTRIFUGE!"" *Hmm... I wonder why the centrifuge got replaced* Alfie also liked the newly replaced centrifuge. He put smaller tubes than required- maybe thinking the big tubes were too heavy for the centrifuge, but he had to take care of the mess of broken tubes and split DNA inside the centrifuge. Lastly, he worked as a great team manager, and helped out the whole team by transferring to many different teams.

Swirl smoothly each plate to distribute the media over the entire plate.
Once plate has been covered with media, set the plate off to side and repeat the procedure with a new plate until all plates contain media. It is important to work as efficiently as possible to pour the LB agar media into the petri dishes before the media solidifies in the bottle.
Allow time for the plates to solidify.
Once the plates are dry, place the lids back on and stack the plates with the lids facing upwards.
Place the plates in the original bag with the agar side upwards.
Tightly secure the opening of the bag with tape, and label the bag with the date, the type of media and the antibiotic added.
Store the plates at room temperature.
Autoclave
Seal the lid of the media bottle with autoclave tape.
Place in the autoclave, following the instructions/standards of your lab and autoclave.
Check if the diagonal lines on the autoclave tape turned black before using.
Inoculation of Growing Cultures in Liquid Media
Spray working surface with 10% bleach.
Add the required volume of antibiotic in proportion to the volume of Lysogeny Broth (LB).
For kanamycin, 1 μL of 1000x kanamycin stock solution is added for every 1 mL of LB.
For chloramphenicol, 100 μL of 1000x chloramphenicol stock solution is pipetted for every 100 mL of LB.
Pipette 5 mL of antibiotic-treated LB into every culture tube or flask.
Open the petri dish and using the needle end of the inoculation loop, scrape the desired colony from the plate.
Close the petri dish and vigorously mix the colony into the appropriate tube or flask. Dispose of the loop into the biohazard waste bag.
Place the tubes or flasks at an angle in the shaker and incubate at 37°C overnight.
Plating E. coli Cultures on Agar Plates
Spray working surface with 10% bleach.
Pipette 200 μL of culture to the appropriate antibiotic-treated Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar plate.
Use a bacterial cell spreader to gently spread the culture on the plate. Be careful not to press onto the plate.

Listeriolysin
Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a pore-forming toxin that is commonly produced by Listeria Monocytogenes the pathogen responsible for listeriosis. When Listera becomes engulfed by a phagosome in a host cell, LLO is thiol-activated and proceeds to produce holes in the phagosome. Once the phagosome has been lysed the cells are free to inhabit the cytoplasm where LLO's effect is reduced due to its lower concentration and the higher pH of the cytosolic environment. By incorporating both Invasin and LLO into the pHlow plasmid we hope to optimise the invasion process.
Crystal structure of listeriolysin [3].
Acid shock response promoter
An essential component of the pHlow plasmid is listeriolysin only being expressed once the cell in within the lysosome. Bacteria often are subjected to environmental stressors in the form of pH change, requiring differential gene expression, and hence have pH specific promoters. We have had these endogenous promoters synthesized and have characterised them for use in the pHlow plasmid.
E. Coli ASR Promoter
The acid shock response protein is present in the genome of E. Coli K12 and was first submitted into the registry by IIT Delhi 2013 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1170000 ) . This part was not available from the registry so we had it synthesised as a gBLOCK from IDT and biobricked it so that future years can access the part without synthesis.
Lactococcus Promoters
Lactococcus lactis produce lactate in their own environment and have several genes that are upregulated due to the low pH they create.The two promoters we are investigating are p170 ( BBa_K1677300 ) and p170-CP25 ( BBa_K1677301 ).The reasons for attempting to characterise both promoters is due to their relative levels of expression;  p170 has a higher level of expression, but is a more leaky promoter, whereas p170-CP25 is more tightly regulated. P170 has been characterised to be induced at pH 6.5 and pH 6.0 but only when the culture is in stationary phase [4]. It is important to note that all characterization of these promoters occurred in E. Coli, not L. lactis and that further characterisation needs to be undertaken to conclusively determine their results.

This other type of chlamydia, you got the chlamydia maybe from your friend, that one is quiet. So maybe if we also do that type of study in Malawi it’s ok. Let’s collect some blood samples, then check chlamydia, I would send the data, we would find 90 %? Yeah, because nobody can claim to be tested for chlamydia, because it is very expensive. The method we have now is very expensive. PCR. You can’t say we want to test people who have chlamydia, we use PCR. It is extremely expensive. [...] That’s why elimination, as you said, is challenging because we are only looking at the signs. So if you are busy looking on the signs, how do you see it? How will you eliminate it by looking on the signs? It’s challenging, because you have to see from the blood do people have it? [...] But not by looking on the signs. What if you don’t see the signs but in the blood it is still there? That’s where I think much more needs to be done. [...] Some of us too think that we need to know if the person has the disease, rather than just the symptoms. So we are doing fine. Or not us, but the Queen people. The Queen is giving us all the resources. Yeah, so they are doing fine.

It is not just us they’re supporting. They do huge support in all these countries. At least the support is on fight of trachoma as a project. So you know if you are fighting as a project. Where it has got maybe the busiest then when the project ends you find...
Daniel C.:
...they peter out.
George:
But they are trying to sustain it so that even though the project should go but the villages should be at least equipped to say Ok, hygiene should be like that. So that’s what we are trying, but it is not easy.

Yeah, but I think that’s the end aim, to have the villages know what they are doing and taking care of themselves. Yes, I think you are right.

Buddies
Jason Park
I am a 5th year MD/PhD student in the UCSF School of Medicine and the UCSF / UC Berkeley Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering. I'm originally from the Los Angeles area and went to college at MIT. I've been in the Cell Propulsion Lab for about two years and I am co-advised by Dr. Wendell Lim and Dr. Bruce Conklin. I became a buddy for iGEM because I thought it would be fun working with bright, motivated high school and undergraduate students for the summer and I knew I would get good experience learning to be a better mentor. (Also, I had been interested in participating in iGEM as an undergraduate at MIT but never ended up doing it!) The best thing about being part of iGEM this summer has been working with and teaching students - together going through the learning process of doing lab research with all of its ups and downs.
Chia-Yung Wu
I am a transplant from MIT, where I participated in iGEM as a graduate advisor for the MIT team in 2008 and 2009.  This summer, I joined the Lim/Cell Propulsion labs as a postdoc.  It has been a great pleasure working with the UCSF team.
Russell Gordley
I majored in Biochemistry at Swarthmore College, and performed my graduate studies with Carlos Barbas at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA. I am interested in using synthetic biology to understand and enhance the evolvability of biological systems.
After my freshman year in college, I took a summer internship with Jim Stivers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The practice of research turned out to be far more complex and interesting than I could have imagined--an intellectual marathon whose path is revealed with each new data set and disproven hypothesis. I am happy to participate in a program that immerses high school students in the research process.  For anyone interested in a life of science, this is a great time to join the pursuit!

   Our reporter system consists out of the RecA promoter and LacZ. Originally, the RecA promoter of E.coli has its main role in the activation of the SOS repair system. It is regulated by the LexA repressor, which binds to the SOS box sequence of the promoter. DNA damage leads to an inducing signal, which then activates the RecA protein. In the SOS response the LexA repressor is cleaved by the RecA protein, so the full RecA expression can be reached. The RecA protein can then repair both single stranded and double stranded DNA breaks.
In our project RecA promoters used to detect double stranded DNA breaks in the region of antibiotic resistance genes caused by the CIRSPR/Cas system. To get the desired activation of the promoter, it is important to assure that no other stressing agents might activate the RecA promoter. Those agents could be UV light, X-ray, ionizing radiation and different types of DNA breaking compounds.
   The SOS response in E.coli could also get induced by engineered M13 phage infection that are defective in the minus-strand origin, and so unable to form the double stranded replicative stage.
In this case the single-stranded DNA would be the SOS-inducing signal. The wild type M13 phage doesn’t induce the SOS response ( Higashitani et al. 1992 ). In another study genomes of phage M13 infected and uninfected E.coli strains were compared by oligonucleotide microarrays, where no stress response genes were scored as upregulated ( Karlsson et al. 2005 ). Regarding the phagemids, an A UV-damaged oriC phagemid did not induce SOS response in a recipient cells oriF phagemids on the other hand did (Sommer et al. 1991). To make sure that our system functions reliably, we will test the activation of the RecA promoter at different stress inputs (UV, phage infection,…) by measuring the fluorescence of YFP driven by the RecA promoter.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html,"ate were identified from the pdb-file. Here, we aimed to identify novel receptors by applying directed evolution to Tar chemoreceptors. To enable E. coli to perceive novel substances five amino acid residues in the ligand binding site were the target. Our method of choice is targeted saturation mutagenesis. In comparison to random mutagenesis, this has the advantage to specifically mutate the selected amino acid residues.
Chapter I: Preparing Tar for the Library
The amplification of Tar was carried out directly from the E. coli K12 genome. We introduced the BioBrick standard restriction sites by primer design (see sequencing primers ; Tar for + prefix & Tar rev + suffix). The amplified BioBrick part was then inserted into the vector pUC18. To get rid of BioBrick standard restriction sites in tar, a QuikChange reaction was applied. The XbaI site (nt 420-425) was exchanged from TCTAGt to CCTAGt while keeping the codon for the same amino acid. Our next step was to express the quikchanged tar (TAR_QC) under the constitutive Anderson promoters .
Figure 10: Promoter comparison through a chemotaxis assay. Eight promoters of the „Anderson“ collection were cloned in front of the gene coding for the Tar receptor inside the pSB1C3 backbone. Here, we compared the swimming behavior of these strains in chemotaxis assay with M9-swimming agar plates. The chemotaxis assay was conducted as described in the methods section. L-aspartate served as the attractant in the central Whatman paper. The numbers next to each halo correspond to the promoter activities reported by the Berkley University in 2006. (A) The constructs were transformed in the Δtar strain. The picture was taken after 3 days incubation at 33 °C. The halos of the strongest promoters (J23100, x2547 and J23104, x1831) had a slightly bigger radius than the other promoter constructs. In addition, slight chemotaxis could be observed for these strains. The drop of the construct J23106 was smeared during the application and is therefore not evaluable. (B) The constructs were transformed in the BL21 strain, that naturally expresses the Tar receptor. The picture was taken after 1 day incubation at 33 °C. In general, halo size did not vary strongly. The halos of the strongest promoters (J23100, x2547 and J23104, x1831) had the biggest radius. The halo of  J231"

We conducted the experiment again      with the four day incubation. We planned future      experiments in which the incubation time would be extended      to about a month.
Mouse and Mosquito Experiments
Given a sample IRB from Dr. Owens we drafted our own IRB      using our protocols and sent it to Dr. Owens for review.
Community Outreach
Because the next generation sequencing is highly      expensive, we decided for our community outreach that this      may not be the best idea. Additionally, we would have to      undergo training for human subjects experiments and      establish a new IRB protocol. We still thought it was      beneficial to develop a survey and FAQ about mosquito      borne illnesses. We drafted a version of the survey asking      questions about frequency of mosquito bites, knowledge of      mosquito borne illnesses, and preferred characteristics of      mosquito repellent (ex: is scent important when choosing a      repellent?). We sent the survey to a cohort of individuals      as a pilot study to find any errors in the survey data and      gain preliminary results. The power analysis revealed that      we need about 250 participants or more to obtain      statistically significant results.
7/10-7/16
Rhamnolipid Quantification
We grew wild type P. Aeruginosa and transformed      P. Aeruginosa with L1 + RhlAB, and extracted rhamnolipids      from the two strains using liquid-liquid extraction.      SFC-MS result shows that mutant P.A. produces much more      mono-rhamnolipids, confirming that our construct works      well in P. Aeruginosa.  We also tried growing mutant      Putida and E. Coli (transformed with L1 + RhlAB and H2 +      RhlAB) in a different growth media, LB + glucose.  SFC-MS      result shows that all of them make mono-rhamnolipids:      E. Coli + H2_RhlAB made the most mono-rhamnolipids, then      E. Coli + L1_RhlA, then putida + L1_RhlAB.
Transformation of P. putida PhaC knockout
We tried transforming the knockout strain with 4 different      promoters and RhlAB, but only L1+RhlAB showed GFP positive      colonies.  We will sequence it to confirm the operon and      quantify the amount of rhamnolipids.

In our project IOS-i-GEM, we try to diminish concerns over genetically-engineered entomogenous fungi both from building a plasmid construct, a functional prototype and a pest group size forecasting website. However, several worries arise when comes to the word ‘genetically-engineered’. But why?
Previous iGEM teams provides precious survey outcome about it:
    Although 85% of our respondents said that they would support, or strongly support environmental remediation projects and initiatives, the number dropped to 60% when respondents were told that these projects would use genetically modified organisms.                      ── 2014 iGEM York
    In 2013 iGEM, BGU_Israel asked the question “In the sources you were exposed to, do you feel that the subject was covered in a positive or negative manner?” in their survey. 48% of their respondents feel positive, 28% of respondents consider neutral, and 14% think it negative.
    In 2014, iGEM team Warwick asked” Do you believe Synthetic Biology is a dangerous tool, knowing that potentially dangerous organisms are being dealt with?” in their survey. 30% of respondents say yes, 45% give negative answer.
    In investigating their survey design and outcome, we thought the iGEM community are getting a clearer image of how the general public percept gene-tech related information. We, as well as another iGEM team HSiTAIWAN, however, wondered more about how and why these perception is formed? When genetic-engineering related information, or more generally speaking, gene-technology related information is transferred, in what attitude is the story being reported? Does the report contain too much terminology that distant the audience with scientific outcome? Does the information sufficient enough to transfer correct and complete story to public? What about iGEM wiki? Are the stories in iGEM"

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

Stability Analysis
In our tri-stable system, stability plays an indispensable role in determining the robustness of the system. What we learnt from the bi-stable switch is the variation in biological parts, e.g. promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBS), would cause the system to be unstable. Therefore, we performed stability analysis to assess the conditions and constraints that the system"

Audience's feedback
""Great debate today. Congratulations to all the participants and to Claire [and the rest of the Paris Bettecourt 2012 iGEM team] for organizing everything. What I love about events like this is seeing the world in a new light - I was impressed by the research concerning cleaning up plastics in the ocean, 3 degrees of mutations and research concerning XNA. We are on the edge of a whole new world of thought-provoking research. I particularly liked the question, ""Who will decide if this is right or wrong?"" Scientists? Politicians? Public intellectuals? (for which France has the advantage!) Very powerful stuff. You guys have your fingers on the pulse of the future. The question is, who's listening? My country is still debating gun control and abortion while other countries are taking on huge topics such as applications of synthetic life forms. I have 2 words to sum up the debate: paradigm shift."" (Mister Alan Damon, a high school biology and physics teacher at the Ecole Active Bilingue Jeannine Manuel and member of the public during the debate)
""It was very interesting and I enjoyed the informal part, once the jury left, even more that the official one because people seem to speak more honestly, directly and with less posturing and acting. Overall, the level of debate, in terms of scientific facts, arguments, was less that what one could have achieved by putting together some ""real"" scientist, iGEM team members, but this naiveté is also exactly what made it interesting and unique. Such public issues will often be debated by non-experts, and if and when they make it to the legislature, they will be debated by politicians, and they are certainly not experts. With that in mind, seeing how non-experts could argue different aspects of genetically modified bacteria was very instructive and useful. Thank you again for putting it together, it was a pleasure to be there."" (Dule Misevic, a post  doc at Francois Taddei's lab)

""Being on the judging panel for the ""Genetically Modified Organisms FDA Style Debate"" was an exciting and novel experience to me - I have never really participated in a structured debate. I think this was a very interesting concept to let experienced debaters but non-scientists / non-iGEMers debate the merits"

Resistance to Heavy Metals (SCRaMbLE)
Overview
Synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution(SCRaMble) generates combinatorial geomic diversity through rearrangements at designed recombinase sites. We applied SCRaMble to Saccharomyces cerevisiae（synX）to attain strains with better tolerance to high concentration of cadmium ion and cupric ion solution and compared the growing condition with the original strains to demonstrate the validity of SCRaMble.
Theoretical Background
Sc2.0 Project
Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) is the world’s first synthetic eukaryotic genome project that aims to create a novel, rationalized version of the genome of the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On March 10th, 7 articles related to Sc 2.0 were published on Science. As a member of Sc 2.0, YJ lab has completed two synthetic yeast chromosomes, and two articles are published on Science discussing challenging but exciting task of building synthetic chromosomes V, X .
Cre-loxpsym System
As a part of the Sc2.0 Project , yeast chromosomes are targets, named loxPsym sites. loxPsym sites are substrates for Cre-EBD , which is an inducible form of the appropriate site-specific recombinase. Results of the recombination events are dependent"
