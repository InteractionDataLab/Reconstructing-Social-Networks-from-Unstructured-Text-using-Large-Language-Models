Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," with DNase I under the control of the T7 promoter. Unfortunately no transformations were successful and all colonies  produced contained empty plasmid backbone. Worral and Connolly reported that a promoter which is less tightly regulated  (pKK223-3) would result in transformation failure. As was shown in our metabolic kill switch, the T7 promoter we used to   control expression of the CDS is very leaky. This is likely the reason why transformations were unsuccessful as immediately  after transformation, production of DNase I would commence killing all the cells. If this is the case future work on a  system that uses DNase I as a kill switch but under much tighter control, may prove very effective.

Metabolic Kill Switch: KillerRed and KillerOrange.
We have shown that KillerRed and KillerOrange can effectively kill cells (Fig. 11 & 13) under much lower light intensity  than is used in the literature (Sarkisyan et al, 2015). On investigation into the kind of light source that was needed to produce  the 1 W/cm2 of previous experiments (Bulina et al, 2005), it became clear that 1 W/cm2 was impractically bright and would generate large amounts of heat which would kill E. coli. We decided to use a much less powerful LED array that produces 1.2 mW/cm2 at the wavelengths most effective for KillerRed and KillerOrange (Fig. 7) and expose our samples to light for a greater length of time. We showed that this was still effective with an average  survival rate in the + IPTG condition of 2.2% for KillerRed (Fig. 11) and 12.7 % for KillerOrange (Fig. 13). A wider range of exposure times  and light intensities would greatly improve the characterisation of these parts, unfortunately time limitations prevented   us from testing this.
The leakiness of the T7 promoter used in our kill switches was quantified by comparing protein production in the + IPTG condition and - IPTG condition. A one tail t-test assuming equal variance was performed for the mean fluorescence values of the cultures tested in the light box. Fluorescence was used as a measure of protein production. No statistically significant difference was found between the + IPTG condition and – IPTG condition (a significance value of < 0.05 was used. p-value for KillerRed 0.18, p-value for KillerOrange 0.16). CFU counts   for + IPTG conditions were within the standard error of – IPT"

We made four containers illuminated by LEDs. Then we put four containers into a huge incubator. We called these containers our “Hardware1.0”
Figure 3. Four containers in the incubator.
Generally, this system worked pretty well, and we incubated several colored mediums with sufficient illumination all night.

The space was limited for our sunflowers in the 96-well plate shaker. We used aluminum foil instead of sunflowers. And it worked well.
The DC current source whose highest voltage was 12V could provide energy for four LEDs at the same time.
Then we fixed them inside the lid of the shaker. Four plates are separated from each other by aluminum foil to avoid light leakage.
Figure 4. Internal structure of our hardware for liquid.
Figure 5. External look of our hardware for liquid.
We tested our hardware and found some problems.
1. Light intensity was not adjustable.
2. The distribution of light intensity at the bottom was uneven, especially in the 96-well plate shaker where light intensity was high.
We used different colors in areas which had different fluorescence values or optical densities. The deeper the color was, the value that it stood for was higher. The following pictures visually display the fluorescence or optical density distribution in a certain area in a 96-well plate.

The light intensity could reach 35000 lux at the center of the 96-well plates, while it was 15000 lux in marginal area.
Solutions:
1. As for light intensity, on one hand, we used PWM to change current waveform so that the valid value can be manipulated; on the other hand, we altered distance to change light intensity subtly.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html,": Next day plasmid purification was done according to this protocol and restriction digestion control with EcoRI    restriction enzyme was done to see if correct clones were obtained.    This enzyme has 2 recognition sites in our construct. Therefore two    bands (1535 bp and 6081 bp from pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) and 2090 bp and 6081    bp from pDR111+message+sfGFP(Sp)) should have been obtained on the    agarose gel. Moreover we sent this new constructed plasmid for    sequencing.
RD mixture:
20 μl RD assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see following protocol .

Figure 6. DNA electrophoresis with samples (1-6 from     pDR111++message+ sfGFP(Sp)) from RD control with EcoRI.
Sequencing:
Plasmid pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) and pDR111+message+sfGFP(Sp) was sent for sequencing . Primers used for    the sequencing were F-gfp insert for pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) and F-gfp insert    and F-message sequence for pDR111+message+sfGFP(Sp) (primer sequences    can be found here ).
Conclusion:
Figure 5 shows two correct bands (1535 bp and 6081 bp) when the    pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) was cut.  Figure 6 shows two correct bands (2090 bp    and 6081 bp) when the pDR111+message+sfGFP(Sp) was cut.  Therefore we    assumed that our cloning was successful and correct plasmids were    obtained. Sequencing results confirmed our assumption as you can see in    Figure 7, 8 and 9.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Localization_-_-_TEXT.html," reduction equivalents in order to create light-emission through oxidation. The underlying mechanism hereby relies on the creation of an instable, highly excited intermediate under the consumption of energy. This high-energy intermediate then spontaneously falls back into a state of lower energy, emitting the energetical difference as visible light. While mainly being used as a folded, stabilizing element at the N-terminus for the construct containing the biotin acceptor peptide, the nanoluciferase could also be used for advanced binding studies via luciferase assays. [11]
Figure 5: Reaction scheme of the reaction catalyzed by the NanoLuc nanoluciferase. Taken from the NanoGlo Assay Kit manual.
Luciferases have also found their way into biotechnological applications. [12] The simplistic concept of creating visible (and thus easily measurable) light makes luciferases ideal reporters for the expression of secretable proteins via a corresponding assay. This project also made use of a luciferase for the determination of expression levels of the BAP surface receptor while providing a stable and folded domain at the N-terminus, as well as having been used for the choice of signal peptide. The monomeric luciferase used in this project, the so-called ’NanoLuc™' [13] (due to terms of simplicity referred to as ’nanoluciferase’ in the following), can be fused to other proteins in order to make their expression visible and quantifiable. This engineered luciferase emits a steady, easily detectable glow when exposed to its substrate, while being only 19 kDa large and being brighter, more specific and steadier than other luciferases commonly found in nature. Using luciferases for the quantification of expression levels offers several advantages over fluorescent proteins, including higher sensitivity and smaller size.
CMV promoter
Last but not least, high expression levels of the receptor, so that a high avidity for the interaction may be reached. The CMV promoter (taken from the parts registry, BBa_K74709 ) therefore enables constitutively high expression of the receptor - and, in the case of the BAP-construct, the biotin ligase BirA.

Construction of the reporter circuits
Reporter genes selection
To characterize the viability of our circadian clock, we required special report genes that functions sensitively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There are many report genes available but not everyone is suitable. We looked up papers and websites, screening massively. Our modeling group facilitated us to rate the fluorescent proteins fitted for our project most. They set up an Evaluation Model, which takes issues like lifetime, quantity yield(QY) and strokes into account to select the suitable fluorescent proteins among millions of alternatives.
Besides, Prof. Li recommended luciferase for us. The functional enzyme is created immediately upon translation and the assay is rapid, reliable and easy to perform with ATP, oxygen, and luciferin as substrates. It possesses a number of physical properties that make it an excellent reporter protein: small, monomeric enzyme, high thermal stability and so on.
we primarily chose Fluc, NanoLuc(BBa_K1680009), EYFP(BBa_E2030), mCherry(BBa_E2060), mOrange, and ECFP(BBa_I13602) as alternatives. Then verification experiments were operated by linking report genes above with constitutive promoter TDH3 promoter and measured the fluorescence intensity.

Human Practices
CATE aims to provide a framework for curing a large range of solid cancers. As a medical project, it targets a wide and diverse audience, including patients, doctors and researchers. We thus considered it important to spread the word about our efforts, with a two-fold purpose: disseminating information considering new, innovative therapies; and bringing a range of interesting aspects connected to Synthetic Biology to the public's awareness. Given the ever increasing amount of exciting results produced by SynBio labs around the world, we believe it is vital that the main ideas and methods of the discipline become more well-known and publicly discussed. We have tried to use our project as a model for this.
Engagement
This year, we thus set out to bring synthetic biology closer to people of different knowledge and perspectives:
We pitched our project at the ETH Student Project House, hoping that DIY enthusiasts will feel inspired to enter the world of genetic engineering. After all, custom-made bacteria already have numerous applications in science and technology. The SPH hosts teams of highly interdisciplinary character, which is exactly what is needed to kickstart innovation in genetic engineering.
We travelled to Greece and gave a talk at NTU Athens to Computer Science master students, giving them a bird's-eye view of synthetic biology, and the important role an engineer can play inside an interdisciplinary SynBio team. We highlighted the modelling aspects of our project as an example of data-driven research that involves collaboration among diferrent disciplines.
We collaborated with our departments entrepreneurial club ( D-BSSE meets industry ) and organized a talk by the CEO of T3Pharma , a company that specialized in bacterial cancer therapy. By presenting our iGEM project side by side with T3Pharma's technology, we demonstrated that bacterial cancer therapy is a well-established field of research, offerring ample oportunity for academic success and business development. After all, a joint effort will be needed to safely bring the technology closer to public use.
Perspectives
Further, we seeked opinions and perspectives from people of diverse backgrounds towards our own project. Through these conversations we learned:

Figure 5. Fluorescence and absorbance data for E. coli quorum sensing strains. Continuous line: Fluorescence/OD600; Dashed line: Absorbance at OD600; Red: 2 plasmid quorum sensing strain; Green: 1 plasmid quorum sensing strain; Purple: reporter plasmid only strain. For both strains every value displayed is the average of all technical replicates (at least three) and for each, the line displayed is one of three biological repeats all showing a similar pattern. All Fluorescence/OD600 data were normalized to the range of the 2 plasmid quorum sensing strain data. The Fluorescence/OD600 data for the 1 plasmid quorum sensing strain were corrected to start at 0 (as they would otherwise have been negative). After almost 12 hours, the fluorescence from the 2 plasmid strains reached an overflow. Therefore no Fluorescence/OD600 values after this point are displayed.
To investigate the dynamics of the two quorum sensing strains, plate reader measurements were used. We measured GFP fluorescence and optical density to correct total GFP production for the bacterial population (Figure 5). There is a clear difference between the responses of the quorum sensing strains and the negative control that only contains the GFP reporter plasmid. Fluorescence in the negative control barely rises above the background level. However, both quorum sensing strains show a steep response in GFP expression at comparable optical densities. This indicates that both tested systems function as expected and provide a means of regulating gene expression based on bacterial density.
Subpopulation Formation
Using the previously described system, population-wide Cry toxin overexpression is likely to kill all E. coli cells in the first moment of toxin expression. It would be beneficial to subdivide this population to keep healthy bacteria, as non-producers. These cells would be able to initiate a new growth phase after death of the toxin-producing cells. The critical requirement for this is that some cells can behave differently than the norm of the population, but are genetically identical. A collection of cells that acts differently from the rest of the population is called a subpopulation.
For bacteria to produce a subpopulation there must exist two states in which an individual cell can grow. We based our states on a two protein system. The proteins that we chose to include in the system (Figure 6) are phage λ- and phage 434 cI repressor protein. The working of the dominantly present protein determines cell behavior. A promoter has"

Gut Flora
  We believe engineering gut bacteria is a promising field in the future, for bacteria are easy to be engineered compared with engineering human cell, and human gut is naturally inhabited by many different bacteria. We could construct a gut bacteria kit for either supplying nutrients such as vitamins or synthesizing and delivering drugs. We’re highly motivated to do this project, for it offers a good solution to alleviate the current famine and diseases brought by malnutrition in many developing countries around the world. The drug delivery, adapted to host’s circadium rhythm and physiological state, would be an ideal approach to cure some chronic diseases. However, we didn’t choose to further develop Gut Flora Kit as our team’s project this year, because we have limited knowledge and experience in gut flora and intestinal environment.
Alternative Splicing
  Alternative splicing is a type of post-transcription mRNA modification observed in most multi-cellular organisms. It happens where there is more than one intron in a gene, meaning that different splicing site choices generate different mature mRNA thus produce different protein. The choice of the splicing site is controlled by a very complex system, yet we have some interesting and convincing understanding about it, and may it become a new perspective in synthetic biology.
In a multi-exon pre-mRNA, some exons are constitutively cut off or maintained, while some exons are sometimes skipped and sometimes kept. The latter is called an alternative splicing. The pattern can be controlled by many mechanisms involving a good many RNA secondary structure formations, protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Different splicing patterns always have relatively constant expression pattern in certain cell condition.
We are inspired by this interesting phenomenon and hope to design a new synthetic biology tool which can use compiled gene to produce many different kinds of proteins under different conditions.
We are inspired by a consistent mechanism of splicing pattern determination, which is called the mutually exclusive splicing. Every time only one out of several exon cassettes(altering exons) are presented. Latest discoveries revealed this is affected by certain pre-RNA secondary structure. If we change the sequence of the regulatory region, we may change the splicing pattern, and some proteins are expressed in a regulated and constant way.
One big problem about this idea is the chassis. Multi-cellular life-form is not very suitable for synthetic biology, and there is no such system in bacteria. So yeast becomes the only solution we can come up with. Very few alternative splicing is reported in yeast, yet it can normally carry out the pre-RNA processing function."

Overview
The iGEM InterLab Study is the currently the largest interlaboratory study in synthetic biology (Beal et al., 2016). The interlab study investigates the replicability of data by providing all participating iGEM teams with protocols for measuring the fluorescence output of a set of genetic devices that have been designed to provide varying levels of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression. Team Newcastle 2017 followed the Interlab plate reader protocol, which can be found here (link protocol document).

Mackenzie is in her 5th (and final!) year of her undergrad in Microbiology and Immunology. She joined iGEM last year to learn about what synthetic biology is, and how she could get involved in this emerging field. The iGEM 2016 Jamboree not only inspired Mackenzie to come back for 2017, but encouraged her to help cement Dalhousie iGEM’s place in Dal’s programming. She is grateful to be apart of this amazing program which grants undergraduate students priceless training and offers incredible opportunities. Mackenzie finishes her degree in December and plans to take a short breather before entering Graduate Studies in September 2018.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid"

This could be extremely relevant in oncology, where T-cells have been modified to attack cancer but also end up attacking the healthy cells in the body. This would also be relevant in hormonal responses, where the cells would be able to sense the natural frequency of the hormones and then respond accordingly.
Final Thoughts
Oscillate has many potential uses in many fields, ranging from medicine to microbiology to manufacturing. Our interviews with Professor Lambert, Professor March, Dr. Baig, and Professor Varner informed our initial ideas and inspired our creativity during brainstorming. Their expertise provided us with the ideal launch point for delving deeper into our project’s potential, and we found that the possibilities are endless.

My name is Nikolas Rakebrandt and I am currently in the first semester of the MSc ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" program in Göttingen. Before my career as a scientist, I made a little detour and hold  a BSc in Business Administration and Economics from the University of Passau. After this, I acquired   my Biology BSc in Göttingen with a thesis about effector proteins of plant pathogenic fungi. I am   really looking forward to iGEM because it will be ""our"" project and we will be able to work and plan   on this autonomously. I think this will be very challenging and fun, not to mention that we will probably   learn a great deal!
When I am not busy with PCRs, cloning or studying I am very much into sports like football, surfing or basketball.  Also I like travelling whenever there is time (and money) or just being outside.

As a big fancier of genetics, microbiology and biochemistry, I recently started to study Microbiology and Biochemistry for a Masters degree at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. Last year, I aquired the academic degree of bachelor of science in biology at the Humboldt University of Berlin. During these studies I also specialized on the already mentioned fields. This year is the first I participate in iGEM and I'm really looking forward to work independently on our project and hope learn something and to meet new people.

Last year, I finished my Bachelor with an emphasis on molecular biology at the University of Göttingen. Next to the university courses I really enjoy to play tablesoccer in my freetime. I am a member of a club which competes with other teams in a german wide national league. This year, I joined the iGEM team to participate in an interesting competition as well as improve my lab skills. I am eager to organize and develop a project together with other students and just like to have a fun time with them. Hopefully, we are able to get to the jamboree in europe and meet lots of other students with worthwhile ideas and projects.

We hope that these works may lead to a better understanding of possible goals or outcome one may get when presenting the iGEM project, and that improvements may be made by finding out the additional goals one may want to achieve when comparing the existing goals and the possible goals listed in this taxonomy.
Here are the detailed illustrations of our work.
First we shall have a look at the right part of the figure, the box named ‘metacognitive system’. The idea comes from the revised version of Bloom’s Taxonomy by Robert J. Marzano, which indicates that mental process can be ordered in terms of control. That is to say, before we actually start our cognitive activities, we need first to decide whether or not we will engage in the speech the speaker is delivering. When it comes to presenting an iGEM project, it means that at the beginning, the speaker may need to stress on the importance and uniqueness of the project. So it would be helpful to show the seriousness of the problem the project is dealing with, and to clarify the research background of the project so that people doing research in similar fields may be interested.
Then we may come to the cognitive part of the process, which is illustrated by the large triangle in the middle in figure. It is further divided into four levels.
1. Retrieval
The retrieval here means the retrieval of knowledge about simple facts. The major mental activity in this stage is memory. It’s about the knowledge we have memorized and the knowledge we are yet to memorize.
Speakers working on this level will help the audience to recall simple facts like ‘an open reading frame starts to express when the inducer binds to the promoter’, and also introduce the basic feature of a new concept like ‘a recombinase reverses the DNA sequence between its action sites’.
The knowledge or fact we retrieve here will become the building block of the following stages.
2. Comprehension
Comprehension here includes the common ‘understanding’ process and also an additional ‘interpretation’ process, which means that the audience here are expected to take in what the speaker is explaining and convert it into something that is more meaningful to him/herself.
Speakers working on this level will give meanings to the knowledge building bricks retrieved in the first level. The basic knowledge here are organized in a certain relationship to express an idea the speaker want to express.
In an iGEM presentation, this is extremely important when the speaker tries to explain how their circuit work, for example ‘how does the combination of different promot"

The Tristable Switch
Tristable Switch is a biological device that could perform three discrete, but alternating, steady states driven by three different repressible promoters. The presence of a transient pulse of inducer allows effective state shifting, while signal interference is prevented. In order to enhance the specificities towards inducers, improvements were made based on the Brown’s Tristable Switch model in 200"

Introduction
General description
Proof of Concept
Introduction
While Catalytic Activity Sequencing began as a method for catalytic biomolecule activity recording, we have also created a way to adjust CAT-Seq to record activities of regulatory part libraries. In addition to the activities, cross-interactions of different regulatory parts can also be measured.
We highly suggest to read the main design section of CAT-Seq first, as we will not go over the main design scheme here and will only build upon it further.
Adjusting CAT-Seq system for Regulatory Sequences
Just like in the main CAT-Seq design page, we again divide the Regulatory CAT-Seq design page into two parts:
1. Design description - an in depth explanation of how a particular part of our system works, how it should be used in real-life situation and why such design choices were adopted.
2. Proof of Concept - a story about how we applied the design using specific components and parts to build Regulatory CAT-Seq and demonstrate that it works as intended.
General description
As already established, the Catalytic Activity Sequencing records the activity of different catalytic biomolecules in separate water droplets simultaneously. That is achieved with the help of Substrate Nucleotides. In turn, unique catalytic biomolecules produce different amounts of Product Nucleotides, which can then be quantified by adding them to their own amplified template DNA and later sequencing those molecules.
Yet, the activity of the catalytic biomolecule is not the only aspect that can influence the amount of Product Nucleotides that are produced. If all of the droplets would contain the same catalytic biomolecule, but each droplet would have a different concentration of that biomolecule, we would get different amounts of Product Nucleotides. For example, droplets with large amount of biomolecules may produce a large number of Product Nucleotides and vice-versa .

Outlook
An ambitious system we want to design for security is an artificial black box which people should work with by keys. The general idea to get the information from a working system is extracting the plasmid from the bacteria and sequencing the working parts. In this way, there will be less security. The bacteria will be a white box for everyone who gets it. Here the black boxes are necessary for the proteins or plasmids that may be harmful. So we are trying to design a bacteria that not easy to work and be extracted and sequenced.
Ligand control working system
The first step, the controllable lysis system are introduced in the bacteria. And an operator system is employed as a switch to the lysis system. The lysis system will start without the ligand. A large library of specific interacting protein-ligand pairs with one template operator system can be built with computational design and directed evolution. In this way, only the owners of the bacteria know what the key is. So the bacteria itself will not grow and work, and at the same time the information of DNA is also destroyed by the lysis system. Our software can give a regulatory network to make the operator system stably open and close the lysis system.
Engineered codon system
The second step, the plasmid is restricted to work in the specific bacteria only, as it is hard to block the process of plasmid extraction and transform. A library of tRNA synthetases is necessary to change the translating processes to make the plasmid can not work in other bacteria. In this way, it is necessary to construct a platform to select tRNA synthetases mutation. A cell-free system is necessary, as the mutation may lead to the chaos of whole cell. And a time-dependent protein expression system can be designed by our software. And the plasmid can only working in a ligand-controlled specific cell environment.
In this way, we can construct a new platform to protect some harmful or potential harmful genes or systems.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," minute is set as a time step. For each group of E.coli, a fraction of the population will go through the process of plasmid replication and dividend at each time step, through which the fraction is determined by the level of E.coli’s growth rate $\mu(i,S)$, who is closely related to the E.coli’s type and culture concentration.
After each time step $dt$, the population change of the $i^{th}$ group $\frac{dN}{dt}$ is constituted with two parts: E.coli with $i$ plasmids produced by parent cell in other groups, and the E.coli with $j(\neq i)$ plasmids produced by parent cell in the $i^{th}$ group.
Given a random distribution mechanism of plasmids into son cells, the distribution rate $\delta_{i,j}$, which stands for the probability of parent E.coli in $i^{th}$ group producing son E.coli in $j^{th}$ group. We then multiply this probability to the fraction of population who replicates, to get the change in population respectively as $$\frac{dN(i)}{dt} = \sum_{j \neq i}^{N_{p,max}}\delta_{i,j} \mu(j,S) N(j) - (1-2(\frac{1}{2})^i) \mu(i,S) N(i)$$
Meanwhile, the consumed substrate can also be describe in an ODE as $$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{1}{Ys} \sum_{i=0}^{N_{p,max}} \frac{dN(i)}{dt}$$
Programs simulating this process is done at each time step, and each group’s population is well-known. We selected ten representative groups (E.coli with 1,20,40,60,80,100,120,140,160,180,200 plasmids) and have their population drawn in the curves below.
Probability of distribution
The loss of plasmids during reproduction, is mainly due to the uneven distribution of plasmids into two son E.coli after plasmid replication. Therefore, it is important to give the probability of each possible situation. To be more specified, the probability of a i-plasmid parent producing a j-plasmid son has to be calculated.
Plasmids’ self-replication has to take place ahead, for a empirical formula of replication number is given $$CopyNum(i) = \frac{V"

For CatA gene product the reaction was carrried out in Sodium phosphate buffer 50mM, with the same concentration of catechol, 0.03M aswell. In 200ul of reaction mix was added 5um of cell extract.
Finally BpuI, carried out in citrate buffer 100mM, with 5ul of cell extract in 200ul of reaction mix with 0.4mMof substrate, ABTS.
Week 3rd-9th October
We recieved the long primers to do the phusion proteins, XylE and CatA with FBD1 and FBD10 each.
To do that we follow a standard protocol of Phusion taq PCR, but adding DMSO in the final mix, 1.5%, instead of the corresponding volume of water (0.75ul per reaction of 50ul). The template was the plasmids we already construct to express XylE and CatE. The amplicons, once purified from the PCR mix, were used to do Golden gate cloning to introduce the new fusion proteins in the backbones, the same backbounds as for the rest of genes. And the product of golden gate transformed into DH5-alpha also for blue/white screening, and colony PCR for the positives.
Once we know that the gene is there we followed by cloning them into our strain to do gene expression and express the proteins just as we did for the XylE, CatA and BpuI genes. And tested them together with the others in the same conditions to see if the activity was affected by fusing the FBD to them.
Week 10th-16th October
This week we return to the GFP-FBD, to test the binding strength in different fabrics and un different washing conditions. Teja cut prepare 3 plates for different fabrics to test all the binding domains. After express all the 10 fabric domains only 8 were properly expressed, we realized of this by doing an SDS-PAGE, but also because the results of the experiment show that some samples have the same fluorescence as the negative control, it is to say, no fluorescence. Our ""official"" negative control didn't work neither, it is to say, GFP wt. Therefore we used as negative control only cell extract of BL21-DE3 which don't express the GFP.
The experiments consisted in:
- 24h incubation with the cell extracts in the plates at 4C.
- measure fluorescence of the cell extract (excitation 475, emmision 515)
- remove cell extract"

The forward primers that I orderd for the antirepressors also arrived today, so next week we can do a PCR of the antirepressors and ligate the products into pSB1C3.
Unfornately someone forgot to put Annemi's restricted products from the 23-09-2010 in the fridge after having run them on a gel. So these are most likely not working anymore, and have to be redone before we can do the ligations of G1, G2, GR1, GR2 + GFP. Sebastien told us that if restricted products are not kept on ice, the sticky ends possible get degraded.
24-09-2010 - Thomas - Antiterminator group
The transformations of our ligations from yesterday look really good! :). There are only about 8 colonies on the ligation control, and 20+ on the plates with the actual ligations. We restreaked 4 colonies of each of the 5 ligations and put them on the lab bench to let them grow over the weekend. On Monday we should start some overnight cultures of all 20 restreaks so we can miniprep and verify them on Tuesday.
Patrick and I also did PCRs of the pSB2K3 backbone plasmid and the RBS+GFP. In addition to that we did 9 verification PCRs on the minipreps of our ligations from last week, so hopefully we'll get some good bands there! The PCRs will finish just before I leave the lab (wow, it's already 17:30...) so I will put them in the fridge so they can be run on a gel on Monday.
23-09-2010 - Thomas - Antiterminator group
Unfortunately, I was in the lab alone today, due to half my group being on vacation. Since I had to prepare the presentation for the meeting with our supervisors and the 2009 team in the afternoon, not alot got done in the lab. I transformed the ligations that Patrick did yesterday, with Anja's help, and plated them. Anja ran a gel of the PCRs of the plasmids backbones that Patrick did yesterday and they all looked good. Anja also did a miniprep of the MG03 plasmid :).

Human
practices
Founding and communicating, in this year’s project, set the tone of our human practices. And that is what we would clarify through three aspects, as follows.
At the beginning of the project, a milestone for iGEM in Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) was settled, that is, an official student club, or the “iGEM club”, was founded. It serves as a stronghold of all iGEMers in HIT as well as a place to develop reserves. Recruitment of new iGEMers is organized and lectures for beginner training and workshop for project are held regularly. Meanwhile, it also organized academic visits and help with some team trivia during this year.
Furthermore, we manage to spread the idea of iGEM across Harbin. We delivered a lecture for the team of Northeast Agricultural University (NEAU) to help them prepare for iGEM next year. We also invite representatives of team NEAU to our termly meeting and share our ideas with them.
Also, in order to exchange ideas and extend eyesight, groups of iGEMers went to summer schools and conferences in Peking University and Tongji University in China as well as King Mongkut's Institute of Technology in Thailand. And those activities are sure to benefit our project in many ways.
Human practice, on the whole, offers us quite a lot besides knowledge and project. It makes us get aware that we are not only a group of people gathered to fight for a competition, but a big family for sharing sorrow and joy.
iGEM Club as a Stronghold
Founded in March 15, 2012, the iGEM club serves as the stronghold of all iGEMers in HIT. It takes charge of most of the administrative work of the team, including team establishment, meeting arrangement, member training, process monitoring and so on.
The aim of this club is to systematize the whole structure of the project, and also to spread the idea of iGEM to more people of HIT. Our project is divided"

We started new cultures of cholera to grow over the weekend. Cultures were prepared in 4mL of our high SSW LB. We also streaked our cholera onto a new plate. Both the plate and the overnight cultures were placed in the 30°C incubator to grow over the weekend.
We heard back from the Lyons, France iGem team about getting part BBa_K802001 from them, however they are on vacation until Monday. They will send us the part as soon as they get back. We emailed them our FedEx shipping number and address. We also checked on the primers that last year's iGem team prepared for the DspB, but they were using a different plasmid vector so we will have to redesign new primers for the part that we are getting so that we can use it in the pet-15B plasmid in order to allow us to easily purify the proteins once we get the gene cloned into E. coli and are producing the enzyme. We will work on designing the new primers this weekend so that we can order them on Monday.
We are also going to research assay methods for our specific enzymes to be able to test the ability of our enzymes to degrade biofilms. On Monday we will go over the different methods we researched and plan which assays we are going to use for our specific enzymes.
We gave the sequence of the Subtilisin savinase gene to Dr. Grose for her to order today. Their turn around time is seven days, then a few extra to mail it to us. We will adjust our goal dates according to when we receive the sequence back.
5/6/13
We talked to Dr. Robison today and were able to get a sample of Bacillus subtilis from his lab. The savinase produced by this bacteria strain is a homolog to the savinase that we were originally looking for. We plated the sample that we got from him and put it in the incubator at 30C to grow the culture. Once the bacteria is grown we can amplify the gene that we want and clone it into the pET15b plasmid to allow us to purify the gene after it is produced, as the pET15b plasmid attaches a His-tag to the protein that causes it to be excreted from the cell and easily isolated and purified.

Figure 1. Delivery plasmid map and integration into the conserved attTn7 site using a transposase complex.
How will our kill-switch work?
At the same time, we came to realize that any selected system would have intrinsic disadvantages which may compromise our kill-switch. The downside of introducing toxins into bacteria is the selective pressure to improve fitness through deactivation of the toxic gene, as well as leaky expression of the toxin, which could hinder the effectiveness of the biocontainment system (Pasotti et al, 2011).
Therefore, we searched for potential well-described gene switches where we could employ a toxin-antitoxin system. We decided to use two switches instead of one to ensure improved regulation and advantageous GMO containment.
More specifically, we built upon the cumate gene switch of the iGEM Trieste 2012 team, previously developed by Mullick et al. 2006. It is a tightly controlled inducible system where we aim to insert a toxin, Colicin E2, previously used in many iGEM projects, such as iGEM TU Darmstadt 2016 and iGEM Paris Bettencourt 2012 . Although leaky expression is minimized by the tight regulation, we believe that expression of a DNA endonuclease might still pose a threat.
Thereby, we aim to add another layer of protection by controlling the expression of its cognate Immunity protein 2 (Im2) by a Trp operon and its negative repressible feedback mechanism. The tryptophan operon is a well-known gene switch regulated by the levels of tryptophan and a tryptophan repressor (Rose et al, 1973).
Overall, our goal is to prove that the inherent weaknesses of the cumate switch can be compensated by the tryptophan switch and vice versa.
How is our kill-switch regulated?
Our biocontainment kill-switch is divided into two parts: the cumate regulatory system and the tryptophan regulatory system. Their names refer to the compound which is used to induce toxin expression by deactivating the safety switches.
Cumate system
The repressor of the system ( CymR ) is constitutively expressed and is bound to the T5 cumate operon , repressing the expression of the downstream gene. Once cumate is added it binds to CymR, while the latter dissociates from the T5 cumate operator, enablng the expression of the downstream gene. It should be noted that we have added two reporter proteins, RNA spinach apt"
USTC,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," The most intractable problem we confront is the overload on our server to complete the simulation task. After literature reviewing, we choose some factors, for example, translation rate, to which a designed gene circuit is most sensitive. We also set a range for parameter fluctuations. Some designed circuits are proven to be robust and resistant to environment perturbations, while some other plausible well-functioning gene circuits are sensitive to specific parameters. The analysis is crucial because it gives us deeper understanding of a complicated gene circuit and lays foundation for wet-lab realization of functional novel gene circuits.
5.DNA: Get the DNA sequence
Function:
After designing gene circuits, the DNA sequence and other information of the designed circuit are available for users to check and download.
Why to choose BioBLESS
Although many designs of logic gates have come into being, circuit design in a larger scale is still rare. With more inputs and more given functions, the inter-reactions among them may become too complicated for humans to analyze one by one.
BioBLESS is here to tackle the problem.
BioBLESS can offer multiple functions, and it can be of great help even if you need only single one function we provide. BioBLESS can generate optimized logic circuits and detailed gene circuits automatically, then depict most reliable ones for users after screening.
BioBLESS is far more thoughtful in analyzing and displaying interior structure as well as exterior integration, which makes the simulation more accurate and reliable.

Podcast
The Beginning
During this years iGEM competition, we were involved in the making of a informational video in cooperation with several other iGEM teams around the world. It all started when Lars-Christian (a former iGEM team member turned superviser from our team) told us that Cornell University was considering making a collaborative podcast video as part of the human outreach aspect of iGEM. It didn’t take long for us to decide that we wanted to participate because it sounded like a fun and exciting project to work with. After the initial emailing and formal introductions we had a series of hangouts on google+ which enabled us to see and speak to each other face to face. This helped the process, it would probably have been a rather difficult task to achieve the same level of productivity and cooperation over email, when several different people from all around the world are involved in decision making.
The Task
Very early it was decided that the product of our labor should be focused on the ethical aspects of synthetic biology but also teach the public about iGEM and synthetic biology in general. That we as scientist take the ethical issues regarding genetic manipulation seriously. The “problem” that we ended up wanting to investigate was GMO’s and the way they are perceived by the public.
The Idea
At first we talked about making a movie where the different teams would contribute with their part and the editing would be spread out among the teams. This approach was abbandoned though and each team was then tasked with producing their own movies. After a couple of weeks of planning, writing scripts and making mission statements for our movie we were ready to shoot the first set of interviews. By making this video we hope that the average population might understand or at least appreciate our efforts to make a better world, and not perceive our hard work as a mean to corrupt the natural order of things.
The Message
The purpose of this video is to build a bridge between scientists and the general public. Using it as a way to inform people in general about the ethical and philosophical aspects of genetic modification and how human technological advancement has enabled us to manipulate naturally occurring systems into workhorses of great benefit to modern society. By openly discussing the issues that arise dealing with"

Introduction
Of the proteins used in our project, three of them are Cytochrome C protein, wherein Heme has a very important role to play. However, the pathway of Heme biosynthesis is extremely complicated. In fact, no one has modeled it properly till date. As heme synthesis was our fundamental problem, we put on a lot of efforts in modelling it properly. What follows next is a brief insight to all that we have done.
Mathematical model
Pathway of heme production in E. coli (C-5 pathway from glutamate):
Also, d-Aminolevulinate (ALA) produced as an intermediate in the above reactions. -Aminolevulinate Synthase (ALA Synthase) is the committed step of the heme synthesis pathway, and is usually rate-limiting for the overall pathway. Regulation occurs through control of gene transcription. Heme functions as a feedback inhibitor, repressing transcription of the gene for -Aminolevulinate Synthase.
A non-competitive irreversible feedback inhibition model is assumed for this step with a Ki value of 0.02 mM. Hence, the following equation governs the production of ALA:
The rest of the reactions in this pathway are assumed to proceed via Henri-Michaelis-M"

Our team created new BioBricks for expressing and purifying the Cas13a protein used in our CascAID system and BioBricks for investigation of degradation tags with GFP.
Lwa Cas13a
To express the core piece of our project, Cas13a, we cloned the protein sequence - in this set of biobricks for the version of Leptotrichia Wadei- into a psB1C3-backbone and fused it with several elements of our part collection.   By equipping the Cas13a with a T7-promoter, a Tphi-Terminator , N-terminal 6xHis/Twin-strep tag for affinity-chromatography and Sumo tag for increased solubility, we created our favorite Biobrick: BBa_K2323004 , customized for expression and purification of Lwa Cas13a.   Other, more basic versions of this construct we submitted are BBa_K2323000 and BBa_K2323001.    The results gained by the use of our purified Cas13a enzymes is described in readouts .
TEV protease
To independently provide a tool for the removal of the affinity tag for our other Cas13a versions from Lsh and Lbu, we improved BBa_K1319004, submitted by the Aachen team 2014, coding for Tobacco Etch Virus-(TEV) protease by inserting the sequence for an N-termianl 6xHis Tag, creating BBa_K2323002 . This way we were able to express and purify the protease ourselves and could also show that it posesses high cleavage activity with this improved BioBrick .This BioBrick will be useful for any future iGEM using proteins in a cell-free system.
Degradation Tags
We created a library of GFP-containing constructs fused to different degradation tags which are targeted by the ClpP machinery of E. coli. The degradation tags for BBa_K2323003 , BBa_K2323006 , BBa_K232300 , BBa_K"

The team Shiyan_SY_China constitutes by our nine students and five tutors such as Dr. Xu Mingkai to instruct and help us. Some of us own deep interest in biology, some are enthusiastic about mathematics, some are interested in music and sports, also some are experts at making the software and studying intensively. We utilize our curiosity and energy to construct our team. Thanks to all the people who have helped us, without them, we couldn’t explore a new and interesting field.
I am Jinyan Chu,I participate in the iGEM for challenging myself to form my leadership and to achieve some first hand experiences about biology experiments and software making. Due to the admiration of doing experiments, I own the desire to be a scientist. I am the leader of students group and the administrator of the software part in our team, and also a participator of the biology experiment.
I am Yiyang Liu, one of the members of the Shenyang_SY_China team and the leader of the experiment group in our team. As I have great enthusiasm in Biology and want to achieve more knowledge about gene engineering, I take part in the IGEM. I love Biology so much that I decide to devote my lifetime to experiments and research.I learn a lot about teamwork and confirm my will to dedicate to Biology.
I am Fanglin Zhao.My dream is to be a scientist in the future because I really love chemistry and biology. From my perspective, the coolest thing of science is that I can obtain much knowledge about the nature through experiments and studies. In our team, I take charge of the experimental parts with three other team members. I learned a lot from the lab and I plan to try to have more opportunities to study in chemistry or biology labs.

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," By fusing the PduD targeting sequence to Ferritin and HybA we will hopefully succeed in packing the BMC with the iron-rich proteins, potentially resulting in a magnetic microcompartment. We will additionally try to target a heat-activated protease (DegP) into the compartment, which should degrade the ferretin and leave behind only the metal particles.
Figure 6: Ferritin multimer (24mer) (left) and Ferritin monomer (right). [8]
Another idea we are interested in is targeting the fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry into our microcompartment. GFP and mCherry expression will allow us to visualise our microcompartments and test the efficiency of our PduD targeting sequence as a localisation signal. In order to compare GFP/mCherry expression in the cytoplasm to expression in the microcompartments we will use an SSRA signal. Fusion of this SSRA signal to GFP will target it to CLIP proteases in the cytoplasm resulting in degradation of the fluorescent protein. Therefore only GFP molecules protected within the BMC will be expressed and so any fluorescence detected in the cell will confirm expression of the microcompartment. However this is dependent on GFP reaching the microcompartment before it is degraded.
In conjunction with biobricks made by other iGEM groups in the past, we aim to test the versatility of our microcompartment and to expand our BMC approach into a wide variety of new applications. For example, we hope to use part BBa_K190019 from the registry with our own PduD part to target fMT into our microcompartment. fMT is an arsenic-binding protein which could play an important role in the purification of water polluted with heavy metals, an idea effectively tackled by the Groningen team in 2009. If we could target fMT to the inside of our BMCs then remove them from the E. coli cells using the poly-histidine affinity tag, we will have created a water purifying microcompartment. Isolating functional microcompartments from the cells might avoid many of the complications that accompany introduction of genetically engineered bacteria into the environment.
Other parts we hope to manipulate include BBa_I742111 and BBa_C0083, which code for limonene and aspartate ammonia-lyase, respectively. These parts will be used to create bacterial lemonade, although the human guinea pigs that will have to drink it have not been nominated yet. We are combining the lemon smell (limonene) with a sweet taste (either “diet” aspart"

Daniel C.:
It’s difficult for us to judge, so we want to ask you: What are the main factors actually contributing to chlamydia in those countries or the chlamydial infection?
Dr. Courtright:
Chlamydial infection … the transmission of course is very focal and if one looks throughout Africa, the mistake that was made in the past was to just […] paint all places red, if they found trachoma in one particular area within a country. That was an error, and only more recently the global trachoma mapping project is really clarifying where chlamydia transmission is really a problem where it’s not. As an example: in Tanzania there [are] around 150 districts but in fact right now there is probably only five districts in which transmission is at such a level that there needs to be considered effort at reducing transmission and tackling the disease. [In] Ethiopia, on the other hand, the number of districts that need intervention is probably over 150. So it’s very focal.
    I think that is one of the things we’ve had to learn, that we have to bring the programs down to an area by area. Even within an area we have to look much more carefully at where transmission is happening. So the programs that are in place, although they are focused on a district, and the district can be 100,000 to 300,000 people, there’s a bit of over treatment right now. In some areas, because the entire district does not really have problem but it is focally within that district so that is something […] we struggle with: that there is an overtreatment in some areas. But then in other areas undertreatments […] I’ll give you an example. Around Kilimanjaro we have districts that include the outland areas around Mount Kilimanjaro but then also the Masai step at the lower ends of Kilimanjaro. The population density is higher on the slopes of Kilimanjaro rather than down the flat lands, which is more of a hot dry area. […] Trachoma in those communities is a huge problem, but if you do a survey in the administrative district the findings from the slopes wash out the findings from the lower populated areas down below. So we’re actually missing populations that are not being treated. And this is a problem in several areas. I think that there are still a lot of lessons we need to"

The Tale of Ghost and Elf: Chapter one
That night the little prince left the earth. The distance between the earth and B612 was so far that he had to find a place for resting. At this time, the little prince landed on planet Ecoli. Something unimaginable on this planet was impending, which was absolutely different from the king, the conceited man, the tippler, the businessman and the geographer he encountered before. Ecoli, not as big as the earth, has gardens and buildings on it. The moment his feet touched the ground, a small voice came to his ears:” Hey, you tread on me.”
“Oh, sorry.” The little prince moved away his feet in a hurry.
“Who are you?” Little Dot asked curiously.
“I am the little prince.” Apparently, the little prince felt happy right now, because the silence of the universal trip was finally broken.
“You are a good boy. Nice to meet you.” Little Dot was frank and outspoken.
“Do you live alone on the planet?” The little prince asked.
“NO. Why not let me introduce you to my companions?” Little Dot was very kind to the guest.
For some reason, the little prince found something familiar on Little Dot. He knew deep in Little Dot’s heart, it was pure. “Then let’s go.”

Despite these two problems, there is no better model cyanobacterial organism, and this means that routine Genetic Modifications that require cyanobacteria are rendered difficult so that many iGEM teams are put off from attempting to harness the potential offered by photosynthesizing bacteria. In light of this iGEM CLSB UK decided to take up the task of improving the ability of Synechocystis PCC 6803 in conjunction with our task to improve BPVs.

UFlorida,2017,Team:UFlorida#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," sample of the red interior was taken to be further examined under a compound light microscope. Under closer examination the red color came from what appeared to be septate hyphae.
Figure 5. Mycelium from site A
The mycelium also had white hyphae protruding from the red hyphae. This could explain the white fuzz that filled the petri dish. A water mite is seen feeding on this fungi with distinguishable chelicera and a cephalothorax.
Figure 6. Close up  of mycelium from Figure 5
Zoospores are seen being released in Figure 6. Three further isolations were conducted to identify if the white fuzz  and the red colony were the same fungi only at different developmental stages. It was also necessary to question whether or not they were chytrids. Input was sought from Dr. Timothy James from the University of Michigan. He confirmed the presence and identified the morphological forms as oomycetes (water mold).
October 5, 2017 - 3rd Isolation Attempt
Figure 7. 2nd isolation of the unknown fungi
Upon isolation it was discovered that the ‘white fuzz’ was of a different species than the reddish colony in the center of the plate. When these species were separated they then grew without the reappearance of the other.
Figures 8 & 9. Oomycetes and microparasites.
Figures 8 & 9 show the water mold in the multicellular haploid stage of its life cycle. The green patches were noted by Dr. Matthew Smith to be microparasites feeding off the water mold colonies.
Discussion
It was stated in the University Maine Chytrid Laboratory protocol (used for this experiment) that their method was more effective in the cooler months of the year. It was also noted that oomycetes over-run the baits when the water sampled is at warm temperatures. Because this experiment took place during the summer and in Florida, the result of obtaining oomycetes could have been predicted.

Know your enemy; Improving public awareness of biosciences
Currently, biotechnology in Latin America faces constraints that limit its social acceptance, mainly due to a lack or distortion of available information to decision makers and the general public. Our team was interested in evaluating and determining the perception that undergraduate students have about biotechnology and GMO’s through a survey, and the Honduran regulatory process for approving products derived from genetic engineering. After analyzing the results, we coordinated and conducted education and information activities with children and youth through basic biotechnology practices. Based upon the results, we were inspired to develop an educational model to improve awareness and criteria in Latin America about Synthetic Biology and modified living organisms. Finally, in order to demonstrate that Synthetic Biology can be safely practiced, we conducted a risk analysis of the E. zamofordi organism, created to detect copper residues in water sources, using the Cartagena Protocol and the Environmental Risk Assessment of genetically modified organisms’ guidelines (ERA). There are many approaches to conduct an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA). One is the ""Guidance of Environmental Risk Assessment"", developed by the Secretariat of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, as part of the Convention of Biological Diversity. The other approach is an ERA guide developed by a group of 14 Latin American regulators and biotechnologists. Our team has adopted the approach presented in the Latin American ERA guide, as the Honduran legislation regarding GMOs has been developed along the lines of other countries in Latin America such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Colombia, which already have experience in the deployment of GMOs. With this science-based approach we proved that our project,""Know your enemy"", complies with established biosafety norms, if handled according the relevant regulations. As an alternate product, we propose this tool as a simpler alternative to elaborate consistent risk assessments for Synthetic Biology practices and to comply with national and international biosafety regulations.

Every year before university commences new students at Physics attend a kick-off week where they get to meet each other, hear about Physics and university life and get accustomed to their new environment. SpaceMoss dropped by to tell them how awesome it is to study Physics and tell them to keep their eyes open for opportunities like the iGEM competetion and cross-disciplinary work.
Human Exploration and Space Flight
Kiruna, Sweden - August 15th 2015
SpaceMoss attended the course Human Exploration and Space Flight in Kiruna (Northern Sweden). The course is about the historical development of human spaceflight, an understanding of the requirements to be met in order to send humans into space now and in the future. During the course we discussed our idea with respected scientists and even an astronaut, launched rocket SpaceMoss and held a presentation for the course participants. Read more about the course here

Social Media
During the entire project we have been active on several social media platforms. With almost 600 followers on our facebook page and 200 on twitter we have shared our ideas, frustrations and not least our successes with a diverse group of people from all around the world.
Below you can see a screenshot of our facebook page and a selection of the pictures we have shared during the process.
#AMADEE15 Competition
We show our support and sent this Mars Pioneer photo with our best wishes to the AMADEE-15 Mars simulation mission. This social media campaign aimed to bring awareness about the AMADEE-15 mission and at the same time introduce the many people who are involved in Mars research and who make a contribution for humans to set foot on the red planet in the future. The competetion was a call for everyone who are dreaming about humans embarking on a trip towards Mars in the near future.
Although twitter has been a new platform for most of us (Twitter is not big in Denmark!) we have found that it has been a great way of sharing our progress. In particular, twitter has been invaluable for following companies and inspirational people who work with Space and/or Synthetic Biology every day, and in particular, other iGEM teams and the progress they've made.

3. Amplifier
Despite that, as an inflammatory signal, nitric oxide has good specificity and regionality. It is a                     reactive gas signal molecule with a short half-life [1], which decays sharply with increasing                     distance, suggesting that the input signal is very unstable. To overcome this drawback, we have                     introduced an amplifier in the sensor. The amplifier converts unstable gas signals into stable                     intracellular signals to gain sustained high-level output. The sustainability is very important                     because it also prevents signal attenuation in the immediate vicinity of the device due to                     anti-inflammatory drug delivery [2]. The amplifier is based on a positive feedback loop, and after                     the signal is input, the transcriptional activator B-A is generated, which includes a DNA binding                     domain and a transcriptional activation domain. On the one hand, B-A can activate the expression of                     the reporter gene, and on the other hand can activate the expression of B-A itself. In this way,                     B-A can self-drive in a manner independent of the input signal for a period of time after the                     signal of input, and the metabolic flow in"

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," a very big role when discussing the application of synthetic biology in real life. Researchers need to obey the juridical boundaries and on the contrary the legislature has to react to novel developments and find a compromise between many different opinions, some being more conservative, others more progressive. To reflect this interweaving, we additionally invited local politicians, such as Prof. Dr. Nicole Marmé who is member of the city council of Heidelberg. Dr. Stephan Brandt, chairman of the department for Biotechnological Innovation, Nanotechnology and Genetic Engineering, investigates how laws need to be adapted to the most recent findings in synthetic biology and genetics and we are very glad he joined us for this evening. Finally, the  topic that stands in the center of this evening is, after all, research in synthetic biology. For that reason, we asked Dr. Dirk Grimm, who works on the CRISPR-Cas system and who knows the cutting edge developments to be the scientific representative in the panel.
Jasmin and Max gave a great introduction to synthetic biology in medicine
After a lot of planning, organization and set up of all the required technical equipment (thanks again to Dr. Jens Wagner from the Physics Department), the discussion evening could start with a brief introduction to the topic given by Jasmin and Max from our team. As we wanted the main part of the evening to be an open discussion, we deliberately made the introduction very compact. For the remaining 1.5 hours of the evening, Tim navigated our guests, as well as the audience through the discussion.
The involvement of the audience was amazing, proving that this topic is indeed highly interesting to a large part of the society. Most eminently, we were very happy that additional to the approximately 100 guests that joined us physically in our institute, we had almost 400 viewers online, among them also other iGEM teams, such as iGEM Team Cambrige (link). Besides watching, our followers on twitter were also very engaged in asking questions that were then addressed by Tim and the invited experts.
Luckily, many people came to our talk evening. Even more joined us online via our simultaneously translated live stream and asked questions with #askigemheidelberg
The topics discussed ranged from green to red biotechnology and were contemplated in a highly interdisciplinary way (with the focus on medical applications nonetheless). Besides, and in correspondence to the initialization of the “Community lab” track in iGEM, we addressed biohacking and the implications of it on society, the scientific community and the communication between the two entities.

Additionally, we streaked plates with Serratia marcescens. Overall, the high school trip was a success and we got along really well with the students!
We attended the geekStarter workshop hosted by Alberta Innovates at the University of Calgary on Sunday, May 24. We presented questions about iGEM to a panel of experts. We also got one on one ""speed-mentoring"" with the experts as well as an exclusive group meeting with each of the four experts. Meeting the University of Lethbridge team was also quite cool!
After meeting with the experts, we decided to put the literature review on the back burner so that we could proceed with actual, physical experiments.
Week 4 - May 25 to 29
This week, we focused on perfecting our silver staining techniques. We are currently troubleshooting our gels because the stain comes out quite dark and with a lot of background staining.
We also started reaching out to local start-ups and companies looking for sponsorship and further funding.
Our team also started drafting versions of our wiki on this week. As we are not familiar with the mediaWiki interface, this task proved to be quite difficult. Our wiki did, however, go live later in the week. A lot of work is still necessary for the wiki because at this time, there was no content - just a template.
Week 1 - June 1 to 5
This week, we worked on and finalized the DNA sequences to be sent to IDT.
We also continued perfecting the silver staining techniques outlined by our principal investigator. Unfortunately, we are still experiencing difficulties in background clarity. We tried to switch out the vessels used during staining because we thought that residual silver was affecting our gels. However, even new pyrex containers did not make a difference in our final stained products. We are thinking now that the BioRAD Silver Stain Plus kit that was provided for us contains defective reagents.
Week 2 - June 8 to 12
This week, we really decided to focus our efforts into perfecting our silver stain techniques. Additionally, we divided all the tasks we have to do from now until Boston and divided them according to each of our team members strengths.
We also changed the look of our wiki this week. We opted for a more centralized design. Our new logo went live this week as well (we had to change it due to branding issues with our institution). We took inspiration from the separated protein bands in SDS-PAGE and we are"
ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Model#Environment Sensing#parameter fitting_-_-_TEXT.html," we could fit two parameters of our model: the expression level of luxR, and the leakiness of our promoter (both in log scale):
Figure 1. Fit of the expression level of luxR. Parameter space fitting the experimental data. Each point represent a parameter vector that significantly fit the experimental data. The blue points fit the data the best (least sum of square) while the yellow ones represent parameters combinations that barely fit the data (but still significant according to the chi2 test of goodness of fit). Fitted parameters are annotated in red. Unfortunately, a very large values of the Hill coefficient of the promoter in regards to LuxR-AHL were possible, thus it could not be fitted.
From our statistically significant fit and under the assumptions made, we can gather with a 95% confidence that:
The expression level of luxR in our system is equal to 41 ± 7 nM.min-1
Moreover, this expression level is very close to the expression level we aimed at (100 nM.min-1) during our preliminary parameter space analysis.
The leakiness of the PLux promoter in our system is equal to 3.9 ± 1.5 %
LuxI expression fitting
What experiment do we need to fit the expression of LuxI?
LuxI is the enzyme participating to the positive feedback loop by producing AHL that will bind to LuxR and lead to more activation of the promoter controlling the very own expression of luxI, closing the loop of positive feedback.
The strength of the expression of luxI (especially when at the basal activation, without AHL) is a parameter which strongly influences the bacterial cell density threshold at which our system activates. The same way we could deduce the expression level of luxR from the AHL dose response, we will here infer the expression level of luxI by testing over which bacterial cell density our system gets activated. This would not have been possible without knowing luxR expression first, as both parameters have an influence on the response of our system toward bacterial cell density. To see the response of our system to different cells concentration inputs,  we have designed and performed a quorum sensing end-point experiment to be able to fit our luxI expression parameter.
Assumptions on parameters

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," that this new and hybrid technology can be developed and which would not have emerged within the constraints of autonomous scientific disciplines. The concept of BioBricks is even a metaphor for this connection between engineering and biology as synthetic biology is often described in terms of ‘building’ and ‘designing’ of ‘standardised, hierarchical parts, devices and systems’ (Finlay 2013: 27). These subsequently produce a genetically engineered ‘machine’ (Robbins 2009: 1). Moreover, this iGEM interdisciplinarity has been stretched beyond biology and the applied sciences into the social sciences and humanities when ‘Human Practices’ became an award teams could compete for, and which is now called ‘Policy & Practices’. More is discussed on this topic in the next chapter.
Political Modernisation and Cross-border Collaborations
New developments in the global governance of science and technology have been sparked by the growth of transnational initiatives in synthetic biology. Moreover, it is the iGEM competition that seems to be spearheading this development as a result of cross-border practices and scientific uncertainty in synthetic biology as explained in previous chapters (Zhang et al. 2011). What is specifically noteworthy here in relation to the tandem of theories central in Sociological Imaginations, is how this relates to redefining the role of the state when it comes to environmental reform. The theory of ecological modernisation, for example, has questioned the position of the state vis-à-vis the re-assessment of production and consumption patterns. Although the state remains of great importance, and even continues to be the preeminent policy actor, in terms of environmental policy-making, governmental involvement has been urged to take a step back. Instead, it chooses to accommodate for measures of prevention, participatory politics and decentralisation. This eco-modernist view is also fuelled by the notion that the void that has been created as a result, is subsequently taken up by market forces.
The eco-modernist twist to the notion that uncertainty drives social change in the risk society, has been described by Pellizzoni (2011) in terms of ‘disorder’. The instability and incalculability of risks generated by late-modern society give rise to disorderly conditions but they are rendered manageable or governable because of the way the ‘ecologised’ neoliberal market shapes new institutional opportunities to handle the contingencies of emerging complexities. This approach to the nature of risks hence breaks with the idea of seeing them merely as a source of fear morphing into the trust deficit that grew out of it. Therefore, from this market perspective, the biotechnological practices"

The lower left part of the map is warmer. In this region, ${k_{on}}$ is high and ${k_{off}}$ is low, which means that two peptides are prone to associate. This is the very district where the state of split EBFP2 with intein lies in.
The higher right part, on the contrary, is chilling to the bones. Here, ${k_{on}}$ is low and ${k_{off}}$ is high, which means that the two parts tend to disassociate. The state of spilt EBFP2 without intein falls into this region.
If we compare the two figures in parallel, we can see that the values in the “titration” map is lower than those in the “dimer” map. This is in accordance with our experimental data. Wet lab work shows that with a constitutively-expressed part, channel capacity is lower. The model match and explain the phenomenon.
To sum up, mathematical modeling reveals the impacts of thermodynamic constants on the gene regulatory circuit’s ability to convey information.

Using CV Technology to Quantitative Forecasting
Hypothetically, you use the test paper we design and you can see three lines (Which means there are three kinds of mi-RNA have been found in your body fluid). Don’t worry, it doesn’t necessarily mean you got the cancer. Because the amount of those three mi-RNA has to satisfy this equation：
So, we have to turn the GFP brightness information into the possibility of patient being afflicted with cancer. And we use the CV technology to help us achieve that goal.
For example, we now have the photo of the test paper(The color of test paper itself might be light yellow due to the ambient light or the paper quality).
We use Matlab to read this file and we can get an array of the RGB value of this image.Then,we can use this function to calculate the Brightness of each pixel:Y=0.299*R+0.587*G+0.114*B
Then we have to normalize these data to eliminate the effect of the ambient light.We pick an pixel in the “white” area and calculate its brightness/255, set this as constant C, and use it to multiply every pixel’s brightness.
After that, we will get a new array of the normalized brightness information. We can use the relative position to pick 10 pixel in each line, and calculate the mean value of each line’s brightness. We"

The Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms could not crawl towards the alcohol without training.
Furthermore, we did the starvation treatment to our worms before the experiments, because of the hunger the worms would huddle together, however our Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms crawl to the alcohol (Fig.2 B)) which means that they sensed something they prefer at that time.

As well as simply speaking to the public, we wanted to give them something entertaining and informative that they could take away for themselves, and so the idea of a comic was born. Hugh has been met with a fantastic response, and has gone off on adventures all around the UK, being given to our audience at the Edinburgh Festival, sent to schools, libraries and museums, including the popular Wellcome Collection in London!

SCU-WestChina 2017 used insulator RiboJ and eGFP to measure the absolute protein expression ability of 10 promoters in Anderson's promoter family for the first time. After measuring the relationship between the absolute protein quantity and fluoresence with purified eGFP, we measured the eGFP fluoresence driven by different Anderson's promoters to achieve this goal. The measurement provides basic information for metabolic pathway construction because the proper absolute enzyme concentration is always needed to be consider to be consistent with the substrate concentration, which is never characterized in iGEM before.
The constitutive promoters are widely used in iGEM. Anderson's promoters are the most widely used constitutive promoter family. Those promoters are well characterized by RFP fluorescence. However, a key problem of generalizing the results of characterizations is that the dynamics of gene expression are influenced by the protein coded for. The RFP expression result might not compatible with our gene expression. In 2016 iGEM competition, team William_and_Mary tried to use insulator RiboJ to make relative expression levels similar between different proteins. They have verified this phenomenon as the paper published before. We adopted the same RiboJ insulator design to measure the 10 promoters from Anderson’s Promoters family by expressing eGFP to avoid the influence brought by different coding sequence for our pathway construction.
Why we start to do the measurement is that we need to calculate based on the urate concentration in the gut to evaluate if our pathway is efficient enough to reduce the urate in the gut, or there's unnecessary extra protein to express theoretically. At the time, absolute protein concentration expressed by different promoters should be known. We have to find out the relationship between eGFP quantitive protein concentration and the promoters. And that's the first time in iGEM to evaluate the absolute protein expression of a promoter with the help of insulator to predict the metabolic ability of a pathway. Our measurement provided a prospective for the teams to evaluate the efficiency of the pathway in the future.
To achieve this, we deciede to draw a standard curve of eGFP fluoresence-eGFP absolute protein quantity. We expressed the eGFP-6x his-tag in pET28a driven by T"

Thankfully, multiple of these species are carried by the sandfly vector which we are immunising against..
A brief clip from our recording of the meeting with Dr. Carrasco can be found here :
Regulation in Honduras
Now that we understood the condition on a scientific, clinical and epidemiological level in the country, we felt the need to gain an understanding of key regulators of Leishmaniasis control in the country. Firstly, talked with Dr. Carlos Ponce, the former director of Leishmaniasis strategy control in Honduras. He approved of our Limitless lactis vaccine idea and was very impressed by it as there is a real need for such a vaccine. We also spoke with Dr. Concepcion Zuniga, the current director of Leishmaniasis strategy control who offered us further insight into the regulatory aspects of treating this disease. From these conversations we learned a great deal about the positive and negatives of introducing a vaccine such as ours into the country.
Firstly we learned that regulation in Honduras is practically non-existent in comparison to regulation in the developed world. There is no regulatory body for health products in Honduras. They do follow Pan-American regulatory guidelines, but they are far less stringent than the tight, drawn-out regulation that we are used to at home in Ireland. This may be highly beneficial for bringing the Limitless lactis vaccine to market in the country as vaccines could potentially get from initial design to the market in under a year.
This system would ensure that we would have a much better chance of avoiding failure during preformulation studies and clinical trials and reaching the market than in Ireland, where often as low as 1 in every 10,000 compounds make it to the market following drug safety and efficacy studies (1). It would also open the opportunity that the vaccine could reach the suffering population of Honduras many years earlier than in the developed world (12-15 years), in which time it could save many lives and prevent the suffering of millions. In addition to this, the reduced expenditure on clinical trials and documentation during development could contribute to a reduction in the cost of the vaccine to the government, hence having an economical benefit to the country. This is especially important as public healthcare in the country doesn’t cover everybody due to lack of funds. Taking these points into account, the potential for the Limitless lactis vaccine to be utilised by the country seems very promising.
However, even with such benefits in place, we learned that a system like"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," are circular loops of DNA that exist separately from the main bacterial genome; they can replicate independently and be transferred between members of the same and different species. Plasmids commonly contain genes for antibiotic resistance and are the method by which species acquire resistance to multiple antibiotics.
While plasmids provide a mechanism of insertion of specific genes into a given bacteria, they do not represent a single permanent change. Over time, transformed bacteria may lose their plasmid and so their novel function. The result is that over time, the bacteria become less effective. It can be observed that over successive generations of cell division the likihood that both daughter cells receive a plasmid decreases, hence the frequency of the desired genes in the population decreases.
This is the so called gene loss, the inserted genes are effectively lost from the population. The reasons behind this are complex and not completely understood, and while the probability of a single transformed cell division producing plasmid-free daughter cells is very low, the likelihood of such an event is believed to be disproportionately increased by the reduced growth rate of transformed cells. One possible explanation for this is due to the additional genes transformed bacteria are able to carry out more processes. This in turn increases the metabolic burden on the bacteria and so the overall growth rate is reduced, meaning less frequent cell division. As such, over time, more transformed cells die than are replaced giving a net loss of transformed cells in a population. If this is the case, it may present an inherent shelf life on synthetic organisms.
While seemingly unavoidable, plasmid loss may not be entirely negative and instead may present a new opportunity for biocontainment. One of the key challenges with synthetic biology is controlling the modified organisms when they're used outside the lab. Genetically modified organisms may have inherent advantages as their new characteristics are from a distinct environment and, as such, efforts must be made to ensure they do not escape the environment of their intended use. Biocontainment may involve physical isolation (for instance inside a container that prevents the bacteria escaping into the wild), or genetic controls. These are called kill switches, genetic circuits inserted into the bacteria that cause them to die in the absence of a specific molecule usually provided in the growth media.
Both systems however have problems; physical containment can fail due to improper production, while kill switches effectively generate a selection pressure in favour of those with mutated kill switches as these bacteria will survive. Plasmid loss therefore may represent an effective way of ensuring genetically modified organisms do not cause damage to the natural ecosystem. In theory, if you could manipulate the rate of plasmid loss, you could control how long your bacteria remained"

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," high concentration of proteins to a remote site 2 . NU iGEM has explored this property of Gram-negative bacteria to deliver Cas9 and gRNA to pathogens, potentially far from the site of insertion into the body. OMVs can then be endocytosed by target pathogens 3 .
Other in vivo gene and protein delivery methods have been extensively studied in an effort to characterize a safe, clinical application for resensitizing antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Each of these methods suffers from drawbacks when compared with OMV delivery. Bacteriophages have been studied as a potential vehicle for CRISPR to knock out antibiotic resistance genes. A limitation of this delivery method is the large size of bacteriophages; infected tissues are not permeable to most phages 5 . Additionally, hydrodynamic injection has been investigated as a potential method to deliver plasmid DNA to animals for applications in gene therapy. The technique is essentially a rapid, intravascular injection of a large volume of DNA solution into a blood vessel or skeletal muscle tissue. Though this method does not involve viral gene delivery, the high volume of fluid causes temporary cardiac dysfunction, increased blood pressure across the liver, and significant expansion of the liver when tested on rats 6 .
Many potential avenues of in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 delivery have been explored, though these methods also carry disadvantages. Lipid-mediated transfection, the delivery of DNA or proteins encapsulated in engineered liposomes, can be taken up by a target mammalian cell via endocytosis 7 . This method was shown to work well for delivering functional Cas9-gRNA complexes into mammalian cells, but has never been shown to work for bacteria 8 . In comparison, OMVs have been well-documented as transporting molecules to bacteria.
Considering these limitations in current delivery methods, we have explored a novel method of Cas9 delivery to pathogens by utilizing the properties of naturally-occurring bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs).
Programming E. Coli to Translocate Cas9 to the Periplasm
Gram-negative bacteria have an inner and outer membrane; the “periplasm” refers to the region between these membranes. OMVs secreted from bacteria contain the periplasmic substance, as well as periplasmic nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules 9 . Proteins produced in the cytoplasm must be translocated to the periplasm in order to be delivered via OMV; as such, our primary goal this summer was to translocated Cas9 to the periplasm.
