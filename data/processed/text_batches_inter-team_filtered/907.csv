COLLABORATIONS
NU iGEM 2016 performed a variety of collaborative activities.
First and foremost, we collaborated with the University of New South Wales iGEM team. OMVs played a large role in both of our projects—we sought to use them as a delivery mechanism, and UNSW worked to standardize their generation, purification, and characterization for future projects such as ours. In order to standardize these procedures, UNSW needed to demonstrate that they can be replicated in other labs. To that end, NU iGEM 2016 provided UNSW with data collected after using their protocols to purify vesicles produced by our hypervesicular strain. We obtained data from a Bradford assay showing the total protein content in whole cells, periplasm, and OMVs using their purification protocol and sent them this data.
Our team also completed Munich United’s “Enabling Factors in Biotech” survey. Munich wanted to know what factors promoted or limited iGEM teams from creating startups. Our response was that we didn’t consider entrepreneurship because of inexperience with iGEM.
Finally, CRISPR Capsules also helped Purdue University’s team fund-raise their project, “Engineering E. coli to Treat Wastewater and Generate Electricity,” on the research crowdfunding platform Experiment. We donated to their project and promoted it on our social media.

Key hiding
Decoy
Hiding the key became called the decoy approach.The key-containing spore will be send in a mixture       of different decoy spores. The recipient has to be aware of       the special treatment that is required to select the       correct spores from the decoy. We have been working on a photoswitchable ciprofloxacin compound.
Only the knowledge about the right wavelength allows the       recipient to activate the added ciprofloxacin and thus       start selection of the right spore strain.
Our design of the decoy approach included the biobricks       for ciprofloxacin resistance, a superfolder GFP and a pATP       promotor.
Read more about the decoy experiment.
MIC and MBC values of ciprofloxacin
We determined the MIC and MBC of ciprofloxacin on       wild-type Bacillus subtilis 168 as well as the MIC       of E. coli Top 10 and B. subtilis 168       carrying the qnrS1 ciprofloxacin resistance gene.       We could observe  a significant improvement in antibiotic       tolerance when compared to the MIC values of the wild-type       strains. Additionally we obtained a B. subtilis 168 isolate by directed evolution which is even more       resistant to ciprofloxacin.
Our time-lapse video to the right shows germination of B. subtilis
Read more about the MIC and MBC experiments..
Key deletion
NucA key deletion
Another biological security layer is provided by our key       deletion system. This assures that only authorized parties       can access the key. We have been working on two different       approaches. The first is a nucA killswitch which is made       out of an assembly of different BioBricks. ATc or       tetracycline have to be added to inhibit the tetR promoter       to stop the expression of the nucA and digestion of the key       sequence.
CRISPR/Cas9 key deletion
The second approach makes use of a CRISPR/Cas9 system       which will delete the key from the genome if no special       treatment is applied. Addition of aTc or tetracycline will       stop the Cas9 expression.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#SravantiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to an object. While we were inspired by such a design, we decided to create a tree, which was very different from our icon idea. The tree creates a hierarchy of devices, part types, and specific parts, and the rule creation is implicit within the tree - we'll develop it more tomorrow!
Tuesday:
Today, we iterated on yesterday's design and developed it further. We thought of a user interface and thought of how to make our design more modular. Additionally, we worked through specific queries, and how we would actually search for things using both the icon and tree designs, which was helpful for our initial debugging and refining our design.
Wednesday:
Today, we thought through more of the details of both of our designs. We created a table which translated from our visual language (in this case, either the tree or icon designs) to Eugene code, and translated that into regular expressions. Looking at the technical details revealed even more details that we hadn't considered before, so we iterated on our designs again. Learning about regular expressions took some time though, so most of the translation was tricky and took some time. Tomorrow, we'll be preparing for our brainstorming session with BU!
Our brainstorming at the moment
Thursday:
Today, we created our materials that we're going to present to the BU team tomorrow during our big brainstorming session. We created a pamphlet which stepped through specific queries using the icon design, detailing step by step what the user interface would actually look like. Additionally, we created a large poster of our tree design, which illustrated a specific query. Additionally, we started giving some thought as to how we were going to display the search results. After some time, we came up with two preliminary ideas. One idea was a ""pile"" idea, which sorts results into piles, which also acts as a filtering tool. Our second idea was to create a tree of results, which has branches for each option/filter that the user could then sort through. However, we then ran into the issue of having thousands of search results, so we don't know how we'll deal with that scenario yet - hopefully the brainstorming session will help us out with that!
Friday:
Today was our big brainstorming session! We presented both our icon and tree ideas to the BU team, and we got a lot of constructive and helpful feedback. We got a lot of mixed reviews - people loved the icon idea for rule making, but appreciated the tree's structure for viewing the circuit as a whole - they wanted to have both interfaces as well as a way for them to actually see the Eugene code and code if need be."

OVERVIEW
Compared to last year, we have made improvements and more efforts in sharing knowledge related to synthetic biology with the public. We established the iGEM community at our school to introduce not only the competition itself, but synthetic biology and iGEM knowledge to all students as well. We participated in various science and technology forums held on campus. However, in our daily life, we  felt deeply the lack of understanding of synthetic biology among the local people. Therefore, we planned to issue a questionnaire to investigate the matter. We were inspired by CCiC to officially issue the questionnaire and analyze the results. Through analysis, it turned out that our concerns were justified, but not as seriously as we thought. So，we investigated and found that many schools in our country, especially high schools, lack biological laboratories, resulting a general paucity of biological knowledge. We strongly believe that we need to start exposing children to the study of these subjects for a young age, so we decided to pursue a cooperative project with a local high school. Since we already had a relationship with OUC-China at CCiC, they allowed us to use the beautiful comics they had designed for the purpose of presenting the subject of synthetic biology in a manner suitable for younger children.Using these comics, we gave high school students a presentation to give them an awareness of synthetic biology. Also, we invited them to come to our lab to learn and communicate during their spare time.
Education
We hope that more people, especially those who are unfamiliar with biological knowledge, will learn about it, and wish this could provide tools, knowledge and opportunities for people who are not familiar with synthetic biology, and have a two-way dialogue with them. We also hope that through our publicity on synthetic biology, more and more people can be inspired and even contribute to this field.
A. Establishing an iGEM community
We have learned that many college students have studied biological knowledge during high school. Some of them have not chosen to major in biology for some reason, who are full of interest in biology. So we established the IGEM community in university campus, eager to bring together like-minded and enthusiastic young people.
Club activities

So far, we have held two lectures. We have sent invitations throughout the school and hope that all interested students will participate in"

Rationale and Aim
Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations that hamper success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors.
This part can be used within the platform as a processor unit. Real world applications of biosensors are limited by many factors, one of which is that with most biosensors there is not a readout signal showing if the biosensor is working when not in use, i.e that the cells are still alive and have not lost their biosensor phenotypes. This can make them difficult to use, as well as market, since their viability comes into question as well as leading to false negatives/positives.  Biosensors which rely on expression of a reporter signal may also suffer from unobserved activation due to weak or inconstant induction.
For this section of the project, as an improvement on a part by the Tokyo Tech 2015 team ( BBa_K1632013) , we aim to produce a biobrick compatible part which is able to constitutively express a reporter signal prior to activation (to show that it is functioning) and to amplify a weak or inconsistent induction signal by permanently switching from an [OFF] to [ON] state after induction.
Background Information
Expression of the E. coli type 1 fimbriae gene is tightly regulated and phase dependent, i.e expression is either completely [ON] or [OFF] (Klemm, 1986). This change in expression is controlled by the action of two proteins FimB and FimE which independently act upon a 300bp promoter region upstream of the fimbriae gene.  The 300bp promoter region is inverted to either activate or suppress expression (McClain et al., 1991). Typical gene regulation mechanisms rely on up or down regulation of a promoter from a baseline expression, the fimbriae mechanism of ‘"

Singapore iGEM Team
After reading that we were continuing on from last year’s project, the NTU-Singapore team approached us offering to help us knock in our very large plasmids (>10kbp). After further discussion we decided against this option as it would be too hard to coordinate in the little time we had left (September to October).
Coincidentally, we started a CRISPR-Cas9 approach this year as well. This led to the sharing of ideas and developed into other possible collaborative work. For our CRISPR-Cas9 project, we managed to show in vitro that our gRNA-Cas9 complex was able to target and cleave the PCR product of our target gene, hemH. This assay also provides a quick and easy test to their Cas9, which was their overall goal. Our collaboration involved testing their Cas9 in bacterial cells which would help to characterise their Cas9 functions when compared against the commercial Cas9 we acquired for our own experiments.
To facilitate this, NTU-Singapore did a purification tag switch (FLAG to 6xHis) so that we could purify their mutants of interest with high yields for characterisation using our in vitro assay design. In return, they attempted to help us generate a hemH knockout, and perform RT-PCR on our Magnesium chelatase plasmid containing 6 genes, for which we have functional assays to show that it works.
In summary what we did for them:
Sent the NTU-Singapore team our Mg-chelatase operon plasmids and primers designed
for each gene for the RT-PCR
Purified and characterised their Cas9 mutants of interest proving their mutant enzyme functions
What they did for us:
Sent us their Cas9 mutant plasmids after cloning in a His-tag

Testing toxicity of pcol Ia-ssp2 and pcol E9-ssp1and pcol E9-ssp2: A group of colonies of pcol Ia-MCS and pcol Ia-ssp2, pcol E9-ssp1 and pcol E9-ssp2 were added to 1ml LB and OD adjusted to 1.0A, then serial diluted 1/10 6 times. These were then spotted onto 0.2% glucose, 0.2% arabinose and 0.4% arabinose plates. No toxicity was observed.
From the plate toxicity tests we would expect to see inhibition of cell growth in the areas spotted with pcol Ia-ssp2, pcol E9-ssp1 and ssp2. However, the cells grow normally in these areas and do not differ significantly from the pcol Ia-MCS control. We concluded that although our toxins were being expressed, they were not being secreted by the cell. Therefore we would need to find a way of enabling our toxins to exit their producing cell and reach their target cell. So we decided to design a lysis cassette to include in our construct.  While our lysis construct was being put together we did some lysis experiments in the lab to test this concept.
Lysis Experiment
When the plate toxicity tests presented a negative result, we concluded that the modified colicins may not be being secreted by the cell, therefore we lysed the cells and spotted them on MG1655 E. coli to test their toxicity.When the plate toxicity tests presented a negative result, we concluded that the modified colicins may not be being secreted by the cell, therefore we lysed the cells and spotted them on MG1655 E. coli to test their toxicity.

The loading module of Amphotericin contain an redundant domain DH that can’t modify the starter unit or any other polyketide unit[11]. We eliminate the DH domain of Amphotericin to optimize loading module.(figure.4)
Figure4: Elimation of redundant dh of amphotericin
Finally, we will test the seletivity of diffenent AT so that we can determine the structure by selecting the substrates. AT domain is responsible for selecting CoA linked extender as building blocks for constructing the polyketide chain[12].
3.2 ""programming"" the PKS
By all these work we do, we can control the structure of polyketide in three aspect: by choosing or engineering the appropriate host, the supplement of building blocks will be enough[13][14]; then, by choosing the suitable loading module and KS-AT domain, the PKS can select the building blocks of polyketide synthesis. Finally, according to the structure of polyketide, we can insert different modified domains into specific module, so that the building blocks can be modified correctly.
We will try to establish a database that can provide the information about the utilization of  standardized domain. According to the structure of polyketide that user need, the database can provide the information about the assemble of standardization domains and host needed for synthsis. Achieving the programmed synthesis of polyketide.(figure5)
Figure5: how do we produce new polyketide. a) approriate host for producing substrate; b)choose suitable didomain KS-AT to select correct building blocks; c)arrange the suitable proccessing domains to modify the polyketide chain.

STUDENT EXPERIENCES
Here are some thoughts from a few of the high school and undergraduate students who took part in our iGEM Summer Camp:
Michael Siarkowski
Michael is a first year Science student at the University of British Columbia. He is incredibly interested in iGEM and plans to be part of a team (either UBC or UofC) in 2010. He is also a member of the UBC Thunderbirds Swim Team.
Julia Martin
Julia is a second year science student at Dalhousie University.
Previous to my tour of the iGEM lab at the University of Calgary I was unfamiliar with the project, really only having heard snippets here and there about it from my friend, and UofC iGEMer, Jeremy. I had no idea that there was such a fantastic undergraduate initiative out there for students to engage in! One of a kind, I discovered that iGEM was an international competition utilizing techniques in the up-and-coming field of synthetic biology to engineer and modify basic processes of life. I was intrigued that iGEMers literally got to play around with bacteria and make them do such things as glow green or smell like bananas as if they were LEGO. I find it remarkable that although the actual work involved in producing these results is a great deal more tedious and complex then simple LEGO pieces, the fact that these results can be produced is revolutionary.
Moreover, I found out that the U of C iGEM team is not merely concerned with lab work. It was interesting to see how they had members working fulltime in other initiatives such as SecondLife, Marketing and Ethics. I liked the fact that were so many aspects to the project and that there were different things within iGEM to be involved in, whatever your interests. In addition, I really admired the U of C team because it seemed that they had built a strong working relationship and were on track to start building a community. The facilitator of the project, Sonja, allowed freedom within the project that allowed for all kinds of hands-on learning, and it sounds like the team members were able to learn more than they did in any type of biology class. I admired the sense of trust and support that the lab seemed to have, and I am excited to hopefully be a part of iGEM myself in the future!

Does Synthetic Biology raise concerns on health or moral grounds?
Synthetic Biology is not a field of Science devoted to health issues. It is a swet of methods aimed to work in Biology the way they do in Engineering. In the worst case scenario, everything can be used to cause damage. Although this is not a goal of SB and there must be control mechanisms to prevent scientist misconduct that may result in health, environmental or moral damage.
Would it be possible to insert human genes in a fish so it may breathe out of the water? (Callum Chapple)
The respiratory system is too complex to be reproduced in a foreign organism as of today or in the near future.
Is it hard to mix Biology and Engineering?
Frankly, yes. Engineers are used to work with very high accuracy, to known the behavior of every part inserted in a circuit, to models that reproducibly mimic the real syste. Biology is an experimental science dealing with complex natural systems: living beings. This means that it is almost impossible to know how a biological system works before trying; and even then it is difficult to measure accurately the parameters that define the behavior of the system. Engineers work in human-designed, rational systems and biologist in nature-designed systems where randomness is always present and even when it is possible to isolate a part to measure is properties, these will surely change depending on the biological context. Synthetic Biology based on parts is trying to bridge the gap setting standardized parts and hierarchy levels but this is still running.
How did you get involved in Synthetic Biology? (Francisca Elena López Pérez)
Thanks to iGEM. It was our opportunity to learn beyond our degree, to get practice in the lab (wet and dry) and feel responsible of an entire"
Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," are naturally occuring peptide sequences that splice out of a precursor protein and attach the remaining ends together to form a new protein. When splitting those intein sequence into an N-terminal and a C-terminal split intein one is left with a powerful tool to post-translationally modify whole proteins on the amino-acid sequence level. This construct was designed to express any protein of interest fused to the Nostoc punctiforme DnaE N-terminal split intein.
BBa_K1362101
BBa_K1362101 is the corresponding C-terminal construct to BBa_K1362100. Upon coexpression or mixture of the N- and C-constructs protein splicing takes place and the N- and C-terminal proteins of interest are irreversibly assembled via a newly formed peptide bond.
This mechanism can be applied for a variety of different uses such as the activation of a protein through reconstitution of individually expressed split halves. See our split sfGFP experiment set a foundation that you guys can build on!
Sample Data Page for our favorite Parts.
Circularization Construct. BBa_K1362000
This part represents an easy way to circularize any protein. In a single step you can clone your protein in the split intein circularization construct. Exteins, RFC [i] standard overhangs and BsaI sites have to be added to the coding sequence of the protein to be circularized without start- and stop codons by PCR. By Golden Gate assembly, the mRFP selection marker has to be replaced with the protein insert.      If the distance of the ends of your protein of interest aren't close enough to connect them you will need a linker. BBa_K1362000 , the split intein circularization construct, includes a strong T7 RBS ( BBa_K1362090 ), we sent to the parts registry as well, and the split intein Npu DnaE. The T7 RBS derived from the T7 phage gene 10a (major capsid protein).
The resulting plasmid can be used to express the protein of interest with the obligatory linker and the N- and C-intein.
In an autocatalytic in vivo reaction, the circular protein is formed. To read more about the trans-splicing reaction visit our Intein Background page. If corresponding split inteins are added to both termini of a protein, the trans-splicing reaction results in a circular backbone.
Circular proteins offers many advantages. While conserving the functionality of their linear counterpart, circular proteins can be superior in terms of thermostability, resistance against chemical denat"

Script writing
Click on the download button to download a copy of the script.
Figure 1: Chris and Deborah Pearson (professional theatremaker) hacking away at the first draft of the script. (Picture by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
Using creative writing as a form of outreach is a novel approach that has not been taken by any other iGEM team before. For episode four of Radio iGEM Chris, who had taken a creative writing course during his second year, decided to write a script that is set in a world where our platform technology is widely implemented. In order to create this world and make it believable he decided to set it in a familiar setting. By weaving the world seamlessly into the narrative of a short high school setting.
Also, in order to give a little bit of a background to this world he decided to use a common trick that involves using a narrative within a narrative. By using the context of a history lesson it was easy to use Mrs. Parkin's dialogue as a plot device to introduce the background in a non-intrusive manner. Then, by using the dialogue between the characters he was able to keep it entertaining while also making it relatable to the listener. By making the world a believable and yet familiar, he hoped to take out the fear that is associated by many people with the unknown of genetic engineering.
The editing process for this short story consisted of a workshop where Deborah Pearson (a professional theatremaker), our RCA advisor CJ (who cooked a lovely meal for us as well) and Kerri Hall (actress and comedienne) took the story and relentlessly slashed through any sections and sentences that were not up to scratch. This process took several hours but it was all worth it in the end. Jake (the ""antagonist"") became more snarky than before while Mrs. Parkin"

NYMU-Taipei,2015,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," any commercial product, it must be designed, built, and tested. Even making relatively small changes can take a lot of work, time and money.
DNA synthesis has to be cheap, fast, predictable, accurate, and open to all, including researchers whose labs lack equipment or funding.
The engineering of genetic circuits, biological modules, and synthetic pathways is beginning to address these crucial problems and is being used in related practical application. If human beings could similarly learn to build and control novel living systems, synthetic biology could then trigger a biotech revolution.
Camp
In order to promote IGEM, we invite high school student to come to National Yang Ming University. We introduce the current situation of synthetic biology and let them know more about IGEM. After that, we introduced our project to them and answer any questions regarding iGEM or our project itself. Later we distribute IGEM into four parts and introduce one by one. The four parts are wet lab, dry lab, wiki and policy & practice. By this, they can clearly understand what will do if they join in IGEM. The schedule is as following.
2015/08/15 (Saturday)
10:00~10:30 Check in
10:30~11:00 Introduction of IGEM   Introducing what IGEM and synthetic biology are
11:10~12:00 Introduction of our 2015 NYMU iGEM project Including NYMU team presentation and Q&A
12:00~13:00 Lunch pizza
13:00~13:30 Lab tour
Introducing the environment of the wet lab
13:40~14:10 Introduction of wet lab

To know the efficiency of the camp, we make a questionnaire. We find out that the percentage of thinking this camp is helpful is over 60% in every aspect.
Non government organization/ public
We contacted lots of non government organizations, not only to promulgate our project but also to get support from their resources, in order to get public’s attention. We also attended numerous forums to gather opinions from different perspectives.

About  the Team
As the first modern university in China, Tianjin University has a history of 120 years. However, our School of Life Sciences is very young and fresh, which was founded in 2012. Though our college is so young, we have made many achievements owing to the great supports given by our university and the hard work of our professors and graduates.
This year is the first year when our school took part in the iGEM competition. The recruitment included all undergraduates in our university. After resume screening, audition and a tough winter vacation work which required candidates to submit a complete project design with protocols, 22 students were chosen as the members of team Tianjin 2015.
Our team consists of students majoring in life sciences, chemical/pharmaceutical/biological engineering, computer science, and even electric engineering. In particular, Yifan Zhang in computer science is from Zhejiang Sci-tech University. We are divided into four groups which are responsible for wet lab, wiki&design, modeling and human practice.
In our iGEM journey, our instructors always give us great help, and many graduates shared their experience with us. Since all of us are green hands in biological research, a small step for our project could be a gaint leap for ourselves. No matter what the result is, we have spent a happy and fulfilling time all together.
It is the second time for Ketong to take part in iGEM. And this year not many people would play jokes on him because he has become the team leader and usually shows his straight face. He doesn't like pretty loli anymore, but he still loves female.
Dongqi is another leader in our team. She is lazy in body but hardworking in mind. Larry in the book The Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is"

Outreach
Back in May, applied and received a Building with Bio kit through NSF. The kit is designed to help out with outreach events. While many of the activities were aimed at children in elementary school through high school, there was also a kit to set up a forum discussion designed for anyone over the age of 14. The activities focus on synthetic biology and exposing people to genetic modification. We were lucky enough to partner with a local children's science museum in the Lansing area for our event - Impression 5. We are incredibly thankful for the help of those at the museum for allowing us to set up in an open area of the museum and work with the kids and their families.
On Saturday, September 17, our team stopped by Impression 5 to run our outreach event. We brought two activities with us: Kit of Parts and Super Organisms.

Negative PCR results. Found out that Håkon had used a too short elongation time for my samples to be amplified. Have to do a new PCR on the colonies.
Vilde
Dephosphorylated pSB1C3. Used the pSB1CR Izadora cut (with EcoRI and PstI)and purified from gel yesterday. Used 17ul of purified pSB1C3, 2ul of 10X buffer and 1ul of phosphatase. Let the reaction in 37 degrees for 15 minutes and heat inactivated the enzymes by leaving the sample at 75degrees for 5 minutes. Stored the sample at -20 degrees.
Vilde
Assembled parts into dephosphorylated pSB1C3. Used the dephosphorylated pSB1C3 and parts digested 01.08. Ligation reaction sample: 2ul pSB1C3, 2ul Part, 1ul 10X buffer, 0,5uL enzyme and 4,5ul DH2O. Transformed 5ul and plated out on CAM plates. These parts will be the new biobrikcs we will send to the iGEM register.
Izadora
An A3 assembly was performed making a dephosphorylation with the enzyme FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase in the plasmids before ligating it and following the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Scientific).
The digestion enzymes that iGEM’s protocol suggests were used and the buffers as following:
Part A: Cut Smart buffer
Part B: Cut Smart buffer
Plasmid: NEB 3.1 buffer
Part A: NtermHisTag
Part B: LacZ-alpha Stop
Part A: LacZ-alpha Non Stop
Part B: CtermHisTag
Part A: CtermHisTag
Part B: T1
Part A: NtermHisTag
Together with the A3 assembly the re-ligation or circularization of the following linearized plasmids without dephosphorylation was attempted: pSB1A3, pSB1K3, pSB1T3.

Science Manual for elementary school kids
June - October 2017
Throughout the process of making our genetically engineered machine, we also focused on the importance of spreading science to people and most importantly to those in their early stages in life. This is why, in collaboration with the other two mexican iGEM teams we created a fun science manual full of easy experiments for elementary school students. This manual is intended to be presented to the Mexican Ministry of Education. Each team collaborated in proposing 10 different experiments according to the national educational plan. We validated the experiments in public and private schools in the cities of Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Mexico City where we got feedback from teachers and students. We aim to awaken the children’s curiosity and to bring them closer to scientific activities to, in the long term, increase the scientific development in Mexico. For more detail please visit our Collaborations section.

This means in our model that the warrior cannot actually kill another warrior, but can activate the RFP expression of another warrior. And more RFP inside bacteria means the bacteria is killed more by warrior in other side.
    In conclusion, we can say that killing ability of warrior I is larger than that of warrior II when they are co-cultured together, RFP inside warrior II increase faster (indicating speed of accumulating strength, more details will be shown below) or increase to a higher steady state level. (indicating maximal killing effect.). (The initial amounts of two warriors are same.)
III Gene circuit of warrior in the model
Note: Here for simplicity, we hypothesize that this gene circuit is orthogonal.
IV ODE parameters and its resource
Note: This is part of fluid model to help us solve this specific problem. Detailed explanation can be seen at Fluid Model. Subscript 1 indicate warrior I, subscript 2 indicate warrior II. AHL1 is C4HSL and AHL2 is 3OC6HSL.

2. AHL1 (Produced by warrior I) molecule concentration inside cell (molecule/cell)
3. AHL2 (Produced by warrior II) molecule concentration inside cell (molecule/cell)
4. AHL1 (Produced by warrior I) molecule concentration inside environment (molecule/medium)
5. AHL2 (Produced by warrior II) molecule concentration inside environment (molecule/medium)
6. Amount of RFP inside the cell (a.u/cell)
7. Amount of AHLI1 inside warrior I (molecule/cell)
8. Amount of AHLI2 inside warrior II (molecule/cell)：
V Original Parameter set of the model
VI Results of model
Note:
1. Since we have assumed that the increasing rate and carrying capacity of two warriors are same, so in the model, the amount of two warriors are same at all the time.
2. In the following description, we will show how to regulate killing ability of warriors by showing how to regulate killing abilities of two warriors to the same level!
3.Killing effect means the real time effect of one warrior on the other, but killing ability is a global property that partly describe how killing effect of one warrior change as time.

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," regarding human embryonic stem cell research, the Catholic Church does not oppose synthetic biology. Following the publication of a paper from the J. Craig Venter Institute, an official from the Catholic Church praised the development as “a further mark of man’s great intelligence, which is God’s gift enabling man to better know the created world and therefore to better order it.”[32] The statement encouraged continued synthetic biology research, provided that the research proceeded responsibly and did not undercut the sanctity of life.
Faith-based scientists also declared: “absolutely nothing accomplished in synthetic biology by way of synthesizing the genome of a self-replicating bacterial cell from its component parts - which is the most striking and specific technical achievement of the Venter Institute team - demonstrates that life is without mystery or value that goes beyond the assembly of its parts. The mystery of life is amply great, as both religious and secular minds can appreciate, to survive even the most masterful scientific feats[33]” . While religious thinkers suggested caution regarding the human tendency toward hubris, none expressed concern that synthetic biologists were “playing God”, which is an argument that can often arise in debates on this subject.[34]
Despite all that, we believe that there should be strict guidelines in place to regulate synthetic biology research, because responsible science should reject the technological imperative: the mere fact that something new can be done does not mean that it ought to be done. Conversely, how do we ensure regulations do not impede the progress of development? Three principles are prescribed to ensure that : the precautionary principle, the proactionary principle and the prudent vigilance. The first prescribes halting or substantially slowing the progress of scientific research until risks can be identified and mitigated. The second assumes that an emerging biotechnology should be considered “safe, economically desirable and intrinsically good unless and until shown to be otherwise”[35]. The last is a middle ground of those extremes, it prescribes to carefully monitor, identify, and mitigate potential harms over time.
In conclusion, biotechnology has the potential to affect everyone, and opportunities for the public to participate in discussion and deliberation about emerging technologies such as synthetic biology are critical. Robust public participation is essential in both the development and implementation of specific policies as well as in a broader, ongoing national conversation about science, technology, society, and values for the future.
Conclusion
Each team had an interesting experience doing this collaboration. We had the chance to exchange different points of view from our different countries and we managed to write a great report out of those discussions. Unfortunately, we barely covered three areas of the"

Since the beginning of 2017, a group of young people who are interested in synthesis biology came together. We are from different places in the world, from China to America, form eastern hemisphere to western hemisphere. We held the winter and summer camp, by convening 15 young teenagers together. We   brainstormed and discussed to design our project. We worked together closely to collect samples, conduct the experiments, raise funding, and finally fulfill our target.
Communication
Field Trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University
On July 20th and 21st, 2017, our team took a field trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University to attend a meeting with instructors and students from their former iGEM teams. We explained our project idea and they warmly offered several specific suggestions in our experiment design and human practice. Informed that our attempt was to improve the salt resistance of the yeast and increase the efficiency of food waste disposal, they generously provided us some information from the former teams who had studied the similar project from a different perspective.
CGEM Forum
In August and September, we contacted many iGEM teams in China and invited them to attend the CGEM (China Genetically Engineered Machine) Forum in October, which is organized by our team together with CIEI-BJ.
On 4th, Oct. the First CGEM Forum was held in meeting room “Reddish Lake” on the 4th floor of WenJin International Hotel. In respond to the invitation, two high-school teams (HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou and RDFZ-China) and one college team from Tsinghua University came to the forum. In total, more than 70 teachers and students attended the conference. Our team was in duty of welcoming, leading the people, setting the room, as well as doing signing up for visitors.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

The aim of this course was to introduce non-biologists to basic techniques of micro- and molecular biology. That way, the non-biologists were able to assist the biologists, so that the ""experts"" could concentrate more on experimental planning and on the interpretation of results. The idea was to grasp this chance of an interdisciplinary project and offer the students the possibility to get an insight into a field that differs significantly from their own. Therefore, the modelers became comfortable in the lab, and the biologists learned something about modeling.

[9] The amino acid sequence of CPP-PYY complexes is LEAGCKNFFPRSFTSCGSLE, and we sought to cut through Arg-Ser(R-S) site. Therefore, data of Arg-Thr(R-T) site in salmon calcitonin was taken for reference, because Ser and Thr are both polar and uncharged residue. The figure of time to percentage of Arg-Thr cleavage is shown below. However, due to the fluid motion in circulation, we supposed that nearly 100% of the complexes would be cleaved during 30 minutes.

Healthin Drug Effect
Steinert RE et al. had administrated the intragastric load of a mixed liquid meal on subjects for observing the plasma concentration of active PYY after meal, as shown in Fig.1-5-1. [10] The physiological PYY concentration in plasma is approximately 45 pg/ml, and it reaches maximum at 113 pg/ml after 30 minutes of food intake. To prevent the potential side effect of PYY resistance, as well as exert the optimal appetite suppresion effect at the same time, we sought to control the PYY concentration at the level of 100 pg/ml (0.1 μg/L) after taking Healthin.

Basic fermentation
We first powdered the algae, removed the lignin and then treated remains with the enzyme solution to produce cellobiose and xylose.
In order to engineered the yeast for utilizing cellobiose and xylose as carbon resources, we cloned relative genes to a shuttle plasmid in E. coli cell, then transformed it to yeast. We prepared SC medium  containing xylose and cellobiose as the only carbon resources, so that we can verify that we have already cultivated the strain which can grow with merely cellobiose and xylose as their carbon sources. If our novel strains grow significantly better than the negative control (which does not have the gene GH-1, CDT-1, or XYL1, XYL2) we can prove that our ideas are feasible and the genetic circuit works well.
At the same time, we used HPLC to detect the concentration changing of cellobiose and xylose, and got more data to support our idea that the engineered yeast can utilize cellobiose and xylose as carbon sources. If the concentration of xylose/cellobiose decrease with time. SBA biosensor can detect the reaction process of substrate by immobilized enzyme as electrochemical signal, which supports us to describe a curve reflecting the ethanol generation under culture condition. Here, we prove that two engineered yeast strains can utilize cellobiose and xylose to produce ethanol directly.
Pretreatment
1.Enteromorpha physical pretreatment.
2.Treat the residue with 0.2% H2O2 to remove the lignin.
3.Preparation of the enzymatic hydrolysis solution of Enteromorpha fiber.
4. The validation of xylose and cellobiose content after pretreatment.

Characterized BioBricks
Divergent promoters from Gifsy1 phage and Gifsy1 repressor GogR
BBa_K374008
This part contains the promoters: pRGifsy1 and pRMGifsy1. Downstream of the pRMGifsy1 promoter is the repressor gogR. gogR binds to the operator regions located between the two divergent promoters and is predicted to act both as an activator of the pRMGifsy1 and a repressor of the pRGifsy1.
This regulatory biobrick can be used in a biological circuit. Other BioBricks can be inserted downstream of the pR promoter, however, no expression will be allowed because of the GogR repressor. BBa_K374008 can be combined with BBa_K374010 hence allowing expression of your inserted BioBrick.
For more information look here or in parts-registry, BBa_K374008
Divergent promoters from Gifsy2 phage and Gifsy2 repressor GtgR
BBa_K374009

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Following the successful demonstration at the faire, we intend the wonderland and synthetic biology to children in school, teaching them basic concepts of synthetic biology and raising their awareness on the problem of stray cats. Afterwards, children can decorate the wonderland with markers and paper cuttings, so as to cultivate their DIY skills and reinforce what they have learnt through arts.

During the way to the proceeding of our lab project as well as our endeavor to let the world improve our project and meanwhile influencing the world, we have done a lot. We record and recall the entire story and make it into a documentary series. The documentary shows how we spared no efforts to conceive our human practice and communicate with the externality to contribute to solving the stray cat problem.

Episode 0: Fenghua Li, we intimately call her ‘Aunt Li’, is the sponsor of the organization ‘Li Fenghua stray cat rescue’ in Beijing. She persists in feeding, neutering and saving stray cats for 20 years without a single day-off. She rescues cats as a full-time profession. However, the cat shelter she built was destroyed by an arsonist two years ago and after that the government was prohibiting the construction of new cat shelters. Thence she had to roam across the city to feed those helpless creatures and to catch and to neuter them as well as to treat them when they are injured or sick, whereas when Aunt Li was injured or sick she had to carry on. Moreover, Aunt Li is suffering from osteoporosis for many years. Her life is a hardship even though a lot of people gave her hands. GreatBay_China helped her in raising funds and public awareness.
This video starts with Rocky on his way to interview Aunt Li and ends with Aunt Li’s future expectations and how we helped her.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2015,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Society_-_-_TEXT.html," general feeling towards GMO. The respondent were asked to express their feeling on a scale from 1-10 were 1 relates to a very negative attitude and 10 a very positive attitude. What the general public answered can be seen on top and what academics answered can be seen in the bottom picture. These results include both answers from Sweden and the Czech Republic.
Where people have received information from about GMO varies. Media is very prevalent in both the Swedish and the Czech answers within all ages as well as within the academic world. The internet (mostly younger people) and friends are also common answers. School and social media seem to be a more common source of information, especially for younger people, in Sweden than in the Czech Republic. Scientific articles dominates in the academic field however quite a few people in the public have also gained information about GMO from articles. While only a few (14 from the public and 2 from academics) claim to have had no information, most people of the public agree that they have not obtained enough information about GMO to really understand what it is and make rational decisions about it. Most academics claim they have obtained enough information.
Figure 2, a comparison of the results obtained regarding how the respondent had obtained information about GMO. The question was of multiple-choice character meaning each respondent could give a different amount of answers. How the general public said they had received information can be seen on top and how academics have received information can be seen in the bottom picture. These results include both answers from Sweden and the Czech Republic.
Almost all academics knew GMO can be used in more than crops while only half of the public, both in Sweden and in the Czech Republic, knew about this. Generally, people of the public are more reluctant towards using GMOs in food and crops but more positive about using it in medicine, fuel and other materials. Both academics and the public mostly agree that it’s important to do thorough research on the effects of GMO but are a little more split on the production of new GMO-products. Although true for the whole survey, the interpretation of the question is particularly important when it comes to these two questions. Some of those who were positive about new products added something along the lines of “as long as the effects are well known and safe” and some of those against added “because we need to know they are safe and the effects are well known”.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Assembly_-_-_TEXT.html,"We obtained our modified PBAD BBa_K2082112 through site-directed mutagenesis of BBa_K808000 .
Figure 1: Alignment between promoter sequence from BBa_K808000 (wt-PBAD )       and the modified PBAD sequence.
In addition to the low basal activity, the PBAD has the advantage of tuneable experssion strength, that is controlled by addition of different amounts of arabinose.    We estimated that controllable amounts of mutagenic proteins     would also result in different amount of mutagenesis, thus enabling a tuneable mutagenesis.
In addition to the titrable promoter activity by adding arabinose PBAD can be repressed by adding glucose. Glucose decreases intracellular     3',5'-cyclic AMP concentration, thereby lowering expression of PBAD promoter (Miyada et al. 1984).
We characterized our modified PBAD BBa_K2082112 by adding the RFP expression system BBa_K516032 downstream and measurement of RFP after different amounts     of time and with various amounts of arabinose added. The measurement was performed in the Top10 strain, which is deficient for arabinose metabolism (araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7697).
Figure 3: Measured expression of BBa_K2082112 in comparison to BBa_K808000 . RFP expression via BBa_K516032 was used for promoter characterization, and the promoter was induced by addition of arabinose. After 300 min RFP fluorescence was normalized       on OD600.
No difference in leakiness could be observed. The addition of 20 mM glucose represses the promoter slightly and decreases promoter strength by about 65 % to 52 %, compared to no addition. Addition of arabinose activates the promoter, in which increased amounts of inductor leads to increased promoter activity.    In total is the modified PBAD BBa_K2082112 a bit weaker than BBa_K808000 .    The main aim in decreasing promoter basal activity was not proven. Perhaps the used method has to be optimized further for detection the already small basal activity of BBa_K808000 and compare it with our modified promoter.
Error-prone polymerase I
For the polymerase I we contacted Manel Camps, the leading expert on this field. ( Read more about our     correspondence with Manel Camps here ) He told us that the two-plasmid mutagenesis system is a complex mechanism.     This means that changes in the expression levels of error-prone polymerase (e.g."

Integrated Human Practices
We created a complete ‘advise-test-feedback-promote’ circle to improve our project. According to this 7-steps circle, we do our human practice corresponding to every step of it. Not only interviews and feedback were participated but conferences and meet-ups were attended. Meanwhile, we designed a Bio-Chess with both board game and online version to promote public engagement. Please see Human Practice for more details.
Model
Model plays an important role in the project. For database integration, we build a model to screen the blast results, which influences the reliability of our database directly. We used JS divergence for feature extraction and innovatively employed logistic regression classifier with polynomial features to classify blast results, which performed pretty well. For promoter prediction, we used machine learning method to construct promoter classifier. Then, we constructed multiple classifier system to improve the performance. With large-scale search model, we can identify promoter in a large-scale sequence. In a word, without model, there will be no BioMaster. Please see Model for more details.
Demonstrate
We bring BioMaster to this year’s Giant Jamboree. It’s an integrated biobrick database. In order to show clearly that this database can work under realistic conditions, we recorded a video. At the same time, we sent our database to some synthetic biologists and iGEM teams to solve their problems and they gave us their feedback.Meanwhile, we consulted lawyer for the intellectual property issues and made sure of the safety of our projects. Please see Demonstrate for more details.

Collaboration
We interacted with several iG"
OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#proof2_-_-_TEXT.html," there is a clear protein band at corresponding position with a correct size (50.2 kDa). It proved that we did express INP-mSA on the E.coli surface successfully .
Protein function verification
Immunofluorescence Staining
After verifying the protein expression, we want to prove that the protein can function as normal. We used Rhodamine-biotin to immunofluorescence stain the engineered E.coli and negative strain  DH5α to observe whether the bacteria has fluorescence under fluorescence microscope.
The result proves that the function of protein was normal.
Fig 2.3 Rhodamine-biotin immunofluorescence staining of engineerd E.coli(right) and negative strains(left).
Meanwhile, we would like to quantify the expression of INP-mSA compared with DH5α by plate reader. When we carried out the experiment, we met the problem that there are different incubation conditions with immunofluorescence staining in different paper.  So we had to explore the best Incubation condition for immunofluorescence staining. Firstly, We did two sets of experiments to compare the fluorescence values of 2h incubation under two temperatures ( 0 ℃ and 30 ℃, 0℃ means incubate on ice.)
Fig 2.4 Expression level of INP-mSA fusion protein under different conditions.( I )  the single cell fluorescence values from E.coli DH5α cell expressing JIM fusion and DH5α without a plasmid under 0 ℃  incu-bation for 2h. ( II ) the fluorescence values of E.coli DH5α cell expressing JIM fusion and DH5α under 30 ℃.
The image showed that E. coli containing the Jim plasmid successfully expressed INP-MSA fusion protein. The fluorescence value showed that after 2 hours incubation under 30 ℃ conditions the Rhodamine-biotin can better binding to mSA. We speculate that there may be an ice dye incubation that causes ice nucleation proteins to form crystals that inhibit the combination of fluorescent dyes and the mSA of fusion proteins. [2]
Yeast strain construction
Here we need to construct the vector of BirA (biotin ligase) and BAP (biotin acceptor peptide) in yeast for displaying biotin on the surface.(fig.1)
We first cloned birA into the yeast-shuttle plasmid pYC230. After transformation, it enables the yeast to transfer biotin to biotin acceptor"
IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," the  discussions  (both  formal  and  informal)  were  very  productive  and   propitious  for  the  teams,  in  general. We  learnt  a  lot  about  iGEM  through  this  meetup,  got  to   meet  a  lot  of  people,  and  are  confident  that  the  advice  and  suggestions  given  during  this   meetup would definitely help us give this first attempt at iGEM our best shot.
NCTU­Formosa regional meet up:
The NCTU Formosa iGEM Meetup was held during July 19­23, 2015. This was the third time  NCTU organized its own meetup, and this time, it kept it open for all the Asian iGEM teams. It   was organized on a pretty grand scale with 30 teams (from countries like Taiwan, China, India,   etc) participating in it. The two Indian teams participating in this meetup were IISER Pune and   IIT Kharagpur. The option was given to teams to either go and attend the meetup in person, or   to present their ideas via video conferencing (Skype). Accordingly, our team went ahead with   the second option, and was allocated a video conference slot for the evening (Taiwan Time) of   the third day of the NCTU Meetup (21st July). The  main  idea  behind  our  team’s  participation  in  this  meetup  was  to  get  advice  and   suggestions  from  experienced  iGEM  teams  with  regard  to  our  project  ­  wet  lab,  policy  and   practices (social outreach, meetups, collaborations, lab visits), modelling and so on. The format   of the online conference was 20 minutes for the presentation and 20 minutes for the question   and answer session. Harsheel, one of the senior members of our team gave the presentation of   our project idea, and the questions that followed (which were pitched by the audience gathered   at  the  seminar room  in  NCTU,  Taiwan)  were  tackled  by  some  of  the  senior  members  of  the   team,  as  a  whole.  Very  valid  questions  were  raised  by  the  audience,  and  many  useful   suggestions were given with regard to how we could improvise our presentation for the"

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," bee or the resulting honey. As well, we finished the article saying that we wanted to create knowledge and well-informed citizens who can create their own point of view to this technology, based on good information.
Besides the article, we know that synthetic biology is a completely new topic for beekeepers, nevertheless we think that science should be part of everyone’s lives. That's why we put our contact at the end of the article, so iGEM Tec-Chihuahua 2018 could solve questions that could emerge in beekeepers or public in general.
Since our article will be published after the Giant Jamboree takes place, we asked Bee Culture’s editor, Kim Flottum, to write us an email ensuring our article in next’s edition. Below you can find the email Bee Culture’s editor wrote for us. To see more of this article, it will be found on the Bee Culture November’s magazine edition!
Genetic Manipulation Forum
Every year a new Student Council (SAIBT) is elected by all the alumni and we decided to join forces and plan something at our college. For this edition, iGEM Tec-Chihuahua and this student community came up together to organize a forum in which synthetic biology, as well as other related topics such as genetic engineering, are discussed and shared with the public in general. iGEM Team Tec-Chihuahua 2018 is organizing this forum in collaboration with the council and the Biotechnology Degree directives to reach a greater public and cover a bigger community sector.
The plan for this forum consists of 4 vital steps; brainstorming, planning, promotion, and fulfillment. Please click on each drawing to see what we did for each step.

Bacterial sunscreen
- Evidence suggests that several components found in most sunscreens are harmful to us and can be carcinogenic, also most sunscreens only protect against UV B (315-280 nm) and not UV A
- These sunscreens use metal oxides (Zinc oxide) to absorb UV radiation, but the effects of absorbing these metals into your skin are not fully understood and are thought to lead to production of reactive oxygen species and could lead to melanomas rather than preventing them.
- Scytonemin is a pigment found in cyanobacteria which protects them from UV radiation, absorbing 325-425 nm. Its synthesis requires three enzymes, SycA-C Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are produced by organisms adapted to environments with high levels of sunlight (eg. cyanobacteria and algae), protecting them from UV radiation. There are 20 types and they also serve as anti-oxidants by stabilising free radicals (anti-ageing?). In a bioinformatics study the genes YP_324358 (predicted DHQ synthase) and YP_324357 (O-methyltransferase) were identified in A. variabilis PCC 7937 cyanobacteria.

Theo also continued experimenting with his electrical engineering skills with the E.glometer: trying to build a DIY light measurement device.
In the evening we made a live recording of the Gibson Assembly Song at Bill's so that we could record the music video in the lab tomorrow.
Wednesday
Paul continued with his plate reader experiments, this time comparing the light output from all the different L. cruciata luciferase colour mutants.
The transformations from the fluorescent proteins showed some very small colonies. We left them to grow for longer.
We had a lot of fun recording the Gibson Assembly Song video in the lab today. Theo has very good camera skills.
Thursday
Today there were decent sized colonies on the fluorescent protein plates. However, it looked like there was a lot of cross-contamination - red colonies on lots of different plates that shouldn't have RFP. Very confusing. After examining the plates we just took colonies that appeared to be excited at the correct wavelengths and glow the right colour.
Ben, Emily and Bill recorded the individual tracks for the Gibson Assembly Song which Bill mixed using Garage band. It's slowly coming together.
Friday
Aware that next week we would need to pack up the lab to move into Jim Ajioka's lab in parasitology next week, we started slowly tidying up the lab :( It was a sad time indeed. Especially when the motivational posters of Anja had to come down off the walls.
We also realised clearing up the lab might take a while.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.

TEAM
We are a group of five high school students, which aim to promote science in a different, more entertaining and easier way to understand for others. All our performance has been achieved by our perseverance and the help of our tutors. In our team we all have different likes; however, we have joined for a reason: science, in which we have shared very good moments as well as moments of great stress, working late hours and many days in a row, reaching to the conclusion that the life of a scientist is not ""easy"". This experience has helped us to understand how we are going to develop in the future, realizing that all of us will study something that has to do with biology or health.

“biological engineering”
I am 16 years old, I am a high school student with high skills in science; I have headed the project from the beginning until June 2016, where for group decision I was followed by a partner. In July this year I was invited to participate in the Summer School Global Imperial College London to gain more knowledge and allowed me to strengthen the team in science field. I like working in the laboratory but more in theoretical work, I am also part of the translation of written work. My goal is the study of biological engineering abroad, and working on stem cells and research in aging process.
Hobbies
I like to read (specifically about science), jogging, playing videogames and volunteerism. Also I study classical piano and enjoy outdoor activities.
Antonella Osses (15)
""Medicine""
I'm a high school student. My top priorities are the welfare of the team; encourage it to work and to be more responsible, because these attitudes I have been appointed as the group leader. I love the laboratory work, my performance is good and I enjoy it very much, however, I have worked more on developing presentations, and everything that has to do with computing. Later on, I hope to be an excellent biologist, so that in the future I would achieve my dream that is to study Medicine or something related to science, conducting research, and in parallel to be a professional volleyball player.
Hobbies
my passions are volleyball and science; I also like jogging, hanging out with friends and watch TV series.

Results Summary
Below is a brief summary of our results from this summer. Each statement has a link shown in
RED
to the page(s) containing more information and detailed results.
This summer, we created 63 new Level 0 Parts (32 prom, 12 5'UTR, 16 CDS, and 3 terminators), 14 new Destination Vectors, and 86 new Level 1 Transcriptional Units to the MoClo Library
We have also updated the MoClo Kit to include 90 Level 0 Basic Parts and 21 Destination Vectors so teams next year can create devices containing up to 4 transcriptional units
Using a state of the art BD LSRFortessa at the Center of Synthetic Biology here at Boston University, we have successfully characterized 64 Level 1 Transcriptional Units and 2 Level 2 Devices
From this work, we will draft a proposal for a standardized flow cytometry protocol for future teams to utilize when testing devices containing fluorescent proteins in E. coli
Working closely with the Purdue Biomakers team, we are designing a datasheet that will allow users to more easily share information and data within the iGEM community and beyond
We have begun implementing a Java-based web tool to generate these data sheets

The results obtained after the testing of the instrumentation with biological samples as well as videos of our instrumentation in action can be seen at our Results page.
Further improvements on instrumentation design
Due to the constraints of time and budget, we could not realise all of our aims for the Biologger. What we have developed though is a robust prototype which clearly demonstrates the potential our kit has as a cost-effective and reliable sensory ability. We include the considerations we could not realise below, in order to guide anyone who wishes to turn our prototype into a polished end product.
The cuvette holders we made could be replaced with alternative cuvettes with bio-containment mechanisms. These cuvettes could have a hollow wall, containing an antibiotic or antiseptic. By applying a small amount of force on the sides with the lid on, the second layer would break, thus releasing the antibiotic inside the cuvette. The cuvette would then pose a greatly diminished biocontainment risk and so this would facilitate disposal.
Microfluidic technology could be used to deliver the testing sample to the cuvettes. This would both reduce spillage, and potentially reduce the sample volumes required.
For increased biosecurity, and where cost is not an issue, the device can have a sensor dedicated to each cuvette. In that way, parallel readings could be taken in a non-rotary device, reducing the exposure of the cuvettes not in the detector to the environment.
Hall-effect sensors or barcode readings could be used to more accurately identify which cuvette was in the detector. Furthermore, these barcodes could also be useful for identifying what analyte is being assayed in the sample by each biosensor.
GPS data could also be acquired by the Android software, thus facilitating data analysis and detection of possible trends related to geographical position.
Sporage and Distribution
Sporulation of 'Bacillus subtilis' cells happens naturally when the organism is stressed. In the lab sporulation can be artificially triggered by growing on a defined medium. The cells are first transformed with all the necessary parts for sensing and output and then sporulated. The dormant spores can be stored by simply dropping a solution of them onto sterile filter paper disks and air drying them. These disks are attached to the inside of the cuvette thereby immobilising the bacteria. A dessicant is also kept in the cuvette to contribute to the longevity. The cuvette can then be kept until the kit is required. When the kit is"

Yuze WU
I will go to bed before 12 today!
Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.

Kent,2016,Team:Kent#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," applied topic models to quantitatively analyze the context and the impact of their project as part of their integrated human practices.
Furthermore, we would also like to show that our novel modelling approach is a powerful and useful quantitative tool for iGEM projects. From this we hope to inspire future iGEM teams and show topic modelling has no limits by using them in their project as we live in an information age. For more information about our topic model and learn what topic mode is, please click here! (link to modelling page)
Results from our Topic Model
iGEM team Human practices/Policy and Practices
Click here for full size
Figure 1 shows the mapping of 15 topics which was computed by our topic model. The size of the circle indicates the probability of that topic appearing in each of the documents that were introduce to our model. The thickness and darkness of the lines connecting each topic is affected by the distance between each topic. As you can see shorter distance equals darker and thicker line and vice-versa for longer distance.
Human practice/Policy and Practice texts of all the teams from 2013 to 2015 were collected and there was total of 572 text files.
It shows that the topic with the biggest probability of appearing in each documents is the dark blue circle and it contains only 1 word, “communication”. Which essentially is its own topic and the distance with synthetic biology is quite far. This could be something that is expect due to either the general public still lacks understanding of synthetic biology or mode public engagement needs to be done for the scientists side. Communication can go both ways.
Seeing that the communication has strong connection (closest distance) with topic which contains the word team perhaps signifies strong collaboration betweens.
It should be noted that absence of the words “ethics” or “policy” might signify these are topics that are not very popular. Yet we also have to take into account that the input data are from 3 years back, where the rules for Human Practices were not so stringent, and teams mostly focused on just communicating their scientific ideas to the public. Possibly, future iGEM teams could explore these these further or do more under the more stringent iGEM rules in working on more novel ways to explore HP, thereby, enhancing the significance of SynBio in a grander societal context.
Several world problems that are popular among iGEM teams are: health, antibiotic resistance, cancer, energy, environmental. We can argue that iGEM has probably made an impact in these areas. Perhaps there are more areas which we can look at in the future, such as poverty, world hunger"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," to how we see it in our device.  We also tested to compare white background vs black background. However, the main purpose of these test was to see what we will see when multiple colours are present. These results were inconsistent and therefore inconclusive. One of the reasons for inconsistent results is possibly the amount of ambient light, as there is room for error in our current procedure. So we tried determining the colour of certain object in completely dark room. By doing so we got more accurate and consistent results. The next step in testing the sensor is to try the same colour strips in completely dark room. The Arduino code, currently processes all of the necessary calculations and outputs the RGB components.  This week we were also able to connect the colour sensor with the LCD display so that the output from the colour sensor can be displayed on the screen. It is not 100 percent consistent and the code requires certain improvements.  This week we also repeated the plate reader experiment. This time we attempted to use both E. coli and B. subtilis cultures transformed with RFP. However, the E. coli culture did not grow over night, so we used just B. subtilis culture. We expect to receive the numbers by Monday. We also had a meeting with “Transformers” sub-team to talk about what areas we can quantitatively model. We will look more in depth at the experiments they have done to determine controlled variables, dependent variables, and what calculations can be done. This week we also continued working a 3D animation to show how our device operates. The draft animation was rendered using Maya software to increase the quality. Some improvements need to be made, but the animation is a satisfactory in showing how our device looks like and operates. Next steps in regards to 3D modelling include improving existing animation and creating an animation to show the biological processes that are taken place in our device. This week we also created a schematic that outlines our device. This schematic can be used on the poster.

We started this week by further testing our colour sensor with printed colour stripes. In previous colour stripes, the colours on the sides were too far apart for the sensor to see, so we had to revise and resize the stripes. We also started conducting our tests in a closed box to avoid ambient light. By eliminating ambient light we"

Wednesday, 7/11: Consuelo, Wendy, and I sat in on a wet-lab meeting at BU.  This week BU is focusing on creating their level1 modules, and Traci ordered a record-breaking 128 primers!!  Back in the comp lab, we are working with Eugene still; with a lot of help from Casey I finally was able to parse some fake data, and get that to print out. The next step would of course be to use real data.  But as a result of the parsing, I realized that a lot of the Eugene rules I had written had to be reworded.
Thursday, 7/12: We worked on integrating my code with the front end done by Kara and Nahum.  We decided that since permute nor product does what we thought they did, we should only use ""permute"" in Eugene for Level2 modules, and that for Level1 modules we create only a nested for-loop.  Today I worked on integrating that into the MoClo Planner design, but as usual, ran into a lot of problems with syntax.  We wanted to interview Professor Beers today, but there was a conflict and the interview is delayed to another time.
Friday, 7/13: Starting to work on the backend behind Level 2, especially on Eugene.  Things are especially interesting because creating a hybrid device might not work the way we thought in Eugene.  So far, to test hybrid device functionality, we are creating four abstract devices with the same non-specific backbone parts, and then permuting them once they are all defined to be a single hybrid device.  The problem is, will the permutations show the differences between the pieces of the hybrid device?
So far, permutations are working- we can create 720 permutations of a level2 device from 6 abstract level 1 devices; this can be done by defining the abstract devices with the same parts inside (prom, RBS, CDS, term) while they are all abstract, and create a hybrid device composed of all 6 abstract devices.  Then, the permutation is of the abstract devices inside the hybridDevice, which come out at 6!, or 720 permutations.
Week of July 16th: Generating Permutations on the Front End & More Interviews
Monday, 7/16: We started generating text files of the permutations from Eugene, and then Consuelo and I sat down and started parsing the files and then integrating the files into the EugeneModules code, which is the front end that Nahum and Kara have been working on.  I had"

Introductory Lab Session: 7th July 2009
Experiment summary so far...
Yesterday, we attempted to transform cultures with BioBricks. We inserted the three BioBricks into competent E.coli cells grown in the previous lab session (via plasmids) and grew them overnight. The cells were spread on plates in both undiluted and diluted forms. The diluted solution of competent E.coli cells were spread onto three different plates - a negative control plate, a positive control plate and a plasmid plate (see table above). Today we reviewed the cultures which grew on the plates and prepared them for plasmid extraction and purification - this will form tomorrow's experiment.
Observations
Firstly, none of the E.coli cells mixed with BioBrick 1 (in the presence of competence inducers) took up the DNA - they didn't appear on the diluted or undiluted plates, which were lined with ampicillin. However the E.coli cells which had been mixed with BioBricks 2 and 3 did take up the DNA as they were present in colonies on ampicillin-covered plates. There were two colonies of bacteria which had been transformed by BioBrick 2, and eight colonies transformed by BioBrick 3. These 10 cultures became the focus of the subsequent experiments.
Preparation of Solutions
To prove that the DNA the E.coli cells had taken up really was the BioBrick added to the solution, we need to carry out the procedure of DNA electrophoresis with the aid of restriction enzymes. In order to carry out this step, we need to extract and purify the plasmids first (to be done tomorrow) via alkaline lysis"

Single Expression
The expression of the Mdh was confirmed via a SDS-PAGE showing clearly visible bands at the expected weight of 40.7 kDa. In parallel to whole cells, supernatant of lysed cells and the respective cell fragments were checked via SDS-PAGE. The cell fragments showed the strongest bands indicating the formation of inclusion bodies containing Mdh when expressed under the control of a T7 promoter. To avoid this, we transformed different strains of E. coli ( SHuffle T7 Express and C43 ) as alternatives to BL21 Gold (DE3) which are known for more efficient protein expression and also tested lower cultivation temperatures. Additionally, it was confirmed that all strains are able to grow on M9 medium because we made the experience that not every strain is able to grow on M9.
However, the variation of strains and cultivation temperatures showed no significant effect on the Mdh becoming incorporated into inclusion bodies.
To test the functionality of the expressed Mdh we used a modified version [2] of the colorimetric and fluorometric formaldehyde assay described by Nash [3] . The whole-cell samples of BL21 Gold (DE3) showed the highest formation of formaldehyde proving the strongest activity of the Mdh compared to the other strains. Neither in the"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Starter culture will be done today.
Procedures:
10mL of LB was added to a culture tube.  For a final concentration of 100ug/mL of carbenicillin, 10uL of 100mg/mL was added to the 10mL of LB.  Using a sterile pipette tip, and pipette, a single colony was streaked and the entire tip was ejected into the culture tube.  The tube was then incubated at 37C at 5:50PM.  In addition, another 1L of LB was made and autoclaved for 30 minutes."

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Humanpractice_-_-_TEXT.html," the dispersal of living modified organisms into the environment. “Type 1 Use” means use which is not subject to taking measures similar to “Type 2 Use.” When we use E. coli, which collect objective biomarkers or toxic substances and release profitable substances, under natural environment, our experiments are categorized “Type 1 Use.”
When we make, import, and/or create Type 1 Use of Living Modified Organisms, we must stipulate regulations concerning usage which is based on the evaluation criteria about potential adverse effects on biological diversity provided by the competent minister. We also must obtain the approval of the competent minister. The evaluation criteria are close to the risk appraisal. The criteria also consider host’s properties including distribution, usage history, and competitiveness. In the case that iGEM members create Living Modified Organisms and plan to conduct field tests, we need consider these criteria. After the approval, usage in conformity with the regulations can be restricted only in order to prevent potential adverse effects on biological diversity. If new findings after the approval suggest adverse effects on biological diversity are suggested, experimenters need not take the responsibility. However, if they do not obey the restrictions, they will be imposed a penalty including imprisonment.
In Type 2 Use, if containment measures are prescribed, experimenters must obey them during the period of use. If containment measures are not prescribed, we need the competent minister confirming them. The containment measures are related to the biosafety guidelines. When we use BioBrick, we follow the BSL according to its sequence and host.
There are various penalties and seems a unique Act concerning Living Modified Organisms. The Act restricts a wide range of act and is grounds to punish for not following the biosafety guidelines. However, the object of penalty is involved with misconduct including false application. Penalties are difficult to happen as far as we naturally act as a scientist. It is much more instructive for us to understand what regulations justify Living Modified Organisms than what penalties are.<P>

Which SR protein should we take?
The high serine and arginine contents of protein we predicted by data mining is Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 6 from the species of Oryctolagus cuniculus (Rabbit). We conducted research on the Internet and take a trip to Academia Sinica, Taiwan to meet expert in SR protein research, Dr. Woan-Yuh Tarn . She did a lot of researches on SR protein and now is transferring interests to mRNA metabolism. She suggested Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 in human with a long stretch of SR domain. And she has materials of SR gene for gene cloning and protein expression as well as SRPK1 gene encoding SR protein kinase, which can phosphorylate SR protein.
Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1
Reference: Wikipedia
Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) is a protein in human encoded by SFRS1 gene, which is located on chromosome 17. SRSF1 is essential for alternative splicing, mRNA nuclear export and translation. The function of SRSF1 is regulated by phosphorylation at the serine residues in SR domain by SR specific protein kinase 1 (SRPK1). And up to 12 phosphoserine sites have been characterized ( J Mol Biol. 2008 ) The phosphorylated SR protein plays crucial roles in heart development, embryogenesis, tissue formation, cell motility, etc.
