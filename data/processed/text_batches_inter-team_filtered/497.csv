Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," have solved multiple parameters which we then tested experimentally. The predicted parameters have successfully provided perfect droplet merging conditions which we have then continued using in the CAT-Seq system experiments. You can find our mathematical description of droplet merging by clicking this link
Week 38
At our second meeting with Greta we have presented our results and discussed possible improvements upon our system.
More
Greta has pointed out that our system might suffer from immense sequencing bias, as our system was then based on discriminating different biomolecule activities depending on phi29 amplicon amounts, which in turn was connected to how many Product Nucleotides has the particular biomolecule produced. If the molecule variant was highly active we had a good amount of DNA to sequence. But, if the activity was low, there was a high chance to lose that information, for example, due to low read count.
Close
Week 39
The meeting with Greta has pushed us to innovate our system even further. Soon after that we have came up with the idea of Reference Nucleotides.
More
These were specially modified nucleotides which phi29 could incorporate into DNA easily. Also, the nanopore sequencer could detect those nucleotide modifications at the same time as reading the full sequences. We have added a specific amount of reference nucleotides to amplification droplets used for enriching droplets with amplification mix.
After the merging, each droplet now contained reference nucleotides, which have helped to balance the overall amplified DNA amount, even for the mutants which had extremely low activities.
Close
Week 41
We have presented our finalised design and results at Science Days event which was organized by our sponsor Thermofisher Scientific. After that, we had a session discussion about further development of this project after iGEM and have received offers to collaborate with bioinformatics from Life Sciences Center in order to start using the immense amount of function to sequence relationship data in Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

In case of Pex15 we used a truncated version, lacking a large part of the N-terminus, only consisting of the transmembrane domain (315-383) (Figure 3.1). For Pex26 we use the truncated version published in Halbach et al. (Halbach et al, 2006) .
Figure 3.2 Concept of secreting peroxisomal contents to the supernatant. For the secretion, the membrane anchor Pex15 or Pex26 is used. This anchor is used to decorate peroxisomes or our modified compartments with the v-SNARE Snc1. For the secretion Snc1 interacts with the t-SNAREs in the cell membrane. Induced from this interaction the vesicle and cell membrane fuse and the content of the compartment is secreted to the supernatant.
We verified our secretion using beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter protein. In 2012 Stock and colleagues described the GUS reporter assay for unconventional secretion (Stock et al, 2012) . With it, it is possible to determine whether a protein is secreted conventional and is N-glycosylated or secreted unconventional and not N-glycosylated. GUS is a bacterial protein with an N-glycosylation-site, which is active only if the protein is not N-glycosylated. The GUS-activity can be measured with different reagents in plate or liquid assays. Liquid assays can be applied qualitatively as well as quantitatively to measure differences in activity. If GUS is secreted by the conventional pathway the N-glycosylation leads to inactivation of the enzyme (Stock et al, 2012) (Fig 3.2).
Figure 3.3 The GUS Assay. GUS secreted with an unconventional secreted protein like Cts1 from Ustilago maydis active in the supernatant. GUS secreted with a conventional Signal peptide (Sp) inactive in the supernatant. If GUS is in the cytoplasm there is also no activity (Lysis control) (Feldbrügge et al, 2013) .
GUS will be imported to the peroxisome with the PTS1 sequence and measured quantitatively in the supernatant. We will use a coexpression of GUS-PTS1 and Snc1-Pex15 or Snc1-Pex26 to identify"

To quantify the amount of copper in the samples that were collected, we used Phen Green SK dye, which is proportionally quenched in the presence of copper [22]. Phen Green SK dye was prepared in a stock solution in PBS (28 µM final concentration). Two hundred  µL of this stock solution was added to each well in a 96-well plate to which 25 µL of sample was added. All experiments were done in triplicate, and a standard curve was generated for Cu and PGSK to determine the amount of Cu in the tested solutions.
Mission Architecture
On another planet, mycelia will grow and expand to provide structural integrity for the house, inside which the astronauts will live. However, the mycelia requires a substrate (food) and oxygen to grow. Where will these supplies come from? Cyanobacteria.
Cyanobacteria are self-replicating, photosynthetic organisms that can convert the abundant carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere into oxygen. This oxygen can be used to grow the mycelia, as well as to keep astronauts healthy and alive inside the habitat. Moreover, it has been shown that mycelia can use cyanobacteria as a substrate (food) to grow (at normal Earth gas concentrations). Our goal in this experiment is to demonstrate and quantify the oxygen production capabilities of a specific strain of cyanobacteria, known as Anabaena variabilis. Achieving Earth-like percentages of oxygen (~20%) solely from the Anabaena, in combination with existing knowledge, would demonstrate the feasibility of cyano-based mycelial growth and Astronaut sustenance.
All experimentation was conducted inside an airtight, Nasco Whirl-Pak bag (total volume: 1627 mL). Two BD Gaspak Anaerobe Sachets were used to help establish an anoxic environment (down to .8% O2); Dry ice was used to establish a 90% + CO2 atmosphere, mimicking the Martian atmosphere. Wireless CO2 and O2 sensors measured the gas compositions over time, for the respective gases.

Overview Recombination Suicide Transporter
Overview
Background
To engineer Lactobacillus acidophilus by chromosome integration through homologous recombination, the selection of integration site is very important for successful recombination and not disturbing bacterial internal metabolism.
Based on the method created by Grace L. Douglas and Todd R. Klaenhammer1, the region between slpA gene (LBA0169) stop codon and the terminator was chosen as the intergenic insertion location.  The gene of slpA encodes a surface-layer protein with a strong constitutive promoter activity, which can also drive the expression of the inserted gene.
Fig 1. The schematic diagram of gene integration location (modified from Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011)
1    Recombination Vector – pLBA169
To make pLBA169, the downstream region of LBA0169 and the upstream region of the terminator were amplified by PCR. Then, the two PCR-amplified DNA fragments were ligated to pSB1C3 by tripartite ligation.
Next, CP29-RBS-aeBlue was cut from Part: BBa_K1033280. And this gel isolated DNA fragment was further inserted between two recombination regions on pSB1C3. This process created the standard EcoRI-XbaI-PART-SpeI-PstI assembly position.
To delete the extra SpeI recognition site within the one of the recombination region, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to change one nucleotide of SpeI recognition sequence. The final product has been confirmed by DNA sequencing.
You can refer to the following flow chart of gene cloning of the recombination vector.

MIT,2018,Team:MIT#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," will have to be incubated in saliva in order for             the experiments to be realistic/accurate.
In terms of quantification methods, Dr. Paster recommended using crystal violet staining methods over CFU. Staining would be                 more accurate and overall quicker. To study the effectiveness/accuracy of the current CFU-based method, he suggested doing a             microscopic analysis to see if chain formation is enhanced. Some potential mechanical models include microfluidic devices and             chemostats. The team should also look into incubating S. mutans with output and hydroxyapatite. Wash beads, quantify bacteria             that became dislodged from the beads (in the supernatant), and use subtraction to calculate the number of bacteria that remained             bound to the beads. He also recommended to take dilutions of S. mutans and plot a standard curve for assay reference. Also,             because S. mutans is not the only cariogenic bacteria, the team should also look into experiments involving other bacterial                 species that may take the place of S. mutans after its elimination.
Repeating the same characterization assays for other species beside S. mutans can help the team understand the outputs' effects             on the oral microbiome. Because of Dr. Paster, the team will be incorporating saliva into the experiments and doing more             literature research into other cariogenic bacteria. He recommended looking into Jeff Hillman's work on S. mutans and encouraging             attachment of beneficial bacterial species.
Dr. Xuesong He, Forsyth Institute, PhD and DDS
Dr Xuesong is an expert in the oral microbiome and the role that S. mutans plays in it. As someone who has studied the oral             microbiome extensively, including the contribution of different species to cariogenesis, we felt that Dr. He would be able to             give valuable insights into whether or not our project would be successful. Our main goal was to get his take on the concerns             voiced by Dr. Paster (regarding how eliminating S. mutans would just lead to something else taking its place).
Dr. He was overall very supportive of our project. He said that because our project is a proof of concept of a unique host-based                 caries prevention system, we do not need to have our solution be modular towards targeting other cariogenic bacteria as well. Other justifications he gave for our project were that: 1. Caries treatments focused on the host rather than directly targeting             the bacteria themselves is very new and complicated, and delving into this field requires us to start on a smaller scale. 2."

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," reader experiments. Although a background signal is visible in the systems expressing the pink ( BBa_K2205018 )and the sfGPF( BBa_K2205015 ) reporters, the blue reporter ( BBa_K2205016 ) due to its lowest background level, constitutes the most suitable reporter module for the Sensynova platform customised as IPTG biosensor. This highlights a crucial advantage of our multicellular, modular framework, which enables each component to be optimised avoiding any extra cloning steps. As each biosensor may be different and require specific designs and optimisation,  easily choosing and changing modules and predicting in silico the bacterial community behavior is essential for the development of new biosensors.
Conclusions and Future Work
In conclusion, through a comprehensive systematic review a design pattern of four components was identified for synthetic biology biosensors. The components are detection and output devices, with optional processing and adaptor units. Based on this design pattern, a multicellular biosensor development platform was designed in which biosensor components were split between cells and linked by intercellular connectors. Modularisation of biosensor components is ensured by the reusability of parts due to these compatible connectors. The production and detection of signalling molecules has been standardised across cells: Detector cells will produce C12 AHL, processing cells will detect C12 AHL and produce C4 AHL, and output cells will detect C4 AHL. Therefore, as long as constructs include the correct connectors, they are compatible will all other devices, without any further engineering of the system. This creates a “plug-and-play” approach to developing biosensors and allows the rapid construction of many biosensor circuit, which can be fine-tuned using only cell-mixing. The splitting of biosensor components between different cells enables the top-down design of biosensing systems. In the top-down approach, systems are designed at a whole system level without consideration of the smaller subsystems required to generate a behaviour, as opposed to a bottom-up approach, where design begins with the smallest parts required to make a system and behaviour is built-up using the knowledge of these smaller parts. Using our platform with sub-systems of a known function already pieced together within cell, it is possible to simply add a cell to generate desired behaviour instead of having to consider the underlying biological parts. Top-down design will enable a more interdisciplinary approach to biosensor development, as knowledge of underlying biological behaviour is no longer required, and will generate biosensors better suited to their intended functions, as the design process will begin with consideration of end-user specifications, as opposed to discrete biological parts.

We developed two new circuits both consists of two parts: the original RFP pool and an orthogonal GFP pool. Genes encoding RFP is supposed to express as the host's 16s rRNA always exists, while the expression of GFP mainly depends on the presence of orthogonal 16s rRNA.
We charactize the difference between the expression of different reporter genes at the same time to get a more detailed view of how the orthogonal ribosome improve the precise control system.

Results
Construction
The orthogonal ribosomes we successfully constructed by mutation are the A2, C9, TJU. They were all sequenced and cloned into pSB1C3 backbone either for further cloning or for submission. We met great difficulties on the mutation of orthogonal 16s rRNA B8 but we are stilling working on it.
The plasmids contains reporter gene GFP or RFP under the orthogonal ribosome(plasmid A and plasmid B) was directly synthesized by the third-party company. After getting the plasmid, we cloned the orthogonal 16S rRNA with a  constitutive promoter into it.
 
Characterization
For characterisation experiments, transformed cells were grown from stocks overnight, and subcultured for three to four hours, the cultures were diluted to 0.05 O.D. and aliquoted into a 96 wells plate or cell culture tubes. The fluorescence signal of GFP and RFP were monitered over time using a microplate reader. Fluorescence values were divided by absorbance values to give a series of normalised data. Both the original and normalised data were presented below.
Characterization experiment A
The experiment aims to test the orthogonality of orthogonal ribosome and host ribosome.

Opentrons
Opentrons gave us a unit of their OT-2 pipetting robot to help us automate lab protocols and help them gather feedback for future releases. For all intents and purposes, we had a direct line into Opentrons to voice our opinions on their hardware and software solutions, as well as to troubleshoot any potential technical problems we’d encounter. Our relationship proved invaluable in the beginning of our time with the robot - we ended up on a Skype call with an Opentrons representative to help diagnose a protocol-breaking issue we were having with the robot. Additionally, we joined an exclusive Opentrons forum dedicated to feedback between other iGEM teams with Opentrons products - even making a few technical posts. On top of it all, we automated part of an Interlab protocol using the OT-2 robot and open-sourced every protocol we wrote to GitHub.

Cyanobacteria Protocol Exchange with NU Kazakhstan iGEM
We had a brief Skype call with NU Kazakhstan discussing our projects as we were both working with S. elongatus . Unfortunately, there was poor signal and other technical difficulties during the call, so it was difficult to hear one another. Nonetheless, we had an email thread and were able to exchange information on culturing and transforming conditions, recommended working antibiotic concentrations, and light intensity. However, we weren’t at the point of transforming yet. NU Kazakhstan offered advice on how to manage temperature in our incubator, which helped tremendously in fixing the issue.

Helping UChicago iGEM with Transformation
We had an email discussion with the UChicago GeneHackers Team, who worked with a cyanobacterial species very closely related to ours, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 . After learning about issues they had in transforming the DH5alpha cells for InterLab (specifically they were unable to gain colonies), we offered advice by giving them pointers originating from iGEM's single tube transformation protocol, namely to spin down the transformed cells, remove some of the supernatant, and then resuspend them. They were successful in this endeavor and passed these tips to Northwestern iGEM as well.

About Our Green Wiki
Our project is all about ensuring a greener and more sustainable future for ourselves and the coming generations. This of course meant, that our wiki had to to follow this purpose as well.CO2 Neutral Website sponsored our wiki with a CO2 offset equal to the amount of CO2 produced by having the wiki running until October 31 2018. This does not mean the wiki is CO2 neutral in itself, but that the offset, equal to its pollution, is compensated. Compensating an offset could for example be global initiatives like replacing stoves in Africa with energy efficient stoves and building new, renewable energy sources. Also companies will be instructed in reducing their CO2 offset.

iGEM Goes Green
“It’s not easy being green”
Kermit the Frog
The Collaboration
As part of a Human Practices collaboration project the iGEM team of TU Dresden invited us to participate in iGEM Goes Green. The main idea of the collaboration is to calculate and consider the emission of CO2 related to iGEM.
We are grateful for the opportunity to be play a part in a collaboration which focuses on the green aspects of GMO, as it corresponds with a main focus of our project.
Our Carbon Footprint
Much like the coastline paradox presented by Mandelbrot, our total carbon footprint is hard to measure since we cannot take the following into account: Every single kilometer we have driven, the exact size of our trees and so forth.
The estimated carbon footprint of a flight from Copenhagen, Denmark, to Boston, Massachusetts, USA and back again is 3.430 kg/person Flight emission calculator . With a team of 14 individuals, this culminates in a total of 48.020 kg or roughly 48 tonnes of carbon dioxide for our team - just from flying intercontinental. Added to this is the carbon footprint of the Danish trains at 30 g/km/person DSB environmental report .  With the same 14 individuals and 175 km to Copenhagen from Odense this yields a total of 147 kg. We have been on a total of three trips, one to Langeland, Denmark, two to Copenhagen, Denmark, and one to Delft, Holland. We have travelled to these destinations in two Volkswagen Transporter vans. The carbon footprint of these is 188 kg/km/car Volkswagen automobile details .   With a total of 2320 km travelled our trips yield a total of 844.5 kg of CO2.
Thus our total carbon footprint of travelling is roughly 49 tonnes of CO2.

To balance the previous results, Mexico is more moderated regarding population opinion.             Several results support this conclusion: Firstly, 50% of the population think that GMOs are             not safe for the environment; Secondly, 45 out of 80 people (56%) are supporting the development             and use of GMOs in agriculture or environment.             And finally, the 84% of persons voting for the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh             temperatures.
Moreover, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements. It             meets the needs of 90% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs.

Regarding our interactive map, the objective was to work on different fields for 6 countries             (USA, Taïwan, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil). However, the lack of answers for 3 of them             do not allow us to show representative results.             From the public opinion follows the creation of laws and regulation of the country.

GMO's Regulation
Objectives
The objective of the data collection for the global regulation of GMO is to           complete our interactive map. Also, we want to compare how GMOs are perceived by           the government in different countries around the word and how they put into effect the regulation.
Intended audience
The public for the regulation of our project are mainly the population that want           to discover easily the GMOs’ regulation of their country or in another one. This part           can be useful to the future IGEM teams or for scientific researchers too, to see all           the regulatory requirements to start a project in a country.
Data collect
To collect data for all countries, we consult:
International Organism website (Food and Agriculture Organization of the             United Nation, International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications, …)
National Organism website (United State Department of Agriculture,               the Library of Congress, …)
National government website
the Law of the country
We asked IGEM team in the country for more information

This is effectively just the activator system with a second step, as the switching level depends on the properties of the promoter, not the quantity of repressor present. It would still be interesting to see what happens when this extra level is included and whether this helps remove basal transcription level problems.

Wet Work
Melanin Pigment
Made controls (as  suggested in the meeting yesterday) to confirm that the melanin pigment was being produced by the bacteria with the MelA gene, rather than by oxidation of plate substrates. Schematic is shown below - all plates contain tyrosine, copper sulfate, and IPTG. Brown colour represents melanin bacteria, while pale stain represents the TOP10 control species. All plates were stored over the weekend at 37 degrees.
Melanin Retention
Electroporation was used to transform the MC1060 (containing an acrAB deletion) and MG1655 (containing an acrF deletion) strains with the MelA-containing plasmid before plating them out onto ampicillin plates. Hopefully these should show limited melanin diffusion into the agar medium and delineated black colonies after a spell in the incubator.
DNA Wash
As part of troubleshooting the column wash procedure, the QUIGEN kit was used to purify the DNA after a PCR. The gel below shoes, from left to right, 2-log ladder, unwashed PCR-product, 1/10 diluted PCR product, and washed DNA. The QUIGEN kit therefore produces a reasonable yield of pure DNA, and will be used in the melanin protocol which will be startedon tuesday.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling#Photoinduction_-_-_TEXT.html,"% of YcgF is in active state at steady state at 10 % of sun's original irradiance.
We took a frist glimpse on the expected receptor activation by approximating the steady state solution for the ODE system.
From these results we gained two insights. First, we had to assume YcgF and Lov (for both of them light only activates) would be fully activated at low irradiation. ""Low"" refers to the fraction of original irradiance, e.g. actual sun light intensity or the irradiance caused by a certain light bulb. This was an indication that we cannot use this receptors in real world applications. (See the upper part of figure 3.)
Second, Cph1 and CcaS - the receptors which are activated and deactivated by light - didn't show different activation levels for different light settings, i.e. they cannot be used to distinguish for example between sun and room light.
Actual UV photon flux
Figure 4: Relative amount of natural sun irradiation. The number of photons (blue) is lowered compared to the power (yellow) at low wavelengths.
Since E.colipse is an UV protection system it is essential to know which fraction of a receptor's activation is due to UV radiation. To glance at the emission and absorption spectra only can be misleading because emission spectra are normally given as energy flux [J m-2 s-1 nm-1]. However, photons of low wavelength contain higher energy (Ep = h*c/λ), which means the actual flux of low wavelength photons is lower than obvious at first view.
An example is depicted in figure 4: The yellow area is the energy flux according irradiance spectrum. In contrast, the blue area is the photon flux. One can see a ""shift"" to the higher wavelengths, because it needs more ""red photons"" to transport the same amount of energy as ""UV photons"". For the sun the fraction of UV photons is 40.49 % less than one would expect from the power spectrum.
Fraction of rate constant due to UV
Figure 5: Fraction of reaction rate constant due to UV radiation, e.g. 16 % of the kon of Lov is caused by photons with λ < 400 nm.
To get an idea of the relevance of UV radiation compared to visible light, we calculated the fraction of the reaction rate constants, which is due to ""UV photons"", i.e. the integral over all wavelengths up to 400 nm of the product photoconversion cross section times photon flux.
The results show that the UV fractions for all light source-receptor combinations are always less or equal "

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"son & Welander, 2008). The predicted PHB range was based on COD to PHA conversion. Another member of the team assumed the average COD content in human excretions to be 61.75 g/cap/day (Rose, Parker, Jefferson & Cartmell, 2015), the COD to VFA ratio of 0.74  (Coats, VandeVoort, Darby & Loge, 2011)and the VFA to PHB conversion of 0.38 g PHA/g VFA ,(Coats, VandeVoort, Darby & Loge, 2011) which resulted in 41 kg of PHA per year per crew of 6. According to NASA, the cost of shipping supplies to space using SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is $27,000 per pound. The costs saved by producing 41 kg of PHA in space would then be about $2,440,000.
We also contacted a 3D printing company called 4G Vision Tech that uses selective laser sintering (SLS), which can be used to 3D print with PHB (Pereira et al., 2012). Howard from 4G Vision Tech approximated that the predicted amount of PHB can be used to create approximately 50 hydroponic systems and 20 general tools like wrenches, hammers, and scissors.
The integration of PHB production in leachate treatment would likely be unfeasible due to low volumes of leachate that are usually produced at landfills. In Calgary, a single landfill generates about 100,000 L of leachate per day. Although COD content in leachate is higher than in wastewater, the estimated amount of PHB produced in Calgary was about 8000 kg/year, based on COD content of 1977 mg/L in Calgary leachate (Kashef & Lungue, 2016). This would result in about $40,000 in revenue, assuming a price of $5 per kg of PHB (Manufacturing and properties of PHB, 2017). Another member of the team performed similar calculations assuming 0.38 grams of PHB produced per gram of VFA, which resulted in 22,250 kg of PHB per year and a potential revenue of $111,126 per year. The cost of implementing a PHB production process will likely be magnitudes larger. Leachate treatment in China is a more promising alternative. China generates a larger amount of leachate compared to many other countries(""Leachate"

- To reach students in China whose native language is Mandarin and where Youtube is not accessible.
- To broadcast synthetic biology 1 to people whose mother tongue is Chinese.
Description
From the meeting with some high school students, we found that one issue is the medium of instruction. While Hong Kong is a place where English is the secondary language, students especially from public high school are taught in Chinese. Interesting sources for learning synthetic biology with Chinese as a medium of instruction is also limited.
At the same time, we encountered Mr. Ariel Lindner who introduced us Synthetic Biology 1 page and invited us to collaborate in Chinese translation with Mr. Edwin Wintermute. We would like to thank you Mr. Ariel Lindner, a founder of CRI, and Mr. Edwin Wintermute for this great opportunity.
Achievement
We translated subtitles and voice-over for four videos shared by Synthetic Biology 1. Our translated videos have been uploaded on bilibili website: https://space.bilibili.com/178821464/#!/
As synthetic biology 1 presents a diverge way of learning through interdisciplinary research, we hope that in the future we can share these videos through our facebook page once the translation is uploaded on Youtube. Bilibili is yet sharable on Youtube or Facebook. For further information about Synthetic Biology: https://syntheticbiology1.com

Week of July 9th: Integrating Real Data/Combining Front & Back Ends of the MoClo Planner
Monday, 7/9: Consuelo, Casey, and I visited the MIT iGEM team and sat in on a morning wet-lab meeting today.
Initial observations: We made observations on how the space restricted/augmented conversation and group interactions.  Also, we looked at the variety of visual aids that were used by the PIs and students in the presentations.  We also paid careful attention to conversations on troubleshooting techniques, and noticed several trends.  It would really great once we're done with the MoClo planner that the MIT team come and test it out at Wellesley.
Eugene
Also, we started using the product and permute functions on Eugene.  It seems that product and permute do not actually work the way we want them to for Level 1 modules.  We want variations of concrete parts in the same order, replacing the absDevice(prom, RBS, CDS, term) pattern with real biobrick parts.  However, permute changes the order of the parts so that the absDevice would have variations of (RBS, prom, term, CDS) or (term, RBS, CDS, prom), etc on the inside. This function will be extremely useful once we get to creation of Level 2 modules, but it is not pertinent to creating Level 1 modules.
Tuesday, 7/10: Started fiddling with parsing real data.  Somehow it's really difficult retrieving RBS data from the Registry!  Do you search ""RBS"", their family names, or something else all together?  What if the RBS doesn't have a family it belongs in?  Nicole and Veronica have been working on semantic search for a while, and used their skills to also mine the Registry for pertinent information for the MoClo planner.  However, as a result of using different parameters to classify different backbone parts, the rules that I wrote earlier for Eugene must now all be redefined.  For example, I realized today that instead of creating 4 separate categories of promoters (constitutive, hybrid, repressible, inducible) that the promoter type can just be defined as a property"" of promoters inside of a promoter type.  The same pattern can also be followed for RBS, CDS, and terminators.

This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production in an E. coli host - or especially with co-expression of E. coli Hfq BBa_K1963000 . The system is based on the BBa_K1963002 template and has the proD strong promoter, followed by a short antisense sequence targeting the 5' end of the fliC transcript, followed by the E. coli micC hairpin, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. The anti fliC sRNA is placed betweeen C-193 and T-194. The system should impair motility of E. coli.

This has happened because scientists cannot have an opinion: they only work in the labs, but they do not get enough freedom of expression.  20. They also need more time to think about the possible implications of their projects.  21.  Issues related to responsibility. Who should take responsibility for a bacteria that has been designed to produce drugs?  22. Liar bacteria: someone designs a bacteria that can lie 23.

After our first attempt, we were told what aspects could be improved or are difficult to produce. -We should focus in less ethical aspects (probaly one or two) because the length of the movie limits our possibilities. -We should try to make a more realistic film if we want people to connect with the situation. -We shouldn't include so many locations, characters, special effects and resources in general because of our budget and time limitations. -We should avoid wtiting dialogues
In the forthcoming meeting with Ana in Valencia we will restructure the project to make it feasible.

Fudan
Although we are from the same school, we chose totally different projects and tracks, and worked in different labs. In wet lab, Fudan and Fudan_China discussed about experiments and debugging methods almost everyday! There was frequent reagent exchange between us, like competent cells, enzymes and antibiotics. For example, team Fudan received Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol from us, while we obtained DH5alpha competent cells from team Fudan. Also, we borrow experiment equipments in each other's lab when needed. In dry lab, Fudan helped us to meet the professor of biophysics, and get some enlightenment of the diffusion model. In the meantime, we taught Fudan how to make an interactive animation of their models on their wiki.
ShanghaiTech
We submitted our parts to the part library built by the team ShanghaiTech. We discussed the problem with team Shanghaitech and they helped us figure out an available algorithm in August. And we talked about the possibilities of dividing our circuit into smaller parts that can be delivered by their multilayer signal processing system, so that the load in each cells may be decreased.
We also worked together in dry lab work. There was an approximate process in the origin integrase model, the rapid equilibrium, which causes the difficulties in infinitesimal method for simulation.
Peking
We had a phone call with team Peking in late August. Due to the similarity of our system, we discussed about the integrase experiment details. Peking answered our questions carefully. It was helpful for us to modify our experiment on integrases.

Connecting with the Scientific Community: Women Building Bio
Dr. Saha, our PI, and several members of our iGEM team were invited to be part of a student panel called “Next Generation Inspiration: David vs. Goliath of Synthetic Biology” at the Women Building Bio conference. During the event, we talked about doing synthetic biology research as undergraduates and the outreach that we do through the iGEM program. It was fun to talk to women in the Biosciences industry from across the state, and it was an honor to be included as speakers at this event. Many of the attendees were curious to learn more about our research, and it was also very exciting to connect with women who do research in similar fields.

A couple of points to make:
Three colonies were taken from each plate containing BioBrick transformants so there is a total of 9 mini-prep digests - 3 BBa_C0056 digests, 3 BBa_B1002 digests and 3 BBa_R0077 plasmid digests.
It was decided that only 1ul of BBa_C0056 would be digested (as opposed to 10ul of DNA) - this is because the gel produced the previous day showed that the DNA concentration of BBa_C0056 mini-prep was really high.
The substances were added in the following order: 1) DNA, 2)Water, 3)Buffer, 4)Enzyme
Because the components of the digest were pipetted against the sides of the 9 Eppendorf tubes, the tubes were spun down for a pulse to mix the contents together. The 9 Eppendorf tubes were then placed in the 37C water bath for 1 hour.
DNA Gel Electrophoresis
Mathew preparing DNA samples
The DNA samples were the prepared in the way suggested by the DNA Gel Electrophoresis protocol (i.e. 9ul of restriction digest solution and 1ul of loading buffer/dye) and loaded into the 0.8% agarose gel (along with the HindIII DNA ladder). DNA gel electrophoresis was allowed to commence for 40 minutes under 100 volts. Once this procedure was accomplished, the gel was analysed under UV light by GelDoc.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ators in Yeast [16,17]. However, they also find that the combination of promoter and terminator will affect the behavior of the circuit too, which means that it is difficult to predict the output level of particular circuit by the quantitative result of promoter and terminator respectively. Here, we combine the minimal promoter and minimal terminator together to test if we could get a minimal promoter-terminator pair (minimal genetic regulatory elements,MINI-GRE) with similar or higher transcription output level compared with commonly used transcriptional regulatory elements.
Background
The native promoters and terminators of Yeast are usually significantly longer than that of Bacteria [16,17], with quite a few unnecessary regions for engineered circuits. The big size of fungal promoters and terminators may increase the cost of synthetic circuits, the possibility of non-specific homologous recombination, and the undesired endogenous cellular interactions [16,17]. All these disadvantages limits large-scale synthetic biology efforts in yeast.
Mini promoters
In previous research, this problem of bulky yeast promoters was scarcely addressed in synthetic biology until a research work was published by Heidi Redden and Hal S. Alper, In their research, they claimed that the core element in MINI promoter is a TATA box with consensus sequence of TATAWAWR followed by a transcription start site (TSS) with consensus sequence of A(Arich)5NYAWNN(Arich)6.The UAS elements contain transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) thought to aid in RNAP stabilization and enhance transcription rates. For Neutral AT-rich spacer, Hal S. Alper draw a conclusion that 30bp may be the minimal spacing required between the TATA box and TSS for S. cerevisiae.[16]
What’s more, they designed a basic scaffold for artificial minimal promoters and selected minimal promoters by high through-put technology. During their work, the length of minimal promoters is significantly shorter than general WT yeast promoters, which can provide short yeast promoters for robust function with high orthogonality.[16] For convenience, we call the minimal promoters from this outstanding work MINI promoters.
Fig 3.1 The structure of mini promoter.
Mini terminators
Not until 2011, when Yamanishi et al. optimized the expression level of fluorescent protein and other heterologous protein in yeast by using the different terminators instead of the commonly used CYC1 terminator did we pay attention to the influence of terminators in gene expression[20]. This research shows that the quantitative description on function of terminators in yeast is very important for SynBio work in the future.

Questionnaire
public views on allergen testing
Introduction
A questionnaire survey that aims to investigate public views on allergen testing has been done at the first stage of our project, which also made a contribution to finding the stakeholder and potential users of the products we developed. The questionnaire is designed carefully, as it spreads in social networks. However, it is a pity that we can run more statistical tests to estimate the characteristics of the population as we do not have an unbalanced and random-sampling sample. Whereas we use biased sampling method, the analysis of results indeed gives us hints about how to improve our project and help us to find the proper application field.
Objective
To investigate the popularity of allergen testing in public
To find out the people's views on the allergen testing the have done
To find the stakeholders and potential users of our projects
Improve our project and design Human Practice activities by analyzing the survey results
Methodology
Convenience Sampling
The convenience sampling is simple and easy to do. With this method, we can timely access to required information, saving the time and fund. From the point of view of convenience, investigators randomly selected a certain number of samples within the scope of the survey object for investigation. However, in practice, not all individuals in the population are the same, so the sampling results deviation is large, the credibility is low and the sample does not have enough representativeness. As we know little about the population that has got an allergen testing, in this survey we use convenience sampling at first to test our questionnaire and gets the basic data, which let us have a preliminary understanding of the respondents.
Snowball Sampling
Snowball sampling refers to interviewing randomly selected respondents and then asking them to recommend subjects that accord with the overall characteristics of the study objectives. This method can control the sample according to some sample characteristics and is suitable for finding some respondents who are very rare in the whole. This method can greatly increase the possibility of contacting the survey group, with relatively low funds and strong feasibility. In this survey"

Community Outreach
Community outreach is an integral part of the iGEM experience; our community outreach efforts allow us to both gain new perspectives on our work as well as challenging us to put our work and the goals of iGEM into context for members of our community. UConn iGEM strives every successive year to further our community connections and make meaningful, long-term relationships with members of our community.
This project cycle, we focused largely on education, running several demonstrations for individuals of all ages as well as leading discussions about relevant topics. On Saturday, February 24, 2018 we lead an interaction demonstration at our local Middle School Science Bowl in which participants were able to visualize DNA via a simple extraction procedure from strawberries. Included in this presentation was a broad overview of genetic engineering, molecular biology, where we can see genetics and GMOs in everyday life, and potential career paths within genetic engineering. We’re planning a similar activity, albeit with a slightly larger age range if about 14-18 versus the range of about 12-14 during the Science Bowl. This activity will be taking place with the support of UConn 4-H Adventures in STEM on November 3, 2018.
Additionally, we led a genetic engineering trivia night for the Science Club at E.O Smith High School on May 31, 2018. This team participates in the Science Bowl and the Science Olympiad competition. Our contact, Dr. Cheryl Granger, is the supervisor for this club and was extremely helpful in guiding the focus of our questions; we wanted to design the trivia to complement their current curriculum swell as mirror the format of the AP Biology Exam multiple choice section. This event also included the primer design activity from the activity book created in 2015 by the William and Mary iGEM team. Students were split into small groups of about 4-6 individuals and and challenged to consider length, annealing temperatures, and interactions with the DNA strands as we floated through the room as consults. We briefly presented on who we are and what we do at UConn as well as gave them an idea of the scale and the content of our projects. The students were especially excited to discuss the microbial fuel cells and their possibilities"

Their data was extremely helpful for us in increasing the applicability of our device to other regions of the world affected by wheat stem rust fungus.
Our team also assisted the team by testing their BBrickIt! Software and provided feedback on its applicability and interface.
University of Minnesota
On August 9th, we spoke to the University of Minnesota team via video chat to discuss our project summaries. The team was willing to supply our team with S. cerevisiae EBY100 needed in the profiling stage of our project.
Westminster UK
On August 9th, we conducted a video call with the Westminster UK iGEM team to discuss the applications of their project to help us reduce polystyrene waste produced by our project. The team’s project uses chemicals to break down polystyrene down to monomers which are consumed by bacteria. Our device would necessitate multiple discs per day, based on the size of the field, and the conversation inspired us to look into alternatives to polystyrene.
Southern iGEM Video Conference
On July 19th, along side the LASA and UVA teams, we attended the Southern iGEM Video Conference hosted by the Tennessee Knoxville team. Each team gave a 15 minute presentation regarding their project followed up by questions. We were asked questions regarding the expression of the transformed transport protein which we had not previously considered. This encouraged us to double check the translationality of the operon between E. coli 1303 and E. coli DH5α. We posed questions regarding the safety hazards and application of projects dealing with human blood samples and encouraged them to explore an education component regarding the safe usage of their product.
Following the presentations, we participated in a discussion focused on general questions and roadblocks many iGEM teams face. We shared our experience with fundraising and directed newer teams to reach out to personal contacts and local companies working in fields related to their project.

Illinois-Tools,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Consumption
This weight minimizes the number of reactions that have ATP as a reactant.  This allows for a more natural flow of events through the pathway. A pathway that consumes large amounts of ATP would be impractical because organisms can only produce a limited amount of ATP.
Known Enzyme Data
Using this weight limits the number of reactions which do not have enzyme data listed in the KEGG database. Synthetic biology requires that the enzyme and gene data for the reaction is known. If we do not know that information, then we can’t synthetically create a pathway.
Fewest Changes to Host
When creating a new metabolic pathway, it is important to consider the host in which the organism exists. This weight allows for the fewest changes to the host organism. For example, if the host organism is e.coli, and the fewest changes to host organism constraints is heavily weighted, the program will choose as many pathways that already exist in e.coli as possible in order to get from input to output compound.
Node Order
This constraint limits the number of nodes that are highly connected. Ideally, we don’t want compounds such as water and ATP, which are in many reactions, appearing in our pathway as primary compounds from the input to the output. By weighting this heavily, a scientist will be able to narrow down the final pathway faster.
When using the program, the user can define up to six different inputs.  A dot product of these six inputs against six parameters defined by the program will be used to check each edge of the matrix while assigning the weights.  The six parameters defined by the program include:
1) number of reactants
2) number of products
3) net positive ATP consumption
4) a 1 if there is no enzyme used, a 0 if there are enzymes used
5) a 1 if its not in organism, a 0 if within organism
6) 1 for node order.
Algorithm
The algorithm we used is the bidirectional dikstra. We took this algorithm from graph theory to handle our large data set. The weights are assigned based on the user-defined parameters. This determines the ""length"" of the edge. Essentially, this algorithm branches out from both the starting and ending compound taking the smallest step possible after calculating the weight of all possible next steps. When the two paths connect you have found the ideal pathway. Although there can be multiple minimal pathways of equal weight, this algorithm guarantees a minimal total weighted pathway between the compounds.
Results
Depending on whether the user specified 1 or 3 pathways, IMPtools will generate and display the top pathway(s"

Searching for a target
Searching for an application field was a difficult task do deal with. Our system is designed for a wide field. But since we need an issue to focus to and optimizing our system to, we asked several experts for their opinion and a review to our mutagenesis system.
Prof Dr. Med. Ulrike Protzer, professor at the technical university in Munich, director of the institute of virology and currently working at the Helmholtz center (German center for environmental health), said, that she could image an application in the virology. We could develop a diagnostic assay, since the production of our Evobodys in E. coli would be cheap. Thus, we could provide a cheap diagnostic for third world countries like Africa.
Something equally said Prof. Dr. Ralf Bartenschlager, professor at the university of Heidelberg and member of the department of infectious diseases, who mentioned emerging viruses. Emerging viruses are viruses that occur suddenly. Most of them are unknown or difficult to"

Team Contributions
This project was designed, organised and executed by members of our team. The initial idea for our project was the result of an internship completed by our Science manager Marjolein Crooijmans under our PI Dennis Claessen. Although everyone         had their own role to play within the team, we helped each other in all project aspects. We credit this willingness to help each other as the most important factor in our successes.
Experimental Work
In our lab we benefited from a very free working atmosphere, and even though people were assigned to a specific subproject we all pitched in and helped each other where needed.
Before our project started, Marjolein worked on         isolating our first 30 stress promoters and coupling them to GFP constructs to enable testing.
Charlotte de Ceuninck van Capelle and Germaine Aalderink
Charlotte and Germaine were responsible for the selection of the bacillus subtilis promoters as well as transforming bacillus with a chromoprotein.
Daphne van den Homberg and Mees Fox
Daphne created all our new promoter constructs using PCR. As a team, Daphne and Mees focussed on coupling these new promoters to GFP.

2. Cytotoxin sensor
Due to the accuracy and specific condition in the field of bio-medicine, the oscillatory biosensor needs to meet the requirement such as synchronization. For example, all cells expected to twinkle at the same time only when cytotoxin existed. In addition, the period or amplitude of the oscillation needs to indicate the concentration of the cytotoxin. Our circuit has the potential to accomplish this kind of job. By further exploration in the relationship between oscillatory parameters such as period and amplitude with other environmental factors such as concentration of antibiotic or cytotoxin, we may create a oscillatory biosensor which can sense different kinds of biological toxin.
Cancer cell killer
1.Cancer cell stalking
Nowadays cancer becomes one of the greatest enemy of our human being. Our main methods used to diagnosis of cancer are based on tissue and organ level, such as MRI, CT, PET, etc. These are mainly physical diagnostic methods.
With the development of science and technology, we create various methods into molecule level concentrated on molecular recognition and signal transduction of tumor marker, such as AFP(alpha fetoprotein), CEA (carcino-embryonic antigen), PSA(Prostate Specific Antigen) and so on. Level of these special molecules in human bodies has become the main basis of diagnosis of cancer. These are mainly chemical diagnostic methods.
So how about using synthetic biology to do something for diagnosis of cancer? Our project can be a potential biological method to assist diagnosis of cancer.
ROS is reactive oxygen species in cells, which has been proved to be associated with several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's diseases[2][3][4]. Concentration of ROS indicates the level of cell metabolism. Normally the stronger cell' metabolism is, the more ROS it will produce. In the recent decade scientist found that the occurrence of cancer is closely related to the level of ROS. But it is not a simple positive correlation as we expect[5].
Figure 4. ROS Level
From this picture we can get to know it clearly. As we know, we use oxide stress to describe the level of ROS in our cell. There is a threshold of oxide stress which is the critical value between normal cell and cancer cell. As a normal cell, its oxide stress is lower than the critical value while the ROS production value is over the threshold. On the one hand, when the oxide stress in our internal environment increases, normal cells may mutate to cancer cells if the ROS value is higher than the threshold"

    Synthetic genetic oscillators have long been of interest to the scientific community. Our team has constructed a special oscillator gene circuit manipulating two quorum sensing autoinducers to change periodically, and reach their peak value alternately. Inspired by Enigma machine, we intend to use our oscillator circuit to make a biological cipher machine, which is able to encrypt and decipher information consisting of two basic elements. In our design, blue and red fluorescence stand for two basic elements of input and output. When one protein reaches its threshold value, a corresponding gene circuit will be triggered, either to retain the original element, or to change it to the other one. Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered. We hope this design can be an innovative attempt to apply synthetic biology to information safety from the aspect of interdiscipline.

Lab Collaboration
When building a colony, cells communicate with one another through different methods, exchanging all sorts of molecules and therefore information, enabling them to coexist and grow as a whole. Inter teams’ collaborations in iGEM play a very similar role in its community. The teams interact with the community, telling them what they need. A team, as a singular cell, communicates how they can offer knowledge, experience and even gear to others that seek it. Once a beneficiary connection has been established, the teams share detailed information regarding their project and explain how the other team can help them accomplish it. This year, our team collaborated with the Köln / Düsseldorf iGEM Team.
Our task was to create a S. cerevisiae cell which lacked both PEX7 and PEX5 genes. We had the choice of either deleting PEX7 in a dPEX5 strain or deleting PEX5 in a dPEX7 strain. Knocking PEX5 could damage genes PRP28 (upstream) and MNN10 (downstream), having consequences we would not oversee. Therefore, our team decided to knock out PEX7 in the dPEX5 strain. Because of our experience performing different gene knock outs in our project, this process was much easier for us.

Key deletion
NucA key deletion
Another biological security layer is provided by our key deletion    system. We have been working on two different approaches. Here we are    presenting the first approach, which makes use of the BioBricks in the    registry. Central to this approach is the nuclease nucA from BioBriock BBa_K729004 . This system will degrade the genomic DNA and thereby  the    key from the genome if no special treatment is applied. For the design    of a nucA key deletion system we made use of the following BioBricks: BBa_R0040 _tetR, BBa_K729004 _nuclease, BBa_B0030 _RBS and BBa_B0015 _terminator. During the cloning process we expected to obtain    the following BioBricks: RBS-nuclease, tetR-RBS-nuclease and    tetR-RBS-nuclease-terminator. The key deletion is controlled by the    constitutively on promoter PtetR. RNA polymerase binds to the DNA    sequence and leads to the expression of the nuclease. If tetracycline    is added, it functions as a repressor, binds to the promoter and thus    leads to the inhibition of the transcription of the nuclease. If an    unauthorized party tries to grow the key-containing spores in regular    growth medium without the addition of tetracycline, the kill switch    will be active and the DNA will be digested by the nuclease. Therefore    the key sequence will be lost and the encrypted message stays safe.    Only an authorized user of CryptoGErM knows how to grow the B. subtilis with tetracycline and will be able to get the key sequence. During the    construction of our nucA key deletion system we encountered the problem    that the BioBrick_K729004 has an incorrect prefix and suffix. See plasmid    construction . Therefore we decided to improve this part with the    correct prefix and suffix. See improved nucA    in pSB1C3 .

We, therefore, addressed the issues of promoter leakiness and basal level expression through the use of antisense RNA based on our modelling analysis. Click to see our Modelling Page.

Feedbacks from conference (2017 iGEM Pan-Pearl conference organized by the CUHK 2018 team)
Q1: Is there a chance where random homologous recombination occurs between your recombinant plasmid and bacterial genome                             inside the cell?
Q2: Is there any enzymes that can digest your engineered plasmids instead of using these recombinases?
Q3: How can you eliminate the plasmid after it’s recombined?
Q4: How would you use your construct in particular scenarios. For example, how will your construct help if you accidentally                             spill the GM bacteria into environment?

ADDRESSING ISSUES
In addition to these feedback questions, we looked more into details of our constructs where improvement can further be made                             to reduce the safety issues. We conducted an interview with Prof. Matthew Bennett from Rice University                             in Houston, who is an expert in organism’s genetic system and circuits.
Q1: It was found that even though luxR sequences do not appear in E. coli in nature,                             there is a homologous gene found in E. coli genome called sdiA. The luxR gene, a family of sdiA gene, shares homologous sequence such that random recombination                             between the plasmid and genome may occur many times, although not frequent. We address this problem                             by finding a chassis that has the sdiA gene being knocked out. See strain JW1901-5 2
Q2: Prof. Matthew Bennett commented that endonucleases may be more efficient in targeting multiple restriction sites and                             we have explored some more nucleases that could do the job of DNA degradation. One efficient                             method to target DNA degradation is the use of CRISPR-Cas3 device, where CRISPR nuclease specifically                             degrades the targeted DNA, leaving the non-targeted DNA unaffected 3 There is also a nuclease that can be transiently transcribed in vivo such as Yeast homothallic                             switching endonuclease (HO endo) which recognizes HO recognition sites and cleaves DNA to become                             linearized 4.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," sequence, which in this case are the sixty C-terminal amino acids of alpha-haemolysin HlyA. This sequence binds with the HlyB-HlyD complex and is then translocated into the channel [7].
There are several problems to address when secreting recombinant proteins through the Type I secretion system:
First, the signal sequence HlyA is not cleaved when crossing the channel, but it needs to be cleaved to obtain a functional protein in the medium. That is why we fused the proNGF sequence with this sixty-amino acid long sequence, separated by the cleavage site for Tobacco Etch Virus protease (TEV). As we co-express TEV protease, the signal sequence will be eliminated once it is out the cell, and our proNGF can be active.
Secondly,  if TolC endogenously exists within E. coli, this is not the case of the transporter complex HlyB-HlyD. Thus, we co-transformed our bacteria with another plasmid pVDL 9.3, generously provided by Dr. Victor de Lorenzo, from Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia of Madrid, bearing HlyB and HlyD sequences, in order to get a chance to secrete NGF out of the cell.

Since we imagined a technology which requires to integrate engineered bacteria in humans, we need to ensure that the engineered bacteria are contained in the specific environment they are designed for. That is why we thought of using a “kill switch” that cause them to die if they are released in the environment. Our kill switch is based on temperature: it enables bacteria to survive at human body temperature (37°C) but die at lower temperatures.
The kill-switch we use is based on a toxin/antitoxin combination, CcdB/CcdA [9]. CcdB is a lethal toxin for E. coli and its production is placed under the regulation of a temperature-sensitive promoter [9]. In permissive conditions, i.e. in human body, the expression of the toxin is repressed and the antitoxin is expressed at a constitutive low level in order to counteract any leaky expression of the toxin. This is done thanks to the modification of the Plac promoter, which is explained precisely in the KILL-SWITCH part of this wiki. When the temperature goes lower, the repression is lifted and toxin expression increases. The constitutive low level of antitoxin is no longer sufficient to counter the effects of"

In addition to defense, biofuels, and agriculture, SBiDer also has the potential to advance health care. The ability to genetically engineer cells to produce specific outputs in response to specific small molecules cannot be understated. One recent development in this field is the production of glucose in genetically engineered cells. These implantable cells have the potential to reduce the prevalence of diabetes , which has become a significant health challenge for adults and adolescents alike.
Many more interesting and current uses of synthetic biology in various industries are also described by the Biotechnology Industry Organization . We hope that as our database increases in size and the more operons we implement, SBiDer will be involved more frequently in the discovery of new and novel uses of existing biology to help drive the field of synthetic biology and society forward.
Validation
We first validated the SBiDer application by searching for circuits described in the literature sources we used to construct the SBiDer database. As expected we were able to successfully retrieve all the circuits used to for the database. We also used this set of devices during the development of our web application; minimally our application should be able to find known circuits used to construct our database. The full list is below:

We also got the double carousels working pretty well and the visualizations look good. We probably won't demo zTree tomorrow at the poster presenation because zMol is more functional and interesting, but I'm glad we got as far as we did with zTree in such a short time. The poster is finished and printed out now.
Some things we need to do for the future in zTree are getting the data sheets 100% working, add a search function, create an output for the cache, and a log.
Tonight we are preparing our pitch for our poster tomorrow. We've got a lot to say but we're mastering the speech and we will definitely be ready by tomorrow. I'm glad that we can finally show off all of our hard work and take a few days to recover before wrapping things up.
Post-Summer Session Update
During August, I spent a lot of time trying to get the data sheets to work as well as prepare everything for demoing. I created a 2D version of (what is now an old) zTree, and we shared that with the BU team and got feedback from them. I added the log and the cache output to the program, allowing file output for those two purposes. I attempted to fix the data sheets and was successful for a very short period of time before the parts registry changed and the program could no longer successfully read in from the site. The search feature will work when the data sheets are fixed. I struggled for about two weeks with the data sheets and they worked perfectly for a glorious 15 minutes before the site was updated and none of it worked anymore. I didn't realize that whoever started the data sheets didn't make it based on the API but on the link from the Registry, so to fix it, the back end will have to be adjusted, but it should still work with the front end regardless. I think that we can consider it mission accomplished for the summer, having produced two pieces of working software.

Small scale yeast transformation with pTUM104_CaXMT1, pTUM104_CaMXMT1 and pTUM104_CaDXMT1
Investigator: Saskia, Roman
Aim: To transform our yeast strain saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSC1 -URA with the created pTUM104 plasmids, to be able to start expression of our genes.
Operational sequence:
The transformation of the yeast cells was performed as described in the pYES2 Manual of Invitrogen (small scale  yeast transformation).
Used plasmids pTUM104_Insert were previously isolated out of clones: Y1B, Y2D, Y3A
As positive control, we used a pTUM104_eGFP plasmid (provided by Simon) and as negative control, no plasmid (water) was ""transformed"".
1xTE and 1xLiAc/40%PEG-3350/1xTE solution were created immediately before use and sterilized by steril- filtration. The other solutions had already been available (and had also been sterilized by steril- filtration).
The resuspended pellets were plated on adequate selective SC -URA plates (minimal, defined medium for yeast, without uracil, due to selection for pTUM104 vector).
Plates were incubated at 30°C over night
Preparation of SC Minimal Medium
Investigator: Saskia, Roman
We prepared 3 l of SC Minimal Medium as described in the pYES manual on page 10. We mixed and autoclaved 50 ml of the already prepared SC-aliquots with 850 ml ELGA and 6.7 g Yeast Nitrogen Base. Additionally we prepared a 20 % glucose and two 20 % galactose solutions. Therefore we mixed 20 g galactose or glucose with 100 ml ELGA and autoclaved it. Note that you need more induction media with galactose than SC medium with glucose. And we don't use raffinose for the induction media.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," them extremely environmental unfriendly. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is the main pollutant that is warming earth. In the past 150 years people have pumped enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to raise its levels higher than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years (IEA, 2016) . This has resulted in a temperature increase of almost 1 degree. Another problem of fossil energy sources is the fact that they are limited. Fossil fuels are not inexhaustible and as a result of the growing demand for energy, it is expected that they eventually will be exhausted in the future. Most people agree that to curb global warming and to prevent shortage, a variety of measures needs to be taken. Probably the best response to the growing energy problem is to switch to renewable energy sources. Renewable energy is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Since in less than an hour, the theoretical potential of the sun represents more energy striking the earth’s surface than worldwide energy consumption in one year, this is considered to be the most promising renewable energy source (Crabtree, 2006) . In this context, solar panels will be the first application for the BioLens microlens array (BioLens MLA).
The problem
The efficiency of solar panels is still very low nowadays and has to be increased to make them profitable. One promising finding is the use of microlens arrays (MLAs). It is already proven that the use of a MLA as an encapsulation layer for the solar panels results in 20% to 50% increase of the efficiency (Jutteau, et al., 2015; Nam, et al., 2013) . However, the production of these MLAs is still relatively expensive and especially very environmental unfriendly (Nam et al., 2013) . Therefore, economically it is not favorable to use MLAs at the moment and perhaps even more important for us, it does not fit the idea about environmental friendly solar panels. After all, the production is very environment unfriendly.
The solution
The biologically produced microlens is an extreme small lens that can be used to make environmentally-friendly and eventually cheaper microlens arrays. The use of these MLAs as encapsulation layer for the solar panels, will result in an increase of the efficiency of those solar panels. To achieve this, Escherichia coli cells (E. coli) will be covered with polysilicate, using the enzyme silicatein. By overexpressing either the"

This means that there will actually be two biosensors for heroin purity. One will have heroin esterase and morphine dehydrogenase while the other will have just morphine dehydrogenase. This will only produce a blue colour if morphine and codeine are present on their own. The difference in colour intensity between these two should represent the heroin purity, this can be read and calculated by an app.

The expected result is 1, 3, 4 groups of long bacteria, and 2 groups are not long bacteria. However, we conducted a number of tests and all ended in failure.
So, we contacted the cooperation team TEAM UESTC-CHINA to discuss the reasons for the failure and the solution. Finally, TEAM UESTC-CHINA proposed changing the enzyme ligation conditions, changing the enzyme ligation conditions to a 4 degree reaction for 22 hours (overnight reaction) for enzyme ligation, and proceeded to verify the work.

Experimental approach
In the framework of recombinant phage gene design we decided to fuse the adenovirus 5 penton base to the D protein of the Lambda phage. The protein D extraction from Lambda phage genome has been lead by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with several couple of primers. The same  strategy has been applied for the adenovirus 5 penton base extraction which has been extracted from a plasmid coding for the virus offered by Dr. Karim Benihoud (UMR8121, CNRS/IGR, Villejuif, France).
After the fusion protein formation, this one is introduced in a BioBrick plasmid. This plasmid contains a resistance against an antibiotic to confirm the transfection of the recombined phage into bacteria and a reporter gene, like GFP, with eukaryotic promoter, the CMV of the Simian virus 40 (SV40), to confirm the transfection in eukaryotic cells. This strategy permits us to prove that the bacteriophage is able to infect eukaryotic cells.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to build the fusion protein in time. However, scientific literature show that the cell vector , a Lambda phage type, confection is possible by fusion of the penton base with the D protein (Stefania Piersanti et al. 2004). The central sequence of the penton base , amino -acids 1 to 571, fused with the bacteriophage offers a transfection in eukaryotic cells, like the use of the RGD fragment responsible for the entry of the virus and the exit of the endosome, fragment 286 to 393.

Design of the fusion protein
For the fusion protein design, we decided to extract separately the adenovirus 5 penton base and the D protein of the Lambda phage thanks to primers containing a BalI restriction site on the protein D reverse primer and the penton base forward primer. Moreover the finale fusion protein contains specific BioBricks fragments to its prefix and suffix.
For these 2 genes extraction we used the following primers:
First and second pair for genes extraction:

PARTS
In 2018, BIT-China has submitted 16 parts. We divide our parts into 3 group, Regulator,                         Feedback and Output. Each group contains some parts with similar function or close relation.                         Different groups also connect with each other.
Regulator
Increase ROS Content
BBa_K2765026 and BBa_K2765021 is a collection of regulate components including coding                         protein and expression cassette, which can increase the accumulation of intracellular ROS                         through overexpressing yon1 induced by galactose.
Improve Tolerance
BBa_K2765030 is 1000bp homologous arm of yca1 gene, which can knock out yca1 gene                         through                         homologous recombination so that the yeast's tolerance to H2O2 could be                         improved.
Feedback
Control ROS Content

Zurich
View of the inner city with the four main churches visible, and the Albis in the backdrop
Zurich is the largest city of Switzerland and its main commercial and cultural center. It has two universities, the University of Zurich, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich). The greater metropolitan area of Zurich stretches way beyond the boundaries of the municipality, and the city, located on a lake and within easy distance of the Alps (and skiing possibilities), is considered an attractive place to live in (at least, up to now, for international bankers).
Zurich can be counted as one of the world's preeminent global cities. According to several surveys from 2006 to 2008, Zurich was named the city with the best quality of life in the world.
ETH Zurich
ETH Hoenggerberg with the new HIT building
The ETH Zurich is an insitute of technology, focusing mainly on the natural sciences and engineering. Locals sometimes refer to the ETH as the ""Poly"", derived from its historical name ""Eidgenössisches Polytechnikum"" or ""Federal Polytechnic Institute"".
Like its sister institution, the ""École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"" (EPFL), ETHZ is a federal university; the remaining ten universities of Switzerland are cantonal. ETHZ was founded around the same time as MIT (1855) and for similar reasons (to develop the local industries and provide these with the necessary professionals). ETHZ has two campuses in Zurich: the old campus downtown (under constant development, of course), with a focus on engineering, applied natural sciences and mathematics; and the new campus on the Hönggerberg, with a concentration on the natural sciences and the building sciences.
ETHZ is an internationally oriented university. It is a founding member of the ""IDEA League"" and the ""International Alliance of Research Universities"" (IARU).
The ETH is regularly ranked among the top universities in the world. Between 2005 and 2008, numerous rankings placed the institute between 3rd and 6th in Europe, and 10th to 24th in the"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," was quickly confirmed, as visible aggregates formed in the media of PHB secreting cultures. This phenomenon has only been observed in cultures with bacteria containing the secretion system. We tried to provide a quantitative measure for the amount of PHB the secretion system provides, but due to the large PHB aggregates flow cytometry was not an option. Instead we compared the amount of extracted material from PHB secreting strains with other PHB producing strains (mg pr. OD) (Figure 18).
The data was too inconsistent to form any strong conclusions, but E. coli containing the BioBrick K2018050 (plus panK, plus sec) grew significantly slower than other strains. This problem did not occur for the cells containing the BioBrick K2018049 (plus sec, minus panK). The samples extracted at the same amount of time after incubation are comparable with each other, as they were incubated under the same conditions.

The red lines show bacteria grown in 2xYT media, blue lines show bacteria grown in LB media and green lines show bacteria grown in TB media.
To increase the yield of PHB we examined the growth of Top10 and Top10/pSB1C3-panK+sec in three different types of media. Figure 19 gives a quick overview over the growth curves for the two bacterial strains in Luria-Bertani (LB), Teriffic broth (TB) & 2x Yeast extract and tryptone (2xYT) media. The growth curves in Figure 19 was used to determine the growth rate expressed as doubling time and final OD.

Increasing Signal Strength and Differences
As is clear from our results, we were able both to detect our signals, and to distinguish differences between Nitrate levels quite precisely.
However, our end goal would be a signal system that could be detected by low tech equipment on farmers fields. In this case, having a stronger signal is always better. Increasing the number of bacteria in beads, as listed below, would probably help this, but so too would increasing the amount of GFP produced by our bacteria or even how bright this GFP is. Whilst this was beyond the scope of our project in the time frame, we would hope further work, ideally with collaboration from other teams would make it achievable.
Improving the beads
Adding a Coating
One of the major public perception problems highlighted by our human aspects work was fear surrounding spreading 'E. coli' in soil. Whilst our bacteria are already relatively well contained within the beads, this could be improved further by the addition of some kind of coating.
We think a cellulose coating would be an ideal candidate as it fulfils the main criteria; hopefully allowing Nitrates to diffuse in, but preventing bacteria leaving the bead. It would also be biodegradable along with the rest of the bead, reducing environmental impact.
Adding Nutrient Medium
Whilst our beads dramatically increase E. coli survival and thus signal strength, we suspect this could be improved further by the addition of nutrient medium into the beads. This could even be linked to nutrient dependence - for example tryptophan auxotrophy - rendering the 'E. coli' unable to survive at all outside of the beads. This would not only increase the signal strength and thus efficiency of our product, but also make it more palatable to the public.
Regretfully we didn't have time to experiment in the lab, however, we suspect beads with nutrient media could be made by slurrying cells in Lennox Broth rather than water in the slurry stage of our bead construction procedure.

The cells are afterwards rinsed two times with PBS to remove residual extracellular BoNTC-HiBit. Thus, only intracellular HiBit is able to lead to a luminescence signal. Following the washing steps, the cell membranes are broken up to release HiBit into the extracellular environment. Finally, LgBit and the luciferase substrate are added to generate a luminescence signal detectable by the plate reader. While BoNTC-HiBit should be able to enter the neuronal SHSY5Y cells, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF) are also tested for a concentration of BoNTC-HiBit, since their cell membranes partly consist of gangliosides but should not allow a endocytosis of BoNTC-HiBit.
Figure 2
Figure 2: HiBit Nano-Glo luminescence assay in lysats of undifferentiated SHSY5Y and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. 30.000 cells of the respective cell line were incubated with different concentrations of BoNTC-HiBit (displayed on x-axis) for one hour at 37°C. Cells were then lysed by addition of 0,1% Triton-X100, and mixed with 200µl reaction buffer, 200µl PBS, 2µl LgBit and 4µl Nanoluciferase substrate. The samples were thereafter incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C. Values are presented as relative luminescence units (RLU), error bars are displayed as SEM.
The overall low luminescence compared with the values presented in Figure 1 can be explained by an a lower concentration of BoNTC-HiBit in relation to the well’s area, since the fractional analysis was executed in a 96 well plate while the cellular lysis assay was conducted in a 24 well plate. The luminescence values from the conducted luminescence assay increase when the cells are incubated with higher concentrations of BoNTC-HiBit. This confirms that BoNTC-HighBit retains its features as a split nanoluciferase with LgBit after 60 minutes incubation time. The interpretation of the assay itself allows multiple conclusions: The first explanation for an increased luminescence is the aforementioned successful endocytosis. Simultaneously, BoNTC-HiBit might get stuck on the surface of the cellular membrane and remain there bound to a membrane compartment. It"

Bacterial overcrowding
During the European meetup in Münich we spoke with iGEM Düsseldorf about how we want to make a living material. They recognized the problem of bacterial overcrowding within our construct. Since our bacteria will keep dividing and cannot escape the hydrogel, at some point bacteria will be over-saturated which can lead to problems in protein expression. They offered to help us, and we had a meeting with them over skype. They were making a construct that uses the Lux Quorum sensing. Their construct contained 3 plasmids: Luxl (synthase for AHL), LuxR (molecule where AHL binds and can then bind to promotor) and pLux (promotor to which LuxR +AHL can bind). When the promoter gets activated, a phage lysis gene will the synthesized. In our case they offered to send us the plasmids without the Luxl in the construct, so when we add AHL to the hydrogel medium, cell growth will be inhibited. This is a great solution to keep our bacteria in control, as we want them to stay in steady numbers within our hydrogel, with steady lysostaphin production.

With regards to the interest of human health, we will provide the information necessary to distinguish our organism from known pathogens. We hope to have these experiments complete by December 2014.
Protocol development for accidental release: because our strain will be mass produced and packaged for field use, containment is very important. We will likely use established level 1 biohazard clean-up protocols should our system breach. The protocols will be fully developed when we know the details of how, where, and who will be contracted to manufacture the organism. The device that will be taken to the field is designed to keep the microbe contained within it, whereby a cytotoxic chemical is released to the microbe upon completion of the assay. This chemical compartment will be built into the cartridges and release will be initiated after the assay is run to completion. The final mechanisms for this will be developed as we approach the product development phase where the prototype is finalized.
The deadline for submitting this information for approval is 120 days prior to when we plan to start using the organism. Being well organised and using an innocuous genetically modified organism, we do not expect delay from this regulatory approval. The costs associated with this application are currently in the cost of performing the required tests.
Standards Approval
For the FREDsense biosensor to be a measure of toxins, it needs to produce accurate and reproducible measures of the compounds we claim it is detecting. In the highly regulated field of oil and gas, this is a crucial step towards  increasing adoption of the FREDsense biosensor as the industry standard for detection of these compounds.  The Environment Canada branch that manages this certification is the Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Program (Canadian Environmental Technology Verification Program: Applicant Information Package, Global Performance Solutions) . The program independently validates the claims we make of our product.
EVT is a voluntary internationally recognized program for validation of environmental technologies. Recognition for accuracy and reliability would help assure our investors that our product is credible and has the potential to become widely used in industry and worthy of continued investment. There are several steps associated with gaining validation through this program:

Bordeaux,2016,Team:Bordeaux#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," to use this system in other organisms than bacteria, scientists had the idea to combine the crRNA and the tracrRNA into a single RNA called single guide RNA. This enables the design of a sgRNA that targets the gene you want. Once the system is on the DNA helix, the Cas9 nuclease performs a double strand cut. It leads to a non-homologous end joining and by consequent a gene knocked out due to a change of the frame shift. It is also possible to insert a DNA fragment with a homologous recombination. The PAM pattern is a component of invading viruses, but it does not exist in the CRISPR locus. The sequence from the foreign DNA chosen to be inserted in the genome is always inserted in CRISPR locus. The revolution began when scientists discovered how to design a single guide RNA in order to target a specific position in the genome. The Cas9 is an endonuclease that moves on the DNA and can “jump” from one DNA to another DNA.
The potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9
Consequently, applications are only limited by our imagination. In research studies, it allows the precise study of a gene and its functions. If a gene is responsible for a disease, it is possible to knock it out or repair it.
CRISPR-Cas9 may very well eradicate all viruses that insert their coding sequences into the genome. In our way to fight cancers, it could become a powerful tool that modifies the immune system in order to fight tumours. Many studies are currently in progress.  A study [1] published in March 2016 in Nature shows that CRISPR was used to delete the coding gene of HIV in cells. In the study, almost all every cell of the rat population used had been infected by HIV. After an injection of CRISPR-Cas9 in the tail only, half of the rat cells became healthy. This technique may also work for other genetic diseases. Other advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system include a quicker, cheaper and more precise design compared to other existing methods.
The limits of CRISPR-Cas9
On the other hand, despite our knowledge on this system, we do not have any hindsight. The system is not perfect. It might be possible to cure a person with a given disease, but their child will still have that disease. For the cure to be transmissible to future generations, one has to work with stem cells or germinative cells. This equals modifying the baby in an irreversible way.
The main purpose would be to cure severe human"
Tec-Monterrey,2018,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," samples under the brigde of San Cristóbal de las Casas highway, we got inside the car and went to the village of La Trinitaria, where the Natural Reserve Lagos de Montebello can be found. We spoke with the natives and they told us they didn't use any motor boats, because they wanted to keep the lakes as clean as possible. This is why we used a canoe to get to the sample location.
We took the samples carefully while we were on the canoe. Children and workers from the Reserve came with us and we told them about the project and how we were measuring pH. We told them about the importance of the chemical pollution and they told us about the activities they did.

On the Reserve, they spend their time on tourism activities. Because of the beautiful colours of the lakes, many people from all over the world visit the Reserve. However, for the past few years they realised the color of the lake went from deep blue, to green. They were really worried because they knew that would affect the amount of people that would come to the Reserve.

""I've lived here for 58 years and I have seen how the color of the lakes has changed, now the lakes look muddy rather that the beautiful blue color it had before"". The villagers have the hypothesis that it might be due to the use of agrochemicals in nearby crops or the urban waste coming from the village Comitán de Domínguez, located a few kilometers away.

Integrated Human Practices
When we came back to Monterrey, the samples were analysed in our laboratories with chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods. We were surprised with the results, it turns out the concentrations of nitrates, phosphates, cadmium, and lead was surprisingly within the limits of the Mexican norm. This concerned the whole team, even though we knew the pollution problem was real, alarming and happening at Southern Mexico, our results showed us something completely different. We decided to speak again with Cecropia.
Conversation with Cecropia about the obtained results
They were as surprised as us, but we got to the realisation that the samples were taken at the surface of every body of water and not at a deeper depth, and that might have been the reason why the concentrations turned out to be like that.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2015,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Approach_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterial system, we also modified the structure of the glycogen using branching and de-branching enzymes in order to increase the number of free ends available to the putative acyltransferases whilst maintaining the solubility of the glycogen to aid downstream analysis.
3. To help us understand how carbohydrate structure affects the number of free ends we have modelled the growth of glycogen molecules. As we do not know which carbon positions the acyltransferases will utilise or if they will compete with carbohydrate synthases, we have also modelled the effects on carbohydrate structure and yield of the modification of different carbon positions during growth. Finally, we have made a kinetic model of glycogen production from glucose.
2. A Butyrate-producing Probiotic
The second approach aims to produce a culturable bacterial strain that produces butyrate. This would be particularly useful for individuals whose colonic microbiomes are lacking in butyrate-producing bacteria.
1. We have cloned six coding sequences that encode the enzymes that catalyse the biosynthesis of butyrate from acetate from the colonic bacterium Coprococcus sp. L2-50 (DSM 16842) 3 .
2. We have assembled these enzymes into a BioBrick that we are initially testing for butyrate production in a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli . We are also aiming to engineer bacterial species such as Escherichia coli ""Nissle"" (Mutaflor®) that are already used in probiotics.
3. Our final test will be to test the performance of our bacteria in realistic digestive conditions. We will therefore introduce our bacteria into an artificial gut system consisting of faecal microbiota.
