Small scale yeast transformation with pTUM104_CaXMT1, pTUM104_CaMXMT1 and pTUM104_CaDXMT1
Investigator: Saskia, Roman
Aim: To transform our yeast strain saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSC1 -URA with the created pTUM104 plasmids, to be able to start expression of our genes.
Operational sequence:
The transformation of the yeast cells was performed as described in the pYES2 Manual of Invitrogen (small scale  yeast transformation).
Used plasmids pTUM104_Insert were previously isolated out of clones: Y1B, Y2D, Y3A
As positive control, we used a pTUM104_eGFP plasmid (provided by Simon) and as negative control, no plasmid (water) was ""transformed"".
1xTE and 1xLiAc/40%PEG-3350/1xTE solution were created immediately before use and sterilized by steril- filtration. The other solutions had already been available (and had also been sterilized by steril- filtration).
The resuspended pellets were plated on adequate selective SC -URA plates (minimal, defined medium for yeast, without uracil, due to selection for pTUM104 vector).
Plates were incubated at 30°C over night
Preparation of SC Minimal Medium
Investigator: Saskia, Roman
We prepared 3 l of SC Minimal Medium as described in the pYES manual on page 10. We mixed and autoclaved 50 ml of the already prepared SC-aliquots with 850 ml ELGA and 6.7 g Yeast Nitrogen Base. Additionally we prepared a 20 % glucose and two 20 % galactose solutions. Therefore we mixed 20 g galactose or glucose with 100 ml ELGA and autoclaved it. Note that you need more induction media with galactose than SC medium with glucose. And we don't use raffinose for the induction media.

Our solution
We incorporated all these design requirements in our end-product: CASE13A (see our Project Description ). To apply our design in the field, we looked at our design from the perspective of a potential end-user, in this case a farmer. We developed a detection protocol with simplified methods (see our Sample Preperation page). Due to the simplicity of the steps in our protocol, the detection can be done outside a lab environment and without special training. Check out our Demonstration page to see how we achieved this. We also managed to limit the costs to around 10 euros per detection, which is much less than the current method.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP#Gold Integrated Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," In fact, we had originally decided on the development of a biosensor for herbicides as our iGEM project. However, our research for this project unearthed an interesting fact: despite the large number of synthetic biology biosensors that have been developed over the years, there is a distinct lack of synthetic biology based biosensors in everyday use. Despite their advantages over methods like immunoassays and mass spectroscopy (which are expensive and often rely on additional equipment), these traditional methods are much more widely used by researchers. Also, the day-to-day usage by non-scientists, who are often the target end-user for a biosensor, has not materialised. In fact, not one synthetic biology based biosensor has been approved for use outside of a laboratory setting by the EU. This led to the question which shaped not only our human practices work, but our project as a whole: What are the barriers facing synthetic biology biosensors, and what can we do to help?
The Issues
Issue #1: Parts Reusability
“The main problem with using biosensors outside the lab is legislation” - Dr Chris French
The Issue
The use of synthetic biology based biosensors is limited in the field due to restrictions around the use of genetically modified organisms outside controlled areas. Speaking to Dr Chris French on this matter, he told us about his experience with this issue when trying to get clearance for the use of the arsenic biosensor in the field. It became clear that this was the only hurdle in this project and that it was the reason the project has come to a stand still.
Our Solution
During our discussions with Dr French, he pointed us in the direction of the Workshop on Biosensors that took place in. This report said that “a possible solution to getting around legislative restrictions is the use of cell systems”. After reading this and along with our discussions with experts, we went forward and created a

We constructed the plasmid with lactose operator and signal peptide, and transformed this plasmid into E. coli to test if this kill switch works. We used gradient plate method in our experiment.  As we can see in the picture, the concentration of IPTG on the left of the medium is 0.1% while the concentration on the right is zero. We can see colony only on the right of the medium, the kill switch is effective which illustrates that IPTG can induce the expression of signal peptide and LALF so as to inhibit the growth of the E.coli. Also, a decrease of OD is observed too, after we added IPTG to the liquid culture medium, which means our kill switch did work well.

Designing the UnaG BioBricks
In the original paper (Kumagai et al., 2013) the authors obtained the UnaG sequence from a cDNA library of unagi eel muscle. Since we lack the budget to go fishing in Japan, we ordered the nucleotide sequence from IDT. This not only gave the possibility to address codon bias, but through synonymous base substitutions to eliminate all restriction sites as per the iGEM BioBrick guidelines. An exception is an NsiI site in the N-terminal 6xHis tag, but a BioBrick without it was also made. In addition to the affinity tag, the original sequence was also modified to include C-terminal flexible linker (GSG)2 in case the protein would be part of a fusion construct. By default a double TAA stop-codon is present right before this flexible linker, which prevents it from expressing and thus potentially affecting protein function. This does not interfere with 3A assembly, but a variant of the BioBrick without the flexible linker also exists.
IDT sequenced the entire pUCIDT-Amp vector including the ordered insert as part"
NTU_SINGAPORE,2017,Team:NTU SINGAPORE#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," shorter dwell time at the promoter for the VPR transcriptional activator to work effectively. One key weakness with our experiments was that we were unable to directly characterize target DNA binding affinity by our truncated dCas9 variants.
For our collaboration with Macquarie iGEM team, we had a serendipitous meet-up with their advisor in Singapore. Noting their protein purification capabilities, we suggested an EMSA affinity binding assay. EMSA affinity binding assay is a well-documented method to characterize dCas9 binding to target DNA. Native gel PAGE is utilized, whereupon dCas9 binding to target DNA, a mobility shift upwards is observed due to increased size, and hence decreased migration. The intensity of the shifted band would indicate the amount of dCas9 binding to target DNA. We hypothesize that truncated dCas9 would have decreased binding, and hence lower band intensity.
Our dCas9 wild-type and truncated variants were cloned into BPK 65767 (gift from Keith Joung Lab, Addgene) with 6x His tag, using Gibson assembly. The original Cas9 is replaced – this is necessary as we are investigating binding without cutting with dCas9, and all dCas9 proteins were human codon optimized. Macquarie iGEM team utilized commercially synthesized sgRNA that they have previously shown to work with Cas9.
Results
In the EMSA gel experiment, Macquarie utilized the considerably purer commercial WT Cas9 to provide a reference point as to identity of bands. They confirmed that our WT dCas9 and all truncation variants were unable to cleave target DNA, as evidenced by singular uncut ferrochelatase PCR product in lane B9, D5, D8, and D11, compared to the cut products for commercial WT-Cas9 in lane B5.
Mobility shift was apparent for our WT-dCas when comparing the band size of ferrochelatase PCR target between lane 8 and 9, and this was reflected in commercial WT Cas9, albeit fainter due to most undergoing cleavage and dissociating. This shift appears to be due to gRNA binding, as the band is observed in the RNP lane with only dCas9 and gRNA. DNA binding appears to result in a very large RNPF complex that is unable to enter the gel, as evidenced by the bright DNA band in the well of B4. The same shift did not seem to appear with our WT-dCas9, although a high MW smear was observed. This phenomenon seems isolated as the same smear was not observed with the truncated dCas"

Adding instance variables to the widgets really extended the possibilities for interaction, so we decided that if an infected bacterium encounters a non-infected bacterium, the latter one would also become infected with the same colored virus (we currently have three different viruses: red, blue, and purple). We then restricted the widget’s movement so that neither bacteria nor viruses can be dragged off screen, something we’ve been trying to accomplish since yesterday. Once that was working, we expanded the app so that viruses and bacteria would now float freely within the “tank”, even when not being dragged by users. In the afternoon, we explored marker functionality, and defined any marker interaction with the screen to produce a new bacterium at that spot. The last successful change we made today was to make bacteria be able to reproduce: a bacterium now starts out small and grows continuously, until it reaches a size after which it divides and makes two new bacteria! At the very end of the day we started looking into having different bacteria and viruses bounce off of each other when they collide, but we ran into some issues, which would occasionally prevent them from moving at all and get interlocked. We’ll continue to look into that tomorrow.
6/5/2015: Day 5
Today we continued working on animating the widgets, but ran into the same issues when two widgets collide. We tried several different approaches and equations, but all of them seemed to have some borderline cases that would not display properly On a more successful note, we managed to get marker recognition working: we assigned different markers different roles. Tapping one kind of marker on the screen creates a new bacterium; tapping a bacterium with a specific marker display information about it, and tapping it with a different marker removes it from the tank. We also explored future customization, in terms of using custom images as the bacteria (instead of drawn shapes), but only tested it with a sample image. More works needs to be done in creating a customized bacteria image for the actual project. We will probably spent most of next week focusing on that, and on exploring more accurate SynBio concepts. Overall, it was a good first week!

Each condition was repeated 3 times                     (3 wells). Average over the three wells of each condition (along with SD) is presented in the figure.
We were expecting E+P/E+P+A to elicit a strong presentation of the OT-1 peptide on MHC-1 complexes on dendritic cells, as suggested by literature review. However, unfortunately, the results were disappointing as they show no difference                   between experimental conditions and negative controls. This might be to multiple reasons, such as low expression of Encapsulin-OT-1 by our TX-TL cell free expression system, or some other experimental error. We are planning on repeating                   the experiment with the hopes for better results next time.

HP    Our team seeks to synthesize membrane-less organelles and turn it into a multi-functional toolbox for synthetic biology based on basic phase separation principles, which is a rather fundamental field in condensed matter physics. Therefore, it’s not really a reality application so far. Nonetheless, it’s definitely not the reason that we are confined in the laboratory coping with experiments and mathematical models without making a difference to the society directly. Meanwhile, we need to get to know about the demand of engineers and consumers. Thus we did an integrated human practice in several different ways. Inside the iGEM community, we made statistics of the education background and numbers of igemers each year in order to investigate how iGEM has been broadcasted internationally and how the field of synthetic biology has changed over the last 14 years. We noticed that most iGEM teams are becoming more and more diverse, which promotes the development of iGEM community but make it more challenging for team members to communicate. This can also be read as more people from different disciplines especially mathematics and physics have been devoted to systems and synthetic biology, which are interdisciplinary sciences needing various knowledge while on the same time, they can feed back to enrich the individual scientific disciplines and biology-based solutions for societal problems can be worked out. We also tried to play an active part in public engagement. We communicated with people from various backgrounds in universities, high schools, kindergartens and on the internet. We realized that there has always been a gap between the achievements in scientific research and reality application. People from academic world and industrial world barely know each others’ requirements most of the time. Thus we discussed this topic in detail using fluorescence microscope as an example. Our human practice reinforced our team construction creating more chance for the team members to communicate and collaborate with each other. We tried to make synthetic biology accessible for as many people as possible and we do expect our efforts may make a difference. Meanwhile, we’d be more than glad if our work may give the synthetic biology community some inspiration. To gain a deeper understanding of biology in the 21st century, we need to integrate knowledge from various"

Results
From the chart, we can see that cells were hardly induced in the control group, and with the concentration of inducer growing, the intensity of GFP increased by groups. The most efficient concentration of inducer was around 10-5M, and higher concentration may lead to the  expression of GFP decreasing. Additionally, to most groups, the intensity of GFP reached its maxium after 4 hours.

BIT,2017,Team:BIT-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," meant adding sweeteners indeed accelerated the fluorescence protein production in yeast cells in our system.
In other words, our system can be sensitive to sweeteners. Besides, the red fluorescence intensity increasing rate of fructose group was higher than sucrose group’s, which means that the sweetness of fructose is higher than sucrose’s. This result also conforms to the result measured through people tastes.
In order to confirm this result, we repeated this experiment three times.  The all results showed the similar tendency. These results demonstrate that the system can work as our expectation.
Though the fluorescence intensity is still at a low level, the distinction between each group can be observed obviously. The reason may be that natural signal pathway in yeast can’t adapt well with the human sweet taste receptor. The improvements of this work are continuing. (Fig. 16)
Fig. 16 The schematic diagram of Gα mutation
Summary
1. We had the optimized codon and synthesized human receptor gene T1R2,T1R3 successfully by using OE-PCR.
2.The heterologous receptor was expressed and located on the cell membrane successfully in yeast, which has been confirmed by immunofluorescence.
3.Our system can sense sucrose, fructose as our expectation.
>
Fig. 17 The red fluorescence intensity of different sweeteners
To confirm whether our yeast can respond to different sweeteners, we selected fructose, sucrose and glycyrrhizic acid as sweetener candidates. The result showed that the red fluorescence intensity sucrose induced was the lowest among these three sweeteners and it was the highest induced by glycyrrhizic acid. It suggested that our engineered yeast system could respond to different sweeteners indeed. More importantly, we found that the fluorescence intensity is positively correlated with sweetness.
Fig. 18 The red fluorescence intensity of different concentrations of glycyrrhizic acid
We also found that fluorescence intensity induced by 1 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid and 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid was greatly increased than the control group. This result showed that when the concentration of the glycyrrhizic acid reached 1 g/L the fluorescence intensity was higher than 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid, which meant that 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid might exceed the detection limit of the system. The result also indicates if sweetness is beyond the detection limit, the result may not be accurate. Just like that, beyond a certain limit, the taste of sweet and the concentration of sweeteners are not positively correlated"

igem goes green
“The future will either be green or not at all.” - Bob Brown
This year's Team Dresden had the idea to make iGEM a greener competition. In the first place this means to make participating teams aware of  the environmental implications of their projects and how to work more environmentally friendly.
Therefor the Team Dresden created a GoGreenGuide , an emission calculator, lab poster and much more. Moreover, they hosted a workshop during the German Wide Meetup . During the German Wide Meetup we participated in this workshop, afterwards we decided to take part in iGEM Goes Green. So, we read the guide and took some advice for a greener lab - below you can see the points we fulfilled -  and we also used the calculator ( have a look ). In addition, the Team Dresden suggested to think about ideas to compensate greenhouse gas emissions. Instead of planting a tree, we gave away Bryophyllum plants at our university.

NUS_Singapore,2017,Team:NUS Singapore#Model B_-_-_TEXT.html," degrade both mRNA and DNA [4]. This eliminates the need for the two kill switch systems, hence alleviating the metabolic burden on cells.Lastly, we choose pH (e.g. Pasr) as the second sensor since it best characterizes the environmental condition inside and outside beehive. The use of the second sensor also make the new kill switch more specific. In addition, for E2-IM2 killing system to function properly, we develop a NAND gate, with pH and blue light as the two inputs. Similar to the first case study, E2 toxin is constitutively produced in all environments and its toxicity is neutralized when IM2 antitoxin is produced. A key would be to control the expression of IM2.
Circuit Design
Due to time constraint, we were unable to characterize the blue light sensor. Assuming that the BLind-v1 and pH sensor promoter are of medium strength, the following NAND gate, which controls the production of IM2, was generated using CELLO. The design was subsequently modelled using AdvanceSyn Studio software.
Figure 1: NAND gate design generated by CELLO
Table 1: Truth table
Result
Figure 2: BeeT Kill switches simulated performance using the model developed
Conclusion
Simulation results suggests that E2-IM2 kill switch functions properly. BeeT bacteria are likely to die within 1 – 2 hours after being released into the external environment. The rate of cell death can be optimized by controlling the toxin-antitoxin production. In addition, it is necessary to simplify the current NAND gate design to reduce the high metabolic burden on cell.

Joe, Daisy and Marianne got together one evening to work on the poster. We realized after we finished making the template for the poster that we have no data! Alina also came into give her input on the poster.
Later that night, Joe, Daisy, Marianne and Sam all went to Alina's lab to help her mash and pipet strawberry extract at 9 pm. A couple of Alina's lab members were also in the lab at 9 pm and were very surprised to find an illegal team of undergrads working on Alina's bench. PS We learned that Sam had a mullet and sang acapella at UCSF.

Improving previous iGEM projects
In this part, we will focus on the old iGEM projects led by our colleagues. The goal is to show how our PEPTalk system can improve or change some parts of previous iGEM projects.
IGEM TOULOUSE 2013
This very innovative project tended to create an electronic system called ""E.calculus"" which serves as a ""bit calculator"". The main goal was to demonstrate that a system based on recombination logic gates could be used in complex systems. Thus, the bacterium that received this system would be able to make its own calculations and send a report to the user.
E.calculus consists of 5 logic gates: 2 XOR, 2 AND, 1 OR. The general idea was to create a complete and stable complex system in a single bacterial strain. The logic gate would be regulated by ""tetR"". In the absence of an inducer aTc, tetR would be produced and would repress the expression of the entire logic gate system, allowing the bacterium to develop normally. On the other hand, adding the inducer aTc would move the bacteria from a ""normal"" state to a ""calculator"" state (see the picture ).
Because the system is too large to fit into a single plasmid, they decided to integrate the logic gate parts (AND1-AND2 and XOR1-XOR2) directly into E. coli DNA (see the picture ).
Where our project can improve this old project is at the level of logic gates. We know that a plasmid cannot accept too many bio bricks. That's why they took the initiative to cut the system and integrate it into the microbial DNA. The problem with chromosomal DNA is that you can only have one copy per bacterium while the plasmids can be present in several copy. We could just insert several plasmids but there is a potential problem of rejects and the bacterium would die because it would not have had enough energy to support all the plasmids.
Our system avoids all these problems. Indeed, thanks to PEPTalk we can insert each logic gate in a plasmid which will also be inserted in a different strain of bacteria. The communication system would simply connect the different bacteria and therefore the different parts of the E.calculus system to increase its efficiency and give positive and non-random in vivo results. This is called a distributed logic gate.

NYMU-Taipei,2017,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," by assisting our characterization of shuttle vector with Holin- Endolysin- NrtA system ( BBa_K2350021 ), and measurements of growth curve with Escherichia coli DH5α, by adding lactose to induce kill-switch, in order to determine whether the suicide system works. With their assistance, we verified that concentration of E.coli significantly decrease after kill-switch functioned in different lactose concentrations.
Figure 1 TAS_Taipei independently tested the function of our lactose-induced kill-switch system. In different concentrations (0-250 mM) of lactose, it induced decreasing on bacteria population.
Teach about conducting site-directed mutagenesis
We have also shown mutual friendship for our long-lasting relationship by teaching them how to conduct site-directed mutagenesis as well as assay biofilm production. Also, two TAS students, Catherine Chang and Leona Tsai, are also NYMU team members. This year, they help us communicate with team TAS_Taipei, finish public outreach for Human Practice, and present our project at the 5th Annual Asia Pacific Conference and the Giant Jamboree.
Link: Safety
Oversea team collaborations, we gain advice, melanin, from Tokyo Tech and put it into our pigment project. With help from Peshawar, we ensure our transformed E. coli can produce our target protein, NrtA protein.
Pakistan: Team Peshawar
We sincerely appreciate the invitation from team Peshawar in Pakistan for team collaboration. NrtA part has been constructed by our team, and its sequence has also been determined. We submitted the part to team Peshawar for examination of protein electrophoresis in September. Team Peshawar has successfully transformed the plasmid containing NrtA gene sent by us, and the transformants were lysed and the SDS-PAGE was performed. Following are the step by step processes that team Peshawar followed to help us in confirming whether the protein is properly synthesized in the cell by running the protein on gel i.e. 45k Da.
The conclusion of our collaboration reminds us of modifying our design by taking signal peptide under consideration. In fact, we have conducted a functional test for determining the capability of NrtA with a semi-permeable membrane system. The function of NrtA protein has been proved valid but still had much to be desired. Taking signal peptide under consideration, we may transfer the protein to the plasma membrane or even to extracellular fluid. Therefore, the capability of NrtA-transformant may be enhanced significantly. The collaboration really inspired"

Mutagenesis·DESIGN
In traditional directed evolution, a mutation library is achieved mostly by PCR and DNA shuffling. Differently, we introduced a mutagenesis module in the IgEM system to make the diversification automatic and more controllable. In order to generate enough mutants of the interested sequence carried by the phage, an inducible mutagenesis plasmid was constructed (see Fig.1), inspired by the work of Kevin M. Esvelt [1].

Figure 1 &nbspStructure of the mutagenesis plasmid
The increased mutation rate is achieved by suppressing the proofreading ability of DNA polymerase Ⅲ and enhancing the translesion synthesis in the SOS response.
Suppressing the proofreading
The dnaQ gene encodes the ε-subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, which acts as the proofreading 3' exonuclease. During DNA synthesis, mispaired bases are removed by the ε-subunit soon after they are incorporated. By changing two amino acid residues, we get dnaQ926, a defective mutant whose products interfere proofreading by competing with wild-type ε-subunits [2].

<p1> (a)An adenine nucleotide has been mistakenly added to the newly-synthesized DNA strand; </p1> <p1> (b)Different from wild-type Pol III, the mutant one with defective ε-subunit (ε’), without 3’→5’exonuclease function, fails to remove the mispaired nucleotide; </p1> <p1> (c)The mistake is retained in the progeny DNA strands. </p1>
Enhancing the translesion synthesis
When a cell experiences DNA damage, RecA proteins will bind to single-stranded DNA formed consequentially by the damage, and induce the SOS response by inactivating the repressor of umuD and umuC. The UmuD protein then undergoes an auto-digestion and produces UmuD’ which associates with the umuC product"

Transformation
Preparation of competent  cells:-
Dilute an overnight culture of E. coli 1:200 with LB broth.
Incubate at 37°C with shaking (at 200 rpm) until the cells reach early log phase (OD600 = 0.25-0.4).
We already have 1X TSS in 4 deg fridge(old). Use it without dilution or thawing. Keep it inside the icebox just after taking out from the fridge.
OR
(if the above 1X TSS is not available)
While cells are growing, thaw 2X TSS on ice and dilute an appropriate amount 1:1 with sterile distilled water (100µl of diluted TSS will be needed for each ml of cells). Chill on ice.
Place 2-ml aliquots of early log-phase cells into sterile 2-ml micro-centrifuge tubes and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 4°C  at 3000g for 10 min.(6-8 mins for taking part from iGEM kit)
Remove the supernatant and discard. Add 0.2 ml of the ice-cold 1X TSS and place the tubes on ice.
Gently suspend the cells by pipetting.
Proceed with the transformation protocol below (Step 2), or immediately freeze cells by immersion in liquid nitrogen or a dry ice/ethanol bath. Store the frozen cells at –70°C.

Aspects that are still missing, like validation
To do’s to achieve a responsible and relevant synthetic biology design
Changes
Achieve relevance by validating the design at the farm
Achieve responsibility by analyzing the risks when there is false positive or false negative
Reflection of the workshop
Lists of responsible and relevant things in our project
Things that were considered as really responsible are listed below:
Reliability (this is not yet know)
GMO-free and safe
Sensitive detection
Contained
The broad range of applications of TDPs
Things that were considered as relevant are listed below:
Modules can be used separately and can be used for different purposes and broad applications: sustainable storability of TDPs
Tackling a real societal/local threat (ABR)
Costs (are unclear)
User Friendliness
Biobrick can be used for broad application and we contribute to an integrated synbio engineering system
Reflection. What is beyond the scope of iGEM and what is things we still can include?
Tackling a real problem
Beyond the scope of the project:
The need is to identify which AB is relevant to use when facing a disease. Our tool gives insights in which ABs not to use. Although we think that our strategy will help to reduce the abuse of antibiotics, the question in the market is slidely different. Prototype tests should give insights whether are device is relevant enough to tackle current challenges.
Point out which AB to use
Sensitivity and reliability
Things we can do:
What happens if there is a false positive or a false negative?
Estimate the change to have a false positive or negative
Make risks analysis: Contact TNO to talk about risks analysis
Beyond the scope of our project:
Being able to quantify detection
Make Cas13a able to detect mutated genes
User Friendliness:
Things we can do:
Contact farmer to check if we meet the friendliness requirements concerning farmers
Contact industrial designer to think along with the final design
Make a decision tree so the farmer knows exactly what to do after obtaining the test results
Beyond the scope of the project:
Develop an easier RNA extraction (specialist should look into this): Adjusting the detection protein to detect the DNA directly instead of the RNA. This would take a step of reverse transcription out of the protocol and make the assay more direct instead of indirect.
Develop a service “a traveling lab in a bus” that does this kind of ABR tests (Front end runner)

Moreover, the application of microfluidics in our platform allows us combine the process of ability training and neuron activity, and makes the research becoming easier to carry out. In the future, our platform can also be applied in different fields, such as the simulation of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The BCI can help the paralysis patient obtain the ability to move and oper-ate things. But the signal from the human brain to which convert to the order to control the computer is so complex and difficult to deal with. If we can decipher the neuronal signals during people learning when the patient’s mind interact with the computer, it is possible to simplify the network and build more connection between them. We are now using our platform to study the alcoholism, in which we train worms to be addicted with alcohol and then study the neuron network during this behavior forming. Hope one day we figure out the logic network of alcoholism of human and help to treat more serious social problem.
What is MiniMos?
The miniMos transposon is used to carry transgenes into the C.elegans'genome by the means of inserting a transgene into a modified Mos1 element (miniMos). The miniMos transposon can carry the inserted transgene (together with a selection marker) into the genome where insertions are generated directly by injecting worms. It will take approximately 1 week to get the result. The insertion site is random and can be identified by inverse PCR on the strain. The miniMos system contains 4 vectors——transposon with target gene, transposase, mcherry and peer-1 markers. Transposon needs transposase to cut and paste in the genome. mcherry and peer-1 are two negative selecter that can help to select the target strains. The method has some advantages:     1)The insertion frequency and fidelity is high.     2)The exact insertion site can be determined.     3)Large transgenes can be inserted.     4)The miniMos element is active in C.elegans.     5)Transgenes are expressed in the germline at high frequency.

Strategy for marker free
The multigene vector 380MF-BBPC has four genes (CrtI, PSY, BKT and BHY) for endosperm-specific synthetic astaxanthin, and a marker-free element comprised of two genes (HPT and Cre) for marker-free deletion. This marker-free element was placed between two loxP sites, and consists of a HPT (hygromycin) resistance gene expression cassette and a Cre gene expression cassette controlled by anther-specific promoter (Figure 9). When Cre gene was expressed in transgenic rice anther, the Cre enzyme deleted the HPT and Cre gene cassettes between two loxP sites. Two primer pairs, F1/R1 and F1/R2, were used to PCR identify the marker-free aSTARice later generations. As is shown in Figure 9a, the expected 400-bp band of F1/R2 PCR indicates marker-free homozygous lines, but the PCR results containing both 540-bp and 400-bp bands indicate marker-free heterozygous lines (Figure 9a). The 400-bp band was further determined by direct sequencing (Figure 9c). And more marker-free homozygous lines would be obtained in progeny.

Put differently, when infinitely many particles obey (6), they will exhibit       Keller-Segel type spatial dynamics as in (7). In a sense,                         we’re using a “reverse-engineered” particle equation that corresponds to the                         Keller-Segel field equation. A detailed theoretical treatment of (6) is                         outside the scope of this model description because it contains a stochastic                         variable. The traditional rules of calculus do not apply anymore for stochastic                         differential equations and a different mathematical theory called Itô calculus       is required. It is sufficient to say that the second term containing       $dW$ accounts                         for Brownian motion in the form of random noise added to the displacement of the                         agents, causing them to diffuse, and that it is governed by the diffusion       coefficient $\mu$.
The first term in (6) on the other hand is easily understood                         as an advective or drift term (net motion) dependent on S, pushing the agents                         along a positive gradient (for negative chemotaxis the sign is reversed). The                         chemotactic drift hence points towards an increasing concentration of the                         chemoattractant. The advective properties are governed by the chemotactic       sensitivity function $\chi (S)$. For our model we used a function of the       form (8).

Biology and Oil Sands: Finally Talking
Today we had the tremendous opportunity of touring Suncor Energy’s Oil Sands project alongside U of A and U of L iGEM teams. This was set up by Andrew Hessel as a means of bringing synthetic biology and Alberta’s biggest industry (oil and gas) one step closer to forming a partnership for future projects. It was incredibly fascinating to see the entire project of mining the bitumen along with its transportation and processing. We were able to briefly talk to one of the mining engineers Len about a topic that has been thrown back and forth with iGEM Calgary: bioremediation. He definitely accented its prevalence in this industry and how they are using some sort of nitrogen containing fertilizer alongside bacteria in order to combat this problem.
What was most interesting today, however, was when talking with Andrew, he corrected my misconception in that it was neither him nor the synthetic biologists who invited us to the field. It"

All cultures except those transformed with Device 1 show a logarithmic growth (see fig. 2). However, even though the OD600 over time is lower than that for Device 3, the fluorescence over time shows higher values for Device 1. Device 3 shows values at a similar range as the negative control. The highest fluorescence after six hours can be seen for Device 2, which is the only device with higher values that the positive control.
OD600 (A) and GFP fluorescence emission (B) over the timecourse of six hours.
Results
The normalised fluorescence was calculated using the spreadsheet given out by the iGEM HQ. As figure 3 shows, Device 1 shows the highest normalised fluorescence for all time points. Device 2 shows lower fluorescence, while Device 3 only shows a very basal fluorescence after six hours.  Both Device 1 and 2 show higher fluorescence than the positive control.
Normalised fluorescence emission for all three devices at the given time point.
Disease and symptoms
All three promoters used in this study were characterised by the iGEM-Team Berkeley in 2006 and showed the following relative strengths:
J23101 (Device 1): 1791
J23106 (Device 2): 1185
J23117 (Device 3):  162
It was therefore expected that Device 1 showed the highest fluorescence, followed by Device 2 and, with a ten-fold decrease compared to Device 1, Device 3.  Our results reflect these values, even though Device 2 showed a lower value than expected."

Unfortunately, Mef Nilbert further confirmed what Mike Vega had told us; she did not think that our detection method would work. She said that it most certainly would be hard to distinguish the gas vesicles, with all the movement and gas that already is in the colon, using only ultrasound. She suggested that we should look for a marker that could be used to detect colon cancer, for example some secreted molecule that could be detected in the stool. With this new information from Mef Nilbert, we decided to see if we could find some possible alternatives to the gas vesicles that could be coupled to our system.
Alternative Methods
So what other methods would be applicable to our product? For diagnosis and localization of the cancer, the most favorable approach would be expression of an MRI detectable reporter gene in the yeast. These give accurate indication of the location of the host cell, and the depth of tissue is not an issue (Srivastava & Bulte, 2014). There are several possible candidate genes for this, as described in the review “Seeing Stem Cells at Work In Vivo” by Srivastava and Bulte (Srivastava & Bulte, 2014). With this approach, the final product would work in the same way as our previously designed system, but with MRI used for screening instead of ultrasound.
Another promising approach that allows for detection, but not localization, is through the use of DNA-recording devices. More specifically, DNA-recording devices in which a specific cell stimulus of choice induces permanent changes in the host genome, which can then be read through DNA sequencing at a later date (Seth & Wang, 2018). One such method, Temporal recording in arrays by CRISPR expansion (TRACE), performs recording through CRISPR-mediated sequential spacer sequence integration into a genomic locus (Seth & Wang, 2018). In our system, induction of TRACE by the pFUS promoter would allow for quantitative DNA encoding of yeast cell density (Seth & Wang, 2018). By sequencing the integration locus of Saccharomyces boulardii from fecal samples obtained from the patient, it would then be possible to determine whether pFUS expression occurred, and to which extent. This would not only provide information about the presence of cancer, but could also indicate treatment progression and has a possibility of predicting tumor"

Twenty-five colonies were selected from Ampicillin resistant plates streaked on new LB –Amp plates and cultured in LB-Amp broth. QIAprep Spin Miniprep protocol was performed on the cultures and DNA was quantitated using nanodrop spectrophotometry. Results: Nanodrop analysis indicated high levels of RNA contamination. P1 buffer didn’t work properly.
Ten new colonies (#1-10) were streaked and inoculated in LB-Amp broth, purified using the Qiaprep Spin Miniprep protocol, and nanodropped.  To confirm that TRC was correctly inserted into the PCR2.1 TOPO vector, an Eco RI and Pst I digest was set up and run on a 1.0% gel. Results: Trc was not successfully inserted into the PCR 2.1 TOPO vector. Bands in the gel correspond to the TOPO vector without insert.

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
Introduction
Through our surveys and various talks, we found that often the recurring theme was a lack of information and contact with the public about how synthetic biology works and its implications for society.
Although our project’s application is broad and touches a variety of fields, we found that it was difficult for people trained in other fields to relate to the synthetic biology aspect. In our questionnaire, one of the results that we found is that most people were unaware of the benefits of synthetic biology and how to use it, rather than being scared of synthetic biology itself.
Therefore we investigated how best to disseminate ideas about synthetic biology and how to make our project appeal to people in other sectors. Moreover we put it into a context to which they could relate.
Contact with Educators
At the outset, we wanted to contact students and professionals in education to understand what current technologies have proven effective in their field and thus how best to disseminate our project.
We first decided to meet with teachers who have worked with students of different levels and ages. We met with:
Edgar Ornelas, a former high school teacher who has worked in the public sector and who currently focusses on implementing open source learning circles across Paris.
Maria Azi, an education professional who has experience teaching elementary school level and is currently implementing successful educational programmes for big companies.
They explained to us that effective education depends on the interchange and feedback between educators and students, and successful educational programmes which we could disseminate to a large audience need to be :
Interactive
Reproducible
Accessible
Personnalisable
Cooperative
Furthermore, they referred us to relevant literature allowing us to better understand the process of learning, which we then used when developing our programmes. Through these interactions and by studying the literature we decided to focus on educational games as well as peer to peer learning.

Our training and experience
Those studying science alone are all in their final semester of a three-year degree, and have taken various courses in microbiology, molecular biology and genetics, and similar fields at the University of Sydney. The two of us studying both science and engineering degrees simultaneously are also in our third year of study, but have completed less units of study in the same subject areas listed above. Sholto’s training lay in mathematics and engineering, and he’s also studying subjects in finance and business.
At the start of the iGEM season, the wet lab team were given a workshop in common laboratory techniques by Nick Coleman (see below), to ensure that there would be consistency in our practices throughout this project. A lot of learning was also done on the go as the project progressed! All website coding was done by Sholto, a self-taught skill he accumulated over the iGEM season. He had no previous experience in website front end devlepment before, though he has worked on iOS and Android apps.  The dry lab team had weekly tutorials with Ed to learn how to apply familiar engineering concepts of modelling to biological systems.
Supervision and guidance
Dr Nicholas Coleman
Dr Nick Coleman was appointed Lecturer in the School of Molecular Bioscience (SMB) in 2006, with teaching and research responsibilities in environmental and medical microbiology.
Nick has lectured to 2nd and 3rd year students across many degree programs including B.Sc., B.Med.Sci, B.Pharm., B.VetSci. and B Ag.Sci, and he has been a course coordinator and prac class coordinator for MICR2022, MICR3022, and MICR3042. Nick did his PhD in Trevor Duxbury's lab at the University of Sydney, studying explosives-biodegrading bacteria. This was the first work to investigate the aerobic biodegradation of the energetic compound RDX, and  he discovered that a cy"

That would make the project more feasible for one summer. - E. coli might not be able to handle all of this. It’s been proven that the process works in anaerobic and aerobic conditions, so yeast might be another object. - We have the capability to build the type of filtration system necessary. - Is it the best to degrade this plastic? It’s carbon sequestering. The degradation of plastic would need to be coupled to something that would get rid of the CO2. We could couple it to make a precursor for some new plastic. We would need to repolymerize it in a type of biological recycling. - Plastic is good to recycle. Another way to think about this project would be to microbially recycle plastic. Divya: “Transplastomic antibacterials” - Plants make small molecule compounds that act as antimicrobials against Gram positive bacteria. There compounds typically act in combination. - Genetically modified plants would produce antimicrobials. New genes are inserted into the chloroplast DNA. - Use a gene gun to deliver the DNA to the cells. This way the chloroplast’s double membrane is penetrated. - Rate of transformation of plants is very low and growing plant tissue is difficult and takes a long time. - Transforming plants is a task in and of itself. We do have resources on campus to do this. It would look very impressive if it actually worked. - Great project, but we need some feedback from alternative sources about the gene gun and plant transformation. - This is a complex project for the time frame. You have to isolate the compound, look at the genes, then isolate and transform. This might work as a side project though, if a very simple compound was used and we changed its expression levels. Cara: “A Privy Understanding of E. Coli” - Fecal matter is the main source of bacterial pathogens in waste. Create a little package of genetically modified bacteria that would be added to a bucket that would be used as a toilet. Bacteria would sanitize the fecal matter and a color change would indicate full breakdown. - How to focus the project: Choose one compound to degrade, look at what types of bacteria/fungi/protozoans are in the mix. - Animal feces might be a bigger problem than human waste. - The bacteria sanitizing the fecal matter"

The AIP sensor function will allow E. coli to “listen in” on the quorum sensing conversations of the S. aureus. The BioBrick is modeled after the agr (accessory gene regulator) quorum sensing system present in S. aureus. AIP (from same cell or from another cell producing the peptide) binds AgrC (a histidine kinase). This, in turn, allows for phosphotransfer to AgrA and subsequently, through activation of transcription, more AIP is produced, amplifying the signal. It is a loop (Atkinson and Williams, 2009.) This is part of the mechanism which allows the bacteria to be aware of the concentration of its own strain in the infected area, subsequently leading to a “collective decision” such as expressing virulence. Please refer to Figure 2 for a visual display of the previously mentioned.
Figure 2: agr quorum sensing system in S. aureus (Cambridge iGEM, 2008)
3.3.3 COMPONENT #3: SIGNAL AMPLIFIER
This BioBrick will serve the purpose of further amplifying the AIP signal obtained by E. coli, and thus, allowing it to “sense” S. aureus, before S. aureus has had the chance to produce a high enough concentration of the quorum sensing signal to initiate a response. In other words, E.coli would be able to, through amplification, “sense” S. aureus before S. aureus has had the chance to sense itself. Unfortunately, there was insufficient time for proper research to be done on this, and so, the final construct lacks an amplifier. The amplifier is not a necessary part, but simply an assurance that the signal will be received through over-amplification.
3.3.4 COMPONENT #4: RFP REPORTER
This RFP BioBrick will produce a red-fluorescence signal proportional to the AIP concentration E. coli senses. This way, not only would one be able to tell that S. aureus is present, they would also be able to quantitatively compare samples to see where the infection has spread further. This would mean being able to decide whom to treat first, in the worst case scenario.
3.3.5 COMPONENT #5: AIP GENERATOR; PERIPLASM TEST.
The purpose of this construct will be to check the sensor-reporter system. The alternative construct contains AIP Generator for self"
UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2011,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," that resistances won’t be horizontally transferred to any pathogenic organism.
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of environmental safety?.
Yes. Hydrogen production could interfere with nitrogen fixation. If the strain we create lacks the nitrogen fixation system and if it becomes common in the environment it could poison the nitrogen cycle. However it is part of our objectives to maintain nitrogen fixation in our bacteria. In the case both systems are mutually exclusive, further safety evaluations and experiments would be required before considering introducing our bacteria into the environment.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Yes, our broad host-range plasmids with antibiotic resistances.
How did you manage to handle the safety issue?.
Our bacteria will be handled exclusively in the laboratory for the iGEM competition. For further applications we have evaluated the chromosomal insertion of our system, which would make vary unlikely the transfer of any resistance gene to other bacteria.
How could other teams learn from your experience?.
A proper documentation, containing not only what safety measures were taken but also why, is crucial. This way all our team learnt from our project will be properly transmitted to future teams.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?.
Yes.
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?.
They believe it to pose low or no risk at all given our bacterial strain Rhizobium etli CFN42, which has a very low fitness compared to other strains.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?.
It is important to recognize which teams did a proper job considering safety issues. As well as present teams check what was done in previous winning projects, teams could check what was done regarding safety in previous competitions. Those teams whose work achieved proper considerations should be distinguished, so future teams can look back at their work.
How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?.
Undesired and unexpected interactions among parts or among systems should be diminished to the maximum. For example, a double transcriptional terminator ensures that the transcription regulation affects only our system, avoiding the transcription of downstream genes. In this way the promoter affects only our system, ensuring that no new regulation interactions arise with the downstream genes. It is important to think that the properties of one part modiffy other parts interactions or interaction strength. For example the number of transcriptional terminators affects the promoter possible interactions.

Modeling approach
The simplified version of our Bi[o]stable switch illustrated in Figure 1 was used in the modeling. A system must possess two or more stable states for it to function as a switch. The essential components of the switch are the two repressors and two repressible promoters. Each promoter is inhibited by the repressor expressed from the opposing promoter. The aim of our project is to design a robust bistable switch that exhibits bi-stability over a wide-range of parameters and that the two states are tolerant of the fluctuations inherent in gene expression. This will allow the latest induced state to remain constant over cell-generations. The bi-stability will arise as a result of the mutually inhibitory arrangement. As denoted in Table 1, the absence of inducers will leave the cell in its current state, where either promoter 1 expresses repressor 1 or promoter 2 expresses repressor 2. The expression of the repressor will prevent expression from the opposing promoter, preventing the spontaneous change of state.
The change of state is accomplished by transiently introducing an inducer (or an anti-repressor protein as in our case) of the currently active repressor. Maximal expression from the opposing promoter and establishment of the alternative stable state will ensue (Gardner, T.S. et al, 2000)(Cherry, J., 2000).
Michaelis-Menten Function vs Hill Function
In our repressor-repressor switch, the simplest switch is one where each repressor binds to its operator by mass action and the rate of transcription is proportional to the amount of unbound operator. A Michaelis-Menten equation can approximate the fraction of bound operator when the molar quantity of the repressor is greater than the operator. The rate of production of repressor protein x is given by:
Where k1 is the maximal rate of protein production, KD is the equilibrium constant for dissociation of repressor from its operator site, y is the concentration of repressor protein y
By expressing Kd in terms of repressor y:
And conversely, the rate of production for repressor protein 2 is given by:
Where similarly, k2 is the maximal rate of protein production of"

Yeast Toolkit Background
If your iGEM team sets out to do work in E. coli, the Parts Registry provides huge selection of parts and vectors to choose from. But E. coli doesn't make bread. Yeast make bread. If your iGEM team wants to deliver vitamins to malnourished children in a genetically-engineered yeast chassis, there are few resources available to assist you. There is a major gap in the supportive parts - expression cassettes, vectors, and reporters - for iGEM work in yeast.
Many special considerations must be made when working with yeast as opposed to E. coli. Yeast expression cassettes are different. Coding regions in yeast must be nestled between a yeast promoter on one end and a 3' UTR on the other.
Yeast projects also require a versatile set of vectors. Ideally, these would be shuttle vectors that can be transformed into E. coli for amplification then back to yeast for final deployment. A variety of selectable markers including HIS, LEU, URA, and TRP would also be desirable. Some applications call for autonomously-replicating CEN vectors. Others times vectors designed to integrate their inserts into the genome are needed. Sometimes all you need is a 2-micron vector.
Finally, with the vitamin A pathway, we are already on our way to a nice reporter library. Beta-carotene is the bright orange pigment found in carrots. Its precursor, lycopene, is the bright red pigment found in ketchup. We decided to go for a third reporter as well: violace"

The samples were freeze-dried during one night at -50°C and at 0,039mbar using a Labcon lyophilizator (Figure 2). Then they were kept at 0°C for 3 days, and at the 4th day a transformation was made. Positive control for transformation was done also with bacteria that had not been freeze-dried. As before, plasmid BBa_J04450 was used. Results of the experiment are shown figure 3.
In comparing the number of colonies obtained after and before the freeze-drying, conclusion was done that loss in competency was roughly 35%. Thus, the freeze-drying can be used as a way to avoid a -80°C chamber.

Figure 3: Transformed JM109 with plasmid which contains RFP gene. On the left - freeze-dried bacteria conserved at 0°C for three days. On the right - positive control transformed JM109 conserved at -80°C.
How to prepare different sucrose concentrations?
In order to obtain different sucrose concentrations, serial dilutions were done.
Final volume of sucrose 100mM of 8mL was the starting point. Sucrose’s molecular mass is 342,3 g/mol. The final concentration expected was 0,1 g/L. Using the mathematical formula m=V*M*C, it was determined that 0,27g of sucrose was needed. So, 0,27g of sucrose was dissolved in 8ml of sterile water.
Serial dilutions are explained in the following table:

Kingsborough_NY,2016,Team:Kingsborough NY#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," The first plasmid is cut with EcoRI, SpeI, and PstI. The second plasmid is cut with EcoRI, XbaI, and PstI.
A quick and routine purification of DNA from a restriction digest, using QIAgen spin columns for example, will eliminate the very small SpeI-PstI fragment in the first digest, or the small EcoRI-XbaI fragment in the 2nd digest).
In both cases, empty vector is generated with EcoRI and PstI overhangs. However, the only viable product of a ligation and transformation will be the vector that contains both BioBricks ligated together. In summary, this strategy uses a triple digest and takes advantage of the fact that most commercial spin columns do not capture small fragments like the EcoRI-XbaI fragment, which would have interfered with the ligation if not removed (however, gel purification is not necessary here).
Gibson Assembly
We also developed a strategy to use Gibson Assembly, both to clone individual HZS subunits fused to a reporter gene and to generate a three-protein operon that will produce the entire protein. You can view this strategy in PDF form, in which homologous DNA sequences are represented by blocks of the same color."

North American Midwestern Meetup
Our team organized a meetup for Midwestern teams on June 30th, held at Michigan State University. In attendance were team members from Rose Hulman Institute of Technology, University of Michigan, Carroll High School, and University of Iowa, respectively. We spent the morning on a very warm tour of the university’s botanical gardens, learning about a range of plants and the history behind the gardens. In the afternoon, each team gave a short presentation and answered questions about their project, ending in a tour of our team’s lab and facilities. Through this meetup, we made connections with other teams and began our collaboration with Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
All of the Meetup attendants pose next to the MSU Horticultural Gardens' statue of the ""father of modern horticulture,"" Liberty Hyde Bailey.
Meetup attendants take a tour of the MSU Botanical Gardens. The temperature may have been close to 100 F, but nothing can keep science nerds away from plant pathway knowledge! (We gave them ice cream afterwards, don't worry.)
Our friends from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology present about their project. This presentation session allowed teams to practice a prototype of their Giant Jamboree presentation in front of other teams as well as faculty mentors.

Organization
This year’s competition will have a Giant Jamboree and no regional-level meetings. In order to discover other French teams’ projects and exchange ideas before the Jamboree, we decided to organize a French meetup with the other Parisian teams, that is, Bettencourt and Evry. The meetup was from 8/2/2014 to 8/3/2014. The following teams participated: Bettencourt, Bordeaux, Evry, Lyon, Saclay.
Planning started in June. We invited all French teams via email. We held meetings with Bettencourt and Evry was decided that Saclay’s campus serve as the venue, because of its open spaces and easy access via public transportation. Saclay team members also offered accommodation in their homes. Meals were prepared by all three hosts.
Activities

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua-A#Modeling#Sensitivity_-_-_TEXT.html," degradation of Cre protein increases so that the Cre declines to zero faster and the time when Cre exists decreases , the number of times of flip will be smaller and the inversion may even happen only once when the degradation constant of Cre protein is proper. We can also see that the number of genes in state ‘B’ which we want is bigger for the reason that when lots of genes flip to the state ‘B’ from state ’A’ and ready to flip back , Cre and Cre-Loxp have declined to zero , so these genes keep the state ‘B’ finally. To understand the affection of the degradation constant of Cre protein more clearly, we then simulate the process when the degradation constant of Cre protein changes from 0.1 to 1.5. And we can get the following result.
To see the result more clearly, we magnify the above figure and just see a part of it.
The result shows that there is more genes in state ‘B’ which we want when the degradation constant of Cre protein is smaller. So we can expect that if we introduce a feed forward to the system which can accelerate the degradation of Cre protein after a certain time we add arabinose, we can also get more genes in state ‘B’ finally. Based on this idea, we designed a system with feed forward.

Introduction:
iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is an annual academic team competition that hosts their ‘Jamboree’ in Boston, Massachusetts. 2015 was the thirteenth year of competition drawing over 2700 participants on 259 teams from 40 countries. Out of these 259 teams, 227 of them earned competition medals: 55 bronze, 57 silver, and 115 gold. On top of this, competition judges 216 special awards and award nominations, honouring both exemplary projects in the 15 project tracks and particularly excellent presentation components including best poster, best software, and best integrated human practices.
This codebook will be used as a guideline and reference to the dataset used in a network analysis of the 2015 iGEM collaborations. A thorough explanation will be given on all definitions and methods needed to contextualize the data.

a
3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid reacts with the reducing ends to 3-Amino-5-Nitrosalicylic acid, resulting in a changed π-system and therefore a change in absorbance. During the reaction, the reducing ends are oxidized whereas one nitro group of 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid is reduced to an amino group of 3-Amino-5-Nitrosalicylic acid. The more free reducing ends are present the more 3-Amino-5-Nitrosalicylic acid will be formed. Thus, the absorbance will increase.
Results from Dinitrosalicylic Acid Staining
The absorbance of non-hydrolyzed samples of the glgB strain is higher than the absorbance of the wild type (see figure DNS staining of hydrolyzed samples of the glgB strain and wild type). To identify the amount of glycogen in the samples, we hydrolyzed the samples and applied our staining. Our results show that the number of branches in glycogen is higher in the glgB strain compared to the wild type (DNS staining of non-hydrolyzed samples of the glgB strain and wild type).
DNS staining of non-hydrolyzed samples of the glgB strain and wild type
The non-hydrolyzed samples of the glgB strain and wild type show that the overexpression of glgB leads to glycogen molecules with a higher number of branches compared to the wild type. Error bars show propagation of uncertainty.
DNS staining of hydrolyzed samples of the glgB strain and wild type
The hydrolyzed samples indicate that the glycogen amount is higher in the wild type compared to the glgB overexpressing strain. Error bars show propagation of uncertainty. Since cell fragments are still left in the samples, the blank also shows an absorbance. Therefore, the line does not go though the origin.
a
The non-hydrolyzed values divided by the hydrolyzed values generate a ratio. Based on this ratio we can identify the number of branches per glycogen unit. It indicates that the number of branches per unit is higher in the glgB strain compared to the wild type.

MFC
Instead of exploiting more water resources, which has more and more negative influence[1], it's better to make less pollution and treat water pollution.[2] And we must know what kinds of contaminations in the water and how much are them. So we chose MFC (Microbial Fuel Cells) to detect the heavy metal in water.
So, what is MFC?
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) provide new opportunities for the sustainable production of energy from biodegradable, reduced compounds. MFCs function on different carbohydrates but also on complex substrates present in wastewaters which is an ideal approach to solve both pollution problem and energy crisis. Compared with traditional chemical methods of sewage treatment, MFC is environmental friendly and widely adept by various condition[3].
A MFC converts biomass energy directly into electricity. This can be achieved when bacteria switch from the natural electron acceptor, such as oxygen or nitrate, to an insoluble acceptor, such as the MFC anode. A typical microbial fuel cell consists of two compartments: anode and cathode compartments separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM). In the anode compartment, microorganisms oxidize the fuel and generating CO2, electrons and protons. Electrons are transferred through an external electric circuit to the cathode compartment, while protons are transferred to the cathode compartment through the membrane. Electrons and protons are consumed in the cathode compartment, combining with oxygen to form water.
Figure 1. The working principle of a microbial fuel cell.
Substrate is metabolized by bacteria, which transfer the gained electrons to the anode. This can occur either directly through the membrane or via mobile redox shuttles. MED, redox mediator; Red oval, terminal electron shuttle in or on the bacterium.[4]
After electron generated, the electron need to be transferred out of the microbe, The mechanism includes two methods:
1.Direct transfer mechanism: Electrons are directly transferred from the microbe’s cell membrane to the anode surface (A), nanowires transfer the electron through conductive appendages, termed “nanowires”, grown by the bacteria.(B) 2.Indirect transfer mechanism: Microbes employ a secondary biomolecule ----- electron transfer mediators(ETMs) to shuttle the electron to the anode(C).

Abstract
""E.coli Pen"": Draw with your own color.
Our team, KIT-Kyoto suggests an “E.coli Pen” as a new Art Tool. This brand-new pen uses no ink but medium in which genetically modified E.coli has been cultured. The Pen is able to express more than four colors in various intensities with single bacterial culture. This will be achieved by constructing plasmids carrying genes coding for four different fluorescent proteins under the control of seven promoters having different sensitivity to oxidative stress. The E.coli carrying these plasmids will produce different colors with various intensities by differentially responding to the gradient of hydrogen peroxide treatment. Different from previous passive BioArt in iGEM, the genetically engineered “E.coli Pen” provides an active and wonderful tool for us to purely enjoy the Art having a feeling for biotechnology.
Introduction
Our team, KIT-Kyoto has designed and carried out the project taking account of the key word ""Make the science and technology more accessible to the public"".
Recently, it is getting more and more serious problem that people think that the science is too difficult to understand. Moreover, it is expected that people are moving away from the science as the science becomes more and more complicated. Therefore, to overcome such a problem, we would like to offer more opportunities for the public to interact with the science especially for the person who is not interested in the modern science.
In deciding our project, we thought it is the most important that anyone can readily enjoy the science and technology. We therefore decided to focus on ""Bio art"" in order to invent the artistic products by using biotechnology, since Art is more accessible to the public. Moreover, unifying the two apparently distant academic fields ""Science"" and ""Art"" is an educational philosophy of our University, Kyoto Institute of technology.
>>Learn More BioArt
A brand-new form of art has emerged with the revolution of biology in the last ten years, this is Bio-Art. Adding new artistic elements, such as cells, DNA, genomes, proteins, enzymes, etc., this new form of artistic expression has as medium living matter, and the studios of the artists are biological laboratories"

  Zhou Mubing: presented a comprehensive introduction to another basic concept of synthetic biology, the Ribosome Binding Sites (RBS). RBS is a sequence of mRNA which used to lead the ribosome to the right position on mRNA during the beginning of the translation. His introduction included different characteristics, working mechanisms, design standard and assembly between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.
  Pan Deng: chose a rather complicate topic called Synthetic Oscillatory Networks, which described a concentration shifts phenomenon manipulated by negative feedback mechanism. This field may promote our new cognition of living organisms and show prospects in biosensing.
  Lv Chenchen: talked about synthetic biological counter in cells. Riboregulated transcriptional casade (RTC) counter is a stem-loop structure that counts the number of arabinose pulses. While the DIC counter is via the mechanism of FRT sites inversion.
  Zhang Junqiu: gave the presentation “Programmed population control by cell-cell communication and regulated killing” which introduced a quorum-sensing system that can control cell density at constant amount autonomously. The mechanism is similar to the natural circuit of Streptococcus pneumonia.
  Yang Xin: took efforts on the issue of “Engineered bacteriophage targeting gene networks as adjunvants for antibiotic therapy” which mainly concerned the increasing lag between drug development and the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Potential solutions expect phage to be modified to express lethal genes to cause cell death which might be a crucial step in reducing infections in the future.

Rice University Collaboration
Members of our team met with Rice in late June to practice presenting our projects and discuss future collaboration efforts.
Members of our team present our project to the Rice University iGEM Team
The UT-Austin team reached out to the Rice team early in the Summer of 2018 to determine if our teams could help each other. We decided to meet at the Rice campus and share our project ideas.
At the meet-up, we presented our project ideas to each other and discussed ways in which we could integrate our projects. Rice’s project revolved around modifying the T7 Expression system to be more broad host range, which fit with our goal of creating a broad host range plasmid kit to easily and efficiently transform non-model organisms. They suggested they could benefit from using some of the promoter part plasmids we created to test transcription independent of translation. We were able to provide a protocol for transforming Acinetobacter
We also gave them a one tube reaction with a protocol to test to act as a prototype of the complete kit. Once they transformed the one tube containing our assemblies  into their organisms of interest, they could determine which origin of replication functioned and utilize that information.
Albert Truong, of the Rice 2018 iGEM Team , provided their results and feedback when transforming our assemblies into E. coli in their lab. The Rice team also provided us with valuable insight and suggestions on how we could improve our kit protocol.
(See Integrated Human Practices)
Texas Tech University Collaboration
Members of our team hosted a meetup with iGEM members from Texas Tech University and Austin LASA to share our projects, provide feedback, and strengthen our collaborations
In order to strengthen our partnership and continue our collaboration efforts with two additional Texas iGEM teams, Texas Tech and Austin’s Liberal Arts and Science Academy .  These teams met with us as part of the Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium at the University of Texas at Austin in September of this year. Here, we discussed our projects and gave suggestions to each team related to achieving various medal requirements. This was the third consecutive year we hosted an iGEM meetup at UT Austin, and we hope to continue this tradition for the foreseeable future.  This was the first year that the LASA high"

2  Functional assay for Glucose Responsive Suppressor System
The bacteria carrying the indicated vector were cultured in LB media supplemented with 34 μg/ml of chloramphenicol (Cm) at 37°C overnight. The next day, OD600 was measured and adjusted to 2.5 in M9 minimal media with various concentrations of glucose. The bacteria then were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. 100 μl of the bacterial culture was put into one well of a black-walled, clear-bottom 96-well microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The fluorescence intensity was measured using BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader System at Ex/Em = 488nm/518nm  for GFP.
In the assay for repressor system, the data in Fig. 4 gave the similar results as team Glasgow did in 2015, in which the strong activity of the repressible promoter was significantly repressed in the presence of PhlF repressor.
In the assay for glucose responsive repressor system, we improved the Glasgow’s BioBrick device, in which the expression of PhlF repressor was driven by a glucose response promoter, Pcar. The result in Fig 5 clearly indicated that the GFP activity driven by the repressible promoter was gradually increased in response to the loss of glucose to 1.88 folds compared to the initial GFP activity at the beginning culture in M9 media, suggesting that the level of expression of PhlF was positively corresponding to the concentration of glucose.

The bacteria then were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. 100 μl of the bacterial culture was put into one well of a black-walled, clear-bottom 96-well microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). OD600 was measured using BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader System. Further,  the culture media were taken out and diluted 106 times following by spreading onto LB Cm agar plate at 37°C overnight.

For both substrates we can see that the as the temperature increases. Armed with this information we know that if can increase the incubation temperature of our system when we add the substrate solution we can potentially decrease the amount of time it will take our system to produce a signal from the presence of our target DNA.

Standard error of the mean bars are not displayed due to their lack of visibility.
Does Prussian Blue Ferritin Work on a Strip?
After doing the kinetic analysis of the Prussian blue ferritin it was necessary to think in terms of our actual device. There are many factors that we must balance in order to design the most optimal system. How much Prussian blue ferritin will give us a positive result that we can see with the naked eye? Which substrate will give us a result the fastest?  What substrate colour is the easiest to see (Figure 14)?
Figure 14. Image of the colours of ABTS and TMB (10 mg/mL for both) after reacting with Prussian blue ferritin.
In order to test the Prussian blue ferritin in a strip environment we blotted varying concentrations of Prussian blue ferritin onto nitrocellulose; the material which will make up our strip system. From the results below it became readily obvious that TMB produced a much more distinct and identifiable colour compared to ABTS (Figures 15 and 16). Further testing also revealed Prussian blue ferritin was able to produce a detectable reaction of TMB when only 2.5 nanograms of the Prussian blue ferritin was present. We anticipate that this detection limit could be improved given more refined methods of applying the protein to the nitrocellulose. We also decided based on the results of this"

Coffee and lunch breaks were used as networking opportunities! We presented a poster with more in-depth details of iGEM and encouraged the attendees, in particular the industry representatives, to speak with us.
Overall, we feel that attending this conference really bolstered our knowledge about synthetic biology in general, and what applications it is currently being used for. The talks were very interesting and some even inspired new project ideas!
Eccelso Presentation
In July, Rob and Ralf gave a presentation to a representative from Eccelso, a company specialising in the production of vegetable fats and margarine. We presented our ideas to them, and they explained how palm oil products are used in the industry. Talking to somebody with direct experience of using our potential future product was very useful, and their advice helped us to decide whether to create our fatty acids all in one production batch or in multiple batches. In addition to the great advice, they also provided us with sponsorship. Thanks Eccelso!
Young Synthetic Biologists (YSB 1.0) - 12th July 2013
In July, half of the team (the rest were either graduating or attending family weddings - slackers!) travelled down to London to take part in the first ever Young Synthetic Biologists conference (YSB 1.0). Since we couldn’t make the SynBio 6.0 conference we were ready to make the most of this opportunity to network with fellow budding synthetic biologists!
Over the course of the weekend we participated in both a poster and oral presentation, gave feedback on the other teams’ projects and received some interesting opinions on our own work (mainly concerning our model, lots of people were very interested in it!) Various workshops were provided and so we split up and each went to a separate one, we thought we might as well aim to get as much out of the conference as possible. The workshops proved to be a great way to network with the other teams, and quite soon Jess had rallied some other teams into attempting a modelling collaboration (more of that over on its specific modelling page ).
Overall it was a great experience and we’re looking forward to seeing everyone again in Lyon!

There used to be several iGEM conference before the final. This year, SYSU-China participated the 2014 iGEM Conference organized by National Chiao Tung University in August 3, 2014. Five members, Mingxuan Zhang, Runwen Yao, Wei Tang, Jianhua Zeng, Dengwen Lai presented. This conference provide a platform for us to exchange ideas and experiment experiences.
Our team prepared a poster a presentation for the conference, and we successfully introduced our ideas and designs to the teams presented. Our project attracted several teams’ attention, like YMU, NCTU_Formosa, BIT, etc. We argued about some doubts in our project and this helped us to better our project. Moreover, we better understood many teams’ designs during the discussion about their project.
Apart from academic exchange, we also made a small survey about the laboratory condition of some teams. We found that the teams in Taiwan usually have better laboratory condition than mainland. Colleges in Taiwan are more willing to offer independent laboratories and funds to their teams.

BBa_K2378007 is an improved coding sequence of IrrE BBa_K729001 from by Team UCL London 2012. When transformed to E. coli, this protein protected from salt, oxidative, and thermal shock. Background of Improvement We tried to analyse existing IrrE part from BBa_K729001 Team UCL London, and found some possible error in the coding sequence. The translated nucleotide is not a contiguous protein, which is shown by a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, continued by another start codon ~90 base downstream.  At first, we thought that it's the IrrE nature to have two separate active proteins. But after we find the corresponding Uniprot accession number, there are important domain of protein in the 75-199 position of the residues, under the classification of peptidases. This domain is essential for the activity of IrrE functionality because it cleaves and inactivates repressor protein DdrO, leading to the upregulation of several DNA repair and other genes after exposure of the cells to radiation.[ 1 ] From the alignment process, it is shown that the 'lost' protein from the stop codon is not from the peptidase domain sequence. But, from the length of the untranslated residues (~30 aa), it is hypothesized that this will affect the structural stability of the protein itself. Moreover, the second protein is not functional and does not have any motifs, hence will be possible burden for the metabolic process efficiency.
Improvement
We optimized the sequence for the expression in Escherichia coli BL21 by using synonymous mutations, then made the protein contiguous while being translated. We also removed the low complexity region.

Glycerol stock
Made a 50% glycerol stock of C2987 cells containing the T7-LacO-Lysostaphin-HlyA plasmid for the -80°C freezer.
Protein induction
A protein induction of C2987 cells containing T7-LacO-Lysostaphin-HlyA plasmid was planned, but the OD increased too fast to start with the induction. It was therefore postponed until tomorrow.
Small culture
Because of the failed induction, a new small culture of C2987 cells containing T7-LacO-Lysostaphin-HlyA plasmid(2x 25 mL) was started.
New double transformation
A new double transformation was performed, see Day 42 – Monday September 25. Same construct, but on fresh plates. This time there were colonies.
SDS PAGE
The SDS of the double transformed cells from the small culture on Monday September 24 with the pellet and medium of the pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pTetO-HlyB/D and pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D constructs. There were some bands in the cell media of pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D.
PCR
The goal was to get a vector + insert with the correct overlap for Gibson Assembly. This was done with pBAD (469"
