Characterization of the mOrange protein in B. subtilis
The fluorophore genes are derived from the iGEM DNA distribution kit. Previous work using the BBa_E2050 biobrick         was focused on the function of the mOrange protein (an mRFP (DsRed) derivative) in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The aim of our experiments was         to integrate the gene encoding the mOrange protein into the genomes of different B. subtilis strains. Unfortunately, the plasmid pSB1C3 does not contain an origin of         replication for B. subtilis. Therefore, we introduced the fluorophore genes into the B. subtilis plasmid pAC7. For this purpose, we amplified the fluorophore genes by PCR, ligated the digested PCR products with the plasmid pAC7 that was cut with the same enzymes and transformed competent cells of the E. coli strain DH5α. During PCR, the fluorophore genes were fused to the artificial (Plij2 promoter, which should be constitutively active (see Figure 16). The promoter was designed in silico and contains binding sites for the housekeeping sigma factor A and a perfect RBS for B. subtilis. As shown in Figure 17, all strains synthesizing mOrange formed cell pellets with an orange color.
Figure 17. A cell pellet of the B. subtilis wild type strain 168 is not orange. The cell pellets of the strains iGEM24, iGEM28 and iGEM36 synthesizing mOrange are slightly colored in orange.
In the next step, the plasmid containing the mOrange gene was used to transform the B. subtilis wild type strain 168 and the glyphosate resistant strains BP233 (ΔgltT) and BP235 (ΔgltT ΔgltP). The activity of the mOrange fluorophore protein in the B. subtilis wild type strain 168 was further analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, the strain was cultivated overnight at 37°C in the darkness. 0.01 ml of the culture were transferred to a microscope slide that was covered with solid 1% agarose dissolved in H2O to inhibit the movement of the cells during long-time exposure. As shown in Figure "

殺し屋のバクテリアは、病原体役の”餌のバクテリア”のところにたどりつくと、その病原体や癌の細胞を死に至らしめるための遺伝子部品群が作動します。ハイデルベルクチームはそのために2つの異なるストラテジーを採用しています。第1のストラテジーはバクテリアの産生する毒、第2のストラテジーはあるバクテリアに特異的に感染するウイルスの活用です。毒は通常、あるバクテリアの株が生産し、他のバクテリアを殺します。これらの毒はもちろん癌細胞も殺すことができ、これにより癌細胞を除去することができます。そこで、第1のストラテジーでは、我々はバクテリアの毒の産生の遺伝子情報を殺し屋のバクテリアに導入し、餌のバクテリアのところにた"

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the doctor's suggestions. If the doctor considers her suitable for molecular targeted therapy, Ms. Meng will be really willing to try the new drug.
Ms. Guo (70-year-old)       Rectal cancer sufferer
Ms. Guo has been diagnosed as rectal cancer for 8 years. Her initial symptoms were slender stools along with purulence and abdominal pain. But she thought it was caused by her constipation combined with hemorrhoids. She did not know that it was rectal cancer until she went to the hospital for a colonoscopy.
During the 8 years, Ms. Guo has experienced two surgeries. The first one was taken soon after her diagnosing. At that time, as she was found in the middle stage of the cancer, the doctors performed the surgery to remove the lesion. After the surgery she continued chemotherapy treatment for continuous control, adhering to the check every 3 months. However, in 2011 and 2015, Ms. Guo has experienced 2 recurrence. Now she depends mainly on the treatment combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Every 21 or 28 days she goes to the hospital for a session of chemotherapy. After accept chemotherapy, Ms. Guo suffers from side effects like vomiting, hair loss, limbs weakness, etc.
As Ms. Guo’s husband told us, the reimburse they received is more limited, because they came for treatment from another province, which is defined as non-local insurance. Ever since Ms. Guo’s treatment, they have spent more than 200k RMB (30,000$) on medical expenses, which add up to be a very heavy burden for them.
At the same time, Ms. Guo told us that there are a lot of people distributing leaflets and ads around the hospital. Some of these ads might be false, yet desperate patients still try to contact them as if they are clutching at the straws of their lives. Ms. Guo hopes that the government could provide some authoritative medical journals for patients like them, enabling patients to understand the latest researches from the formal channels, and to get a better comprehending of the therapies that suit them.
Summary
Long story in short, most of the patient we interviewed showed positive mental conditions, but the economic situation of their families could be uneven. There are not many patients who have relatively well-off condition like Ms. Chen, and more than half of the patients cannot afford molecular target therapy thus rely on the medical insurance reimbursement.
Most of the patients are holding certain expectations for new therapies. However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies"

Now is time to give you the answers for the questions we asked you and ourselves, actually.
Does tocopherol indeed help with cell growth?
To ask this question, we had the cell growth analyzed with oleic acid in the medium and a same medium with oleic acid and tocopherol. We then measured cell density in the plate reader. Once again, one problem would be the higher concentrations of oil would distort our readings.
This problem was adressed by making the 2:1 solution of oleic acid:ethanol. This solution did not fully stop the separation of the phases, but greatly reduced it, and with the sample in the shaker, it would be well shaken and well mixtured, meaning the nutrients and oil should be available to the cells. The nutrients would no longer stick to the tube wall. The downfall of this method is the presence of ethanol in the medium, which at a maximum of 5% v/v concentration shows no harm at all for the bacteria, but higher concentrations may be toxic
The same ammount of ethanol was also added to the control samples, to simulate the ethanol toxicity and compare only the growth relative to oil and tocopherol.
All the graphics' proportions from now on represent tocopherol|oleic acid added in uL.

Examining the graphic, we note that the sample with 1:1 tocopherol:oleic acid concentration, the 50|, is the one which had the highest growth rate, meaning that our theory of tocopherol helping the bacterial cells to whitstand the oil concentrations may prove itself right. We can also clearly see that the excess of tocopherol helped to inhibit our 2|1 sample. It is noteworthy that the 0.032M sample had a better growth rate than the control, showing already some potential even in the 1:2 proportion.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-def_-_-_TEXT.html," significant difference between the negative control and each of the three volumes of treatment with defensin, thus supporting the role of defensin as a potential combat protein for the inhibition of biofilm formation in S. aureus. However, caution has to be taken with the interpretation since crystal violet also stains bacterial cells and not only biofilm - part of the effect observed may be due to a bacteriolytic activity of defension.
Demonstrating efficient biofilm dispersal by Def
To demonstrate biofilm dispersal by defensin, two crystal violet assays are used, one with P. aeruginosa as the biofilm-producer and the other with S. aureus. For the experiment, the already established biofilm is treated with 5 μl, 20 μl or 50 μl of whole cell lysate containing defensin. Differences between the negative control and Def are then evaluated using Student’s t-test. A p-value <0.05 is considered statistically significant.
Biofilm Assay, First Attempt [❓]
Figure 7. Absorbance measured for different treatments of Def using P. aeruginosa.
The graph does not show a clear biofilm-dispersing activity by defensin. Whereas the larger volumes of treatment seems to lead to a decreasing absorbance, the same applies to the larger volumes of negative control. This may be due to contamination or due to unspecific effects of the cell debris and thus the results may not be reliable.
Figure 8. Absorbance measured for different treatments of Def using S. aureus.
The graph illustrates how defensin (combination of pellet and supernatant) dispersed biofilm by S. aureus. There is a significant difference between negative control and 5 μl and 20 μl of treatment, respectively.
Unfortunately, no clear effect of defensin could be demonstrated - the changes observed after application of the treatment are generally small and do not always correlated with the amount of sample added. Additionally, the negative controls occasionally display an inhibitory effect as well.
Demonstrating bacteriolytic activity of Def
A modified Kirby-Bauer test is used to assess defensin's bacteriolytic activity. TOB1 E.coli are streaked on agar plates onto which filter papers impregnated with the bactericide are placed. Additionally to the cell lysate samples containing the combat protein, a positive controls in the form of an antibiotic is applied as a reference. The bactericidal activity is then measured by observing the “halo” around the impregnated paper.

We then did a transformation with these Gibson-ed plasmids and plated the cells on ampicillin plates and put them in the incubator overnight.
Gradient PCR
In a last attempt to try to amplify the P23019 plasmid backbone (the last piece needed to start a Gibson assembly of the TetR plasmid), Vincent tried a gradient PCR in which separate samples of the plasmid would be run at temperatures between 40 and 50 C (40, 42, 44, 46, and 48). The results showed, once again, that amplification was beyond reach.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Killing_-_-_TEXT.html," called spot42. The spot42 was redesigned to sense our USP45 sequence and bind to it. We call our modified part, Spot42_USP45. The Spot42_USP45 system consists of an antisense region that will recognize our USP45 and it also has the part that recruits the Hfq protien that will block and inhibit the mRNA translation. The Hfq protein will stick to the antisense region; this will block the RBS from binding to the mRNA and therefore inhibits the translation. We have designed three different antisense regions for our Spot42_USP45. They are all based on USP45 but with different lengths, 10, 15 and 20bp. This is to ensure that it is specific to only USP45. Otherwise it might bind to another region and inhibit a process that could be vital for the bacteria. We chose to have USP45 as our primary secretion tag since our initial goal was to build our system in Lactobacillus. To help us with that, we used knowledge from the Uppsala iGEM 2013 team, who worked with Lactobacillus and USP45 among other things.
Result
Characterization
Our initial plan was to have an secretion tag together with our colicin Fy allowing it to secret from the living cells. Unfortunately we did not manage to get the assembly of any of the constructs to fully work. Our enzymes for the Freiburg standard did not seem to work so we had to use SpeI and XbaI causing a stop codon that we did not managed to mutagenise away.
We had however succeeded in creating construct without secretion tag. The expression of colicin Fy with x6 His-tag was characterized via an purification of the protein with IMAC followed by an SDS-page to confirm lenght, [Link to protocol] . 11 tubes of eluent from the IMAC was saved. The protein concentration in each tube was analyzed with a nanodrop. Tube 4 and 6 had higher concentrations than the other tubes and were run on SDS-page.
The results from the characterization experiments can be seen in fig. 2 and 3. According to calculations based on the nucleotide sequence, the mass of colicin Fy is about 49,6 kDa. The protein ladder we used was Thermo Scientifics PageRuler Unstained Protein Ladder #26614 (fig. 2). The thickest band is 50 kDa so our bands should be at about the same height.

iGEM Cornell
We collaborated with iGEM Cornell to design and distribute an anonymous survey that would help us analyze the attitudes of the general public towards genetic engineering and the usage of genetically modified products. This was done to analyze the possible perceptions people may have concerning our treatments and the resulting products. The surveys were distributed online and in person at events such as the New York State Fair and the Ithaca Farmer’s Market; this was done among individuals with differing factors such as age, gender, and educational background. To ensure responses relating to both teams’ projects, we decided to include questions that prompted individuals to consider different aspects of genetic engineering and the merits thereof. We were able to successfully design a survey alongside its distribution, as multiple discussions were held between both teams to analyze the factors that would most relevant to modern societies and the questions that would be subject to the most insight from individuals, regardless of their level of awareness for synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Through this process, we were able to learn more about the prejudices and controversies surrounding synthetic biology, and we used those considerations to design our final survey.
The results from Stony Brook revealed a larger percentage of people who claimed that they knew what synthetic biology was, as compared to the percentage of people in Ithaca. After running a T-test, this was confirmed to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.01. This was an interesting result, since Cornell is a larger institution with easy access to events, seminars, and programs. The results may suggest an extent of segregation between Cornell’s student body and its surrounding community. Many people viewed synthetic biology as a positive influence on the world. Although more people in Stony Brook viewed synthetic biology as a positive contributor, we found that there was an insignificant difference (p = 0.41) in how people felt about synthetic biology in Stony Brook aside from Ithaca. People also believed that synthetic biology should be more restricted to certain areas of science, but there was no difference in this view between Stony Brook and Ithaca (p = 0.21). Most people appeared to have an equal understanding of synthetic biology and GMOs, but as shown by our graphs, people tended to have a better grasp of GMOs than synthetic biology.

2. Only single gene deletion or addition can be performed in FBA. More than that, the metabolic model here can perform modification on any single or multiple genes and reactions through Simbiology.
3. The FBA model is static, it cannot analyze the dynamic interactions between our synthetic pathways with the metabolic pathways. As both our P(3HB) synthesis model and the metabolic model are in the same platform. It was really easy to integrate our pathway into the metabolic model.
4. The strain in the metabolic model is E.coli K12, the strain MG1655 we are using is also included in K12 group. The models can therefore be more easily combined.
In our project, we have a different pathway:
1. We use 3HB as one of the input.
2. ato system is present in the E.coli MG1655 strain.
3. We removed phaA in our case because we use 3HB as the major source to produce P(3HB), it will avoid too much acetyl-coA be taken from the metabolic pathways.
Therefore, we substituted the original pathway with our synthetic pathway. Moreover, we added our gene expression models for the enzymes into the metabolic model as well. In terms of the consistency of the model, we changed the units of our synthetic pathway into micro molar and seconds.
Here is the combination of our model with the metabolic model
The pathway with the black border is our synthetic pathway.
We also carried out a parameter estimations of the initial concentrations of several substrates in our synthetic pathway. The reason is we have single-cell scaled magnitude for them originally (fM level), but there are much higher magnitudes in any of the species in the metabolic pathways (mM level). Therefore, we scaled up the pathway in order to maintain the consistency of the model. As for the metabolites which are involved in our pathway, we cloned the blocks of them from the metabolic pathway in Simbiology and deliberately put them into our pathway. That means our pathway dynamically interact with the metabolic pathways.
Here is the table for the updated initial concentrations for the species in our synthetic pathway: All the kinetic data and initial concentrations of the metabolites in the metabolic pathways are referenced in the paper [18] :

Alternative Splicing
Alternative splicing is a type of post-transcription mRNA modification observed in most multi-cellular organisms. It happens where there is more than one intron in a gene, meaning that different splicing site choices generate different mature mRNA thus produce different protein. The choice of the splicing site is controlled by a very complex system, yet we have some interesting and convincing understanding about it, and may it become a new perspective in synthetic biology.
In a multi-exon pre-mRNA, some exons are constitutively cut off or maintained, while some exons are sometimes skipped and sometimes kept. The latter is called an alternative splicing. The pattern can be controlled by many mechanisms involving a good many RNA secondary structure formations, protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Different splicing patterns always have relatively constant expression pattern in certain cell condition.
We are inspired by this interesting phenomenon and hope to design a new synthetic biology tool which can use compiled gene to produce many different kinds of proteins under different conditions.
We are inspired by a consistent mechanism of splicing pattern determination, which is called the mutually exclusive splicing. Every time only one out of several exon cassettes(altering exons) are presented. Latest discoveries revealed this is affected by certain pre-RNA secondary structure. If we change the sequence of the regulatory region, we may change the splicing pattern, and some proteins are expressed in a regulated and constant way.
One big problem about this idea is the chassis. Multi-cellular life-form is not very suitable for synthetic biology, and there is no such system in bacteria. So yeast becomes the only solution we can come up with. Very few alternative splicing is reported in yeast, yet it can normally carry out the pre-RNA processing function. Another is that changing the gene sequence to control the expression pattern is too difficult to apply.
Finally, we suspended this idea and tried to find other doable and potential projects.
E-waste
E-waste now is becoming a worldwide environmental problem. Current treatment is like this: most countries transport the E-waste to the developing areas; then the workers there recycle the useful or worthy parts by hand; the useless parts are shredded and the powder undergoes further selection by different physical and chemical properties; eventually the remains are deeply buried. The whole process costs tremendously and still results in environmental pollution. So we tried to solve this problem in a synthetic biology approach.
We checked the components of the E waste: plastic and metal. We"

The split-sfGFP strain stress-response
Having confirmed that our design for yeast transformations was correct via the previous experiment, we performed stress-response tests upon our PBS2-HOG1-splitGFP ( BBa_K1486029 ) and ( BBa_K1486035 ) strain to determine whether the pathway is reactive to stress as theorized. A co-transformation was performed using linear fragments produced in the same way as for the first experiment to obtain the strain. The N-terminal split of the superfolder GFP was tagged onto PBS2 and the C-terminal onto HOG1. The strain was then tested along with non-transformed cells in a 96 well plate with various stresses (e.g. Acetic Acid, Ethanol, Glucose...). The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS before loading into the plate.
The most reactive of stresses turned out to be Acetic Acid 3.6% (shown above). Ethanol 10% was also very efficient. Other stresses tested did not seem to show conclusive results and we were unable to determine more reactants before the wiki freeze deadline. To further assess the fluorescence 10μl of our  cells were spread on a glass slide and imaged with a x63 objective and a Green LP filter (Excitation BP 450-490, Dichroïc FT 510, Emission LP 515). Below is shown a comparison of before and after 3.6% Acetic Acid stress in the microscopy image merged with the fluorescence.
For a more quantitative measure, the fluorescent cells to total cells ratio was calculated and illustrated below.
From the data shown above, we can see that fluorescence increases within cells in our split sfGFP strain in response to stress while it does not in non-transformed cells. We can thus conclude that the orientation of the split sfGFP constructs added to PBS2 and HOG1 allows proper re-assembly upon interaction of the two proteins. This result shows promise for the actual application of the project as a Biopad using yeast cells. It is the first time a split gets succesfully implemented in the HOG1 pathway by direct attachment to proteins of the kinase cascade. Detection of protein–protein interactions within the pathway were previously studied using vesicle targeting .
The split-Luciferase strain stress-response
After determining that the pathway is reactive to certain stresses and that the split-GFP strain increases its fluorescence, we performed the same test in the obtained split-luciferase ( BBa_K1486030 ) and ( BBa_K1486036 ) strain. Unfortunately,"

iGEM’s use of the wiki format and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts is unique in that user’s are required to use these tools over the course of participation in the competition, thereby providing a user-base that actively utilizes the collaborative medium.  Furthermore, users are validated prior to being allowed to make any additions or changes, thus resolving the issue of anonymity.  However, the ability to maintain quality control remains an issue that is yet to be addressed, particularly with regards to the products in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Accordingly, we propose a change to current method of rating and review as well as an incentive based program to promote consistent participation in the program from the user-base.
(Note: Obviously, there are numerous other inherent risks to this type of public disclosure in both social networks and Science 2.0 websites.  The risk of harm to the individuals providing the information in both the former and latter situation is a fascinating ethical quandary that is oft discussed and written about.  However, these ethical problems are beyond the scope of this particular paper and are not applicable to our Human Practice proposal.)
Motivation
Our project hinges on the proper function of Cph8 (BBa_I15010).  This synthetic light-sensing protein is composed of a fusion between EnvZ histidine kinase from E. coli and the phytochrome Cph1 from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis.  It was first submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological parts by Jeff Tabor (UT Austin) in 2004 and required a silent mutation at base 108 to remove a PstI cutsite to make the part compatible with RFC[10].
It has since become one of the most high profile parts in the registry and is the red light-sensing component of a featured part, the “Light Sensor” ( [1] ).  This light sensor turns a plate of bacteria into biological film where the bacteria in the dark produce LacZ, which converts S-Gal into a black-precipitate, and the bacteria in the light remain the natural color of E. coli.   This system was also featured in the November 24, 2005 Nature edition under the title “Engineering Escherichia coli to see Light” (Levskaya et al).

iGEM 2010 Notebook
The lab notebook chronicles our journey in the creation of the Genomikon kit.  Many paths were woven together in space and time to reach this finished masterpiece.  To help you navigate through these trials with us we have laid out our notebook in a layered fashion.  This page gives a sketch of each project and how it interacts with each other.  Then follow the links to a projects page for time line of the major landmarks and accomplishments.  If you require more details on the project the links within that page will take you to our day-by-day work log.
Building Parts
The Building Parts project was responsible to first build a plasmid (plasmid 01)that contained our own specialized prefix and suffix nested inside of the standard BioBrick prefix and suffix.  After plasmid 01 existed we inserted the CcdB gene (the ""death"" gene) between our prefix and suffix removing the gene for Kanamycin resistance (plasmid 02).  Plasmid 02 is fantastic base plasmid from which we are able to amplify any part at all because it provides a positive selection marker when transformed into DH5α. At this point we were able to make parts en masse to put in our kit. After obtaining a particular part in a plasmid we PCRed the part and digested it ready to use in Assembly or to Test the plasmid.
Testing Parts
Before we were able to test parts we created 2 base testing plasmids (vector 01 and vector 02).  Vector 01 is designed to test Open Reading Frame parts, or parts that code for proteins.   The part is flanked by a promoter and the start codon on one"

Figure 10: iGEM UIOWA 2018 also informed themselves about Dual Use issues with the help of our slides.
Athens 2018
Figure 11: Team Athens goes through the slides at a Skype conference.
iGEM Athens 2018 also even spread awareness by presenting our slides at the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute.
We thank every team for their openness to look at your project from a different perspective. We are looking forward to every next team that comes along!
3. Dual Use Awareness Button – A Seal of Quality for Awareness Worldwide
As an incentive for iGEM teams to use the slides and to deal with the topic, we designed a Dual Use Awareness button which we sent every team that has dealt with our slides. It is supposed to be a ‘seal of quality’ through which the teams could express that they take DURC issues in concerning their own project seriously and are well informed about the topic. The button is uploaded to the iGEM servers and can be easily integrated into their wikis.
Figure 12: Dual Use Awareness button.
4. Let’s go a little deeper: Detailed Slides for Everyone
Additionally, we developed detailed slides which can serve as a lecture to get a deep understanding of Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern. These slides contain all the relevant definitions related to DURC and suitable examples from different fields of research. They enhance the understanding for this topic and make it easier for students to distinguish between the conceptions. Imparting awareness and developing a sense of responsibility for DURC issues and their communication is the major aim!
5. Establishing a Seminar – Anchoring Awareness
In order to further strengthen the awareness of DURC on a long run we incorporate scientists of various expertises who are willing to present their point of view on DURC in a seminar.
Part of our novel seminar is Jun.-Prof. Dr. Alexander Grünberger who is keen to discuss the slides in the study program Molecular Biotechnology. He is a professor for Multiscale Bioengineering and will represent the view of bioprocess engineering.
Prof. Dr. Kristian Müller is professor for cellular and molecular Biotechnology and was the first PI to supervise a German iGEM team. Therefore, he is one of the German PIs with many years of iGEM experience. He will talk about DURC in synthetic Biology.
Moreover, Prof. Dr. Alfons Bora who is a professor for sociology of law"
Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Humanpractices_-_-_TEXT.html," will recommend all iGEM teams consider in future years.
Outreach
Community involvement
Members of the iGEM team presented to WISEST Teacher Appreciation Day, Aug 14, 2012, discussing the iGEM program and our project. WISEST is a U of A training program aimed at encouraging the attraction, retention and advancement for women of all ages in science, engineering and technology.
We also presented at the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines (aGEM) competition on Sep 15-16, 2012. Currently in its fourth year, aGEM is a gathering of western Canadian iGEM teams, where they have a chance to present and receive feedback from a star-studded panel of judges. Although patterned after iGEM, aGEM attracts its own audience, including more than 100 largely local luminaries who came to hear about advancements in synthetic biology at the hands of Canadian students. Although this year, the team from Calgary won aGEM (boo! hiss! the University of Calgary is a traditional rival to the University of Alberta), we received encouragement and a slate of useful suggestions for the remainder of our project.
High school students who took part in our team will be an important component of our outreach. Their experience, paired with the fact that they are still active in the local high school community will allow them to be powerful proponents of high school iGEM, and will hopefully allow them to have a part in setting up future high school iGEM teams in Edmonton.
Collaborations
Interaction between iGEM community
We would first like to thank Uppsala 2011 iGEM team, for introducing amilGFP to the iGEM universe. Although we did not need to contact them directly, the data and sequences they contributed to the parts registry formed the core of the colors we used this summer.
We have supplied strains and plasmids to a number of other iGEM teams. Both the University of British Columbia and University of Calgary iGEM teams relied on E. coli knockout strains we had access to and provided to them. Additionally, the CINVESTAV-IPN-UNAM_MX iGEM team used a number of BioBricks first made by the 2007 and 2008 University of Alberta iGEM teams, which we provided to them along with technical suggestions. (Parenthetically, we note that the border issues faced by some teams pales in comparison to those faced by Canadians.)

Sup35 is a 685-amino-acid protein, which contains three regions that are distinguished by their function and amino acid composition: the amino-terminal region Sup35N(amino acids 1 to 123), the middle region Sup35M(amino acids 124 to 253) and the carbon-terminal region Sup35C(amino acids 254 to 685)[9].
[Figure 1] Crystal structure of Sup35(PDB code: 1R5B)
[Crystal structure and functional analysis of the eukaryotic class II release factor eRF3 from S. pombe             Kong, C., Ito, K., Walsh, M.A., Wada, M., Liu, Y., Kumar, S., Barford, D., Nakamura, Y., Song, H.           (2004) Mol.Cell 14: 233-245 ]
The character of Sup35 is importantly decided by the character of the amino acids sequence which is quite different from other normal proteins. Sup35N is unusually rich in  Gln(28%) and Asn(16%) resides, but has few aliphatic amino acids. By comparison, the average protein has just 9% Gln and Asn and 29% aliphatic residues. Sup35N also contains several imperfect oligopeptide PQGGYQQ_YN repeats that are similar in character to PHGGGWGQ repeats present in the mammalian prion protein, PrP. These repeats are the only immediately obvious similarity between Sup35 and PrP protein sequences. Sup35M is highly charged, unlike the rest of the protein. Forty-one percent of the residues in this region are lysine, glutamic acid, or aspartic acid. SupN is sufficient to support yeast prion induction and propagation, and Sup35M plays a role in [PSI+] stability and Sup35 solubility. So the Sup35NM is the prion-determining region(PrD) which enables the proteins to act as prions[9].
Sup35 has two states: nonprion and prion states, and they can transform into each other. When it's in its nonprion state, Sup35 is the translation release factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which binds to Sup45 and ends the process of translation.

When Sup35 is in prion state, it can propagate and transform nonprion-state Sup35 into prion"

UNIPV-Pavia,2008,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," a project and, after some meetings with the other team members, they begun project implementation when Spring 2008 DNA Distribution arrived. The two students worked together in lab to build up and test the designed devices. They also organized periodic meetings with the team instructors to discuss about project progress. Daniela Galli supervised students' wet lab activity and was always ready to help to solve specific biological problems. During our activities, we found very useful to keep in touch with Bologna iGEM Team to share doubts and issues about the work. In particular, several conference calls were organized and two meetings were scheduled in Pisa and Bressanone (Italy). It was fundamental to compare lab protocols and techniques to help each other avoiding mistakes and speeding up project progress. The main topics of our discussion were the optimization of plasmid resuspension and ligation reaction steps as well as how to measure fluorescence. Finally, before DNA Repository quality control publication on the Registry web site, we cross-checked some parts that showed problems after DNA transformation. Problems had been confirmed by quality control results (parts' sequences classified as ""inconsistent""). In particular, we were interested in red light sensor parts (see ""notebook"" section for more information).
Where we're from
Pavia is a town of south-western Lombardy, northern Italy, 35 km south of Milan on the lower Ticino river near its confluence with the Po. It has a population of about 71,000.
Pavia is the capital of a fertile province known for agricultural products including wine, rice, cereals, and dairy products. Some industries located in the suburbs do not disturb the peaceful atmosphere which comes from the preservation of the city's past and the climate of study and meditation associated with its ancient University. The University of Pavia, together with the IUSS (Institute for Advanced Studies of Pavia), the Ghislieri College, the Borromeo College, the Nuovo College, the Santa Caterina College and the EDiSU, belongs to the Pavia Study System.
Pavia University is one of the oldest universities in Europe and the oldest one in Lombardy. Since its foundation in 1361 it has been a good place to study for both Italian and foreign students.
Each year, thousands of students can appreciate the multidisciplinary vocation of our University and the hospitality of its campus, really unique in Italy for the possibility it offers of living and studying in a lively, intellectually challenging environment.
The University of Pavia today:
3 hospitals
9 faculties
15 colleges
20 master degrees
35 libraries
49 departements

Population Model
Ecolibrium has developed two population-based models on two different platforms: Gro and MATLAB . Gro presents a novel way to visualise stochastic simulations via real-time animations. Gro fits into our data visualisation strategy, which you can find more about in our Integrated Human Practices page. The MATLAB model provides a more detailed representation of the intracellular and extracellular interactions of our Genetically Engineered Artificial Ratio (G.E.A.R.) system. Scroll down to learn more about our two population-based models!
MATLAB
Using the SimBiology toolbox of MATLAB, a population-level model was created based on the single cell model of GP2 regulation to predict the ratio between 2 populations, with each containing its own circuit. This population-level model allows us to accurately predict the ratio between two populations when modifying the key controllable parameters (ie. promoter strength, copy number, RBS strength, etc) of the circuit identified by the sensitivity analysis of the single-cell model and consequently tune the populations to a desired ratio.
The model consists of 2 compartments representing separate populations housed within a larger compartment representing the extracellular environment. Quorum communication between the circuits within each separate population compartment is encapsulated via AHL diffusion between population compartments and the extracellular medium.
The full single cell model of the circuit is also contained within each population’s compartment, which is scaled up automatically to the growing population compartment’s size by SimBiology. The dynamics of each population’s own internal circuit based on GP2 growth regulation then determines its growth rate. The growth of the populations is then modelled through the Competitive Lotka-Volterra equations, which incorporate competition for shared resources within standard logistic growth equations.

RESULT
As data shown here, Ac5 is a strong and constitutive promoter which can drive GFP to high expression level in mosquito cells. And we can transfect more than 50% of GFP positive cell with liposome-mediated DNA delivery.
Signal driven by CD4-Toll chimera and blocked by HIV
To test feasibility of fusion CD4-Toll chimera, we acquired the plasmid of Drosomycin promoter-luciferase from world-renowned insect geneticist, Dr. Jean-Luc Imler and conducted the luc reporter assay with Ac5-CD4-Toll-polyA in the mosquito cells.
EXPERIMENT
↓ C6/36 cells (1.8 x 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate)
↓ Liposome-mediated transfection and culture for 2 more days
↓ Add gp120 of HIV (1 μg/ml*) or not and incubate for 24 hours
↓ Cell lysis and luciferase assay
*The concentration of gp120 in the serum of HIV-infected people is between 0.12~1 μg/ml.
RESULT
The result indicated that luciferase activity driven by Drosomycin promoter can be triggered by CD4-Toll chimera. The activity was decreased in the presence of gp120 of HIV. The finding demonstrates the possibility that GE mosquito created by our project could be applied to detect HIV virus in infected human blood.

What are we doing?
For the past two decades, wheat stem rust fungus caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) has spread across the world, severely damaging the world’s food supply. Conventionally, farmers look for physical structures called pustules to check for the presence of Pgt, and therefore must wait 7 to 15 days for the physical symptoms to form. By designing an early detection mechanism, farmers will be able to apply fungicide and treat their crops before the disease progresses. In addition, damage from the fungus is more severe when infection occurs early in plant development, making early detection crucial in crop efficacy.
In order to test for the presence of Pgt spores, we propose a two step mechanism: detecting and profiling.
The detection aspect of our project will produce a signal alerting farmers of the presence of Pgt spores, regardless of virulence by detecting ribitol. By transforming E. coli DH5α, which does not naturally respond to ribitol, with a plasmid carrying a promoter induced by ribitol upstream of a fluorescent protein, we aim to detect the presence ribitol, and therefore the presence Pgt.
The profiling component of our project aims to distinguish the virulence of the race of Pgt present.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," materials manufacturing, for which environmental sustainability would be an intended selling point, this level of water consumption might not be justifiable.
Finally, we met with Michael Lepech, Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, who has expertise in life cycle analysis (LCA) and has conducted research with NASA on the use of biomaterials for construction.  Professor Lepech left us with two key takeaways.  First, he emphasized that the environmental impact of a process is inextricably linked its energy source. Any bio-manufacturing facility in the US is mostly running on fossil fuels.  Only about 13% of US electricity comes from renewable energy sources.4 Second, the production and distribution channels for traditional manufacturing materials have become so efficient that it is nearly impossible for biomaterials to compete on price alone. (I pointed out that localized manufacturing of latex might cut down on environmental and monetary transportation costs.  In response, Professor Lepech pointed at my shirt: “Only about a dime was probably spent on transport for that.”)  Because  bio-manufacturing is so expensive and yields are so low, the market currently incentivizes bio-manufacturing of small, expensive products.  Pharmaceuticals are the perfect fit, as are expensive, complicated materials (like Bolt Threads’ spider silk5).
What does the future look like for other biomaterials?  Professor Lepech gestured to his work with NASA as a way forward.  On a place like Mars, there is no market competition.  Astronauts have only limited resources, and bio-manufacturing methods might make most efficient use of limited resources. It could be, then, that space exploration will provide the necessary incentives to develop biomaterials, incentives that our Earth market economy lacks.  Once developed for space, Professor Lepech suggested, these materials might make their way back to Earth. Professor Lepech, whom we met through Stanford connections, had surprisingly led us back to NASA.
Our team ultimately integrated our research into the design of our project by reinvesting in the idea of developing space materials that might be repurposed in years to come. We came to appreciate the greater role that NASA plays in propelling research that might not otherwise happen.  And in our meetings with the Stanford Space Initiative and with Dr. Alan Stern of World View, we attempted to better understand existing needs in space exploration that might be met by biomaterials.
(A side note: We also met with Dr. Stephen Comello, Associate Director of the Sustainable Energy Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, who encouraged us to"
Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"In the early 1900s, radioactive materials were first discovered.  Up until this time, the idea that some atoms displayed signs of “radioactivity” was known, but specific details were lacking.  After scientists realized how to rearrange atoms using neutrons, it did not take long before German chemists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman bombarded some isotopes of uranium with thermal neutrons revealing traces of barium and the first glimpses of nuclear energy technology (1).  This newfound knowledge sparked the interest of Niels Bohr and Francis Perrin who both worked on methods of slowing down the decaying process of neutron emission, right before World War II broke out (1).  Werner Heisenberg’s student, Rudolf Pieierls, took over this work, building on Perrin’s theories (1).  Since Pieierls worked for the German energy project, his team began working on ways of integrating this technology into warfare.  Although they were unsuccessful, both the United States and Britain saw this development as challenging and significant and were spurred to carry on developing the atomic bomb (1).  During the war, governmental efforts increased drastically towards such research, and on July 16, 1945, the United States tested their first atomic bomb in New Mexico (1).  Not long after in August of 1945, the United States put two bombs into service and detonated them over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan (1).  These two events are the only active deployments of nuclear weapons in war.  90,000 to 166,000 people died in Hiroshima and 60,000 to 80,000 died in Nagasaki (1).  Most of the deaths were from the effects of burns and radiation sickness with the balance coming as a result of other injuries and illness.  After the end of World War II, efforts once again turned to energy production.
In December of 1951, Experimental Breeder Reactor I, the first nuclear electricity-generating power plant, was operational and it produced enough electricity to power 4  200-watt light bulbs (2).  By the time it was decommissioned in 1964, it was able to provide enough energy to run its own facility.  This marked the beginning of nuclear electrical energy production.  In 2009, 13 to 14% of the world’s electricity came from nuclear power (1).
There are many ethical issues that arise when discussing the use of nuclear power.  The impact of its use is felt environmentally, economically and socially.  Pro"

We met with Dr. Richard to discuss incorporating his biomass hydrolyzer into our research and to evaluate the economic impact of our project by using the NREL AspenPlus model and economic analysis of a biorefinery. We had our weekly meeting with Dr. Salis and Dr. Richard to update them on our progress. Dr. Salis helped to tweak the website and offered suggestions for improving the design.
Colonies sent for sequencing, discovered that no insert was present. Decision reached to attempt digestion, ligation, transformation again.
Week 7
Monday, June 30 - Sunday, July 6
- Notebook Entries
We prepared and digested 10 colonies of Plasmid 1 to ensure that the backbone is correct.  Four of the digested plasmids were sent for sequencing.  More work was done to update and design the website.
Problems realized with inverse PCR. Several attempts made to optimize this reaction. Success near end of week as strong bands observed. These will be used in the next digestion, ect. Digestion, ligation, transformation carried out again, cells plated. No colonies observed.
Week 8
Monday, July 7 - Sunday, July 13
- Notebook Entries
We prepared the Plasmid 1 backbone and dCas9 system for ligation. New backbone colonies were sequenced and cryogenic storage was prepared. We met with Matt Johnson from the Center for Science and the Schools and he gave us good feedback on how to structure our presentation to the NewBio teachers.
Standard enzymatic digestion, ligation, attempted one more time, with sufficient optimization from the last two attempts. Used Chiam's electrocompetent cells, as it is suspected that ours are bad. Colonies observed, DNA harvested, digested to see if expected bands observed, sent for sequencing. Sequencing results show presence of an insert, but also include significant regions of ambiguity. Attemps made to send for sequencing on campus. Numerous improvements made to plasmid harvest protocol. Improvements made to journal and updates made to website. Skills gained in html, CSS coding. Problem with inverse PCR is discovered. The reverse primer tail was incorrectly designed and was fixed. Unfortunately, this means that virtually everything earlier than this was likely failing because of this error, which cost us a lot of time. Primer re-ordered.

Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," optimized for expression in lactobacilli. The part was optimized to balance DNA synthesis by IDT and expression in L. johnsonii. Therefore longterm and shortterm repeats had to modified and biobrick restriction sites were removed.The part was modified for RFC10 at the prefix and suffix of the part.
( BBa_K1882006 )
LDH-Promotor
This part contains a the promoter of the L. johnsonii ATCC33200 lactate dehydrogenase, a constitutively expressed protein. This part is RFC10 compatible
( BBa_K1882007 )
Ketohexokinase
This part encodes a ketohexokinase (ATP:D-fructose 1-phosphotransferase) from Rattus norvegicus optimized for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The ketohexokinase converts fructose to fructose-1-phosphate using ATP to perform the phosphorylation. This protein is not common in yeast and  functions as toxin of the cell by trapping phosphate and therefore ATP in fructose-1-phosphate, not being able to be further metabolized. This result stop of growth of transformed yeast in fructose containing media (Donaldson et al., 1993). This part is RFC25 and RFC10 compatible.
( BBa_K1882000 )
ApaI-constPromotor
This part encodes for BBa_J23102 with an ApaI restriction site upstream of it. Combination with BBa_K1882010 enables this part to clone a construct in a RFC compatible plasmid.
( BBa_K1882009 )
Terminator-Bam-Hind
This part encodes for the rrnB T1 Terminator (BBa_B0010)  followed by a T7 Terminator (BBa_B0012) and BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. Combination with BBa_K1882009 enables this part to clone a construct in an RFC compatible plasmid.
( BBa_K1882010 )
RBS-PezT
This part encodes for a  codon optimized version of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine kinase (PezT toxin). Upon expression the toxin produces UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 3'-phosphate which inhibits MurA and therefore cell wall synthesis in E. coli as well as L. johnsonii. Besides the sequence for the PezT toxin this part contains an upstream located  ribosome binding site and could therefore be cloned direct behind any promoter of choice.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," a cassette with a chloramphenicol resistance and the upstream and downstream region of the dns gene. To use the natural transformation it is enough to use 1000bp flanks but for the co transformation it is much better to use 3000bo flanks. By using Frt sequences between die single fragments, the antibiotics cassette can be excised from the flippase after integration. Because this knockout worked, we started planning for VibriClone. Our decision was made to perform the deletions with co-transformations. This was a big advantage because you only need one selected product. As selected product we chose the dns, due to the fact, it was shown that a deletion and insertion of an antibiotics cassette at this locus is not harmfulto the cells. This has not been shown for the other parts. The deletion of exeM is done by an unselected product. Therefore we create the upstream and downstream regions of this gene and take another gene that we would like to insert (katG) and build an unselected cassette by using fusion PCRs.
With this procedure, we are able to knock out the exonucleases and thus obtain a higher transformation efficiency.
Figure 3:Sequence of recA. With a zoom in the region of the point mutation.  At position 158  in recA of V. natriegens is a glycine. Through an alignment, we have found out that this is homologous to that in E. coli. To get the same kind of function loss, this glyin needs to be changed to an aspartic acid
RecA
The classic allosterically regulated enzyme RecA is involved in the regulation of the SOS System and the homologous recombination (McGrewet al.2003) . If you think about what you need for a cloning strain, it quickly comes to your mind that homologous recombination in the genome and between plasmids is not only unnecessary but also undesirable.
In E. coli, a so-called recA1 mutation was performed. This mutation limits the recombination of an introduced plasmid with the genome and between plasmids thereby the stability of the plasmids are ensured. Another advantage is that the exogenous plasmid DNA is left unchanged by the modification of RecA. This allows the purification of this bacterial culture plasmid to allow high fidelity PCR amplification of the original plasmid sequence.  The modification in this gene was a point mutation from G to A at position 720. Thereby the glycin at the place 160 chance to aspartic acid"

Next, we checked whether our plasmid can produce M. magneticum proteins from the synthetic operon. Fig. 7 shows the detection of mamQ expression by immunoblotting. In this experiment, E. coli cells grown in rich media to their stationary phase were lysed and the total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and examined by HRP conjugated anti-His5 antibody. When mamQ is included in the synthetic operon, a 30 kDa band is clearly observed. This band is not visible when the plasmid lacks mamQ. These results indicate that at least one gene from the synthetic operon was produced in E. coli, demonstrating that both transcription and ribosome binding work normally on this construct.
Fig. 7  the detection of mamQ expression by immunoblotting
mamQ was detected between 25 kDa and 35 kDa.
We failed to detect mamL, a small hydrophobic protein with 85 amino acids. This might be attributed to some technical reasons, i.e., inefficiency of small protein capture on the membrane, or the difficulty of the solubility in the loading buffer. In any case, since mamQ protein was detected, we reasoned that the other two genes (mamL and mamB) are expressed as well.
Detection of vesicle formation by transmission electron microscope (TEM)
To check whether mamL, mamQ and mamB induce vesicle formation in E. coli, the plasmid pLQB ( Fig. 6 ) or empty vector (pSB1C3 inserted only T7 promoter and RBS) introduced strains were grown to their stationary phase, and examined by the transmission electron microscope (TEM). In Fig. 8 , 8 photos selected from each strain are presented.

Plasmid pSB1C3 (inserted only T7promoter and RBS) was transformed into E. coli the negative control group (upper) and plasmid pLQB was transformed into E. coli the pLQB group (middle). Plasmid pLQ was transformed into E. coli the pLQ group(lower) also made magnetosome-like vesicles. Protein and lipid membrane was stained.

Merck is a leading company for products in the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors. Their expertise consists of three mayor sectors: Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials. This wide variety of subject areas ensures Merck's status as a global player. Their close collaboration with scientists ensures the high-quality of their products and know-how. Merck has supported the iGEM Bielefed-CeBiTec teams for seven years. We are grateful for their continuous scientific support and expertise.   Back in August, we visited Merck to present our final project idea and the first results. Our visit was organized by Prof. Herget, who has been a great supporter of the iGEM-Teams Bielefeld for several years.
The following discussion dealt particularly with possible in vitro and in vivo approaches and the ethical concerns regarding our project. They confirmed our idea to add in vitro experiments as an additional control for our project.  The moral concerns have also been addressed. Therefore, we designed a survey and asked for second opinions in a variety of meetings with ethicists. This eventuated in our report “ChImp - Chances and Implication of an Expanded Genetic Code”, from which we derive guidelines and recommendations for work awareness in science. Visiting Merck is valuable in more than just one way: we did not just gain experience in holding a presentation in front of experienced researchers,"

Using the club recruiting chance in our school, we advertised our project to the students who are interested in biology and nature science. We introduced synthetic biology to them about  the concept, the significance and the future of synthetic biology with the E.coli cartoon designed by OUC-China, giving them a better perspective about the charm of synthetic biology. They learnt more about the blood donation and our project. Another purpose of this activity was to discover the potential members who want to take part in iGEM next year.
We also taught some students the simple biological technology, and held a competition of drawing picture on the agar plate, which caused a great repercussions. Many of them are very interested and wanted to join our team next year.
Here we would like to show some pictures as following that the students drew in the compitition of agar plate drawing. They are very fantastic，hope you like them and enjoy!
Public Engagement
During the club recruiting in our school, we advertised our project to the students who are interest in biology and nature science. We told them about the knowledge of synthetic biology, like what is synthetic biology, what is the significance of synthetic biology and the future of it. We hope that students can not only learn more about the blood donation, but also learn more about the meaning of this subject. Another aim was to discover the potential members who want to take part in iGEM next year.
We also hold a small lecture at our school. We first introduced our project to them, why we chose our topic, how we did the experiments and what we have found in the end. But the most important part of the educational lecture was to introduce the advantages of blood donation to our students and teachers. Because we need to set up the concept of blood donation in the early age. We made some flyers about the knowledge of blood donation and gave them out. The lecture was successful, and students also told their parents about the knowledge.

Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our <a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Add_a_Part_to_the_Registry "">Add a Part to the Registry</a> link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)

Project Description
Our project has three main areas of focus:
1) Design and build low-cost open source biotools:
Our interdisciplinary backgrounds and our convenient home within Inworks at the University of Colorado       Denver, allowed our team to build many of the tools we use in the lab including a fluorimeter, an optical density sensor,       a DNA concentration meter, an incubator, a refrigerated centrifuge, and a yeast dryer,       which we will be exhibiting at the Jamboree expo as part of our ""Hardware"" track deliverables.
The fluorimeter and optical density sensor we built was based on a design by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team .       We improved upon the original design by designing a 3-in-1 cuvette holder using a Form 2 Resin 3D printer.       Different colored filters can be inserted interchangeably into the cuvette holder to filter       different frequencies of light, and thus detect opitcal density or fluoresence or DNA concentration.       We also improved upon the original Arduino code by refactoring and commenting functions. We also used       a four-button Olimex LCD screen, which required re-mapping functions to the four different buttons, and       adding DNA concentration calculations to the code base. All of our code is open source and available for download       on our github repository.
The high-level goal of our project is make biological diagnostics and tools more accessible in       resource-constrained areas. The difficulty with implementing biological diagnostic tools in these places, however,       is largely the same as the issues that orginally motivated our project: lack of refrigeration and resources.       We therefore wanted to design a system where engineered yeast could be ""dried"" similar to the process for       bakers and brewers yeast, shipped in inexpensive packets at room temperature, and reconstituted on site       to preform the intended diagnostic funtion. To meet this goal we built a yeast drier, modeled after       industrial yeast driers. Our Project Design and Proof of Concept pages contain more details       on the construction and implementation of our hardware designs.
2) Create an oxytocin quality sensor using a G-protein coupled receptor in yeast:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html," is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Due to the low yield of the DNA purification fro Attempt 1, the entire PCR was repeated. Upon gel separation we realised the PCRs were nearly identical (see Gel Picture), which is what we were expecting. However, the DNA was euted into 10ul of EB buffer instead of 50ul during the gel purification step, which increased the concentrations of CpII 4-10 significantly. However, CpII 1-3 concentrations were still below the 10 ng DNA/ul range.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"

We were able to successfully perform ICA to obtain a 12-mer. The accessory bands present may be due to PCR non-specific amplification, or to inaccuracies in the ICA process.
We excised the 1324 bp band for gel-extraction in preparation for cloning.

Towards the end of the meet we had the opportunity to interview Dr Adam Rutherford, a prominent scientific journalist and broadcaster, and ask him some questions similar to those that we had previously posed at the Speed Debating session i.e. regarding release of synthetic organisms for the purpose of confronting plastic pollution. This will be part of the next installment of our gemFM radio show. In addition to the other teams, we were interviewed by the BBSRC (British Biological Sciences Research Council) about our experience with iGem so far and what we hope to get from the remainder of our project.

If no thought is given to application or use, the picture is not        complete, just like a puzzle. Within our project we developed a design for the possible implementation of desalinating yeast into wastewater treatment and discussed its necessity in       comparison to conventional desalination methods. Follow the flowchart to gather information on the applied design of a new way to handle wastewater – the Salt Vault.
Reverse Osmosis
Reverse Osmosis is an established technology to remove salt from water by retaining solvent molecules on a semipermeable membrane. This method is used in a variety of applications      in saltwater desalination plants of countries struggling with freshwater supply. Reverse osmosis purifies water completely from all kinds of pollutants and molecules. However, it      has got significant disadvantages, making it necessary to think about alternative solutions.

Reverse Osmosis
The theoretical approach of reverse osmosis is rather simple: A high external pressure is applied to the contaminated solution resulting in water moving to the permeate side            while diluted substances even on molecular basis are hold back. Since this application is used in an extensive way worldwide, it is necessary to talk about this method in detail.            We want to showcase some of the disadvantages of reverse osmosis and some applications where reverse osmosis might not be a good method to clean water from certain contaminants.            Summed up, there are three main disadvantages to reverse osmosis:
Reverse Osmosis plant
1. Energy consumption and Maintenance
Energy consumption and maintenance are responsible for up to 95% of the running costs of a reverse osmosis plant [1]. Not considered in this are the high building costs of such a plant.          Most plants experience severe maintenance problems caused by fouling or breakage of pumps and compressors [1]. As a result most plants run with only 40-80% of their maximum          performance and cause increasing water costs due to low productivity [1]. When plants struggle with their productivity production costs for water can rise up"

Exhibition at Nanterre University
Paris Saclay's stand at Nanterre University
With the help of Stella Pacheco from the CROUS of Versailles, the TEAM held an exhibition at Nanterre University called ""This is not a Lemon"". Our goal was to raise awareness about Synthetic Biology, collect opinions about it and talk about the iGEM competition with a non scientific audience. Some of us, Caroline, Marion, Alice and Claire were present at the site to meet people and answer their questions. Great learning moment!
Festival Vivant 2016
Coline and Carla
We had the opportunity to promote our project and the iGEM competition during 3 days at the Festival Vivant 2016, held at the Paris Diderot University. Marin, Naiane, Coline, Caroline, Maxence, Carla, Laetitia and Mathilde took turns presenting the project to a broad audience with the help of posters and some cool ludic tools.
Fête de la science
Caroline, Yacine and Naiane
The ""Fête de la science"" is a national event organized by several universities, such as Paris-Saclay university. The aim is to promote science in general and it was another opportunity to talk about our project to a non scientific public. We received mostly families and we explained the synthetic biology to children with ludic tools. Caroline, Naiane, Yacine and Carla were there to represent the iGEM Paris-Saclay team 2016.
Meet-up Ile de France
The Meet-up Ile de France was co-organized with iGEM team Paris Pasteur. It took place on the 6th of August in Pasteur Paris Institute. It was a meeting of several iGEM teams of Paris Region: Paris Bettencourt, Evry, Ionis Paris, Pasteur Paris, and ourselves, Paris Saclay.
Naiane was the one who took care of the organization and communication along with Pasteur Paris teams members. Coline and Léa presented the project during a 20 minutes presentation. A great way to spend a summer day under the parisian sun. A moment which allowed great interaction with other parisian teams and their projects, specially during the ""ice breakers"" picnics.

USTC,2009,Team:USTC#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," fields are on the biology side, while evolutionary algorithm is an engineering approach widely used in optimization problems.
Fitness landscape is often used to characterize evolution. Mountain peaks are high ability to survive, while valleys represent low fitness. Similar genotypes are close to each other, while different ones are far from each other. The population takes an adaptive walk across such a landscape. The paths of evolution is determined by the fitness landscape.
Problems to Be Solved
Evolutionary algorithm have been used for more than 50 years, many strategies have been and are being developed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. These strategies deal with the control of evolution parameters. There are deterministic control, adaptive control (feedback control), and self-adaptive control (the evolution of evolution).
Directed evolution experiments are usually carried out by hand, the parameters are optimized according to experience. Therefore, it will take a lot of time to optimize conditions, especially for new targets. When the condition is not optimized, different fitness may not be well separated, and the success rate will be low.
If the conditions can be controlled automatically according to theories of evolutionary algorithm, it is expected to greatly increase the success rate and reduce the time, labor and cost. However, automation of the experiments is not practicable under today's technology.
Fortunately, the rapid development of synthetic biology has opened another possibility. Biological systems become programmable now. It is possible to automate the process in the cell, to make an E. coli cell an automatic directed evolution machine.
The Blueprint
The Goal
Automation of Engineering a Genetically Engineered Machine
We designed the E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine (E.ADEM) project.
The ultimate goal is to make E.ADEM a universal framework for evolutionary approaches in synthetic biology. Anything we want in synthetic biology can be automatically created, from promoters, RBS, regulators, receptors, binding partners, aptamers, enzymes and ribozymes, to sensors, logic devices, reporters, metabolic pathways, entire genomes, and even solutions of mathematic problems.
To each evolution object you want it to evolve, a scoring function can be designed to output PoPS as the fitness score to your demand. After that, you can ligate the scoring function device into the E.ADEM plasmid, transform E. coli, culture the cells and wait for them to evolve automatically and robustly, and get what you want at last.

We picked one plaque off of the 180 sec UV plate sample. We suspended it in 1 mL of broth, and then UV-ed 20 uL samples at 45 second intervals. The number of plaques decreased the longer the samples sat under UV light.  The samples were irradiated from 0 sec to 4 min 30 sec.
As a control, we diluted the T4Do stock to 10^-6 and tested 20 uL at 45 sec intervals (up to 6 min) under UV light.
Also, we diluted the T4 mutagenized stock to 10^-6 and tested 20 uL at 45 sec intervals (up to 4 min 30 sec) under UV light.

BIT,2013,Team:BIT-China#humanpractice.html_-_-_TEXT.html," our team, COFCO has provided us with great opportunities to communicate with fermentation companies and biological experts. COFCO is the largest supplier of diversified products and services in the agricultural products and food industry in China. We set up the bridge of cooperation for COFCO that they use our product to promote their fermentation technology. This relationship can help us verify our result in manufacturing. And our product might be industrialized.
Discussion and Learning
In September, our team has got an opportunity to go to COFCO for communication.
Engineers and experts in COFCO provided many valuable practical suggestions for us. They suggest us to confirm our data resource further. To overcome these problems, we built the model “heat＆quantity” to predict the optimal temperature. This communication help us understand the aim of our work better.
Industrialize
By now, COFCO have used our product in saccharomycetes in testing phases. It's predictable that this project will be utilized in fermentation to economize the costing of fermentation industry.
In the last term, our school have already held several lectures about iGEM in Liangxiang campus of BIT. So this time, we mainly focused on the project of our team and recruited new membership for next year’s competition. We spent about one hour to show our project in detail, meanwhile we also exchanged different suggestions and ideas with audiences who are from life school or other majors. By our lecture, the students have a further understanding of whether synthetic biology or iGEM. What’s more, these junior students are so enthusiastic that more than forty of them wanted to join iGEM. We really appreciate it and we believe with so much power our team can perform better in the next year.
This night, our team made a lecture in The high school affiliated to Minzu University of China which aimed at introducing synthetic biology and iGEM to high school students. During the lecture, firstly our teammates summarized synthetic biology briefly. Then we showed some simple examples in advanced synthetic biology and our project according to the audiences’ knowledge. After that, iGEM was introduced specifically especially the high school iGEM. We displayed the situation of teams of Chinese high school in the past few years. In this aspect, those young girls and boys showed great passion and asked us many valuable questions. Certainly, each of us answered these questions patiently and encouraged them who are interested in iGEM come to BIT for the further communication. Meanwhile, we built up relationship with the biology club of High School. Hopefully, in the near future, more and more Chinese high school students will participate in iGEM family"

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," in a certain way, an ethical stake.
The issue through which we will enter that points is : do we have to consider naturality and artificiality as real entities, as the things that science is about? That question will permit us to know if we have to include these entities in our ethical reflexion with practical ambitions.
Our first work has to be in defining terms. I'm about to skip this step, and I'd rather not include it in our reflexion, relying on the intuition of the reader that maybeis precisely the point here. If we admit, from now, rigid definitions of naturality and artificiality, we won't be able to perceive the dynamics of the changes that these terms are about to be under.  Dealing with these topics, we also have to face the risk of being too philosophical, understood as more concerned with theoretical structure than pragmatic perspective. The paper Newtons of the leaves of grass, by Joachim Boldt and Olivier Müller is a good example. Because of their wondering about ruptures and continuities from synthetic biology with other biological sciences, they are lee to the question : how can we evaluate the change, the hybridation of the organism? How are continued changes able to make an entity becoming an other? The question about the nature of change in synthetic biology is, in my opinion, more about philosophical concerns than ethical, and, with all our respect about that approach, I've decided not to treat it. But, as we already mentioned through Evelyn Fox Keller's writings, scientific work is not only about material production, neither epistemological. It is also a discursive one. Thus, revising, defining, re-defining, reconfiguring words and, through them, worlds is one of the processes of science. Let's face, trying to be unbiased, unprejudiced, on what nature and device could mean, and try to understand what kind of stakes they are culturally crystallizing to people's eyes (both scientists and non-scientists) to contain or express ethical stakes.
A. From “what” do we have to protect nature?
Most of questions raised by literature about these topics seem already applicable to other contemporary life sciences practices. Thus, when La Note de Veille Stratégique (Suet 2009)  wonders about whether “synthesis of the whole or a part of a living organism is ethically acceptable?”, can wonder if that question wasn't already needed in the field of molecular biology or about GMOs. The new waves of questions about naturalness raises as a new stake when we will have to face an entirely synthetic"
