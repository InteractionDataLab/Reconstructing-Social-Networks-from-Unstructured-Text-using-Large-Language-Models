Figure. 4 measurement of novel translating ribosome based tryptophan sensor by galactosidase activity
In this week, we also tested our synthetic tryptophan sensor performance by galactosidase activity. Some protocol seemed not to work for some culture condition and measurement conditions. The final successful protocol was shown as below. Firstly, we picked up E.coli JM109 carrying pTrc99A_trp sensor_lacZ single clone and cultured it in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Tryptone 10g/L, Yeast Extract 5g/L, NaCl  10g/L) with concentration of ampicillin at 50mg/L for overnight. On the next morning, the 600nm optical density (OD600) of the culture was measured to be 3.090. This seed was transferred into 2mL LB medium with the same concentration of ampicillin by a ratio of 5% in a 5mL 48 well culture plate (Huayang Chengxun Cor. Beijing China). After 1.6h, OD600 of every well reached about 0.6. Each well was also supplemented with 720uL fresh LB medium. Isopropylβ-D-1-Thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and tryptophan stock solution was also added into each well to the final concentration of 0.4mM and a gradient of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3mM, respectively. After 21h, the galactosidase activity was measured as described below.

Genes of the Color Pathway
The enzymes necessary to produce colored Escherichia coli colonies will be isolated from E. coli genomic DNA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cDNA. A total of eight enzymes are needed to produce FPP, for the rest of the pathway we will make use of BioBrick I742152 and I742161 to make sure colonies will turn red. Other colors (orange and yellow also see the Edinburgh 2007 wiki ) can be produced by adding other enzymes from the registry. Of the eight enzymes we will isolate three are E. coli enzymes (atoB, idi and ispA), while the other five are S. cerevisiae enzymes (ERG8, ERG12, ERG13, MVD1 and HMG2).
Design
To see all parts we are working on click here . All parts with number BBa_K115050 and higher are the parts involved in color synthesis.
PCR
To PCR the genes out of the E. coli genome, we've designed primers using the invitrogen website. These primers don't contain the biobrick prefix and suffix yet. When the first PCR on the genome has worked with Taq polymerase, we will try it with Pfx polymerase which has proofreading and is more reliable. On these products, we'll perform a new PCR, with attached biobrick prefix and suffix. This way we prevent interference of the prefix or suffix in our genomic PCR. Table 1 gives an overview of the sequences of all primers designed.

Characterization
In the Module Conductive Curli we combine the advantages of live bacteria with the benefits of non-living materials. A great advantage of bacteria is their ability to respond to the environment, but unfortunately, they have limited possibility to create new functionality all of the sudden. However, if you would find a way to combine bacteria with nonliving materials, you can choose your material in a way it meets your requirements. A beautiful example of these “living materials” has recently been shown by MIT"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

Yale,2014,Team:Yale#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," is currently trying to produce an anti-microbial protein that could be used in the field of anti-fouling. What are some things we should consider with our approach?
JT: iGEM's protein product is exploring an area of opportunity and innovation. You will need to consider how the protein will affect different types of organisms -- algae, slime, barnacles -- and whether it will work in various temperatures. You will have to consider how the coating will be created and applied to the ship, like will you incorporate it into the paint? Also, even though the main purpose of the protein is anti-fouling, it must not interfere with the anti-corrosive paint, which is considered to be more important than biofouling.
The anti-microbial properties of the protein will need to work before the barnacles release acid and attach to the ship because even if barnacles die, their shells will remain.
Hopefully, the protein will be biodegradable, as that would make it more likely to be accepted by environmental authorities.
The paints and coatings applied to ships are very specific. Different coatings are used for ships that travel in different waters with different organisms, so any protein product used for the treatment and prevention of biofouling would optimally be able to work in a wide range of temperatures and waters.
""any protein product used for the treatment and prevention of biofouling would optimally be able to work in a wide range of temperatures and waters.
You could also look at bridges: barnacles also attach to bridges, and their acid corrodes the metal, making the bridges less stable. Bridges are also immobile, so you can't use the slippery-paint method.

Blending Research and Entrepreneurship in Medical Devices
Yale iGEM Interviewed Dr. Christopher Loose, co-founder of Semprus Biosciences, on entrepreneurship and using research to address unmet needs in medicine.
Dr. Loose co-founded Semprus BioSciences, a company focused on anti-fouling on medical devices, with MIT professor Robert Langer and David Lucchino in 2006. He served as CTO until the company was acquired by Teleflex Incorporated in 2012. He currently serves as Executive Director of the Yale Center for Biomedical and Interventional Technology (CBIT) and as Assistant Professor Adjunct, Urology and Lecturer, Biomedical Engineering and Lecturer School of Managment.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

""DNA hard drive""
1. use DNA sequence as a medium to store information (DNA base - quaternary bit - original text)
2. put “tag in” information (i.e some specific base pairs as “prototypes”) to classify the information
3. writing functions in programming language with DNA sequences, use DNA as the function variables
- Sci-Fi ideas developed with RCA people:
a. in the future, a bacteria charm/necklace can be made to store and carry the information, such as exam syllabus, genetic disease history,  family photos, etc
b. different coding methods and types of bacteria can be chosen by the clients for different levels of security needs ,(some high risky information can be store in Bacillus anthraci for military use)
c. data can also be stored in E.coli in the human digestive system, it can be erased by intaking antibiotics
- practical problem: we need a bacteria platform to carry out the operation of the data (I.e: bio-compiler? bio-CPU?). A compiler consists of sets of programs and logic relations, it is theoretically workable, but obviously too difficult to do as a ten"

Modeling Overview
Figure 1: Schematic of the coupled models.
To facilitate an understanding of how the RIOT System will respond to the high lactate environment, with nearby CD44v6 marker, a highly modular, C-based, simulation system (RIOT Model) was developed. Since the length and time scales of the bacteria’s evolution and the environment’s evolution are completely different, the two environments are simulated using two distinct, but coupled models. The evolution of the environment (outer model) is controlled by purely diffusion-advection dynamics, and the internal environment of the RIOT is controlled by diffusion-reaction dynamics. The two models are coupled to each other via free diffusion across the RIOT bacteria membrane. This model is also highly modular, allowing the user to input their own bacteria substance-interaction module with ease. To envision the models, consider an environment inside a cuboid space. The environmental space is then subdivided into many small cubes (aka, Cartesian grid). If we have N substances involved in our desired process, then there are N concentrations within each cube (outer point). Within each outer point, there also resides a number of bacteria. The motion of these bacteria and the substances are driven by diffusion-advection dynamics:
where ci is the concentration of the i-th substance or the bacteria population density, Di is the respective diffusion constant, u is the Cartesian fluid velocity vector field of the environment and ∇ is the gradient operator (∇2 is the Laplacian operator). 1 A single small cylinder is then used to represent the average behaviour of the bacteria inside an outer point (the inner model). The cylinder is split into a series of concentric rings of equal vertical width, and radius difference (Figure 2). Within each ring of the inner model (aka, inner ring), there resides the concentrations of the N substances. The dynamics of the inner model are governed purely by diffusion-reaction dynamics:
where c is a vector containing all the concentrations of the N substances in"
NYMU-Taipei,2015,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and examining healthy seed potatoes.
Healthy seeds potato have to first pass the three-staged certification and production before entering the market. Taiwan Seed Improvement and Propagation Station is responsible for preparing tissue culture and breeding original seed. Farmers associations in different areas will then breed the following generations. After four to five generations, they will sell the tubers to the farmers so the farmers have enough cardinal numbers of potatoes to produce potatoes that meets the demand of the consumers. There is about two thousands hectare of farmland in Taiwan, capable to produce about two to three tons per hectare.
Difficulty
The shortage of healthy seed potato supply
Currently only 60% of healthy seed potatoes are produced in Taiwan, and the remaining 40% are mainly from imports. This leads to several serious problems. First, since potatoes are mainly asexually produced, it’s easier for virus/disease to influence the next generation, thus decrease thirty to fifty percent of production. The imported potatoes, however, do not go through three-staged certification and production system, so it’s more likely to carry pathogens. The uninspected potatoes will also deliver pathogen to healthy seed potatoes by hybridization, and lead to new diseases. Imported potatoes that carry the pathogen is what cause the late blight outbreak in 1997, the largest outbreak in Taiwan.
The short planting period
High temperature inhibits potatoes growth, so farmers need to harvest their potatoes before March. Limited by the space of frozen storage device, there is a period of blank supply in August.
The pressure of opening imported potatoes
Because the shortage of potatoes in Taiwan, potato factories often end up importing potatoes. Therefore, agricultural agencies are pressured to allow the import of potatoes. However, to avoid disease from transferring, it is better to prohibit importing potatoes from places that have similar environments with Taiwan. Also, over-reliance on imports would affect local farmers’ contract farming and income.
Law Regulation
We genetically modified our potatoes in the prevention stage of the project, so we carefully read through and abide by GMO regulations to ensure our project is legal. Also, we advocate for juristic modification.
GMO planting regulation
In Taiwan, there are two procedures to test GMO products. One is called “genetic characteristics investigation”, which tests if the gene sequence that will be transplanted constantly express generations. The other one is called “biosafety assessment”. For this we assess the environment to see whether or not our GMO potatoes would cause an effect on their ecology.
Environmental regulation
We checked environmental regulations to see whether or not spraying defensin is feasible. We inspected the restrictions on pesticide use, in order"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
Volume strategy is a special method to solve problems introduced by diffusion reactions. Consider a transport reaction S1->S2 in which the species S1 is moved from the first compartment with volume V1, to the second with volume V2. The rate constant is k but the rate law is not k*[S1]*V1, because the concentration conversion is needed. The correct expression is N*k*[S1]*V1. The volume strategy just uses N*V1 instead of V1 as the volume of the first compartment. To have a general definition, the volume of a compartment is defined as V*N1*N2, where:
V is the volume of the compartment itself;
N1 is the number of compartments located in its outside compartment;
N2 is the total number of its outside compartment
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
Chains in our Chain-Node model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those in the system.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: compare the first part of two chains by their partReference and partType in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or to the end of either chain. At this stage, besides partReference and partType, two parts are considered equal if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its"

This led to almost all purple color being absent in the liquid culture, verifying the occurrence of the protein degradation. On the other hand, the tsPurple with no degradation tag was constitutively expressed, allowing for complete color expression within the cultures. These were analyzed in comparison to regular E. Coli cells, and the hue/percent color values for the tsPurple-LAA were almost analogous to the regular E. Coli cells, while the tsPurple with no degradation tag had high hue and percent color values, indicating the functioning of the ClpXP mechanism occurred successfully.  Through the comparison of our experimental data with our proof of concept, we were able to successfully discern a variation in hue/percent color values with different levels of protein expression and degradation, serving as an effective measurement model. Through the usage of our Chrom-Q prototype, we were able to quantify these variations in values using an alternative model at a low-cost, thereby having the potential to serve as a new basis of measurement in underfunded labs without access to plate readers.   Furthermore, the presence of a negative correlation between IPTG concentrations and luminance/ hue values indicates a quantified trend in chromoprotein expression. The accuracy of the engineered Chrome-Q system is also verified in the differences found in the magnitude of calculated hue and luminance values for each chromoprotein, where tsPurple and VirginiaViolet had the highest mean hues/luminance values, while Scrooge Orange had the lowest mean hue/luminance values. Overall, the Chrome-Q system is a valid system when quantifying and distinguishing chromoprotein color expression.

In order for students to get a deeper understanding of synthetic biology and for team leader to select new members, more academic lectures were launched during this time. By a vivid description of our previous work, we attracted students from different majors to learn about a new synthetic biology world. 
Brainstorms 
Once we set the NEAU-Harbin team, our team members did a hard work in determining the final project. Each of us pointed out at least one idea and made many discussions about different opinions. We think about the safety, value, feasibility and so on in the round.  For Environment has always been a concern in the field of biological research. Especially for synthetic biology, we all choose to put our efforts in the environment governance. Although synthetic biology brings many benefits to our lives, as far as some people concerned, some pollutants that demonstrate serious environmental and ecological problems still can  not be removed. We devote ourselves in the project to solve this kind of problem. 
Peking university Summit
During the Peking university Summit, a lot of teams around China made presentation about their projects. Some common difficulties we met in our projects were discussed. After the Summit, we had a tour of Peking university lab, and we discussed about the difficulty of growing cultures. At last, we visited IGEM Headquarters and several IGEM experts gave excellent lectures to help us to solve those problems.
Give A Hand
During our meeting, a student of SCAU wanted to build their team next year in 2016 and asked us for help. We taught them how to build an IGEM lab and how to use the flow cytometry and freeze-dry machine. Since it’s their first time to attend iGEM, we shared our experience about running the IGEM project and helped them to get familiar with judging standard. Then we showed our poster and wiki last year. They declared that they will build their team to attend IGEM in 2016 probably.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated HP_-_-_TEXT.html," how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the test to high risk individuals for whom the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of their cancer could lead to an increase in the rate of survival: in the case of NSCLC, this could be carried out by offering the test to those with a certain smoking history. To determine which individuals had a sufficiently high risk of developing NSCLC, for our sensor to be cost effective, we have designed a cost model - take a look below.
He also proposed that if the concept of our test were to be proven and a variety of miRNAs could be detected as biomarkers for a range of cancers, then our test could be used as a screening tool for anyone over a certain age, due to the increase in cancer prevalence with age. His comments led us to research the required criteria below for our sensor to be used as a screening tool. His advice on the high sensitivity and specificity required fed into our need to create a second series of switches.
Dr Sujal Desai
We discussed the use of our sensor for high risk population screening with Dr Desai, a consultant chest radiologist. He informed us that lung cancer rarely presents before age 40, and to maximize the test’s value it should be offered to those aged 55 and above, with a smoking history - so that we would not waste money offering the test to too many people who were very unlikely to have cancer.
To integrate their advice, we worked with our our modeling team to work out who would we should screen. Tammegami et al.’s probability score is the probability of an individual getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. [2]
Using our model which combined this with the data for our project and standard NSCLC treatment, we worked out for what probabilities it would be cost effective for us to screen. The model showed that our tool could be cost effective at cost per QALY - saving lives and saving the NHS money. It shows that even if our sensitivity was lower than we expect, our sensor would be extremely cost effective.

July-August
We're working out!
Everyone one is familiar with the old expression, “A healthy mind resides in a healthy body”. Since we wanted to make sure that our bodies were as sharp as possible, we had to ensure that our bodies were in shape too. Since all our summer days were spent inside either working in the lab or researching, we decided that we had to go outside and perform some physical activities. From there, we started organizing weekly sessions designated to sports. We played football, beach volleyball, and even tried playing ultimate frisbee a number of times! These sports sessions were not just a great simulation for the body, but also helped increase the team chemistry, unifying the team and helping the bond grow stronger. Needless to say, we left all arguments on the court.
August-September
Last Month of Summer - Patient  Meetings
All throughout August, we went on to meet patients that have received organ transplants and patients suffering from severe epilepsy. After getting approval from the ethical committee in Belgium, we went on to schedule the meetings and actually sat down with the patients to ask them and get feedback on whether or not what we were developing would be of any help to them. At the end of the day, what good is our device if we it wouldn’t be of use to those in need?
Mid August
Meeting Leen
Creating a new technology is something fascinating and an achievement in itself. However, isn’t enough to just create a technology that is cool, this technology has to be relevant, it has to solve an issue on going with the world! In our case, we were looking into using our invention to treat certain patients, so we wanted to in fact make sure that our product will help those we are targeting. One of the most memorable patient visits was to Leen. Leen is a 43-year-old woman that suffers from severe epilepsy, a disease that we investigated through the course of our project. What was so special about Leen was the treatment and the lovely environment at her household. Normally, patient meetings are quite depressing in a way, the mood during the meetings aren’t the happiest so to say. However, with Leen, her parents welcomed us with open arms, and were extremely enthusiastic about our work! Leen also was a delight to be around, we talked and enjoyed an amazing lunch arranged by her parents! Not just did we leave with confirmation that our product would indeed help those in need, but we left with extra motivation to work harder!

Modeling
In order to reach the goal of minimizing the average degradation rate of E.coli, i.e. the highest average expression level of our target gene, we chose to simulate the behaviors of individual E.coli by a segregated population competition model, furthermore used the method of cellular automaton, while incorporating several modulating model parts into steps of cell reproduction, to get the population of different E.coli at each time step.
To specify, we first distinguish the E.coli by their plasmid numbers, under the assumption that individual behaviors are alike within the group with the same plasmid numbers. Then, by getting the ribosome bind rate through mechanism model and the growth promoting effect through 3-dimensional random walk model, we adjusted the E.coli’s individual growth rate. Meanwhile,  queue theory is used for exploring the relationship between intracellular plasmid number and target gene expression level. What’s more, a fall-off mechanism is incorporated by energy estimation, when considering the subsequent translation of glucose dehydrogenase, which serves as a growth promoter of E.coli.
After repeating the process of reproduction in a reasonable period of time, the population of E.coli with various plasmids can be simulated, therefore provide us with the population’s information as time goes on.
Main model
The whole population of E.coli are separated into 100 different groups, with $N(i)$ E.coli attributed to the $i^{th}$ group, in which they all possess $i$ plasmids at current time. Each group of E.coli was regarded as a distinct population, under the assumption that individuals are alike within, i.e. their gene expression level, growth rate are basically the same under similar circumstances. One minute is set as a time step. For each group of E.coli, a fraction of the population will go through the process of plasmid"

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the concept of ""Synthetic Biology"" being introduced, it is now essential to view cells as true ‘programmable’ entities, and develop effective strategies for assembling devices and modules into intricate, customizable larger scale systems rather than just creation and perfection of genetic devices and small modules. Meanwhile, regulations on gene expression have evolved from transcriptional level, to translational level, and finally signaling transduction level. Based on the foundation of functionalized modules, we finally extend synthetic biology to industrialized application.

Edinburgh_OG,2016,Team:Edinburgh OG#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," this year’s iGEM teams (as seen in the Outreach section): E. coli BL21DE3, E. coli C41, E. coli MG1655, Yarrowia lipolytica, Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303, Dechloromonas aromatica, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, Pichia pastoris, Myxococcus xanthus and Acinetobacter sp. ADP1.
Along with these microorganisms, a database with the related secondary metabolites information (i.e. the general class of secondary metabolite, the most similar biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) related to the secondary metabolite, its location in the genome and the percentage of gene similarity for each annotated microorganism) was constructed using the Antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) software.
It is worth mentioning that the databases will be able to be updated by integrating new microorganisms or editing existing ones simply by logging-in and waiting for the validation of the data by the program administrators.
TOXICITY CRITERIA
Download List
According to the toxic effect of these compounds on human health, animal health and the environment, a quantitative criterion for clear toxicity scores was created using a scale from 1 to 5 and a “traffic light” colour scheme. If the reviewed information showed that the secondary metabolite did not affect in a negative manner any of the three parameters, it was considered non-toxic and categorised as a “1” (green). If the data showed that the compound exhibited some degree of toxicity but nothing considerably serious or untreatable, it was considered slightly to moderately toxic and scored as a “3” (yellow). And if it showed that the secondary metabolite was extremely toxic, it was considered as highly toxic and classified as a “5” (red). However, considering there were three parameters to be considered, combinations of those three scores could occur (e.g., a secondary metabolite being considered non-toxic for humans but slightly to moderately toxic to animals). Therefore, if a compound was non-toxic according to one parameter and slightly to moderately toxic for the others, it was categorised as a “2” (green-yellow). On the other hand, if it was slightly to moderately toxic according to some parameter and highly toxic for others, it was classified as a “4” (yellow-red).  Finally, if the secondary metabolite had no documented toxicity information, or if there was no specific BGC exposed by antiSMASH"

Our collection of submitted biobricks consists of:
Mussel foot protein (MFP) 1-5-1 sequence [combination of Mytilus galloprovincialis Foot Protein 5 (Mgfp-5) and Mytilus Edulis Foot Protein 1 (Mefp-1)].
MFP with superfolder Green Fluorescence Protein (sfGFP).
MFP with our anti-microbial peptide, LL-37.
Entire construct of our anti-microbial adhesive peptide: 2XStrep_Flagtag--LL-37--Mussel Foot Protein--sfGFP.
Note all biobricks are in the pSB1C3 plasmid.
Full Construct: BBa_K1396000
The part is an coding sequence for an anti-microbial peptides linked to a mussel-foot protein-linked to superfolder GFP for localization. The mussel foot protein will anneal to surfaces as a wet glue and the antimicrobial domain is designed to interact with microbial membranes and interfere with membrane stability. In order to use this part you can produce it in a TAG recoded organism simultaneously expressing a Tyrosine supressor or L-DOPA orthogonal translational system. In order to purify you can use the 2X Strep tag and strep column and later cleave with enterokinase to remove the sequence supressing LL-37 antimicrobial action.

In the first article Andreas talked about being an iGEM’er, what iGEM is, and joining the team for the second time. The second article in Sund & Hed followed as a continuation of the first. In the article, Sofie and Sissel were interviewed about the team, our brainstorming process, and the prospect of spending our entire vacation in a lab.
Pupils deeply facinated by the DNA they just extracted from a banana. Public outreach
In an attempt to spark the interest for the natural sciences and synthetic biology in kids and young adults, we participated in the Dansk naturvidenskabelig festival, “Danish natural science festival”. As part of the project, we visited several public schools and gave small talks on what DNA and GMO is. Through play and hands-on activities, we taught the kids proper handling of lab equipment such as pipettes and how to extract DNA from bananas with simple household equipment.
We also visited 2 high schools; The purpose of our lectures was to spread the word of the iGEM competition and synthetic biology. We explained concept of synthetic biology, iGEM, our project, and why we had chosen the subject at hand. We also spoke in general terms about studying at the University of Southern Denmark in the fields of medicine and biomedicine.
The Media
We had an article published in Ugeavisen Vejle (page 12) about Patrick’s involvement on the iGEM team and the field of synthetic biology. He is native of the region, and upon returning to his high school in the town of Vejle (one of the two mentioned above), the newspaper published a press release urging the public to attend his talk.
The university newspaper, Sund & Hed, are currently planning a third article to be published following the Regional Jamboree. Also, we are in touch with the widely published regional newspaper Fyens Stiftstidende in order to give an interview upon our return from the Regional Jamboree.
Since the European Jamboree in Lyon, there has been a lot of interest toward our project from the media. This has resulted in a number of articles, radio and tv-shows about SDU-Denmarks participation in the iGEM-competition.

As the third period, automatic learning requires a tool to enable standardization. Looking through the genetic circuits of previous projects, we find that they are not uniform: some are too complex, some are too simple, and some are incomplete...However, Synsketch is a standardized tool that helps iGEMers design draw clear and unified genetic circuits for experiment. For the future aspect, if every iGEM team can use Synsketch to design genetic circuits, we will get a unified visual effect and can understand all the experimental principle easily.
Has the team demonstrated a minimum viable (MVP) product and had customers to commit (LOI, etc.) to purchasing it / using it?
As for a minimum viable product, our team chooses to first implement online advertising, which almost costs no extra spending at all since the website has already completed and accumulated a certain amount of users. For the future aspect, we are planning to arrange more offline activities such as the lectures or teaching session in high schools and universities, therefore expanding the public influence and inspiring more public interest about synthetic biology. And such activities will also be economic since our team has already established a close cooperation with many schools such as Guangdong Experimental High School and Sunyatsen University.
For the sponsors, our teams attracts the attention of many education agencies to invest because the user base for Synsketch is mainly students who have an interest in synthetic biology and most of them hope to carry on further study abroad. So up till now, we have received 40000RMB from EIC and 15000RMB from APP, both education agencies that are attracted by the potential user base. And our goal is to get 200,000RMB investment in the future.
And many iGEM teams have already applied to Synsketch with their genetic circuits. With the cooperation of SKLBC-China team, many wechat users have signed in as the user of our website and stored completed genetic circuits in their personal account.
Does the team have a viable and understood business model/value proposition to take their company to market?
Our team has already come up with a viable and understandable business model—a circle among ourselves, biology learners and the sponsors.
Firstly, the team can use the project and some online advertisement to attract investment and use the investment to arrange offline activities to inspire interest of synthetic biology among the public, which is of great educational and scientific significance. We also collaborate"
BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the same as each other. These two tubulin monomers are named α tubulin monomer and β tubulin monomer. Microtubule is made up of 13 protofilaments aggregated by tubulin dimers end to end. And microtubule can be the hollow tube with 13 protofilaments coiled into helix with each other, water in hollow part. The tube wall is 4～5nm thick.  Tubulin dimers are incorporated into the growing lattice in the GTP-bound form and stochastically hydrolyze to GDP-tubulin, thus forming a GTP-cap. It is thought that the switching from growth to shrinkage occurs due to the loss of the GTP-cap.
Caplow M [1] research shows that when the cap structure of microtubule plus end subunit containing GDP- beta tubulin instead of GTP- beta tubulin, microtubule becomes unstable and will quickly disaggregate.
Fig.2 Microtubule dynamic instability
As is shown in the figure, there are two kinds of Dimer, called GDP and GTP, with blue and red two connected to the circular. These dimers have close relationship with each other, and there are three important modes of their action.
GTP-tubulin dimer in endpoint can aggregate new GTP to make the single protofilament grow, and microtubules extend.
At the same time, the endpoint GTP may also be made off, thereby protofilaments shorter.
Any place of GTP (in addition to the right endpoints of the GTP) made made random hydrolyzed to GDP have a chance.
Fig.3 Parameters of GTP-tubulin dimer hydrolysis
In order to verify and test the degree of the taxol’s influence on microtubule’s length.
We treated tubulin with taxol of different concentrations, measured their intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength.
First, we use the boxplot to conduct the descriptive statistical analysis. Then, we use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data given by the experiment.
1.0 - Descriptive statistical analysis
Before we use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data, we need to conduct some simple descriptive statistical analysis. This analysis can help us gain the overall understanding of the data, find the abnormal data, and then guide our next work.
We summarized tubulin-inflorescence fusion protein’s intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength under different taxol’s concentration treatments. The shape of experimental group"

We developed a novel system for generating binding proteins in E. coli via directed evolution. Our system can be subdivided into a library , mutagenesis and selection . The library was designed and created by randomizing binding protein sequences in E. coli. Our library reached the size of over one hundred thousand of each, Monobodies and Nanobodies .
The mutagenesis system uses a error prone polymerase to introduce mutations in the coding regions for our binding protein. Therefore creating an even greater variety. We verified the functionality of the system by various reversion experiments to show that it is functional. Additionally the mutation rate was measured by Miseq sequencing .
Our selection system uses a bacterial two hybrid system to give cells with fitting binding proteins to the target protein an advantage in growth by developing an antibiotic resistance. To proof this we run several experiments ( expression control , binding control , interaction control , in vivo test ) and verified its functionality.
For our future prospect we designed a business plan where we considered the necessary points to introduce our project as the system to generate Evobodys itself as well as a company that produces binding proteins. To further develop"

We plan to continue our outreach efforts in the future. We plan to expand our efforts and continue to educate the public about synthetic biology and share our love of science.  In the future our efforts will continue to center around science education. Our profile in our community is increasing as iGEM becomes a familiar group and synthetic biology ceases to sound frightening and gains familiarity.  We hope that the Ontario community of iGEM teams will continue to grow and include teams from all across Canada, helping to strengthen the synthetic biology community across the country.  As members of the Waterloo iGEM team we are proud to educate multiple audiences and to share our knowledge and passion with the world.

Our sensor has the potential to reduce the mortality rates of all kinds of diseases through early diagnosis. We investigated how it would be used effectively in a clinical environment.
In addition, we discussed our design with as many experts and members of the general public as possible - so we could get their opinions and, at the same time, improve public understanding about synthetic biology and its possibilities in the field of diagnostics.
Engagement
Synthetic biology is incredible. We took every opportunity to teach others about it and our project. We have hosted regular events to engage the public in our work, iGEM and synthetic biology. This year we had a stand at a number of open days, gave several talks, held an iGEM open evening and also held numerous workshops for younger boys at our school. Additionally, we created a guide for high schools entering iGEM based off our own experiences and those of other teams who completed our survey.
See our engagement and high schools guide for more details.
Clinical Implementation
Our project is a diagnostic tool. We looked into how our sensor could improve current cancer diagnostics and be applied as a screening tool.
We produced a survey which was filled out by 16 doctors, including oncologists, gastroenterologists and respiratory consultants. You can view a more precise breakdown of the responses here .
Several problems with cancer diagnostics methods were raised by these doctors. In particular, NSCLC was described as difficult to detect. Late presentation of symptoms was identified as the biggest challenge in its diagnosis. This played a role in our decision to choose NSCLC as our tool could"
ESBS-Strasbourg,2010,Team:ESBS-Strasbourg#Project#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html," the histidine kinase–related domain (HKRD) [45] . The PAS domain is named after three proteins in which it occurs: Per (period circadian protein), Arn (Ah receptor nucleartranslocator protein), and Sim (single-minded protein) [1] .
The P1 domain is not essential for the function of PHYB. Deletion of amino acids 1–57 of Arabidopsis PHYB yields a protein with full activity [30] . In contrast, the P2/PAS and P3/GAF domains form the essential photo sensory core domain. These domains contain a bilin lyase activity, which is responsible for the binding of the chromophore to a cysteine residue in the P3/GAF domain. The P2/PAS and P3/GAF domains play critical roles in photo sensing, whereas the P4/PHY domain is necessary for fine tuning phytochrome activity. Deletion of the P4/PHY domain increases the dark reversion rate (i.e., the instability of the Pfr conformation) and causes a blue shift in absorption by both Pr and Pfr. A serine/threonine kinase domain that governs phytochrome autophosphorylation and phytochrome-directed phosphorylation of other proteins, such as the phytochrome interacting factor (PIF3) has also been located in the N-terminal domain [1] . The PAS-A and PAS-B domains of PHYB are necessary for dimerization and nuclear localization, whereas PAS-A, PAS-B, and the HKRD domains are necessary for nuclear speckle formation [1] . Dimerization is required for PhyB full activity.
The light-sensitive interaction between PHYB and PIF3 has been mapped to the 650-residue amino-terminal photosensory core of PHYB [30] .
The improved understanding of these mechanisms has been helpful for the design of the first engineered photoreceptors. By now there have been three illuminating studies that utilized the interaction between PhyB and PIF3 to achieve light regulation of target proteins.
Leung et al. put the association of the GTPase Cdc42 with its effector protein WASP under red-light control. When in complex with PhyB-Cdc42, PIF3-WASP promoted actin polymerization in vitro; use in vivo was not demonstrated. Based on the interaction between PhyB and PIF3, Muir and Tyszkiewicz established a protein-splicing system that was moderately regulated by red light in vitro65. Lastly, Voigt and colleges employed the light-dependent interaction between PhyB and"

Bacteria of type A are not attracted nor repelled by leucine,                         so the chemotactic term falls away. All cell-cell forces are summed up to find a                         net force, taking into account the two different potentials due to the different                         interaction types. As discussed before, this net force times a constant yields                         the velocity due to that force, which is then multiplied by $dt$ to obtain the                         displacement. For B type cells, the chemotactic term models the repulsive                         chemotaxis away from leucine. The chemotactic sensitivity function (12) has a                         negative sign signifying that B type cells are repelled by leucine. The cell-cell                         interaction term in this case is simpler because B type cells only interact       repulsively.
Note that the diffusion coefficient of cell types A and B (13) switches                         based on the local concentration of AHL relative to a threshold AHL value, which       simulates the dependency of cellular motility on AHL.

SAMS Girls' Outreach Beyond the Bench[mark] Event
The Summer Academy of Mathematics and Science (SAMS) occurs every summer where high school juniors and seniors from across the nation come to Carnegie Mellon for a rigorous 6-week program. These students take the same CMU classes that other undergraduates take in order to understand concepts and build confidence in their skills. Dr. Carrie B. Doonan is the director of the undergraduate laboratories and taught the iGEM team basic lab skills in a weeklong program for the non-biologists. The CMU outreach team asked her about presenting Creature Feature to her seven SAMS girls in order to gauge how this lab would work with a more advanced group. Courtney and Nicole rewrote Creature Feature with a more advanced vocabulary, and then upped the difficulty of the rips in the “waterproofing” gene. With this lab, we worked on creating a relationship with the SAMS girls, discussing how synthetic biology was very current (an article was found in the New York Times that morning over Starbucks, and how to improve Creature Feature with a higher-level group, while having fun watching them figure out how to keep their creatures alive. The complexity of their creatures were at a higher skill level compared to the middle school groups and their questions a lot more discussion based on the ethics behind genetically modified organisms. They offered advice on how to increase difficulty, and complimented the design of the activity. The iGEM team was invited to be their audience at a later date for their Genetically-Modified Organisms (GMO) presentations.

Synbio Chess Game
Synthetic biology is a field of science and engineering based on standard parts. Gene, messenger RNA, and proteins act together to construct and regulate intelligent bio-devices, so it is important to understand central dogma. Therefore, we design a chess game to teach the basic principle of central dogma to the public, and give them joywhen learning biology. The chess game, as such things are never designed before, can be an advance in human practice.
Gameboard designed by Xihan Li
This is the board of the game. It is consists of three parts --- DNA helix, single strand RNA, and two polypeptide chains. Start from the “start” sign on the top-left, players should go through DNA, RNA, and a polypeptide chain, and finally get to the “iGEM” sign on the bottom-left. The whole journey of the game is like the process of protein synthesis from the transcription of DNA and the translation of RNA.
When a game starts, player dice and move their chessman according to the pips. Note that there are always tricks along the journey! The “start” sign is a promoter, which indicates that the expressions of genes start from promoters. Along the “nucleic road”, we meet repressor the “evil”, and enhancer the “angel”.

Bacteriophages Encapsulated In Alginate Can Withstand Gastric Acid
The main problem of oral application is the acidic environment in the gastric fluid, necessitating protective measures against degradation. The other requirement of phage protection is the release of functional phages in the intestine. For this reason, we compared the behavior of the encapsulated phages and non-encapsulated phages in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF).
In SGF, the number of active non-encapsulated phages decreases by more than 99.99 % within an hour. This shows the urgent need of a form of protection. As a reference, we used phages that were chemically released by citrate from alginate droplets.
Non-encapsulated phages are highly degraded within an hour in simulated gastric fluid.
In comparison, the encapsulated phages were tested in SGF for the same time as the non-encapsulated phages. Afterwards, the same droplets were exposed for two hours to simulated intestinal fluid to test the release of functional bacteriophages in this environment.
The encapsulated phages were hardly released in a timeframe of one hour when exposed to SGF. After transferring the capsules to SIF the number of active phages reached that of the reference.  This indicates that the encapsulation of bacteriophages in alginate capsules enables the possibility of an oral application. Further experiments could test the alginate capsules in an animal model system.
A small number of encapsulated phages are released in SGF. In SIF, functional phages are released in high concentration.

iGEM Orientation (January 2015)
The team organised an orientation with the purpose of discussing the scope and future of synthetic biology in India and IIT Delhi as well as increasing awareness about iGEM . This event was attended by students from the undergraduate, graduate and doctoral levels, pursuing various disciplines including Computer Science engineering, Electrical engineering, Biological sciences among others.
Orientation for freshmen (July-August 2015)
iGEM Team IIT Delhi kept an orientation exclusively for the freshmen joining in the fall semester 2015. The session involved our team members introducing concepts of synthetic biology to the freshmen and to tell them about iGEM. This was essentially done to help the freshmen develop an interest in synthetic biology and hopefully carry on the iGEM Team IIT Delhi legacy forward.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#pneumosensor#module two_-_-_TEXT.html," Com-Box. (Piotrowski, Luo, & Morrison, 2009). Taking advantage of this competence-specific mechanism, it is now able to produce the S. pneumoniae sensing device of high specificity by incorporating this system into E. coli.
iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST Team has cloned σx from S. pneumoniae strain NCTC7465 and characterized its ability to initiate transcription of two downstream promoters with different lengths: PcelA ( BBa_K1379000 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_K1379001 ), which have the consensus Com-Box sequence. Though much information about the promoters is readily available nowadays, its characterization of promoter activity, specificity, sequence, as well as the biomolecular mechanism can be greatly enhanced with further investigations and experiments. Hence, we were interested in reproducing this gene circuit with all the associated genes and promoters to be combined into a single transcriptional unit. Despite the suggested susceptibility to leakage and other factors that may hinder or interrupt the mechanism, researches have reported that the pathway was highly specific to certain environmental conditions and stress, suggesting minimal or no leakage in the entire process.
PcelA and PcomFA promoters have high specificity to σx for activation, so genes downstream the promoters will be translated only if σx is present. Hence, by using fluorescence protein as a reporting mechanism, this σx, PcelA and PcomFA promoters system could be further utilized as a specific reporter device in E. coli DH10B strain that could be used by iGEM communities.
σx and ComW mechanism
Figure 2. σx - comW Interaction Diagram
σx and ComW protein are both produced by a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for PcelA and PcomFA promoters induction, and ComW protein is required for σx stabilization. ComW protein acts as a barrier that protects σx from being degraded by ClpXP degradation enzyme, hence it increases the production of σx. The increase in σx production will increase the expression of green fluorescence protein by PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
To complete the story of competence regulation mechanism from S. Pneumoniae, we would also like to integrate another positive factor involved in competence regulation which was later found out to be ComW. Prof. Morrison's lab released another research paper on the identification of a new component in the regulation of genetic transformation in S. Pneumoniae. The gene comW (SP0018) was found to be       regulated by the qu"

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada_-_-_TEXT.html,"Megan Tabor and her group of top notch researchers have engineered E. coli with Bay Laurel Thioesterase (BTE) under the control of the sigma 70 constitutive promoter to produce fatty acids. The team has shown that E. coli secretes 100-200uM fatty acids into the surrounding media in NEB Beta cells.
     When the group first received these results, they were ecstatic, but they knew that there was still hard work ahead. It was important for the team to show that not only were they producing larger amounts of fatty acids, but also fatty acids that were 12 carbons in length, instead of the usual 16 and 18 carbon chains found in the typical cooking oil. “Medium chain fatty acids, such as C-12 fatty acids, can be used not only as a biofuel for automobiles, but can also be used as a jet fuel” stated Jovanna Casas, a fellow researcher and close colleague. The group is in the process of repeating their work using chromatography to determine the size of the fatty acids and also testing different E. coli strains to determine the optimal strain for producing fatty acids.
After Months of Trial and Error, Production of Ethanol in E. coli is Possible!
     One of the major goals of the Nevada 2011 project is to synthesize ethanol in E. coli, a bacteria well characterized by scientists. In order to produce ethanol, two enzymes need to be produced in E. coli: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Jovanna Casas and her E. coli project team members transformed E. coli with these ethanol genes under the control of a sigma 70 constitutive promoter from the iGEM registry (J23101). Now all they had to do was assay for enzymatic activity. Sounds simple, but this was where the real challenge began for the Nevada Team.
     Casey Lear and her enzymology team were responsible for developing a classic alcohol dehydrogenase enzymatic assay, but according to Casey, “Only when high concentrations of ethanol were added to the assay was there any absorbance correlating to ADH activity.” The enzymology group concluded that the ADH assay they developed was not sensitive enough to detect ethanol in the low concentration ranges needed by Jovanna’s E. coli group.
     The E. coli group opted to use a more sensitive alcohol oxidase enzyme instead.  The team purchased an EnzyChrom Ethanol Detection Kit (alcohol oxidase) from BioAssay Systems to test"

Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," patient’s genome. The created bacterial system will be applied to two problems. The first one is to create special bacterial strain, which is able to conjugate with the mitochondrion within the cytoplasm. It will enable effective DNA delivery in scientific or therapeutic approaches. The second strategy is to induce apoptosis of tumor cells by means of the proapoptotic proteins secreted to the cytoplasm by bacteria that exist within the cell.
Theoretical basis
Entrance of bacteria into eukaryotic cells
Many bacterial species are able to invade an eukaryotic cell. One of the crucial proteins for this process is invasin. It is capable of selective interaction with integrins, which are present on eukaryotic membrane. It triggers signalling cascade indispensable to start endocytosis [9]. This interaction occurs via the invasin N-terminal domain, which is able to promote effective endocytosis of bacteria that synthesize invasin by cells normally unable to undertake phagocytosis [3]. Majority of the enteropathogenic bacteria are incapable to divide within the phagosome, but after leaving the phagosome they can proliferate rapidly in the cytoplasm. Escape from the phagosome is possible because of hemolysin which causes membrane permeabilisation and phagosome disruption [16]. It was presented previously that transfection with gene encoding hemolysin is sufficient to enable Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli to escape phagosomal vesicle [1].
Mitochondrial transformation
Electron transport chain function can be impaired by a variety of defects acting on the DNA level: not only point mutation and local deletions in genes encoding proteins of the chain, but also deletions of huge fragments or even whole mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Correct mitochondrion contains 2 to 10 copies of mtDNA. Defects in mitochondrial DNA result in severe medical disorders especially in tissues which consume large amount of energy like nervous and muscle tissue. Effects of this impairments are neuroand myopathies [20]. The standard therapy based on bypassing interrupted pathways does not apply under mentioned circumstances. Administration of enzyme cofactors or other metabolically active substances is not effective and may be applied only as supplementary therapy. We are forced to seek novel treatment strategies to cure patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders [7]. Currently the most commonly used method of mitochondrial transformation is the ""gene gun"" approach which is based on delivery of metal beads coated with DNA into the cell. This method is mostly limited to plants and yeast and has low therapeutic potential [7]. Current mammalian mitochondrial transformation techniques like"

Fig 4. The cell growth overnight and glucose uptake of E. coli expressing the Na+/Glu transporter at different time point
Discussion
We’ve successfully genetically engineered E. coli expressing high-affinity active PTS transporter system and low-affinity facilitated Na+/glucose cotransporter system by screening in MacConkey and glycerol agar plate with chloramphenicol, respectively. Our data is consistent with the previous study that overexpressing glucose transporter genes do really harm E. coli partly due to disturbing glycolytic pathways.
PTS expressing bacteria grew difficultly in LB broth but Na+/glucose transporter expressing bacteria grew comparably with general E. coli, suggesting that high-affinity active transporter did interact with sugar-related substances in LB culture media and harm the bacterial survival.
In our results, glucose absorption by Na+/glucose transporter expressing bacteria was achieved to 97% after 4 hours with 1.2 times enhanced efficiency compared to the normal E. coli. To further increase the rate of glucose uptake, one may think about the glucose metabolism or conversion to other materials when entering into the cell.

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"eme(300-700 times). Recent research shows the combining mechanism is involved with two steps: During the first step, NO combines substrate sGC to generate the ferrous nitrosyl heme complexes D3 which then decays to a fully activated state mixture D2.
The first step of NO combined with sGC can be expressed as a reversible biochemical reaction process:
D1 and D3 represent the initial and intermediate states of sGC. Accordingly, k and k-1 are rate constants. The second step has two parallel paths which are depend or independ on NO. The two are all involved in the transition from D3 to D2. The process of independent NO was considered to be a natural decay from the state D3 to D2, with the His105 residue separated from the heme. The process can be expressed as a first order and irreversible kinetic equation(rate constant is k2):
The path which depends on NO can be described as enzymatic action based on the traditional Michaelis Menten kinetics. Since the reversible and dissociation reactions of NO and sGC heme were rapid (association rate constant is 7.1±2*108 M-1s-1 in 4℃), the damage of His105 residue becomes the rate limiting step in the process (the observed value of rate constant of the process which depends on NO in reference documentation is 2.4*105M-1s-1 in 4℃). Therefore, we assume that the NO dependent pathway can be equivalent to a single step irreversible process with a rate constant k3:
Another side of NO-sGC reaction’s is NO disaggregates from sGC, which means D2 is inactivated、sGC return to the initial state. We can express the process as a first order and irreversible kinetic equation:
Rate constant k4 can be regulated by multiple factors, including NO scavenger, substrate concentration and so on. Under the stimulation of cGMP, the yield of NO presents biphase. Along with the initial rapid growth to the peak，following is a recovery to a lower level, with the increase in degradation rate makes the concentration of cGMP reaches to a steady state. Bellamy suggested that the unknown sGC regulatory factors may exist and that the sensitivity of sGC to NO in the late state of cGMP reaction is decreased, and these regulatory factors are active in response to NO's exogenous and endogenous. Now, we assume that the local feedback loop of the final product's cGMP level is a regulator of sGC desensitization. In the hypothesis that cGMP"

CompuGene Seminar
CompuGene is an initiative from the german state Hessen to develop research in the field of computer-based genetic circuits. It is one of our sponsors and contributors to our cause.
CompuGene has held several seminars about newest research on the field of synthetic biology at TU Darmstadt during our project. The speakers presented their results and successes of their studies, as well as their further goals. It has been a great new opportunity for iGEMers from our team to have a gaze into latest scientific progress and newly created fields of study. In the context of this initiative we were able to present our project in front of some active researchers, including Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher. This gave us the opportunity to discuss our project with well-respected scientist and receive objective criticism concerning our issues, and input of great value for our project.
Yet there is even more to this cooperation. On the 26th of July CompuGene has made it possible for Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher, one of the biggest experts on the field of chitin and chitosan research to visit TU Darmstadt and have a seminar with us about the production of chitosan in bacteria, thus being one of the turning points in our project. For that we are very grateful to CompuGene.
The support CompuGene provided to us has been a major factor leading to success in our cause. Since the beginning of our project and right to its end the CompuGene initiative stood by our side, allowing our student iGEM team to contribute to real scientific work and research. Our whole team greatly appreciates that.

We can also find some inherent connections amount these factors within the same group and consequently find the significance of each group. After separation of groups, the evaluation system is constructed. The final evaluation system is shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9. Classification result of impact factors towards genetic pollution (From TJU iGEM team 2012)
With such system, we can know the relative determinant factor of public attitude of the four groups. And thus know what is treated as important factors or influential groups that determine the public attitude towards genetic pollution. This will be very helpful to determine what factor or group is the common one that is thought of as the most important factor that determine public attitude. Such factors or groups should be the one that deserve the devotion in attracting the public attention towards the problem. This factor will probably be the one whose devotion of energy and time will encounter the least resistance.
The mathematical method: PCA methods
All the data are obtained from that of questionnaire. And the relative values are transformed through comparison matrix. All the other calculation procedures are flow the previous procedure of PCA method .
Result and Discussion
Since the data, especially the ones from the governmental leader are difficult to obtain. As a result, we cannot do the analyzing work; and our work is still on the track of searching for appropriate samples from the group of governmental leaders to collects data.
Future Conclusion
We can gain a comprehensive evaluation system to determine the influential factors that determine the public attitude and attention towards genetic pollution. At the same time, we can also achieve which factor is the influential factor that count and which factor’s influence is minute. This will be very helpful to determine what factor or group is the common one that is thought of as the most important factor that determine public attitude. Such factors or groups should be the one that deserve the devotion in attracting the public attention towards the problem. This factor will probably be the one whose devotion of energy and time will encounter the least resistance. We can also avoid the factors that do not pay enough attention by all the people from the four social groups.
Determination of the Optimum Propaganda Method
Background and problem
The propaganda of genetic pollution is unquestionably a very important method to the prevention and protection of genetic pollution. However, there are so many propaganda methods with various properties for us to choose from. Therefore, we are in need of searching for the optimum propaganda methods. Another trouble encountered is that the optimum propaganda method is difficult to determine be-cause there are many properties of the method that should be taken into account. Therefore, we also need to establish a system"

S.O.R.D.
We designed S.O.R.D. as an RNA secretion device. It is comprised of osmY (protein naturally secreted by E. coli) and Hfq (RNA binding protein) fused together. This device is what will transport our spiRNA out of our E. coli and to the target bacteria.
In the labs we wanted to test if S.O.R.D. could be secreted, so we used a western blot to do so.
Western blotting indicated that our S.O.R.D. was being secreted entirely . This meant for future plans that S.O.R.D. should theoretically secrete and be capable of carrying RNA on its journey out of the cell.
spiRNA
Our RNA silencing agent spiRNA is what will attach to a specific gene on an mRNA strand in the target cell. We decided to test spiRNA by targeting the fliC gene which forms the FliC protein. This is the repeating subunit of the flagellum. By targeting this gene the bacterium’s motility should be greatly decreased and therefore easy to see if our device works. We did this by expressing a spiRNA containing a fliC targeting sequence inside a target bacterium.
Result:
Our results showed that the bacteria became less motile as there wasn’t as much expansion on the plate as the control experiment. This is strong indication that spiRNA effectively targeted fliC mRNA and reduced its translation, proving the principle of it being able to target specific genes with downstream functional effects. This means that by changing the targeting sequence, in theory we could target any gene at will."

When I first heard about iGEM and the idea of synthetic biology, it really caught my interest. This is a chance where I can combine other’s work and findings and make the best out of them. This is what I have learnt recently from object-orientated programming – breaking ideas down into objects, manipulating and assembling them into one working machine.
Being in the second year of the Bioinformatics Programme, I am in the middle of learning how the knowledge of computer science can be applied on biochemistry. By participating in the iGEM competition, one would be able to gain hands-on experience on what biochemistry research is like, how the knowledge learnt from lectures can be applied to practical laboratory work, and the wisdom to work as a team – sharing results, joys as well as deadlines and pressure. I am glad and honoured to be a part of the team HKU-HKBU, and it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to work with students from another university in Hong Kong.

I'm a second year student studying Chemistry at the University of Hong Kong. It is my first time to take part in an international competition about synthetic biology. After acquiring information from my other iGEM members, my strong interest drives me to participate into iGEM in summer. At the very beginning, I think this is just another means to kill my time in summer. However, after attending several meeting and assisting others to do different kinds of laboratory work, I find myself immersed in this competition. Some of the laboratory work like western blotting, PCR, electrophoresis and the like are very new to me and I never come across this stuff from Chemistry laboratory. Though repeated failure in the genes knockout, I never felt frustrated since I could learn new things from each failed experiment. Indeed, with the help of other iGEM members and supervisors, I acquire tremendous knowledge about the synthetic biology as well as biochemistry in this competition. My part of work in this iGEM competition is mainly dry lab, which include wikis work, human practice, some search for experiment stuff. Hoping our effort in this competition can pay off and earn the glory and reputation of HKU and HKBU.

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#ApproachA_-_-_TEXT.html," aspartate concentration. Even if the problem of bacteria moving out of the focal plane was no longer existing, there were still several other       problems persisting:
Imaging bacterial motility
The first try to image the reaction of the bacteria to a ligand was done by simply image the motility of freely moving bacteria on a coverslip. The bacteria showed very high activity, however, it quickly turned out to be impossible to track       the cells on the coverslip since they are moving in three dimensions, i.e. in and out of focus.       Afterwards, they were observed using a counting slide, which is confined in the z-direction. There, the first aspartate experiments were done by simply pipetting in the desired concentration into the counting slide. The experiment was done in       M9 medium, which did not contain any aspartate. This allowed us to have control over the final aspartate concentration. Even if the problem of bacteria moving out of the focal plane was no longer existing, there were still several other       problems persisting:
The bacteria were flushed away, whenever medium containing aspartate was added
Aspartate was mixed with the already existing medium. This does not create a homogeneous mixture as desired for a reproducible response.
Tracking bacteria is difficult and they are moving out of the field of view
Subsequent measurements of the same cell are not possible
From these problems, the medium exchange combined with the measurement of the same bacteria were regarded as the most important criteria to have in our biosensor, since it allows a fast and reliable output. We considered using valves for a       microfluidic system, magnets for ferritin expressing bacteria or even attaching magnetic beads to the cells to hold them in place. However, the most simple solution seemed to be to specifically tether the bacteria to the surface at their       flagella.[1,4] This would prevent all the previously stated problems, i.e. it allows the medium exchange with a measurement of the same bacteria. Additionally, the readout of a rotation is much simpler than tracking bacteria in 3D.
Tethering bacteria to a glass surface
This experiment is both simple to set up and analyze. The cells were grown, as before, in M9 medium at 30°C, which yields an average of 1.5 flagella per cell[5]. This is crucial to tether most of the bacteria at only one flagellum. For highest       motility, cells were harvested during the mid to late exponential growth phase and resuspended in a specific tethering medium. To truncate the flagella, the bacteria were pushed through a very"

Evry,2014,Team:Evry#Biology#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html,": Result of promoter sequencing.
Thus, there is 94.1% of identity between the transketolase promoter of the Pseudovibrio FOBEG1 strain and the Pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola strain.
For the replication origin, the aim was here to find the replication origin of the plasmid of the reference strain FOBEG1. To do so, we looked for the repA, repB and repC genes on NCBI. Those three genes follow each other in the genome.
This sequence was amplified with primers 49 and 50 (see primers table in Protocols ).
Figure11: Result of ORI amplification in Pseudovibrio denitrificans (Pd), Pseudovribrio ascidiaceicola (Pa) and E.coli DH5a.
The negative control with E.coli DH5a confirmed that there is no amplification. For Pseudovibrio strains, we obtained one band for Pseudovibrio denitrificans and two for Pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola.
Meanwhile the plasmid of the transposase was tested, and the project to create a viable plasmid for pseudovibrio was abandoned ( Transposons ).
Moreover, our third hypothesis of a system which would degrade exogen DNA was supported by BLAST data, and the presence of the enzyme EcoRI in the genome (see section Genome assembly ). This enzyne is indeed known to degrade DNA without a certain pattern of methylation.

Penn_State,2011,Team:Penn State#Lab#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the design of our device.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.
Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on the procedures that video discusses.
Environmental Health and Safety has done a similar type of safety education program for our  researchers. Certificate of completion is available for all of the iGEM the team members.

Question Was it possible to simulate all Martian parameters for combo-exposure experiment?
Experiment The bacteria were exposed to the UV at the specific duration times and immediately put in the little glass chamber and subsequently in JMMC for further pressure exposure. As both bacteria have shown good results in growth rate for pressure exposures on different durations, an extensive exposure have been carried out. In order to be able to do experiments in a row, the plates needed to be exposed to UV at first then exposed further and pulled out to stay it the created environment in the glass chamber for the chosen duration. Thus, the UV and pressure were not done at the same instant.
Results The growth rate of B. Subtilis has decreased dramatically in this combo-experiment, as expected. From previous experiments on Martian UV spectra assessment it was shown that the growth rates were affected notably therefore the results are consistent with the predicted behavior. The different exposure durations were chosen in order to predict and create a basis for coming experiments on adaptation and acclimation setup."

BIT,2017,Team:BIT#BA1_-_-_TEXT.html,"I generator codes luxI, which can catalyze the synthesis of AHL. When the concentration of AHL has reached the threshold value, AHL combines LuxR to form a compound, strongly inducing the promoter plux. This induction will continue to induce the expression of the luxR and luxI generator downstream, forming a positive feedback. That’s how our cyclic amplifier works.
5.
Thus, the whole process is as follows: When the AFP concentration has reached the LOD, it will combine the aptamer and release the complementary chain and lysine, which will express the fluorescent protein. With the help of the strong promoter and the cyclic amplifier, induced promoter will lead to a higher GFP fluorescence and a lower RFP fluorescence. Finally, we use the GFP and RFP fluorescence ratio, with a higher sensitivity, to be the output signal of our detecting machine.

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"on.  The equipment I  use in surgery is sterilized by chemical or steam methods [which do] eradicate the biofilm.  There are probably reservoirs of bacteria in our hospital or offices that aren’t completely eradicated by standard cleaning regimens.  This can occur in areas we used to use to treat patients such as whirlpool tubs and hubbard tanks. Because of biofilms and impossibility in eradicating the bacteria in these tubs and tanks,  these are now largely obsolete in treating burn patients, patients with wounds, or patients with immunologic compromise.
What cleaning techniques do you currently use against biofilms on your equipment? How effective are they?
Housekeeping is largely responsible for sterilizing the hospital, patient rooms, washrooms, etc.  I am not sure of their current regimen or its success in treating biofilms.
How often do you encounter biofilms in your practice?
The Biofilms I deal with are in vivo.  Part of my job is treating chronic ulcers (diabetic, neuropathic, etc) and chronic wounds.  These are particularly difficult because of biofilms.  Standard topical antimicrobials and even systemic antimicrobials are not all that effective.  Any tissue-safe enzymatic agent that could break down this barrier would definitely be an asset.
I also deal with biofilms in prosthetics.  These prosthetics may be hardware used in skeletal fixation or joints, or prostheses used in breast reconstruction.  Once these prosthetics become bacterial colonized or form a biofilm they largely have to be removed and replaced.   Biofilms can also contribute to scar formation.  Their low grade inflammation (without full blown infection) has been theorized to cause breast capsular contractures (which cause distortion and hardening of breast implants in cosmetic and reconstructive patients).  This low grade inflammation can also cause increased scar formation around total joint replacements (hips and knees) causing reduced range of motion and stiffness.
The best product I could envision would be a gentle cleansing agent that can be used in vivo, and thus on chronic wounds, or to safely wash out total joints or prosthetic devices and be able to safely reuse them in the same patient..

Seed bombs
We made seed bombs to help spread awareness about the decline of bees, while simultaneously promoting bee population growth. A seed bomb is a ball of soil, clay, water, and seeds. The idea is that people plant them in empty lots, undeveloped fields, or even their backyards so that flowers can grow, giving the bees more access to food. We used seeds from Smooth"

2) Insertion on single chromosome :
If two insertions located on same chromosome, we still can get worms expressing two light-sensitive proteins by crossing over. However, the time will be much longer than the first circumstance considering the low frequency of chromosome crossing-over. In nature, the probability of crossing over never exceed 50% [2] .If the crossing-over occurs, the probability of the segregation of traits will be 1:1.
Fig 2.5 Chromosome crossing probability
Part I: F0: Homozygote worms obtained via microinjection. Gene A and B are localized on same chromosome. F1: heterozygote offsprings.  Part II: Crossing over occurs. F2: Three genotypes obtained.
In our experiment, after successfully getting the 2 strains, the“mapping” method (do the PCR for DNA fragment and “BLAST” it in the C. elegans genebase, or wormbase) is used to determine the locus of inserted gene. The gene, odr-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::mCherry is indicated inserted in chromosome I according to the mapping result, but we failed to map the str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP for some unknown reasons.  After we did mating experiments, we found that among 40 F2 generation, two of F2 worms showed stable GFP and RFP in their offspring, and others has the offspring with trait segregation. It follows the Mendel’s laws. Therefore, we deduce that odr-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::mCherry and str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP are highly possible to be inserted on two different chromosomes.

Data obtained from Molecular mechanism of the regulation of Bacillus subtilis gltAB expression by GltC. (Picossi, et al, 2007. DOI: 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.10.100). (b) Fitting result of the relationship between glutamate concentration and relative transcriptional level of gltAB. We use biophysical model to simulate the progress that GltC-Glu complex achieves transcriptional regulation by altering the probability of RNA polymerase binding to the PgltAB promoter.
According to the above formulas and glutamate distribution, we can get the distribution of gltAB expression in the cells, and since the PgltAB promoter is linked to LacI protein, which can also be considered as the distribution of intracellular LacI in Figure 6:
Figure 6: The distribution of intracellular lacI transcriptional level. Bars indicate the number of cells containing different lacI transcriptional levels. The distribution is obtained according to the glutamate distribution and the relationship between lacI transcriptional level and glutamate concentration.
LacI protein achieves transcriptional regulation by altering the probability of RNA polymerase binding to the tetA gene promoter, which is similar to the complex GltC-Glu alters the probability of RNA polymerase binding to the PgltAB promoter. So similarly we can get the total partition function:

The UT-Tokyo-Software team has worked in close cooperation with other iGEM teams this summer. Here we detail some of these cooperative efforts.
Collaboration with UT-Tokyo (wet) team
We collaborated closely especially with UT-Tokyo team in many aspects.
We worked together in external affairs to gain financial and material support.
We participated in School Festival held in May and made exhibitions about iGEM together.
Our team got numerous feedback on our BioBrick Search from UT-Tokyo (wet) team.
We took their comments into consideration.The main points of improvement are:
-Save the history of the words you've searched at the top of the page.
-Add a link to Parts Registry's page.
iGEM JAPAN exchange meet-ups
We participated in a iGEM JAPAN exchange meet-up held in Aug 14 at Tokyo Metropolitan University, where iGEM teams from Japan gathered, made presentations on their projects and  shared opinions on these projects. Our team introduced our project, especially BioBrick Search, which was already in action at that time, to other teams. This enabled them to take advantage of our tools. Also, we gained a lot of feedback from other teams that were essential in improving our tools. It was a great opportunity for all of us.
BioBrick Search
We put up a community post regarding BioBrick Search to let other iGEM teams around the world know about our tool ( https://2012.igem.org/Community ). We got access from 16 different countries and other iGEM teams, in general, gave us favorable responses. The feedback we received include:
We successfully found the appropriate parts from their functions.
We took into account the ""reliability"" score to determine which BioBrick parts to use.
Our project is similar to a past project from Tokyo Tech and we used this tool to find the parts that Tokyo Tech submitted.

Our part is constituted by Plac、luxR、Pluxr、luxr. LuxI can result in the production of AHL—a kind of auto-inducer which can bind to the protein LuxR and induce the high expression of downstream genes of Pluxr，therefore，this system can drive a mass of bacteria highly express a particular gene. What’s more, AHL can be used by all bacteria in certain range.
K1513001: Fast-type merR biosensor
merR gene acts as a regulator which can promote downstream genes’ expression in the presence of Hg (II), the detailed mechanism of it is well-known as a whole. This summer we aimed at finding out a fast as well as accurate method to detect the Hg (II) in water. However, we found that the former method costs much time, so we turn to look for a rapid way which meets our expectation.

Nootkatone – a promising alternative for insect repellents
Imagine: It’s a hot summer evening and you are sitting in the garden with your friends, having a good time! Rather a beautiful thought. If only it wasn’t for all these annoying insects like mosquitoes which are getting on your nerves. Of course having an insect bite is not comfortable but all in all the bite will itch for 3 days and then it’s over.
In Central America a mother tucks in her little son and kisses him goodnight. Under the cover of darkness a black, barely 3 cm long assassin bug crawls out of a gap of the ceiling and falls unnoticed on the face of the little boy. The bug drills his proboscis into the soft skin. While the insect is sucking the blood, it defecates on the skin. Unsuspectingly the little boy scratches his face and rubs the infected feces under his skin. Within one to two weeks the boy develops high fever and his body starts to swell up. He is infected with the Chagas disease. Even if he survives the fever the parasite will start attacking the heart, nerves and the internal tissue.
Eventually time will pass, possibly without any symptoms. But after about ten or more years pathological changes in the digestive tract and symptoms of encephalitis might appear finally resulting in heart failure.
Even though this story is purely fictional, it describes the fate of many people who might get infected.
Chagas is one example but there are so much more dangerous diseases like malaria, Zika, dengue caused by insects.
Different agents are used for the protection against insects, the most effective ones being Diethyltoluamid  (DEET), Icaridin and Para-Menthan-3,8"
Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"La Norteñita”(Labs, S., 2017), it was found that our initial hypothesis, which established that any farmer/company with fire blight incidence would buy our product, would change due to the fact that only apple producers with moderate-high incidence would be interested in acquiring it. Unfortunately, they do not have a completely effective solution that will eradicate the infection of Erwinia amylovora conclusively. We verified not only our hypothesis about our customer pains and gains but also all the needs, signs and conditions of our archetype.
An archetype is the last person or group standing at the end of the process of looking for a person who has all the needs you cover with your product. The market segment we intended to reach is concerned on eradicating the fire blight; it also has a moderate-high incidence of fire blight on its crops. This section is looking for a 100% practical solution at a relatively low price which could be at the same time friendly with the environment, the number of crops owned by this sector is quite a few.
Product
It is important to mention that our minimum viable product (MVP) was developed from the value propositions obtained after a thorough market study. Taking advantage of all of those situations where the customer is not satisfied when using other products available in the market. Our product is a biocontrol that combats the fire blight which is caused by E. amylovora, comprised of a genetically modified strain of Erwinia amylovora which was already mentioned in the executive summary. These were introduced to the bacteria by chromosomal insertion using the CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA complex(Bishoy, M.,2014). Based on this, our proof of concept for biocontrol with the same bacteria, by eliminating its pathogenicity, was validated, because this bacteria would act in favor of the decrement of wild Erwinia population. We can use as an example the mosquito of malaria, which was used as SIT(sterile insect technique), that are specific species and environmentally non-polluting method of insect control that relies on the release of large numbers of sterile insects. Sterile-release methods are based on the distribution into the environment of large numbers of sterile insects. These insects compete for mates with their wild counterparts; a wild female that mates a sterile male will have no viable progeny or fewer than she would otherwise have had, and so the next generation of the target population will tend to be smaller than it would otherwise have been. If a sufficient number of sterile insects can be released over a sufficient period, the target population will decline and collapse(Programme"
