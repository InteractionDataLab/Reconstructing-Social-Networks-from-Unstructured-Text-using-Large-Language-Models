Human Practices (Silver)
With Domilox being a safety switch for genetic containment, our human practices also focus on the different aspects of    genetic containment strategies and biosafety through the interaction with different stakeholders.
Here is how we have emphasize biosafety and our project safety in each Human Practice activities:
1. Hong Kong Summer Science Party (Every Sunday: 23/07 - 20/08)
Being the first human practice event in the public, the Science party serves its purpose for us to test out what the public thinks about synthetic biology. During the workshop for children, parents get time to have thorough chat with some of the team members. For a lot of the adults, they feel unable to relate to Genetic modified organisms for research purposes. However, when it comes to topics like genetic modified crops as food sources, people usually have negative views towards it. We took this opportunity to introduce our project while suggesting different situations in which the project will be useful.
With our Domilox safety switch, we try to promote that there could be a safe way to handle GMOs so that it does not have to be something that people fear.
We have received positive feedbacks, such as faith that our project could overcome some of the safety issues affiliated with GMOs. On the other hand, we also received some interesting arguments towards our project. For example, some still consider the method of phenotypically reverting the organism back to its original state to be an artificial method, thus it still has significant safety concerns.
Other results from the dialogue with science party audiences can be found here
2. Interview with Experts
Prof. Terence Lau, Vice President of Hong Kong Biotechnology Organisation
Prof. Mathew Bennett, Associate Professor of BioScience at the Rice University
Current regulations of synthetic biology and genetic modified organisms in different areas has been discussed to verify    the safety of our project. At the same time, other possible methods for project development had also been discussed to    get the best possible design in which will be easy"

called the sensitivity coefficients of the model\cite{paper8}. We adopt the method proposed by \cite{paper9}, which can determine the sensitivity to the perturbation throughout the time evolution of the system, regardless of the nature of the trajectory. The network is modeled by the ordinary differential equation
<math>\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{s}(t)=N\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{s}(t),\mathbf{p},t)</math>
where the n-vector s is composed of the concentrations of each species, the constant r-vector p is composed of the parameters of interest in the model, the m-vector valued function
<math>\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{v}(s, p, t)</math>
describes the rate of each reaction as function of species concentrations and parameter values.

Assembly of the Pulse Generator
We decided to assemble the pulse generator from the constitutive TetR expression cassette I739001 and the tet-controlled LacI generator I763026 . According to the information available at the time we started cloning, we assumed that cloning the TetR generator behind the LacI expression cassette and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis would be sufficient to construct the pulse generator. However, when the Caltech team sequenced BioBrick I763026 , they found that it did not contain a promoter, but rather started with the ribosome binding site. Therefore, we revised our cloning strategy and tried two different approaches. We firstly cloned the LacI generator behind the tet-controlled promoter R0040 in order to assemble a “real “ part I763026 , our part K142046 . In the attempt to try a different approach, we at the same time cloned the TetR-generator behind the promoterless LacI generator to build intermediate K142048 . In the next step, we cloned the TetR expression cassette behind the LacI generator with tet-controlled promoter and subjected the assembly to site-directed mutagenesis.

We work along the Evry Paris-Saclay team. Their project is focusing on the production of D-Psicose, which might be helpful for diabetic patients. We offered them our help to study the enzyme responsible of the conversion of D-fructose and D-psicose, the D-Psicose-3-Epimerase (EC 5.3.1).  Thus we wrote a quick review about their enzyme and we compared to its homolog.
We also study the structural characteristic of the D-Psicose-3-Epimerase of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and we made a video showing the enzyme active site."

Phillip's notes
Introduction:  Today, the primers for PCquad should be checked by a more experienced primer designer, and amplifying and sequencing primers should also be made.  The clones from Yeate’s lab will also be picked up.  Lastly, preparation for the journal presentation on PCR will be done with Nithin and Tyler.
Notes from Fasih: Design amplifying primers for the gBlock itself.  It says the yield you ought to get is 1 ug, so you should get 100uL at a 10ng/ul concentration, which is great for PCR, but it wouldn’t hurt to have amplfying primers ready for emergencies Check the secondary structure on Benchling to avoid primer dimer or loops.
The cage was picked up from Dr. Yeates. The BL21 (DE3) strain is ampicillin resistant.
Designing of primers: Some notes on primer design: http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html Potentially do two rounds of PCR to add the ends we need. Vinson suggested to use q5 polymerase Removed atg at start of PCquad
Conclusions:  Due to the seemingly extensive amount of secondary structure, the primers will be worked on next week, with some feedback.  Ideally, the order will go out some time mid next week."

During this period, we were informed by iGEM toulouse instructors of what this competition is, and what was expected of us.
From February to May
02/02
First team meeting, our instructors informed us on the competition more specifically and how the team is organized. Our first mission was to prepare a presentation for the next week on the following themes:
Previous subjects. What are the themes explored by iGEM? Give examples of good projects and explain why they won?
Biobricks? What are they? What are their advantages? What are the materials sent by iGEM? How does the registry work?
Competition and deadlines. How does the competition works and what are the important deadlines?
Those presentations gave us the opportunity to understand more about the iGEM competition and to get to know each other (since we don’t all come from the same institutions).
Our first team meeting
We also created our email address and a google drive to organise our files online.
02/09
Every group of two or three students presented one of the subjects seen above. Every presentation was followed by a Q&A. Thanks to it, everyone understood clearly the topic.
02/16
The next step was to present every week, two new project ideas. The presentations were divided in the following parts.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project#DataPage_-_-_TEXT.html,". Ultimately, we hope to reduce the costs of field tests via our in silico work.
First, we started our modelling on the cellular level . We must figure out the impact of E-β-farnesene and methyl salicylate production on E. coli. Thus, we performed a Flux Balance Analysis . Results were compared with wetlab data such as growth curves and GC-MS data.  We also aimed to predict the exact amounts produced and find the rate limiting steps. Here we fed wetlab data into our algorithms. The outcome will define/defined our choice of promoters, plasmid copy number and additive requirements. Secondly we did a lot of modelling on the colony level . We designed an oscillating transcription factor network to regulate pheromone production for the ""sticker enclosed"" BanAphids. This oscillator network allows communication between cells, enforcing a synchronised but oscillating production rhythm onto the whole colony. This will optimise the impact of our BanAphids on aphids and ladybugs even though a direct contact cue between aphids and BanAphids is prevented. We designed this model to answer the concerns of the private end-users regarding the spray (or honeydew) system.
Finally, we must know the effect of our pheromones on the ecosystem . We performed a series of modelling steps which you can find in our ecological model page . This information is essential in several ways : It will define the choice of pheromone production rate, which we can regulate through eg. promoter ranges. Dispersion data will indicate the optimal spacing of the BanAphid stickers, key information for the end-user.
Summarised, these algorithms allow us to model our system from the cellular metabolism throughout to the environmental impact. Based on our models, we continuously adapted the actual building of the system towards the most effective circuit. This will reduce costs and save time when our BanAphids are ready for field tests, and later for actual use.
Wetlab
Our wetlab work consists of 3 experimental parts :
The production and testing of the methyl salicylate bricks
The production and testing of the E-beta farnesene bricks
Ecological work , testing pheromone impact on the ecosystem (i.e. plants, ladybugs, ...). Here, we found industrial partners in the companies Biobest and pcfruit.
Methyl Salicylate Experiments
Throughout the summer, we made 4 different BioBricks involved in the production of methyl salicylate. After finding out that the MIT 2006 brick ( BBa_J45700"

Fatih_Turkey,2011,Team:Fatih Turkey#test3_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our one of the most important goals as a team Fatih_Turkey is to introduce iGEM                 and Synthetic                 Biology to the students in Turkey. But we did not want to limit ourselves                 by choosing only same age groups and we decided to tell the                 children, too.
Synthetic biology has been told them by consultating                     with several pre-school institutions. Also                     we told them that bacteria do not cause only diseases ,in fact, they can also do good                     things for people. For                     example; they can heal the wound or they can produce light.
Then, we asked                   what                   their bacteria can do for them. We want them to show their ideas by painting. They are                   only 6-age individuals but they have a lot of
original idea that can be seen by looking their paintings.
For instance;
* Bacteria that extends the hair 8 cm in 3 minutes',
* Bacteria massagers under the bed',
* Singer bacteria etc.
Consequently, we have told children that bacteria are not too harmful creatures
In fact, sometimes, they would be very useful for people. This experience was a wonderful remembrance for us.
 
What do you want from your  bacteria to do for you?
                                                                                               June 2011
Fatih_Turkey asked medical school students: ""Assuming that you are an expert on synthetic biology, what would you want your bacteria to do for you?
Another activity that we did in Fatih University Medical School was the preparation of a poster that caused a new brainstrom through the prospective doctors.                 We mentioned iGEM competition and some experiments that took place in the competition in our poster. And we asked them what you want your bacteria do for you if you change their genome. We wanted them to                 write their opinions on the poster. And we decided                  surprise award for winner whom has given the best opinion.
Our colleagues                   have childish but originals ideas. They liked                   the activity, because it was done when exams were on going, so they had chance to breathe between exams by writing their ideas on the board. Surprisingly, general approach to the activity was the hero bacteria which would save them from the exams.

Fungal Infections and  the branches of the immune system that deal with them
The peptides we developed have significant applications from a clinical standpoint. It has been observed in that individuals suffering from deficiencies in antibody and complement mediated cytotoxicity are less vulnerable to fungal infections than the ones suffering from phagocytic defects. Moreover studies have shown that neutrophils are pivotal in fending off fungal infections.  This is further supported by the fact that many cases of fungal infections were following a period of neutropenia (low neutrophil count in blood).
Two vital principles can be gathered from the aforementioned information:
- Phagocytes (especially neutrophils) play a very important role in the resolution (clearance) of the fungal infection.
- Antibodies and the complement system are not that effective against fungal pathogens due to the surface of these pathogens being unfriendly to binding.
As such, the modulation of these branches of the immune system should aid in the resolution of the disease.  It's important to mention that since most patients suffering from invasive mycoses are immuno-compromised and that there are different types of immunodeficiencies. Depending upon which branch is dysfunctional, an appropriate strategy of immunomodulation can be adopted.
Modifications to the peptide so that it  can emulate an antibody's stimulatory function
The novelty in our peptides is that it CAN bind to the fungal surface and it can be further modified using the Fc(constant) region of the IgG1 or IgG3 antibody subtype (IgG2a in mice). This region is important as it is recognized by the effector cells (neutrophils and macrophages) of the immune system and thereafter, leads to the death of the target cell. This way"

Therefore, we will apply TPP ribozyme 2.5 to the work we have done. As the work we have done the year, we will regulate the translation of leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH). And the method is that we will use TPP ribozyme 2.5 as a RBS of leudh. What's more, we would change the concentration of TPP, and find the best concentration of TPP. Finally, we will get the RBS sequences with designed efficiency by means of RBS calculators, and this will be synthesized and employed in the final gene circuit.

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," be neglected in modeling our signal-terminator constructs. Thus the folding process is the rate limiting factor.
Shifting the switch
To understand the RNA-folding dynamics of our switches, we performed Kinefold simulations for the His-terminator, the Trp-terminator and for the T7-terminator, each with the corresponding signal. For each terminator-signal construct, there are folding path videos available below and we optimized the signal sequences.
The Kinefold web server [9] provides a web interface for stochastic folding simulations of nucleic acids and offers the choice of renaturation or co-transcriptional folding. The folding paths are simulated at the level of helix formation and dissociation as these stochastic formation and the removal of individual helices are known to be the limiting steps of RNA folding kinetics.
For our purposes, co-transcriptional folding was the appropriate choice: Folding proceeds while the sequence is being synthesized from its 5' to 3' ends at a speed of 3 ms per newly added base (for RNA polymerase T7 phage). Thus, the transcript starts to fold before the whole sequence is fully available.
Kinefold offers the possibility to include additional bases (X) which do not pair to model hybridization dynamics between two sequences. In order to simulate how the binding of the transmitter molecule prevents termination we linked the transmitter via a linker sequence consisting of 'X' bases to the sequence of the switch.
For each transmitter-switch pair we did batch simulations with various random seeds in order to guarantee accuracy.
We also varied transmitter length from two base pairs to full transmitter length which provides insight in how long the transmitter needs to be in order to bind to the switch and how long this process takes at least.
We also examined whether diffusion plays a role in the dynamics of our constructs or not.
We checked that our switch works well for all three terminators.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," use of vesicles created from Varroa mites and release of fluorophores from these vesicles. The new test for Varroa toxicity is extremely useful for future research as the mites' parasitic nature makes them incredibly vulnerable for laboratory experiments.
To create a Varroa specific toxin, we modified an existing crystal toxin to specifically target the mites. Additionally, we tried to actually create a protein domain able to bind Varroa gut cells. This domain could then be used to make existing protein toxins target Varroa mites.
To further improve our chances of getting a working Varroa toxin, we wanted to identify other bacteria that naturally produces a useful crystal protein. Our efforts yielded one interesting candidate which was sequenced to identify any potential toxins. To be able to identify the protein responsible for killing Varroa, we constructed a toxin scanner .
Regulation
As constant low levels of toxin facilitate resistances 11 , we wanted to only produce toxic proteins when Varroa mites are near the bacteria. Therefore we created and tested two systems where protein expression is dependent on the presence of mites. These systems are based on guanine and vitamin B12, indicators of Varroa mite presence.
Another measure to prevent low concentrations of toxin was to only produce toxin when enough bacteria are present. This minimizes effects of the toxin on bacterial growth when the density of bacteria is low. To further increase the growth and survival of BeeT, we designed a system to sustain a subpopulation of non-producers. Both systems were modeled to assess their functioning and how they would combine.
Bacteria might not be able to grow very well in beehives. Therefore, regulation based on bacterial density may not be the best approach for toxin expression. Bacteria may not even be able to grow to the density required for toxin production. As an alternative we have created a toggle switch that combines the mite sensing with vitamin B12 or guanine with one of our safety measures: vulnerability of BeeT to light. This allows functional and safe regulation of toxin production even if BeeT cannot grow inside beehives.
Biocontainment
We wanted to limit BeeT to the treated hive. This prevents unknown effects the bacteria could have on larger ecosystems. The first, most intuitive mechanism here is making BeeT dependent on the shade that beehives provide. Incorporated as part of the toggle-switch we have attempted to create an optogenetic kill switch , killing BeeT when it is exposed to light. To better understand this system a model was constructed.
As a final biocontainment, we envisioned BeeT to depend on"

Organized by the 3rd year bachelor’s students of the University Evry-Val-d’Essonne, the event had the ambition to reunite public and private actors of research around vulgarized broad scientific themes. Researchers from the University Evry-Val-d’Essonne and the Genopole (a biopark dedicated to biotechnology and genetic), as well as entrepreneurs in biotechnology, were reunited. The event was also open to high schoolers and the general public. Were presented articles on genetic therapy, treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, the use of phagotherapy and also the potential of synthetic biology. We were invited by the bachelor’s students to present our project NeuronArch during the day, in front of a hundred people crowd composed of high school students, researcher, and engineers. The afternoon, we discussed with professionals and students, presenting them our poster and allowing ideas to flow.

Personalization (PCRs)
If you ever considered isolating your HLA-DQ genes from your genomic DNA, here is how.
The strategy
One of the objectives of our project is to obtain the HLA-DQ protein from scratch. Based on former studies, only the exons 2 and 3 from each chain (α and β) codify for the extracellular domain of the HLA-DQ that interacts with gluten and non-gluten reactive epitopes.
With this in mind, we designed a robust model to extract the α and β chains of the HLA-DQ from a celiac patient's genomic DNA. A set of primers were designed to conduct 3 different PCRs (that included 10 reactions) to finally obtain the α and β chains flanked with restriction sites for further cloning.
PCR 1
In the PCR1, amplification of the exons 2 and 3 is carried out by using primers P1-P2/P1’-P2’ and P3-P4/P3’-P4’ respectively in 4 separated reactions, called PCR_E2A/PCR_E2B and PCR_E3A/PCR_E3B. The product size correspond to the expected ones, 252bp and 281bp for the exons that codify the α chain, and 391bp and 328bp for the exons that codify the β chain.
PCR 2
The products of the beforementioned reactions are to be the template of the following PCR2. In this step, the restriction sites NdeI at 5' (in the case of exon 2) and SalI at 3' (for exon 3) are introduced for further cloning in the vector pET22b(+). Besides, a complementary region between exons 2 (3' end) and 3 (5' end) for further assembling is also introduced. To accomplish this, 4 separated reactions called PCR_HE2A/PCR_HE2B and PCR_HE3A/PCR_HE3B are carried out using primers P1*-P2*/P1’-P2’ and P3*-P4*/P3’-P4’ respectively. The resulting products with the restriction sites and overhangs should be of 264 and 292 bp for the α chain and 289 and 298 bp for the β chain.

I was dripping in sweat. Some moves were easier than others. Like I’m relatively better with flexibility poses, compared to those balance poses- I kept on falling over. Time went by a bit too slowly sometimes. But it was an amazing experienced. As I stepped back out into the AC room, it was SUPER refreshing. I felt so great afterwards. I’d love to do it again.
Aug 3: End of summer?!
I can’t believe 10 weeks just flew by. Because today was the last day, everyone made posters and I was very fun to go around and check out my friends’ or other people’s posters. As a walked around, I realized that everyone made progress this summer. And some people’s posters were very interesting. I saw one on how Disney’s princesses affect the way kids think about gender. As for my project/ summer, I am proud of how much I have learned. Sadly, this doesn’t translate to how well my project is working. My project has literally just begun.
Aug 4: Finishing the rest up
The day after summer research has ended. Yet I’m still in the lab because I’m not done with my project. Surprisingly, I actually wanted to be in the lab, so I can finish. I hope I can finish it soon.

Ligation
Ligation in the context of molecular biology is the enzymatic joining of previously restricted nucleic acid fragments by synthesis of new bonds with simultaneous breakdown of ATP. A linearized plasmid functions as a vector for DNA inserts and all fragments are connected via ligation resulting in a new circular plasmid carrying the insert DNA. A typical reaction setup consists of a ligase, ligase buffer and the DNA fragments while the molar ratio of vector to insert should approximately be 1:3. The mixture was filled up with nuclease free water. Unless stated otherwise the reaction is incubated for 60 min at room temperature and is then used for transformation.
Gibson Assembly
Gibson assembly is a technique that allows fast isothermal assembly of multiple DNA fragments, regardless of fragment length. These fragments only need to have overlapping ends of 15-30 bp which can be created via PCR. Unless stated otherwise the Gibson Assembly was perfomed using the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (NEB) according to the protocol published by New England Biolabs . To design the primers for the respective PCRs a webtool was used ( http://nebuilder.neb.com/ ).
Set up the reaction according to the table below on ice (2-3 fragment assembly).
Incubate samples in a thermocycler at 50°C for 15 minutes when 2 or 3 fragments are being assembled or 60 minutes when 4-6 fragments are being assembled. Following incubation, store samples on ice or at –20°C for subsequent transformation.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  It has been decided that a new gBlock will be ordered.  After some consultation, it has been decided that the gBlock will be designed with an additional handle for primer annealing.  Regarding the protein expression, the lysis be done and protein concentration will be measured today.
Procedures:
Designing the construct:   The gBlock to be ordered is titled “PCquad Optimized for iGEM 3.0.”  Using a random sequence generator, http://faculty.ucr.edu/~mmaduro/random.htm the handles were designed to be 30 bp.   An initial primer was designed and checked using IDT Oligoanalyzer for secondary structure, and non-specific binding within the construct.  The sequence was optimized by changing some bases.  The highest deltaG was -9kcal/mol for non-specific binding between the forward primer and the reverse complement of the cage. The Reverse primer was designed in a similar method.  The highest deltaG was -8kcal/mol for non-specific binding between the reverse primer and the forward sequence of the cage.
Picking the insertion mutant: Mutant number 10 was chosen due to the site’s potential accessibility by thrombin protease.
Cell lysis:
The 0.093g cell pellet was lysed in 1mL of lysis buffer. Lysis buffer composition: 50mM phosphate pH 8 300mM NaCl 10mM imidazole 1 protease inhibitor tablet/10mL 100ug/mL 2uL DNase/mL
The lysis buffer was added to the cell pellet, and a pipette was used to resuspend the pellet.  The tube was vortexed for 20 seconds in 5 second intervals, and then iced for 5 minutes.  This was repeated three times.  The solution was then spun down for 10min at max speed, and the supernatant was removed.
Observations:  Upon adding lysis buffer,"
Edinburgh_OG,2017,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model:Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the one we obtained previously (Figure 5), the pattern of the plot and unexpectedly round number suggest a numerical error during the simulation. So far we were unable to identify   the source of this issue, however we suspect it originates from the PyDDE algorithm for solving DDEs.

The extinction time of XS and r-ratio are plotted against (A) induction rate ( d4f3bd5 ),    (B) time latency of a temperate phage ( 7a2891f ), (C) burst size of a temperate phage ( c83187d ),    (D) burst size of a lytic phage ( 32e0d55 ), (E) initial concentration of a lytic phage (particles/ml) ( df83949 ),    (F) time at which lytic phage is introduced into the system (hours) ( eac0ccf ). Horizontal line shows the nominal parameters.
Development of stochastic model
We spent a lot of time trying to convert our existing deterministic model into a stochastic one. Most of these attempts failed at the attempt to interpret or replicate a limited number of previous papers that require a much better knowledge of mathematics,   which we lacked as a team (Carletti, 2002; Smith and Trevino, 2009). Those few successful attempts produced more or less sensible results, but we still struggled to understand the rationale behind and thus decided to not include them here. Therefore,   we made a collaboration with the team from Newcastle . They helped us to develop a basic stochastic model based on Campbell (1961) (Figure 8).

You can feel that the place is filled with creativity, and its occupants are constantly in contact with each other, sharing common spaces (kitchen, living room…). What was the most impressive feature in the lab section of La Paillasse is that they didn’t buy any of the lab  equipment, they collected all of it from labs or hospitals that had no use for it anymore (sometimes in working order, sometimes not), and they repaired it all in order to set up a fully-functional laboratory. The three lawyers from our team (Claudia, Victoire and Victor) went to La Paillasse to meet Mr. Jonathan Keller, who is their “in-house lawyer“. Those discussions highlighted the interesting axes to build on in order to write our report about intellectual property in the framework of iGEM. Mr. Keller was the perfect interlocutor to go to because he and his teams work very closely on Open science problematics, on the proposal of a new legal Framework for Open Source Hardware. At the same time, he works closely with the Evry iGEM team, which regularly conducts experiments at La Paillasse. Mr. Keller's input was very enriching and allowed us to get a better grasp of the Open science  problematics in the domain of synthetic biology, which will be developed in our IP report. He kindly agreed to take part in the Parisian meet-up that we organized. If you want to find out more about this place, you can visit their website here"

Comparison of Polymerases
As our variable regions (for each Monobodies and Nanobodies ) were ordered through oligonucleotide synthesis, the strands naturally were single stranded. For the correct assembly of the variable regions into the construct, they had to be annealed. For this purpose we tried using the Klenow Fragment (3'→5' exo-) by New England Biolabs at first. However, the cloning of the Klenow annealed fragments was not optimal.
For example, when inserting the variable regions for the Nanobodies, the primers called F2-1 and F2-2 had to be annealed, to then be cloned into the Nanobody construc t (missing the variable regions). When separating the samples (annealed oligonucleotides) by gel electrophoresis the reason why was hinted as no fragments of 143 bp were found in the bands on which the annealed sample were loaded (see Figure 5).
Figure 5: Gelelectrophoresis of annealed oligonucleotides. Photography of 1% agarose gel dyed with ethidium bromide. Loading of the samples (from right to left): Primer F2-1, Primer F2-2, 100bp plus ladder (by New England Biolabs ), empty space, three times the by the Klenow Fragment annealed parts, empty space, 100bp plus ladder (by New England Biolabs ).
We then concluded to use other Polymerases to anneal the oligonucleotides. For that we annealed two oligonucleotides called V1-1 and V1-2 to a fragment called V1  as well as V2-1 and V2-2 to a fragment called V2. These were used to bring in the variable region of the Monobody construct, inhabitating the randomized regions essential for binding proteins in the following.
For this purpose we used the following polymerases: Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (by New England Biolabs ), KOD DNA Polymerase (by Merck Millipore ), Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (by New England Biolabs ), GoTaq G2 (by Promega ).
In Figure 6.1 one can see the result of the annealing of the oligonucleotides V1-1 and V1-2 to the fragment V1 and V2-1 and V2-2 to the fragment V2 by the four polymerases.

Lactoshield is designed to produce the AMPs upon activation by heat, which is practical considering that all Indian households boil the milk once before consumption. For regulating gene expression through an increase/decrease in temperature, several options can be explored, a couple of which are available in the iGEM DNA distribution kit.A λpR promoter with a mutant cI inhibits gene expression below 42°C. Another part, an RNA thermometer isolated from Bradyrhizobium japonicum can be used for temperature sensitive post-transcriptional regulation. This part too, initiates translation at 42°C.  To read more about the temperature activated systems we used click here.
While designing a system to deliver the AMPs, we took inspiration from the 2012 iGEM team Groningen to build the skeletal design for our project. To read more about the delivery system click here.

Abstract: The lack of standardization in assembly techniques for DNA sequences forces each DNA assembly reaction to be both an experimental tool for addressing the current research topic, and an experiment in and of itself. One of our goals is to replace this ad hoc experimental design with a set of standard and reliable engineering mechanisms to remove much of the tedium and surprise during assembly of genetic components into larger systems.

Tianjin,2016,Team:Tianjin#Community#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," get the genes in this way, we are grateful for Prof. Liu’s help. Here are the screenshot pictures of the e-mail records.
Dear professor, I’m Jiawei Chen, a junior student in the Academy of Chemical Engineering, Tianjin University, majoring in pharmaceutical engineering.
Recently, our team were conducting an experiment aiming to build a novel in vivo inducible bacterial lysis system in Synechocystis. We have found your journal article, A controllable bacterial lysis system to enhance biological safety of live attenuated Vibrio angulliarum vaccine, published in Fish & Shellfish Immunology last year. And we have got great interest in the regulatory switch to control the expression of phage P22 lysis cassette 13-19-15.But we don’t have a deep insight in this field of research and have several questions.
From the article we could know that these 3 genes are from Phage P22. While searching in the GenBank, however, we have found there were different kinds of Phage P22. And different phages have different genes. Thus, we want to exactly know which kind of phage these 3 genes come from. And could you please tell us the gene sequence if possible so that we can make a total synthesis of these genes?
Thank you and we hope to get your guidance.
Best regards
Jiawei Chen
Dear Jiawei Chen, These genes were brought from America and I can give you these genes. So you don’t have to synthesize them. Please let me know your address.
Professsor Liu
Hello professor, It’s excited to receive your email. Thanks a lot for your support. Not only has it solved our problems, but also saved our funds.
It is difficult for us undergraduates to conduct a project by ourselves. In the process of experiments, we will inevitably encounter a great number of problems. So your help means a lot to us. Thank you again and wish our project will go on well with the plasmid you provide.
Besides, our plan is to control gene 13 by a nickle-inducible promoter, meanwhile, make a normal expression of gene 15 and 19. In doing so, we can build a novel in vivo inducible bacterial lysis system in Synechocystis. So could you please give us the plasmid profile or relative gene sequences so that we can make further design to fulfill our purpose.
Best wishes
Jiawei Chen
Jiawei Chen,

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," country in recent years proves this opinion.
During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients. For example, the recurrence of the disease seriously affects people's health and lives and aggravates their economic conditions.
Intestinal microecology is the research hotspot in recent years. However many pathogenesy of intestinal diseases is still vague. I’m greatly interested in studying inflammatory bowel disease from the perspective of intestinal microecology.
Q: We really hope to learn more about the classification of intestinal lesions from the perspective of medicine.
A1: The first classification of lesions in digestive system is mainly based on dissection, including esophageal diseases, gastroduodenal diseases, small intestinal diseases, colon diseases, anorectal diseases, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases.
Actually, each disease from different splanchna can make a sub-classification, like congenital disease or genetic disease, inflammatory diseases, tumor diseases, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, etc. Also there are other symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement caused by some certain disease. For example, immune disease can cause the gastrointestinal involvement.
A2: There are four types of lesions in digestive system : esophageal and gastric diseases, intestinal disease, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases. Intestinal disease includes infectious intestinal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic bowel disease, autoimmune enteropathy, medical bowel disease and tumor enteropathy.
Q: As an outstanding doctor, you must have participated in many major discussions of operations on patients and intractable cases. We would appreciate it if you can offer us some details about some cases caused by inflammatory intestinal disease and patients’ following development.
A1: Inflammatory intestinal diseases is an important type of intestinal disease, which is one of the priorities of our work here at Department of Gastroenterology. There are mainly two types of inflammatory intestinal diseases: ulcerative colitis and  Crohn's disease.
The target organ of ulcerative colitis(UC) is colorectal mucosa mostly, which means that inflammation is limited in mucous layer. The main clinical symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhea and blood stool with mucus and pus. Most of cases are chronic and recurrent, and a little of them is fulminant. We treat mild-moderate patients with 5-aminosalicylic acid(5-ASA) preparation. If the patient is not sensitive to 5-ASA, we give them glucocorticoid. If the patient is also resistant to glucocorticoid, we add imuran(AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine(6"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#HBK_-_-_TEXT.html," does not have these issues. On top of this, they can supply relatively large volumes of the gene doping DNA as the muscles have larger uptake capacity than the veins. The major disadvantage of intramuscular injection compared to intravenous injections is the added degradation of the vectors in the muscle, leading to larger doses being required for the same effect as an IV dose. Finally, intramuscular injections can cause local swelling, drainage and severe pain at the site of injection. Nevertheless, we take both ways of administration into account.
Pharmacological compartment models are developed to understand the distribution of drugs administered to the human body by oral or, intramuscular, or intravenous routes ( Khanday et al. 2017 ). They are formulated based on diffusion processes using Fick’s principle and law of mass action. The same diffusion processes affect the administered adenoviral vectors. We start with pharmacological compartment models for both injection types as displayed in Figure 10. Here it is assumed that the mixing of the vectors with blood is instantaneous, based on an article by Tarr et al. 1933 ). Prof. Beltman, Assistant Professor Biomedical Modelling at Leiden University, later agreed with this assumption.
There are multiple tissues producing EPO, including liver, brain and kidney tissue. The main cell population responsible for EPO production are the interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney, spanning an average population of approximately 100 million cells, which produce more than 80% of the EPO in blood ( Weidemann & Johnson 2009 ).
From the compartment models in figure 10, equations 1 and 2 can be derived for the intravenous administration.
$$\frac{d[c_{blood}]}{dt} = -(k_{blood}+kel_{blood})[c_{blood}]+k_{tissue}[c_{tissue}]\tag{1}$$
$$\frac{d[c_{tissue}]}{dt} = k_{blood}[c_{blood}]-(k_{bind\,uptake}+k_{tissue})[c_{tissue}] \tag{2}$$
Similarly, equations 3, 4, and 5 can be derived for the intramuscular administration. In intramuscular administration, the viral vectors must first diffuse out of the muscle and enter the bloodstream. While in the muscle, the muscle macrophages break down and eliminate the viral vectors.
$$\frac{d[c_{muscle}]}{dt} = -(k_{muscle}+kel_{muscle})[c_{muscle"

Figure 1. Two colour image of βHACdH homodimer with labelled N- and C-Termini (arrows)
Introduction
Our model of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathways highlighted several key enzymes that could be altered to produce palm oil, including Delta 9, Delta 12 and β-hydroxy acyl-ACP dehydrase (βHACdH), which agrees with previous publications on these enzymes. Delta 9 and Delta 12 are involved in linear pathways, meaning that there are obvious reactants and products, so the overexpression of them can be measured directly via LC-MS and other techniques. However, βHACdH which is expressed from fabA is a β-Hydroxydecanoyl Thiol Ester Dehydrase involved in a cyclic pathway[1] specifically the conversion of β-hydroxy acyl-ACP to Enol acyl-ACP as part of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway[2]. Therefore characterising any specific change due to βHACdH overexpression will be challenging, as any products will automatically be involved in the proceeding stage of the cycle and it would therefore be difficult to determine the effect of overexpression. An alternative to measure the overexpression of βHACdH, would be through the addition of His-tags to either the N-terminal and or the C-terminal of βHACdH. However, depending on the structure of βHACdH, the addition of His-tags could potentially interfere with expression, protein folding, enzymatic functions and interactions[3][4][5][6][7]. These problems are particularly applicable to βHACdH, as it forms a homodimer, as shown by Leesong et al., 1996[1]. Therefore, the addition of His-tag could potentially interfere with the interaction domain and thus the formation of a homodimer, which would be"

NANDA WANG NUO'EN
Biomedical Engineering
ROLE
Team Leader, Head of Wet Lab, Collaborations Coordinator, Member of Science Team, Marketing Team, Safety Team, and Human Practices Team
AMBITION
Nanda hopes to make the world a better place in any way she can, which includes helping anyone in need of her love and support. She’s one ambitious lady; she hopes to pick up as many skills as possible and be a Jack of all trades and Master of some. She envisions her future self as someone who would not only make significant contributions to the society, but also empower others, especially the underprivileged, to pursue their dreams. Aside from these, she has also been secretly wishing to have a celestial star named after her in future.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HER
People usually can't tell which country Nanda is from because of her rather unique name. Although it doesn't exactly sound like a typical Singaporean name, Nanda's a true-blue, born and bred Singaporean! Not only does her name sound multi-linguistically unique, Nanda is effectively billingual. A skilled linguist, Nanda alternates fluently between English and Chinese (and would probably adopt a translator's career if she didn't pursue an engineering employment).
NUR LIYANA BINTE AYUB OW YONG
Life Sciences
ROLE
Team Leader, Head of Creative, Collaborations Coordinator, Member of Science Team and Wet Lab Team
AMBITION
Liyana’s ultimate goal is to dedicate her life to humanitarian work, and be a powerful voice for women and children who have none. She also strives to help others recognize their own worth. As a side project, she’s working on inventing teleportation.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HER
She loves it when people teach her things they’re passionate about. Languages, carpentry, sewing, bring it on! (Especially quantum mechanics someone please teach her please please please she really needs it for her teleportation thing...)

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"nge up some from other labs. Noting that the kan plates that we used previously often grew colonies for negative controls, we increased the amount of kan stock we added from 1 mL to 1.5 mL. We have yet to test whether that is too great for the cells with the appropriate plasmid, but we have confirmed that it is lethal to normal cells by the fact that nothing grew on the negative test for the epi300 cells that Ting recently made.
2)Tested epi300 cells by transforming with the rfp cassette for easy identification of whether or not the transformation was actually successful, or if other factors were in play regarding resistance. Negative controls were also employed for the newly made plates.
Update: many colonies on the rfp plate, but none on the negative controls. The transformation efficiency appears to be slightly lower than previous competent cells, but is still fairly high.
3)Miniprepped the resistance cassette colonies. Previously, to do the PCR, we just picked a colony, but we thought that it would be beneficial to have a plasmid stock in case we needed to repeat the PCR.
4)PCR with new (biobrick) primers was attempted. We received primers for the Dsz genes and also for the amino acid genes. We did not, however, receive the DszA forward primer, and decided to hold off on working with the Dsz genes until later. We performed a cPCR for all the genes we had, and ran the results on the gel.
5) We attempted to do a solvent tolerance assay, but were thwarted. As it turns out, gasoline has some rather unpleasant volatile compounds that were interpreted by other members of the LSC as dangerous. Also, the cells that we wanted to grow showed no growth for the first 5 hours. Personally, I think that while it would be nice to have the relevant data, it seems that the hurdles to test to see if the addition of the prefoldin chaperone helps our cultures grow in organic solvents to remove the sulfur compounds are too great. We may revisit the project, but right now, it seems that we should put the idea behind us. As of 2:18, June 16th, nothing is growing in John's other experiment, which may or not be documented on the wiki.
6)Ran the gel. Below are the results from yesterday's and today's PCR. Cameron made the gel and taped the edges of the gel box to prevent the gel from escaping. The gel itself was made to 1% agarose in 0.5%"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html,"). The cells have been co-transformed with a plasmid containing the respective engineered variant of indC and a second plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp, Svp, EntD or DelC. The first row shows plates with cells only expressing the engineered indigoidine synthetases without a supplementary PPTase. Note that some combinations result in blue colonies, whereas others don't.
As depicted in Fig. 5 , both approaches lead principally to fully functional indCs. The synthetic T-domains 1, 3 and 4 showed the same decreased growth and indigoidine production on plates as did the native T-domain derived from P. lumninescens. The colonies obtained after co-transformation with supplementary PPTase plasmid were small in size and of dark blue color. Compared to synthetic T-domain 5, indigoidine production started earlier (approximately after 24-30 hours).
Figure 5: Indigoidine Production by Modified Variants of IndC We replaced the indC T-domain with both the T-domains of other native NRPS modules (entF, delH, tycC, tycA, bpsA, plu2642 and plu2670) and synthetic T-domains. The figure shows the five modified versions of indC that remain the enzyme function, thus resulting in a blue phenotype of transformed E. coli TOP10. The cells have been co-transformed with a plasmid containing the respective engineered variant of indC and a second plasmid coding for the PPTase sfp, svp, entD and delC. The figure shows representative results; all transformants of this first experiment can be seen in Fig. 4.
In contrast to the synthetic domains 1,3 and 4 which were designed by the consensus method and showed medium to high similarity to the sequence of origin, synthetic domain 5 was generated by the guided random method. Remarkably, even though 39 out of the 62 amino acids of the original T-domain were exchanged, the indigoidine synthetase with this T-domain was still functional. Closer analysis of the sequence compared to the original indC T-domain sequence showed, that the characteristics of the amino acid sequence, i. e. for instance polar or charged amino acids, were retained in 72 % of the sequence. Also, the GGxS core sequence of the T-domain at which the activation by the PPTas occurs was conserved.
The Efficiency of Engineered NRPS is Improved When Optimal Domain Borders Are"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Nimaya De Silva
Undergraduate
Hello! My name is Nimaya De Silva, and I am 18 years old. I just graduated from Winston Churchill High School. Starting this fall, I will be entering the biomedical sciences program at the University of Calgary. This is now my third year of iGEM. I joined iGEM to gain more experience in the lab, and to venture more into the world of biology. But I have also found myself working on human practices, and coding the wiki which has been very enjoyable! I hope to continue my experiences in iGEM in post secondary as well! Besides iGEM, I love to read anything and everything to do with dystopia and Harry Potter and love to recreate pop songs on the piano!

Hi!!! My name is Mina Akbary-Zheng, I am sixteen years old and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. I was excited to join iGEM for the first time because I loved the idea of creating something completely unique with people with similar interests to me. I love designing and coding on the wiki and learning new things about lab work and synthetic biology. I have not yet decided what I want to study in post secondary but iGEM has led me towards a path in engineering or computer science. Besides iGEM, I love dancing, listening to music (Jazz, La La Land or Hamilton) and annoying my parents while singing in the shower.

Part 1. Selection of acid tolerance component ( msmK )
    The key point of this part is selecting the gene related to anti-acid characteristic. Because the mechanism of acid resistance is complicated, and genes are connected to each other, it is hard to confirm the most significant gene.
    Gnomic mutagenesis and high throughout screening are carried out to obtain anti-acid mutant strains with significant higher survival rate under specific acid environment (pH 4.0, 5h). Then analyze the diff-genes data between mutant strain and parent strain on pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 respectively. A dimensionality reduction model is established and five possible acid-resistant genes are obtained. Finally, with experiment verification and pathway analysis, msmK gene is shown to be the key anti-acid gene.
    In addition, we also inferred how the component functions by analyzing the main acid tolerance pathways of lactic acid bacteria. The result shows msmK is related to carbohydrate metabolism and sugar transporters. That means it can help provide more energy for bacteria in acid environment to maintain intracellular pHi.
Part 2. Add anti-cold gene( cspD2 )
    According to previous research, we know that cspD2 can express cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria. Therefore, we obtained the cspD2 fragment by in vitro synthesis, and constructed the cspD2 overexpression strain. Verify the cold resistance performance of the recombined bacteria with nisin as inducer.
Part 3. Demonstration
    It has been verified that cspD2 can effectively exert anti-freezing effect in the recipient bacteria. CspD2 was ligated to the pNZ8149/msmK plasmid by one-step cloning (seamless ligation), and the recombinant plasmid was introduced into the constructed L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2 strain using electroporation. The gfp gene was inserted as a marker gene, and cell viability was characterized by fluorescence intensity. The strain was tested for acid resistance and freezing resistance using a flow cytometer.

We want to standardize the minimum information for a qualified BioBrick. If every BioBrick has the same format of information, then it would be very easy to find and distinguish a BioBrick among the sea of BioBricks. In addition, in the website of partsregistry, it is very difficult to find the BioBricks we want due to the useless information in the website. So we conclude that it is essential to create a default template for storing the information of BioBricks.

Indigo Synthesis
Indigo is a deep and rich color close to the color wheel blue, which was cultivated in East Asia, Egypt,                         India, and Peru in antiquity. The earliest direct evidence for the use of indigo dates to around 4000 B.C.                         and comes from Huaca Prieta, in contemporary Peru.1 It is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, printing                         and dyeing industries. However, at present, indigo industrial production often uses a large number of chemical                         reducing agents, such as sodium dithionite. Sodium dithionite decomposes to form sulfates and sulfites, which                         can corrode equipment in dyeing plants and wastewater treatment facilities. Many dyeing plants avoid the extra                         cost of wastewater treatment by dumping waste dyes into rivers, as rivers have a negative impact on ecology 2.
In order to improve this situation, we have explored the Tammy M Hsu’s and 2013 IGEM_Berkeley’s study1 and produced                         a system to express indigo in E. coli with a protecting group strategy (Figure 1).
Results
FMO
Referring to the indigo synthesis strategy of Hack Sun Choi3, we use FMO to synthesize indoxyl. FMO can efficiently oxidize indole to indophenol, and then Indophenol can be oxidized by oxygen in air or liquid to Leucoindigol, which will be spontaneously transformed to indigo (Figure 2).
For better purification and identification, we inserted the coding sequence of each enzyme into pET21αvector containing an N-terminal 6x His tag. Results of colony PCR and sequencing demonstrated that we successfully constructed these plasmids (Figure.3).

The current burning of beehives threatens the environment and the loss of its resources, which is why a viable alternative to avoid such burning is necessary.
He clarified that the word of a beekeeper is not in doubt; however, it might be hard for us to obtain real data regarding the presence of American foulbrood as it is a mandatory complaint issue, so there is distrust of the producer.
Dr. Tanus suggested liquid application (in the form of syrup) which beekeepers could feed their hives. This syrup (sweetened water) could contain the peptides in it and be fed directly to the box. This way, nurse bees would feed on here. Since Africanized bees appeared, he claims, it is better to have interior feeding to avoid foragers. This method would also avoid product loss from environmental conditions such as the wind or sun.
We mentioned the possibility of adding the solution cell by cell, but he said we must think of the beekeeper. This just isn’t scalable for 3,000 or 4,000 boxes. We realized here that the easier the application, the more attractive the product.
We should consider the effect our product would have on the bee's usual microbiome.
He put us in contact with MSc Alejandro Romo, MSc Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa, and Dr. Alfonso Arroyo.
We received an invitation to the XXVI International Congress for Beekeeping Updates in 2019.
Detailed Description
After receiving feedback from beekeepers, we looked into bees’ anatomy and behavior in a healthy environment.

Construct for SP2-Nsp2 characterization in E. coli
This construct is meant to be used in characterizations of the signal peptide SP2-Nsp2, obtained from the same study as the SP1-NSP4 signal peptide,  this causes the attached protein to be excreted into the media by the Sec-dependent (Sec) secretion pathway, the general secretion E. coli route. When this signal peptides are linked to the N-terminus of recombinant proteins, they are critical for translocation and secretion of proteins [2].
Construct for SP2-NSP2 : BBa_K2760021
This plasmid expression vector has a T7 promoter (BBa_I712074) ,induced by IPTG, and contains a a T7 medium strength RBS for E. coli, the signal peptide SP2-NSP2, iLOV (BBa_K2760024) as the fluorescent marker with a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to it; finally a double terminator (BBa_B0015).

Due to the immense possibility of sequence mutation at amino acids                                 level, it is a time-consuming and low efficiency task to obtain a high efficient biocatalyst                                 by random mutation.
With the availability of an increasing number of protein structural and biochemical data,                                 rational design of enzymatic mutation has become more and more popular (Bloom, et al., 2005;                                 Chica, et al., 2005; Kiss, et al., 2013; Li, et al., 2012; Steiner and Schwab, 2012). Many                                 strategies have been used to obtain evolutionary information, catalytic sites and substrate channels by integrating sequence and structural features of enzymes. Previous studies have                                 developed many effective computational tools for enzyme engineering, such as the enzyme design                                 software Rosetta (Leaver-Fay, et al., 2011) and stability design software Foldx (Van, et                                 al., 2011) and so on (Table S2). However, most of them only focus on one feature, like the                                 thermo-stability based on the known PDB structure, and often request professional backgrounds                                 in protein structure, biochemistry, bioinformatics and so on.
What is AEMD?
AEMD is a web-based pipeline, which integrates several approaches together for enzyme stability,                                 selectivity and activity engineering. This pipeline can generate comprehensive reports, which                                 include the recommended mutation for improving enzyme catalytic property. Specifically, users                                 can get the recommended mutation only inputting sequence information of target enzymes, which                                 is very useful in the situation without professional knowledge and the known protein structure,                                 since AEMD contains a functional module that can automatically predict structure of the target                                 enzyme based on the known structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB).
AEMD-Web provides a web interface, enabling users to conveniently predict mutants which                                 could improve the stability, selectivity and activity of enzymes. Users can obtain the suggestion                                 of mutations for almost all enzyme even without protein structure. In the future, we will                                 construct a comprehensive enzymatic mutant database and integrate new computing technology,                                 to improve the efficiency of enzyme engineering in industrial biotechnology.

Stochastic Modelling of the RelE-RelB Dormancy System
RelE and RelB Regulate Dormancy and Influence Their Own Expression
Modelling of the effects of different RelE and RelB expression levels were performed as an important aspect in the implementation of the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system. The toxin RelE constrains bacterial growth by mRNA degradation, thereby inhibiting translation, whereas the antitoxin RelB inhibits this toxic effect by forming complexes with RelE. As seen in Figure 1, three different protein complexes are formed, namely RelB2, RelB2RelE, and RelB2RelE2, containing zero, one, and two RelE molecules respectively Guang-Yao Li, Yonglong Zhang, Masayori Inouye, Mitsuhiko Ikura, Structural Mechanism of Transcriptional Autorepression of the Escherichia coli RelB/RelE Antitoxin/Toxin Module, In Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 380, Issue 1, 2008, Pages 107-119, ISSN 0022-2836 .
Figure 1. The three toxin-antitoxin complexes RelB2, RelB2RelE, and RelB2RelE2.
The expression of both RelE and RelB is regulated by the relBE promoter, which is influenced differently by each of the complexes, as seen in Figure 2. When small amounts of RelE is present, RelB2 and RelB2RelE repress transcription through relBE by binding to the operator sequence. However, when high amounts of RelE are present, the toxin mitigates this repression by reacting with complexes bound to the operator sequence Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 .

In comparison to phosphorylation, proteolysis is irreversible, but could nevertheless                                 lead to a response as fast as the one based on phosphorylation, regardless of the longer time to replenish the degraded proteins once the signal is no longer present.                                 This is in fact sufficient for most envisioned therapeutic applications. Cleavage of a protein can either lead to activation or inactivation of the selected protein and                                 could be engineered by introduction of a target cleavage site into the protein of interest. Some proteases have highly specific recognition sites, such as for example                                 thrombin or the Tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp). This high specificity prevents toxicity of activated proteases to cells due to degradation of essential proteins and                                 activation of cell death.  To use proteases as signal mediators, their activation would have to be triggered by a signal. We reasoned this could be achieved                                 by reconstitution of split proteases, either by an external signal or by cleavage of peptides preventing reconstitution. The latter would also allow the engineering of                                 a cascade of proteolytic activity with each enzyme activating a downstream protein with an introduced specific target site, functioning as a linear signaling pathway.
Site specific orthogonal split proteases can be used to design a protease-based signaling pathway or a complex logic function processing                                         cellular circuit.
Proteases can also trigger the controlled rapid release of protein from endoplasmic reticulum.
Split proteases could also be used to combine several input signals. To test this hypothesis we would need to expand the toolbox of highly specific proteases                                 (similar to TEVp) that should be highly orthogonal and harmless to cells, design appropriate split variants of these proteases and design a system where proteolytic                                 cleavage results in activation. Such a system was previously designed based on competition between linked coiled-coil domains, however it has only been reported in                                 vitro
Shekhawat2009
. Furthermore, the reported system was not based on split protease reconstitution and was therefore not responsive to external inputs.
Finally, we realized that site specific proteolysis could also be used to solve the challenge of the release of molecules from cells. Secretion of proteins from cells                                 occurs via the ER and the secretory pathway, while the retention of proteins in the ER occurs via the ER retrieval signals. Proteolytic cleavage of the retrieval peptide                                 could release the selected cargo proteins or peptides into the secretory pathway, and result in protein secretion from the pool of already synthesized                                 proteins (

Redo of Expressing Honeybee Protein
Following a similar protocol to the one performed on 5/18.
Growing up cells in 100ml of LB.
We are doing a smaller volume because we are running low on bugbuster lysis reagents, and we want to be able to do at least one more reaction after this one.
Instead of making a starter culture, we are simply inoculating a colony into a 1L flask.
I started incubating the culture at 12:35 pm 7/27, but I forgot to add the Kanamycin antibiotic until 1 pm.  (100 ul of 1000x).
Here are the steps for today's growth protocol.
Inoculate one colony in 100 ml of LB in an autoclaved flask.
Add appropriate antibiotics (kan 100 ul)
Grow and shake at 37 until OD reaches between 0.4 and 0.6.
The colony was inoculated at 12:20 pm, At 4 pm , the OD was 0.064, at 5:05 pm OD was 0.358, At 5:17 the OD was 0.502, when we induced with the IPTG (5:25 pm) IPTG was added to a concentration of 0.5mM
Continue to incubate at 37 C and shake overnight.
In the morning, spin down the cells, decant the supernatant, and freeze the pellet at -80 for storage."

Backbone pSB1C3 was used for σx generator construct and comW construct. comX gene / comW gene were fused with BBa_K880005 which contains a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23100 ) and strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The purpose of this strong constitutive promoter and strong RBS is to unsure the large production of σx and ComW protein throughout time. Then, a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) is fused with the promoter, RBS, and comX. BBa_K880005 and BBa_B0015 were obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit.
Construct using pSB1C3 backbone consisting only σx CDS ( BBa_K1379004 ), and σx followed by double terminator BBa_B0015( BBa_K1379045 ) was also built to facilitate assembly of σx to promoters and RBSs of choice.
Bacterial Strain
The bacterial strain of E. coli used was DH10B. Since this strain of E. coli has clpXP degradation enzyme which targets ComX for degradation, an excess amount of ComX protein is required to maintain enough amount of ComX for Com-Box promoter induction.
comX and comW gene
comX gene and comW gene were cloned from NCTC 7465 S.pneumoniae strain genomic DNA by PCR using Vent Polymerase.
ComX Tag Protein
We engineered a C-myc protein tag in the 3’ ends of comX by including the sequence in comX extraction primer.

     Since we are working on a solution for a problem directly related to ordinary people, having a public feedback about synthetic biology is very important to analyze the social impact of our work and it help us to evaluate the biosafety and bioethical issues beyond a simple risk analysis - a sociological characterization of the values of our project. Thus, as a policy and practices approach, we will try to report public opinion of Brazil on these issues using a questionnaire to evaluate our actual scenario and, in a certain way, our own project.
     Because our team involves three universities located in different cities, the project itself is being developted in separated locations. The parts of the project are listed bellow.

Even at concentrations of 500 µM, growth was increased more than 10% greater.  With confirmation that such small amounts of glucose can successfully nourish E. coli, it was time to begin testing the co-culturing apparatus.
Apparatus Components
Culture Vessels
    The actual chambers are made from modified chromatography columns. They are Pyrex glass tubes with removable plastics caps. Each chamber has a double seal to prevent leaking.  Both of these are supported by a ring stand with clamps.
Transfer Pump
      One main thing required to have an effective apparatus is a pump to transfer one bacteria solution to the other chamber into a permeable membrane. It needs to be able to transfer enough volume to fill the dialysis tube completely but not create too much pressure that the tubing would burst. An external pump was chosen to reduce the number of components that would touch the bacteria and lesson the chances of contamination. It also reduces the amount of parts to be cleaned. On our apparatus the E. coli is gravity fed to the transfer pump inlet, then pumped through clear vinyl tubing to the dialysis tube and returned back to the E. coli chamber. It pumps approximately 25 gallons/hr.
Semipermeable Membrane
      The dialysis tubing allows regulated bacteria interaction, meaning glucose from the Cyanobacteria can transfer over to the E. coli but the two bacteria never contact. Something was needed to give the dialysis tubing rigidity and also allow effective flow of E. coli through the inside of the tubing. The dialysis tubing also needed something to seal the ends to prevent contamination. A borosilicate tube was taken and had bubbled ends installed for the sealing surface to the dialysis tubing. The glass tubing then had small holes placed in it with a wall in the middle. This made one end an inlet where the media would enter the glass tube flow out of the small holes into the dialysis tubing filling it on its way to the other end. From there it would exit through the other set of small holes and return to the vinyl tubing and the second chamber.  To seal the dialysis tubing to the glass a piece of shrink tube was placed over the dialysis tubing compressing it against the glass. Next a rubber o-ring was placed over the shrink tube to provide an extra seal.

Schistosoma
Our system turns yellow when a Schistosoma parasite, which causes schistosomiasis or bilharzia, is present. It is the most devastating water-borne parasite in the world and causes huge problems in many developing countries. For more information, read on...
Schistosoma
Life cycle of the schistosome parasite CDC (2010)
Schistosoma, from the class of trematodes constitute a genus commonly known as blood-flukes, are the parasites causing a disease called bilharzias or schistosomiasis which, according to the WHO (2010) is amongst the most devastating parasitic disease, second only to malaria, with 207 million infected and around 700 million at risk.
The most significant species of Schistosoma are S. haematobium, S. mansoni, and S. japonicum, which combined cause a loss of over 1.5 million life years. Schistosomiasis shows typically a focal epidemiology and uniformly distributed amongst populations, with higher infection rates in children than in adults. Acute schistosomiasis, including symptoms such as fever and malaise, is most commonly found in primary infected individuals whereas chronic schistosomiasis and its accompanying complications such as hepatic or intestinal schistosomiasis, are more predominant in people with long lasting infection mainly in poor rural areas. This is caused by a slow process of immune acquisition as well as the long lasting effect of schistosomal eggs trapped in tissues leading to inflammatory reactions. Diagnosis is usually accomplished by microscopy of stool samples although in many cases, especially in rural settings, treatment with Praziquantel is done without individual diagnosis. Much progress has been made in the control of the disease through community-based chemotherapy however these rely on political commitment and strong health systems. To understand the disease"

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#InDepthDesign#PromoterSelection_-_-_TEXT.html," S. cerevisiae is strongly repressed by growth on glucose. It is shown that two sites within the GAL1 promoter mediate glucose repression [5]. The promoter is tightly repressed by glucose and is strongly induced by galactose [6].
The use of the Cup1 was also essential to the use of our experiments. The CUP1 promoter is a yeast metallothionein gene promoter, and may be tightly modulated by copper [7]. It is inducible by adding copper to the medium [8].
The final crucial promoter to our experiment is alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADH1). The ADH1 promoter is a widely used constitutive yeast promoter [9]. On glucose, activity of the ADH1 promoter decreases during late exponential, ethanol production growth phase [10]. A full-length ADH1 promoter would be suitable for conditional expression of genes at high glucose concentrations [11].

and my English name is
Turing which has the
same pronounciation
as my Chinese name.
I am from phamacutical
engineering in chemical
engineering institude.
I have had passion for
bio-engineering since I
was in middle school.
It is really my privilege
to participate in iGEM
and enjoy a great time
doing experiments with
my teammates. I am also
willing to communicate
with young people from
other countries.
I am in the
pharmaceutical
engineering profession.
Like to sleep, eat, watch
animation, play games,
and finally the most
important thing is to do
experiments.
I'm Shiyu Zhang, a
sophomore student
majoring in chemical
engineering. My idol
Yigong Shi once said,
“The 21st century is the
century of biology”.
Because of this, I
attended iGEM. Thanks
to it, I met vigorous
friends. Some of them
say they have an
inexplicable crush on
biological lab.
Designing an experiment
and testing it is my dish.
“I felt somewhat titillated
when they decided to do
something “romantic”,
but it turned out that they
just wanted to keep this
“romantic” relationship
only between two
yeasts!”
I am ZHOU GUO,
responsible for
experiment of heavy
metal.
I am a chemical
engineering Bachelor
versed in heat, mass,
momentum transfer as
well as chemical reaction.
I’m very interested in
molecular biology and
willing to unravel the
mystery of DNA.
Moreover, I’m in charge
of part of experiment
process and
biology modeling.
Hello everyone～
My name is Wang Xinru.
I am studying in TianJin
University. Like most
