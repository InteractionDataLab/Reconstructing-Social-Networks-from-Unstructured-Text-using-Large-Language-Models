CPU_CHINA,2018,Team:CPU CHINA#Application_-_-_TEXT.html," The growth phenotype of cancer cells differs from normal cells due to proto-oncogene mutation, aberrant genetic activation, amplification, over-expression or deletion of tumor suppressor[1]. RNAi is being explored as a way to inhibit the expression of genes involved in oncogenesis. However, when it comes to cancer therapy, specifically targeting tumor cells is an important direction[1]. In our RNAi system, cancer specific target and promoters are designed which means that the strategy can selectively cause destruction of cancer cells without affecting normal cells. However, the efficiency of our system in vivo is also an issue that need to be concerned otherwise our gene device may not reach cancer cells to do its job. What’s more, our gene therapy strategy, if ever to become transgenic drugs, involves multiple genes transferring with two plasmids. There’s an “AND” gate system which protects the normal cells from damaging, however undesirable effects like mutagenesis lead by encoded proteins or RNA products alone (although happens relatively low in normal cells) may happens, these are indeed problems to consider.
In this case, to further improve our project for future application when it comes into a drug, if possible. Two methods which allow us to target tumor tissue in vivo are designed.
Drug delivery based on ERP
Enrich the drugs in or near tumor is vital when it comes to targeting the cancer cells. Liposome is commonly used as carrier for drug delivery[4], and some of them are in macromolecular size.
The major goal of liposomal drug delivery is to deliver the therapeutic agent preferentially to the tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [5]. There are seven barriers in the development of cancer selective macromolecular drugs and steps to be overcome, first of which is vascular wall and blood cirrculation. ERP effect is of prime importance for this step because drug extravasation occurs in a tumor-selective manner[6].
ERP was first proposed by Yasuhiro in 1986[7], which is now becoming the most important pharmacokinetic principle at the first step of the design of macromolecular drugs or nanomedicines[8]. Clearance of macromolecules and lipids from tumor is so impaired that they remain in the tumor interstitium for along time which enables the drugs to be permanent. This phenomenon has been characterized and termed the tumor-selective EPR effect of macromolecules and lipidic particles[9]. The EPR concept is now regarded as a ‘gold standard’ in the design of new anticancer agents[10].

Marburg,2016,Team:Marburg#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,". Therefore, a GMO's safety classification depends on its kill                 switch topology. This raises the need for a tool to quantify a kill switch topology's robustness against mutation. Such a tool does not                 only provide help for a biologist designing a GMO on how to design a specific kill switch but it can be also used to derive general kill                 switch design guidelines.
In the following, we will describe how the escape probability of a kill switch is computed. The escape probability is defined as the                 probability that a kill switch is destroyed due to mutations during lab conditions such that the organism survives in wild life                 conditions.
Genetic Regulatory Networks
Genetic regulatory networks (GRN) describe how genes are expressed inside an organism [2] . This is comprehensively summarized in wiring                 diagrams. Taking electrical circuits as comparison, the electrical current is equivalent to the flow of gene expression in GRNs. Genetic                 promoters represent nodes with different logical behaviors that lead to gene expression and therefore proteins being built. Subsequently,                 these proteins control promoters again such that complex behaviors arise.
A common way to put this into a context so that quantitative statements are possible is to use  modeling of GRNs based on ordinary                 differential equations (ODEs) [3] .
First, a vector of all involved substances is defined \[\vec{X}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\cdot\vec{e}_i\] with \(X_i\) being the concentration of                 the \(i\)th substance. Substances span from mRNA over proteins to intermediate complexes and finally the toxins. This vector \(\vec{X}\) depends                 on the granularity of the model and the precise biological processes (for instance dimerization, cooperativity or other higher order reactions).
The time derivative of the vector \(\vec{X}\) is then formulated as a continuous function that might depend on the concentrations of                 all involved substances \[\frac{d}{dt}\vec{X}(t)=\vec{f}(\vec{X},t,k)\] where \(t\) is a given point in time and \(k=(k_i)_i\) encapsulates all                 constant parameters used in the time derivative. The constant parameters \(k_i\) are of very high relevance: They are used to describe                 the biological processes and determine if the mathematical model in return resembles the involved biology.
Continuous Genetic Regulatory Network Modeling
In the following, the function \(\vec{f}\) is explained for different biological phenomena. It captures how the concentrations \(\vec{X}\) influences                 its own change over time.

By participating in iGEM competition I see a chance to gain valuable experience in the field that can help me a lot during my M. Sc. studies in the future. Though I don't have much experience in research, I hope to help our team as much as I can and become valuable team member.
On my spare time I like read books, watch movies and play video games. Also I like to go hiking when I have enough spare time.
Hila Korach Rechtman
I am a fourth year student in the Faculty of Biotechnology & Food Engineering in the Technion.
My first acquaintance with synthetic biology was during an introduction lecture in molecular biotechnology course, when it seemed a bit like science fiction. My biggest expectation from the iGEM project is to learn how this science fiction can be put in action. In addition, the execution of a research project from start to end is exciting to me, and I hope to get as much experience from it as I can.
Outside iGEM I enjoy playing the flout at the Technion symphonic orchestra, I am the chairman of the faculty student board and a member in the board of directors of the Technion student association. I Also love to go on hiking trips with my husband, family and friends.
Inbal Vaknin
Hi everybody!
My name is Inbal Vaknin. I'm in the end of my third year in the faculty of Biotechnology and Food engineering. I was first introduced to synthetic biology by my friend Hila, who is also on the team. She suggested I join the iGEM competition and take a part in a unique experience - of course I was enthusiastic. During the last semester, I've learnt synthetic biology profoundly - and loved it. I was inspired by it and thought about different issues we encounter during our lives and how synthetic biology could be a great solution for them.
In my spare time, I love spending time with my boyfriend, friends and family. My hobbies are riding the bicycle and watching comedy shows like Friends, The big bang theory, How I met your mother etc.
During this adventure I hope to obtain laboratory skills and understand synthetic biology, but mainly have fun and a great time.

Flux balance analysis of the impact of increasing CO2-uptake and introducing Glucose Oxidase into Synechocystis sp. PCC6803
To aid in the identification of possible target genes for increasing CO2uptake in Synechocystis, the most recent model of the metabolic network in Synechocystis was acquired and analyzed with flux balance analysis . Computation was performed with the COBRA toolbox in Matlab 2014a.The approach initially chosen was simply to fix the CO2 uptake flux above that achieved in the optimal FBA solution, and examining the effect on the growth rate (figure 1).
Figure 1: Synechocystis growth rate as a function of CO2 uptake flux in an optimal FBA solution.
The growth rate increases from 0 as the CO2 uptake flux is increased from zero to its optimal value (1.2 mmol/gDW/h), and decreases after this point. The decrease in growth rate after this optimal CO2 uptake flux is linear with a slope of -0.0083. As the growth rate decreases with increasing CO2 fixaton after this point, this means that any metabolic reaction added to the model that increases the CO2 fixation without also increasing the growth rate, will reduce the growth rate by at least -0.0089/h per unit of flux the CO2 uptake is increased by.
The glucose oxidase gene was added to the model in order to examine its effect on cellular growth. This was done by implementing the reaction:
Since the metabolite D-glucono-1,5-lactone was not present in the original metabolic model, this issue was addressed by the addition of a passive export reaction. The flux through this reaction was then increased from 0, and the CO2 uptake predicted by the FBA solution recorded (figure 2)

The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]
P(cancer) is the figure generated by Tammemägi’s model, weighted by the probability of stage 1 detection (63%) and other stage detection (37%).
P(cancer) = P(true positive) + P(false negative)
As sensitivity ≈ 100%, P(false negative) ≈ 0
P(cancer) ≈ P(true positive) = specificity * P(positive test)
P(positive test) ≈ P(cancer) / specificity
P(false positive) = P(positive test) * (1 - specificity) ≈ P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
Therefore the probability of a false positive is approximately proportional to the chance of having cancer. P(false positives) always amounted to less 1% of the total cost per QALY so this error of this approximation is negligible.
To recap:
P(true positive) = P(cancer)
P(false positive) = P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
P(true negative) = 1 - (P(true positive) + P(false positive))
P(false negative) = 0
The probability of each option was calculated by multiplying P(true positive) * P(treatment success). In the table, P(treament) represents the chance of the treament being as described by the 2nd column.

Cockroach Killing Box
     We have developed a                                         insecticidal agent against                                         cockroaches, which is also destructive to other arthropods                                         but harmless to                                         humans and animals. Spores were collected by two-phase                                         liquid-solid method and                                         then made into sporopollen. The PLGA is then used to make                                         porous particles,                                         mixed with sporopollen, and then compressed into two fluted                                         blocks. Then the two                                         pieces are combined together to form a maze, where                                         aggregation pheromone                                         targeted cockroaches is put in to attract cockroaches. As                                         soon as a cockroach                                         touches the maze, it gets infected with spores and ends up                                         dying. Spores grow                                         into bacteria and will be released in the colony of                                         cockroaches causing more                                         cockroaches to die. In order to improve the insecticidal                                         effect, we have made a                                         modification of the Beauveria bassiana: we have                                         imported the fusion protein gene                                         with protease, chitinase and chitin binding domain of                                         cockroach and tps1 gene                                         associated with trehalose metabolism. And then integrate                                         them into the host                                         genome, in order to enhance the virulence and and resistance                                         of Beauveria                                         bassiana.

These bacteria, in place of MotA and MotB proteins, use homologous membrane proteins PomA and PomB. These proteins function as Na+ channels and ensure that the necessary energy for flagellar rotation is generated as Na+ passes along the channel. Furthermore, in bacteria that use Na+ channels to power their flagella, there are MotX and MotY proteins which are localized in the outer membrane These two proteins stabilize the binding of PomA/B proteins to the motor Flagella that work by Na+ have greater speed and rotational power that those that depend on H+.
Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the proton-driven bacterial flagellar motor. The flagellar motor consists of a reversible rotor made of FliF, FliG, FliM and FliN and a dozen stators, each of which consists of MotA and MotB. FliF forms the MS ring within the cytoplasmic membrane. FliG, FliM and FliN form the C ring on the cytoplasmic face of the MS ring. OM, outer membrane; PG, peptidoglycan layer; CM, cytoplasmic membrane.
Both MotA and PomA proteins have 4 membrane-spanning region, a huge cytoplasmic fold and a C-terminal end. Yet MotB and PomB has only one membrane-spanning region.

In work by M. Homma et al, a host of chimeric proteins were generated by combining different parts of the stator proteins (MotB and PomB) from the two systems mentioned above. .  Many experiments were done to show the activity of the chimeric stator proteins and to identify the most effective of these.  According to their data, the most effective protein was (PotB59)(PomB7E) which was generated by combining the N-terminal tail of PomB with the periplasmic C-terminal tail of MotB. . In order to understand how effective this protein worked, many experiments were conducted with this chimeric protein in combination with MotA and PomA.

We were able to learn about in vitro bee breeding techniques.
We discussed the bioethical aspect of working with bees in the laboratory.
Detailed Description
The main objective of the realization of this visit was to get to know and evaluate the ideal conditions with which M. plutonius and P. larvae grow and how are they handled in vitro. On another hand, we looked forward to knowing the practices of in vitro bee breeding.
Four members of the team had the opportunity to travel to Cuauhtémoc and attend this visit where we invested approximately four hours, first in the laboratory and then in the field. M.S. Alejandro Romo Chacón (who has participated in more than 20 scientific dissemination articles related to bees or agriculture) welcomed us to the facilities and once we entered the laboratory he began to explain us about the bees’ life cycle and about some of the products and instruments beekeepers use to handle hives. Later, we were able to meet M.S. Adrián Ponce de León, who is researching about foulbrood bacteria, and along with M.S. Romo, he explained us about procedures and safety considerations in order to manage the in vitro growth of P. larvae and M. plutonius.

Top candidates are based on two criteria: 1. Exposure at the surface for protease accessibility  2. Speculated to have minimal conformational changes by insertion In general, original proline residues on the side were kept, in case they were involved in transitioning between secondary structural elements.  Also, insertions were flanked  with glycines in order to allow extra flexibility.

7th Grade Introduction to Synthetic Biology
For 7th Graders we decided to introduce the concepts of synthetic biology, since they had just be introduced to DNA in their science classes.  Aside from teaching a general idea of what synthetic biology is, we also introduced them to some basic laboratory techniques essential to synthetic biology. We made up scenarios and asked them to solve these problems using different combinations of standardized parts (promoter, RBS, different ORFs, etc.). They also learned how to use micropipettes and run a gel!

Science Research Symposium
During the school year when we were brainstorming for potential project ideas, our team members were divided into several groups and gave presentations on those topics at the school’s Science Research Symposium.  Over 80 students from 11 research classes presented their own research from all different areas to the school community.  This allowed us to receive feedback on our project ideas from both students and teachers. This really helped us decide our final project idea.

Spring Fair
This is a photo of a lower school student at our booth, playing our interactive game and learning about what it is like to have cataracts.
During Spring Fair we conducted a survey to gather public opinion and designed an interactive game to raise awareness of cataracts. In the survey we asked questions regarding people’s opinions on genetically modified organisms, cataract surgery, and our project. For the game we taped parafilm onto lab goggles and asked people who came to our booth to play the “piano tiles” app with those goggles on, and thus experiencing a real life simulation of the effects of cataracts on vision.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#Game Discovery_-_-_TEXT.html," side B and we win the game if we can kill warrior B. In this case, warrior A kills warrior B first so that side A wins very fast.
    There is a very famous book on war in China called Thirty-Six Strategies. One of the most important strategies mentioned in this book is called “Destroy the core figures and the gang will collapse”. This strategy is widely used in wars as we know that if you catch the general from your enemy side, you control the war.
VII Block the Escape Route
    In this case, the amount of warrior A and warrior B are the same. Warrior B is surrounded by warrior A so warrior B has no place to flee. Warrior A wins the game.
Discovery
Catch the thief by blocking his escape route
    We can see that warrior B is surrounded by warrior A at first. Although their amounts are equal, as warrior B has no where to escape, all of them eventually get killed by warrior A.
    There is a very famous proverb in China saying that “Catch the thief by blocking his escape route”, which is also from the book Thirty-Six Strategies mentioned above. There are countless wars in China as well as in the rest of war that contain this idea.
    The main method for historians to study historical events is by gathering materials and summarizing the strategies and theories from them. However, it is hard to test whether these strategies are true or not and under what conditions we can use them.
    Here, we use our game based on the simplified bacterial system and test many strategies our ancestors summarize. We find that most of the strategies are true but a few are not. Besides, we also get some novel conclusions that are seemingly counter-intuitive and some key points that are seemingly insignificant.
    Our system makes it possible to test the previous strategies and wisdom as well as discover new ideas.Therefore, we think that our game also provide a new angle for people to study history as they can use our system to mimic the events happened in history.
    Moreover, these discoveries are heuristic in helping us considering spatial effects on results of population interactions.
    My deer wiki viewer, you are intelligent and wise. If you pay attention, you will definitely find and create more strategies to win. When we provided this game to the kids during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum, they came up with many new ideas and some of the strategies we mentioned above are even ideas from them! We believe that there are many more values for us to discover, so come and play the game! (link to Solid game)

This is the VirG response regulator from the VirA/G receptor system. The VirA/G receptor system is used by A. tumefaciens to detect phenolic substances secreted by injured plants, e.g. acetosyringone. In presence of these substances, VirG is activated by the VirA receptor and induces the transcription of genes under the control of a vir promoter. Normally, VirG needs the rpoA gene (RNA polymerase subunit) from A. tumefaciens to work in Escherichia coli but this virG BioBrick is mutated, so it works with the rpoA subunit from E. coli. For this reason the point mutations G56V and I77V were brought into the gene ( YC Jung et al., 2004 ). Because this BioBrick is synthesized (Mr. Gene GmbH), codon usage is optimized for E. coli and illegal restriction sites were removed. When you use this virG gene in a VirA/G signaling system you do not need <partinfo>BBa_K238010</partinfo> anymore to get the system working in E. coli.

Description
As we were considering a few environmental problems that could occur around us, we learned that feeding livestock could be detrimental to aquatic environment if not taken care of properly. To be more specific, phytic acid, which is a major storage form of phosphorus in plant tissues such as brans and seeds of cereals, is contained in livestock feed but not absorbed by non-ruminant farm animals through digestion and eventually drained into rivers, seas, or other aqueous environments. This may cause eutrophication in those environments.
But this is not the only problem regarding this chemical. Phytic acid may even trouble ruminant animals. Ruminant animals form a symbiotic relationship with microorganisms that live inside their rumens, or stomachs. Among the microorganisms there are kinds that produce a protein called phytase, which breaks down phytic acid. This allows the ruminant animals to obtain phosphorus derived from phytic acid. However, phytic acid has a strong binding affinity for minerals like zinc, iron, calcium, etc. So as the phytic acid is broken down to be absorbed as nutrient, it collects those elements in the rumen depriving the animals of their important minerals simultaneously. This could possibly decrease the efficiency in the animals’ process of taking in nutrition.
In short, there are quite a few problems deriving from phytic acid. We thought that we may be able to alleviate this situation if we could break down phytic acid in the feed efficiently. To realize that it seems the most promising to add phytase in the feed in advance. Nevertheless, this requires that phytase endure the heat-treatment done as a part of sterilization of the feed. Inspired by the project of Heidelberg 2014: “The Ring of Fire” in which the team successfully stabilized proteins through circularization, we iGEM HokkaidoU_Japan decided to work on stabilization of phytase by inducing self-circularization."
TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria containing the promoter and GFP generator device onto several plates. These were incubated at different temperatures: 30⁰C, 32⁰C, 34⁰C, 35⁰C, 36⁰C, 37⁰C, and 42⁰C (Figure 6, some temperatures not shown). Bacteria successfully grew on all plates (Figure 6); however, under blue light conditions, it can be seen that only bacteria incubated at 37⁰C actually glowed (Figure 7). This is evidence that the temperature-sensitive promoter is only active at and above 37⁰C.
Figure 6. E. coli Carrying Temperature-Sensitive Promoter and GFP Generator Device: Bacteria grew in all tested temperatures (shown here: 30⁰C, 32⁰C, 35⁰C, and 37⁰C).
Figure 7. Temperature-Sensitive Promoter Activates at or above 37⁰C: Under blue light conditions, only E. coli incubated at 37⁰C produced GFP and glowed.
Testing Activation Time
After determining the activation temperature of the promoter, we also tested how long it takes for the promoter activation to be visually determined. Bacteria carrying the testing device were grown at a lower temperature (35⁰C), so that the promoter is not already active. The plates were then transferred to the activation temperature (37⁰C), and checked hourly until GFP was observed. After about 3 hours at 37⁰C, fluorescence was detected (Figure 8).
Figure 8. Testing Temperature-Sensitive Promoter Activation Time:Bacteria carrying the testing device (TempSens+GFPgen) was grown at 35⁰C, then transferred to 37⁰C. After about 3 hours, GFP could be seen. Positive and negative controls are constitutive GFP expression and BBa_ I765001 , respectively.

Clostridium difficile
Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacterium and is the most common causative agent of hospital-acquired diarrhoea in the Western world. The symptoms of C. difficile infection (CDI) can range from watery diarrhoea to pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon and in severe cases death. Most C. difficile strains produce two major toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which are responsible for causing the characteristic symptoms of CDI.
C. difficile is estimated to be present in the natural gut microbiota of around 4% of the healthy adult population however, exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporins, can cause disruption to the microbiota. This disruption can promote the colonisation of toxigenic strains allowing infection to persist. It is thought that non-toxigenic strains of C. difficile can act as a probiotic by outcompeting toxigenic strains in the gut and reducing the likelihood of disease. Currently, CDI is treated using two main antibiotics, metronidazole and vancomycin however, raised concerns over the emergence of antibiotic resistance has led to a desire for alternative treatments.
Phage and phage therapy
Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses which infect bacteria and can exist anywhere bacteria are located. Phages are highly specific, only infecting a single species or strain of bacteria and can be defined as either lytic or temperate depending on the life cycle they follow.
Lytic phages exclusively follow the lytic life cycle, following infection these phages will hijack the host cell machinery to produce multiple copies of the phage proteins. These proteins are then assembled into multiple phage progeny which burst out of the host cell and go onto infect other bacterial cells. Temperate phages can follow the lytic life cycle but are also able to follow the"

Background
This year, our team participated in the fourth InterLab Measurement Study which aimed to establish and test a standardized protocol to measure GFP that can produce common and consistent numbers from all across the world. Doing our part, we used a plate reader, which we were given access to from the UAlberta iGEM team along with support from members of the UAlberta iGEM team to measure GFP fluorescence. Our team followed the protocols outlined in the iGEM InterLab page .

Discussion
Looking at the data curves of our graphs, there is a linear relation at low concentrations of fluorescein but as the concentration increases, the curve plateaus. This suggests that our detector may have been oversaturated.

Brown,2010,Team:Brown#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"0, the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors:
For the light circuit, because the registry did not contain the majority of parts crucial to our circuit, we collaborated with teams EPF-Lausanne, PKU, and Davidson-Missouri Western to obtain the relevant parts. From EPF-Lausanne, we received BBa_K191003 and BBa_K191005. We received from PKU Beijing AraC+pBad+T7ptag+Terminator, NahR+pSal+supD+Terminator, the Bistable switch, and other miscellaneous parts. From Davidson-Missouri Western, we received BBa_K091141 and BBa_K091147 to aid in the characterization of the pLac/Mnt hybrid promoter in the distribution. Thanks all for the assistance!
For the E.Cargo project, we obtained the original Tat-PTD DNA and the idea to use Tat from fellow student Will Donovan '12 (william_donovan@brown.edu).
We would like to thank TU Delft for their WikiHacks section and BCCS Bristol for inspiring our menubar design
All other portions of the project were conducted by the undergraduate members of the Brown iGEM team. As detailed on our Obstacles/Lessons page, our advisors are there to answer questions, register us for the Jamboree, and help us troubleshoot protocols, but we are responsible for all other aspects of iGEM and the laboratory.
Gary served as an awesomely optimistic and encouraging mentor and role model
Adrian registered us for the jamboree and took care of hotel/budget logistics
Adrian and Zak helped us troubleshoot lab protocols and taught us how to use equipment
Contributions to the projects were universal. If something in the lab needed to be done, it was done by whoever was available. Particular roles/contributions of note are:
Ethan Richman was the captain of the Light Pattern project and designed the original idea of the circuit and explanatory diagrams
Julius Ho captained the Tat project and led our community outreach efforts.
James Weis was the king of modeling.
Lily Chan designed the logos for our projects and was a crucial resource for all wetlab protocols.
Jen Kao maintained our relationship with our alumni network and communications with other groups.
Tim Johnstone designed the wiki, created the SynBio survey, and took the photos you see on our site.
We'd like to thank our sponsors:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," should, therefore, not be released into the environment without control a kill switch is considered to be useful. A kill switch is based on a specific combination of genes allowing an inducible growth of the cells but only under defined conditions. Hence, an uncontrolled proliferation of E. cowli could be prevented.
There are already examples for a wide range of possible kill switch systems in the literature which are based on many different combinations of genes. Several genes coding for toxins are commonly used under the control of an inducible promoter. As toxic substances always involve risks and our E. cowli should not be triggered to produce them and thus affect the environment of the cow’s rumen we decided to use an auxotrophy-based kill switch.
To strengthen the spirit of iGEM and to support the extensive iGEM Registry we are planning to introduce the Luminesensor System of the 2012 iGEM Team Peking [1] to our cells in order to control their growth.
Fig. 1: Operating mode of the light sensor [2]
As shown in figure 1 blue light unlocks the N-terminal cap of the VVD domain allowing a dimerization of the VVD domains and subsequently the N-terminal domains (NTD) of the LexA protein which are fused to the N-terminus of the VVD domain. The dimers are able to bind to the promoter of a certain reporter gene inhibiting transcription initiation.
Accordingly, we planned to design an auxotrophy-based kill switch system for our E. cowli cells. Here, the E. coli strain used for the transformation should lack the ability to produce a certain essential amino acid. This auxotrophy should then be complemented by the appropriate gene under the control of the promoter which can be repressed by the NTD dimer. Hence, the growth of E. cowli would be limited to the inside of the cow’s rumen and abolished once the cells are exposed to light. This type of kill switch system would be particularly useful in case E. cowli is accidently released through the cow’s excretions which are subsequently used in biogas plants. Furthermore, no uncontrolled spreading of E. cowli in the environment would have to be feared.
It should be noted that, in order to render this system functional, an E. coli strain incapable of the expression of the LexA protein is needed. Otherwise, the inducible promotor would be permanently repressed, inhibiting the expression of the essential amino acid.

Integrated Human Practice -- A Real Time Social Interactions
This year, our team applied the knowledge of synthetic biology to seek feasible solutions to the energy issue. Urgent as it is, the energy issue is more than a regional problem, but has raised global concerns. It is not just the difficulty we are now faced with, but the huge challenge that would greatly restrain the development of our future generations. Lots of researches and studies have been already devoted into the field. However, the challenge still remains, mainly due to the formidable gap between the research studies and the real industrial application. Thus, what our team wants to achieve is not only demonstrating our platform on the lab bench, but also gradually improving the system in the real social context. With this idea in minds, our team kept interacting with people from all walks of life, the industrial community, the academic experts, and the administrative governments, hearing their voice and learning from their comments.
At the very early stage, when we were still brainstorming the idea, our team members actively talked to several top research groups all over the world. It was their insightful words that continuously stimulated our inspirations and promoted our improvements. Some of those groups have closely worked with photovoltaic materials for long; some of them are the leaders in electron transferring in organisms. Also, some of the team members have relatives working in the energy-related industry, so we took the advantages of these connections, searching for advices from an industrial aspect. Through these social dialogues, we not only discussed about the relevant technological operations; besides the team also learnt about the biggest obscures dragging the real application and industrialization with regards of the energy issue. Three criteria for a feasible solution were figured in the conversations, which are reasonable cost, satisfying efficiency, and the most importantly sustainability. With these objectives in heart, we thought over and over again during the whole research process to keep modifying the idea and make it more and more adaptable to the real industrial application. In assistap4nce of these social interactions, lots of progresses and breakthroughs occurred, including the ultimate application"

Few people would argue against breakthroughs in the form of biotherapies, more affordable pharmaceuticals, or eco-friendly bio-fuels. The Catholic Church promotes stewardship and involvement in all scientific fields to increase the potential of nature (5). Nonetheless, it is not implausible that this science can be misused, and it would be ignorant to deny this. It is however possible to support open source global communication to maintain awareness of the reasonably possible one percent of misuse. The human practices component of iGEM, including outreach, as well as the general expectation to build projects for the betterment of society forge in the direction of the ninety-nine percent of the possibly good uses.
Due to the increasing popularity of genetic engineering it is vital that ethical concerns remain as part of the human practices portion of every project whether Catholic or not. Discussing ethics in the open serves as a partial barrier to possible misuse of the science by means of awareness. Through the continual study and development in the field of synthetic biology it is envisioned “that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion (Pope Leo XIII) (6).” This devotion must include the sharing of ethical concerns throughout the diverse, global community of the world today.

Snofarm
665 Buffalo Rd, Brooktondale, NY 14817
Next, we visited Snofarm, a small dairy farm with 90 cows about an hour away from campus. The owner of the farm, who graduated from Cornell Vet School, strategically met with us during a milking shift at his farm to show us the milking process. Snofarm emphasized how the most intensive part of mastitis was disease prevention. Making sure the cows and their environment were clean was time consuming, but crucial to prevent mastitis. Since they were a small farm, antibiotics were the last resort for them, and they preferred helping the cow heal on its own.

Vet Dairy Teaching Barn
Shortly after, we visited our first farm located close to campus that not only supplies milk, but that is often used for educational purposes and outreach events. The farm is small and milking is done with a few employees. We met one on one with Charles, who showed us the milking process. He told us that mastitis is an “inevitable disease” and that “cows are at risk everyday, so we try to manage that risk.” He informed us about the current methods that he uses to prevent and treat mastitis and showed us what he uses to inject antibiotics into a cow. From our talk with Charles it also seemed that it would be more helpful to develop a prototype that would assist during the milking period rather than the dry period. We saw that during milking, the first bit of milk from the teat is squirted onto the floor as a visual test for mastitis, and decided that we wanted to create something that could better detect mastitis.

Throughout our process we wanted to work with not only farmers, but also researchers. Zoetis is one of world’s largest pharmaceutical companies that develops medicine and vaccination for animals. We reached out to Dr. Neubauer, who also happens to be president of the National Mastitis Council, to ask about a collaboration between us. Dr. Neubauer arranged a call-in meeting for us to learn more about our project and pointed the product development team in the right direction for their milking device design.

During this time, we were also able to ask the students what opinions or thoughts they had regarding microfluidics and their applications in the wider world. Many students were intrigued by the possibility of automating basic experiments they performed in class as well as applications in medical diagnostics, chemistry and pharmaceuticals. Some students were curious about our manufacturing process and how we were able to prototype and fabricate chips at a fast rate. After hearing our breakdown of the process and the relative prices of our equipment, some girls were excited about the possibility of setting up a chip manufacturing space in their high school. The student’s excitement about our hardware and its various potential applications illustrated to us how our project can go on to impact synthetic biologists in the future.
Industry Connections
While working on MARS we wanted to connect with individuals in industry to understand how they approached microfluidic fabrications and what input they had for us regarding a DIY microfluidics setup. We were also curious to see what potential impacts our work could have on the existing field.
Phenomyx
During the course of the Fall semester the team also had to opportunity to tour Phenomyx, a microfluidics startup located at LabCentral in Boston. The tour was led by Salil Desai, their founder and Chief Technology Officer, who took us through their fabrication and testing space. During the course of the tour we were able to learn from his industry experience in microfluidic devices.
Some key points of the tour were suggestions regarding microfluidic fabrication, for example the extra step of filtering PDMS to minimize dust and other obstructions when setting it. Another interesting topic discussed was utilizing general metrics, instead of protocol specific metrics, when grading a chip using our fluid functionality checklist. This way we can ensure that our system can be applied to chips at large without being specific to individual designs. Besides discussing chip fabrication, we were able to engage in a discussion regarding the potential to use software systems to view and analyze microfluidic functionality remotely. Although this goal is out of reach at present, it provides an exciting new challenge to the next generation of microfluidic researchers.
Aline
Over the summer we were able to connect with the team at Aline, a rapid prototyping and microfluidics engineering firm located in California. Over a conference call we pitched our initial project description and goals to their team, and were able to receive feedback on areas such as metering, primitive design and our repository design. We were also able to learn more about their microfluidics systems, for example their take on volume dispensing"

What are our limitations?
We should mention that our design is not perfect and there are intrinsic disadvantages which we cannot avoid and may compromise our system such as:
Selective pressure to improve fitness
Leaky expression of toxin
Other mechanisms of HGT: transduction, gene transferring agents
Mutagenic drift
What additional steps did we perform?
We have also considered the possibility of our lung probiotic being exhaled or ingested. To avoid any incident of spreading, the toxin can be inserted downstream of different promoters that are activated by changes in physiological conditions, such as temperature sensitive and pH-responsive promoters. Subsequently, the expression of toxin would then be induced by the acidic conditions of the stomach if ingested, or by room temperature if exhaled, effectively eliminating the released bacteria.
pH-sensitive promoter
We aim to employ the AsR promoter ( BBa_K1231000 ), which activates transcription in acidic conditions (~pH 5.5), making it suitable for the kill-switch (Sužiedėlienė et al, 1999). By introducing the colicin E2 downstream of this BioBrick, we can determine whether acidic pH (~ 5.5) induces the expression of the toxin and subsequently cell death.
Figure 4. Activity of AsR promoter and expression of colicin in pH 5.5.
Collaboration - modelling
We came in contact with iGEM NUS 2017 to collaborate and employ their characterized temperature sensitive promoter (Piraner et al, 2016).
Lastly, NUS 2017 also offered their modelling expertise as part of our collaboration and they have modelled how the bacteria would react in defined environments. Specifically, they  modelled our two gene switches (cumate and tryptophan) expressing the toxin and antitoxin, respectively. The main objective is to determine whether the two systems would work as expected upon chemical addition.

Catabolite repression is dependent on extracellular glucose concentrations.
Catabolite repression is dependent on the rate of transport of glucose into the cell.
The question posed from the two possible catabolite repression pathways is: Will one or the other have a significant effect on the outcome of the model?
Furthermore, two hypotheses for the phosphorilation of glucose produced from lactose hydrolysis were tested:
Phosphorilation by intracellular hexokinase
Secretion of glucose and phosphorilation once it is transported back into the cell.
The second hypotheses would be predicted to add to the effect of catabolite repression.
Parameter sensitivity predictions:
Lactose and alollactose transformation rates by b-galactosidase enzyme and large glucose concentrations will affect the extent of repression by indurcer exclusion.
Large values in allolactose hydrolysis rate will result in low concentrations of allolactose.
Changes in b-galactosidase reaction rates will have more effects on growth rate.
Changes in the glucose concentration that inhibited lactose transport could extend or contract the diauxic growth period during growth in the presence of glucose and lactose.
Changes in glucose concentration affected catabolite repression and cAMP levels, may have less of an effect on growth rate than the previous case.

Outreach
     Reproducibility is one of the pillars of science, it allows separate groups of scientists to perform the same experiments and come to the same conclusions. Despite the importance of reproducibility, studies 1 and 2 show that oftentimes the conclusions published in high-impact science journals are not reproducible. As iGEM is a synthetic biology competition, we wanted to find out if synthetic biologists also encountered similar problems. We reached out to scientists to ask for their thoughts on reproducibility, and whether or not an online protocol database would help to increase reproducibility in science. The survey was emailed to 155 recipients, the majority of whom were iGEM advisors and student participants. A link to the survey was also posted on the iGEM facebook page. In total, 55 responses were received, and were used to aid our design of ProtoCat.
     We asked participating teams about their experiences with the protocols that iGEM provides on their website. Surprisingly, 78% of teams encountered issues with, or had to make adjustments to one or more of the iGEM-provided protocols that they used. Even though the iGEM-provided protocols are classic molecular biology protocols, and among the most commonly used in the field, a large majority of users had problems with them. With this information in mind, we wanted to gauge the appeal of a software like ProtoCat. We asked scientists whether or not they could see themselves using a multidisciplinary, online protocol database, with 73% indicating 'yes', 27% indicating 'maybe', and none indicating 'no'. Given the positive responses, we felt certain the ProtoCat would be appealing to scientists searching for protocols.
     Respondents provided plenty of ideas such as giving users the ability to search for, review and rate protocols. We implemented as many of these as we could, placing particular emphasis on creating an efficient and easy to use search engine as many it seemed to be the most important part in the respondents' minds.

ABACUS:
ABACUS is a submodule of team USTC-Software-2016's project. ABACUS is firstly developed by professor Liu Haiyan, to enlarge the functions of Biopano. The de novo design of amino acid sequence to fold into desired structures is a way to reach a more thorough understanding of how amino acid sequences encode protein structures and to supply methods for protein engineering. To overcome limitations in current computational models, they developed a comprehensive statistical energy function for protein design with a new general strategy and verify that it can complement and rival current well-established models. They established an experimental approach which can be used to efficiently assess or improve the foldability of designed proteins. To prove it, they report four de novo proteins for different targets, all experimentally verified to the well-folded, solved solution structures for two being excellent agreement with respective design targets.

Feasibility Assessment
We see our project as a step towards the production of more efficient BPVs. In particular, our wiki should hopefully help future teams to solve or circumvent the problems that we encountered when dealing with synechocystis. However, it is unlikely that we will see any significant uptake of our current Biological Photovoltaic cell in real world conditions for a number of reasons. Even with the current theoretical rate of efficiency improvement, the BPV's efficiency will be significantly below grid parity. Combined with the difficulty involved in scaling up production of the BPV, this means that they are unlikely to be widely adopted in the near future. Despite this, our work is a step forwards - if only a small one - and we hope that future teams will improve on our project. In the future, we hope that BPVs will be viable alternatives to traditional energy sources. After all, though our BPV is far from perfect, it has proved to be capable of generating electricity on small scale, showing that our application is practical and, given substantial optimisation, could be an important energy source in the future.
End-User Considerations
There are long term benefits to adopting biological photovoltaic cells since they are capable of self repair and self assembly. This means that in the future BPVs could be a cost-effective alternative to current energy sources. However, at the moment BPVs are fairly expensive to build, largely due to the cost of materials. In particular, platinum electrodes, which show the greatest efficiency, are very expensive - though one can use cheaper carbon electrodes. Nonetheless, the lack of maintenance and ease of setup are important advantages and may mean that in the future BPVs are preferred to traditional solar cells, which can be very costly to service should they be damaged. Further innovations, such as the use of nitrogen-enriched iron-carbon nanorods to replace the platinum currently used might possibly reduce the cost of BPVs whilst keeping efficiency at high levels. Though BPVs are still fairly inefficient, it is likely that our work will help bring BPV nearer to parity with Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), which have achieved a limited amount of market penetration in niche areas such as wastewater treatment. Moreover, it is important to note that thanks to increasing awareness about the environmental impact of fossil fuels, governments across the world have begun to increase funding for renewable energy sources such as solar energy. As a result, it seems realistic to expect subsidies"

(1991) with certain modifications.                                 The assay was performed at 4 °C by adding 0.5 mL of the crude enzyme solution (0.5 ml distilled water in blank group) to 10 mL of 30mM PBS (pH 8.0). The reaction was initiated by adding 5.0 mL of ice-cold CO2 saturated water. The time interval for the pH to drop by 1.5 unit (from 8.0 to 6.5) due to protons released during hydration of CO2 was measured. The reactions were performed in triplicates and average of three replicates was used in calculations.
We calculated the activity according to the formula U= (T0 –T1)/ T0, where T0 and T1 represent time for pH change of blank group and samples group respectively. The CA"

Mr. Rodríguez kindly invited us to present our project with the Cuauhtémoc beekeepers association and commented us about M.C. Alejandro Romo who has done different investigations on the diseases and who we would talk with later in this story.
Getting to know real experiences of the treatment methods used against our interest diseases helped us to better measure the severity of the problem and the obstacles with which beekeepers have to fight to keep their bees’ welfare.

Detailed Description
Key team members related to the development of the mathematical model, human practices, legal management, and wet lab traveled southeast from our city to visit Salcido apiaries in Delicias; a municipality that bases its economy fundamentally on the food industry. Since we arrived with Mr. Ramírez, it was amazing how the discussion flowed and flowed, getting a meeting that end-up lasting approximately 3 hours; all were valuable minutes that taught us many relevant aspects for the development of our project.
First, Mr. Ramírez covered the topic of the importance of bees, emphasizing how they have always been considered an essential factor for environmental health and he even showed us a funny cucumber that had not been correctly pollinated; it was very small and thin.
Bee   diseases   were   our   next   topic.  He  commented  how Foulbrood

If the activity is not seen, then its possible that the sequence or plegation of the protein may be damaged, not because it is not synthesized. Another improvement of this part is a double promoter sequence. The P-LacO promoter was kept for the synthesis of the retrotranscriptase but a T7 promoter was added to the msr-msd segment. The 7 promoter doesn’t produce a protein in the msr-msd sequence but makes it available for transcription factors. Having this double promoter is useful as a double regulation for the synthesis of the retron, which is the final product of this construct. When both promoters are active, it is expected to have a retrotranscriptase and a transcribed segment of msr-msd ready to be used by the retrotranscriptase as a template, in contrast to the previous part, where the whole system was active by just one promoter. The previous part can have interference in the mechanism of structure of proteins, as well as the message to be active for the retrotranscription.
Repression protein for PyeaR: BBa_K27610101
As part of the environmental perspective of our project, the need of an inducible promoter by nitrate ion was needed. The improve part, uses a segment of a reporter construct with GFP ligated to a new segment. The new segment overexpress NsrR protein to inhibit under no presence of nitrate the promoter region. This new segment is regulated by a constitutive promoter, so the overexpression can be achieve. Fluorescence can be later be obtained, once there is the sufficient amount of nitrate to overcome the repression of the NsrR protein.

Working with the iGEM team for the last couple of months has been the most fun and difficult time I have had at the university so far. What I have been doing most this summer was helping the others in their doings, in the wet-lab, a little dry lab and mainly Wiki. I have been jumping around between a lot of tasks and “groups”. I have been doing optimization for protocols and SOPs, plotting in missing details before uploading them to the wiki.

As a student of biomedicine I have a great interest in microbiology and molecular biology in a clinical perspective. My primary efforts have been in the wet-lab, but I have also had PR-related tasks. With a great interest in communication of science, I have also become the key presenter of our group. My motivation for applying for iGEM was to get a lot of “hands on”-experience and the chance to immerse myself into the subject. Throughout the project I have been challenged both professionally and personally but it has been challenges that I would not have been without.

I am currently studying biomedicine on the 5th semester, and when the opportunity to join the iGEM project presented itself, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to find new challenges and gain more experience in the lab. I have mainly been working in the wet-lab, and there I have faced exciting challenges and opportunities that allowed me to put the theoretical knowledge into practice. In addition to the scientific aspect, there is of course the interpersonal relations, which I feel the project encouraged us to expand on.

I have studied Biomedicine for two years just starting on the third. Our project here in iGEM excites me because that all the knowledge I have achieved through my studies has been put to the test. Even through frustration and long nights this summer has been one to remember and if I got the chance, I would gladly do it again!

UTP-Panama,2011,Team:UTP-Panama# Team's Perspective_-_-_TEXT.html,": ""Igem has a human practice part because they want to show to the world that Synbio can be good for humans. Synbio is a new area of study an for this reason people need to know about Synbio. Appart of that in science we help humans.""
Salomon:""Well like Peter´s Parker Uncle Ben should say: “With every great power comes a great responsibility”. I believe science is indeed a great power, so is very important to have something like a human practice dept. to remind us all the great responsibility that we all have in behalf  of this great and only world we have.""
III. CONCLUSION
Our team has reflected that Human Practices is a fundamental part of this revolution called Synthetic Biology, in which we are being a part of it at the iGEM competition. It is necessary that the humanity that we call today society understands the concepts of Synthetic Biology, which is the main goal of this part of the competition, because if all the people involved do not understand how this science could affect them in a positive way, it won't be possible the development of this kind of projects.
In that vein, Human Practices makes possible the constant growth of a strong bridge of communication between the society and Synthetic Biology. This science will take into account, with priority, all the applications and implications that come with it, because of the fact that we are using living parts of the nature to create and recreate new things for the environment that are completely new.
We also think that for the future of the humanity, this science needs to be integral, because we humans are renowned for being rational beings with creativity that we can positively transform our environment and human life.
And of course we cannot fail to mention the fact that this means that our scientists are becoming part of a wonderful new mentality that shows the high degree of awareness and the way of commitment to the development of science.

By calculating the force required to make the incision, this could potentially indicate the size or strength of a possible suspect, while the sliding distance would correspond to the length of the blade. The bone incision experiments allowed us to create a relationship between the applied force, sliding distance and wear volume when a stainless steel knife collides with bone. The results showed that the volume will increase as the length of the blade or the force increases (Fig. 11). However some irregularities were noticed and are likely due to experimental error with the equipment shown in Fig. 12. You can see Hannah demonstrating the method used in our STV appearance .

What next?
Since most of the parameters were assumed in the mathematical models, there is room for error. Practical experiments could be done to produce values for the kinetic parameters or sensitivity analysis to compare varying kinetic parameter values. Probing the concentration range for detecting different chromate salts will be essential to feed back into the modelling which is currently largely based on assumptions. This would ensure that the models are more realistic and therefore give a more valid description of the systems.
Figure 13: Further work would include testing and validation of our methods.
The next step for this project is to find an ideal concentration of ChrB in relation to Pchr-gfp to work in a balance way of expression/repression. This involves finding plasmids with an appropriate copy number and promoters of appropriate strength. The modularity of this system makes this process easier. Once a concentration range has been established, we can test the system by using actual shavings of stainless steel. A problem that might occur is that the chromium contained in the alloy is in the wrong oxidation state. Oxidising chromium to yield Cr(VI) can be done by subjecting it to a strong acid. The solution will have to be neutralised again to be used as an additive for an experiment. The question is then if the concentration is still high enough to induce expression of GFP in our system. Good insights into the amount of steel retained after sharp-force trauma and blunt-force trauma on bones can be found in a series of papers ( 6 , 7 ). Potential contaminants will also be of great importance. Hence testing the system with similar compounds will be one test. Checking for the prevalence of inducing compounds in or around bones is essential to see"

Summary of the project to date
Phase 1: Electro-Transformation of plasmid pNif51142 into E. Coli strains
- 2014
To successfully transform pNif51142, we used Electro-Transformation, also known as Electroporation.  Electroporation provides a method of transforming E. coli to efficiencies greater than are possible with the best chemical methods. By subjecting mixtures of cells and DNA to exponentially decaying fields of very high initial amplitude, we were able to deliver the plasmid into all of E. coli strains that were tested in the project.
Results
According to the gel running and antibiotic testing, bands in the gel and the survival of all strains transformed in antibiotic Kanamycin (there was an cluster of Kanamycin-resistant marker gene in sequence of pNif51142) both prove that the Electro-Transformation was successful.
Phase 2: Determine the optimal conditions for cell survival with plasmid pNif51142 in E. Coli

Due to the oxidative properties of oxygen, most nitrogenases are irreversibly inhibited by dioxygen, which degradatively oxidizes the Fe-S cofactors. This requires mechanisms for nitrogen fixers to protect nitrogenase from oxygen in vivo. Hence in our experiment, we firstly selected anaerobic condition as part of preparation step for the nitrogenase activity testing

Ping-pong bi-bi reaction is a double-displacement reaction. Substrate A bind first to the enzyme followed by product P release. Typically, product P is a fragment of the original substrate A. The rest of the substrate is covalently attached to the enzyme E, which we now designate as F. The second Substrate, B, binds and reacts with enzyme F. Substrate B form a covalent adduct with the covalent fragment of A in the enzyme F to form product Q. The enzyme is finally restored to its initial form, E.
In Ping-pong bi-bi reactions, the mechanism is often written as:
And the equation is:
2.Reactions
Although each domain has its independent function, some reactions are catalyzed by several domains together in the process of polyketide’s synthesis, such as activation of propionyl groups, combination of the extended unit and polyketide chain and so on. Therefore, in analysis of reactions of their mechanism, the introduction will be started from the perspective of the equations of chemical reactions.
(1)Acyl carrier protein, ACP
ACP domain is a carrier. Its function is anchoring the polyketide chains needed to extend. The synthesis of polyketides is engaged on these carriers. The polyketide chains are activated by AT domain, and then are anchored on ACP domains. Until the catalysis of TE domain, polyketide chains are released from ACP domain and become ripe polyketides.
(2)Loading Part
The leading role of the loading part is Acyltransfer-ase, AT domain. In this part, we will introduce the function of AT domain by analyzing the chemical reactions between AT domain, ACP domain and polyketide chains.
The function of AT domain is activating the extended units, propionyl groups which will be combined with the polyketide chains.
In Loading, Proplonyl-CoA reacts with the oxhydryl on the specific binding sites of AT domains and binds to AT domain, and then CoA-SHs are displaced. At this time, proplonyl groups have been activated. They are transferred onto the ACP domains in Loading and anchored there.
In Module 1 or Module 2, AT domains anchor the proplonyl groups of (2S)Methylmalonyl-CoA to the ACP domains in Module 1 or Module 2 by the same mechanism. The propl"

Q8. What’s your opinion on building artificial reefs by synthesis biology methods?
“I’m not familiar with researches on this field, but I’m willing to try if it’s beneficial.”
“Artificial reefs are good to the environment, but how to apply biology technology on it?”
“The existing reefs are built by concrete, how could your method help in the construction? Is the strain good or bad to marine ecology? It generates CO2, wouldn’t that damage the environment? ”
“I think that the key point is not how to build the artificial reefs but how to manage the existing ones.”
“How would you apply this technology? Cooperate with scientific research institutions? Or cooperate with government?”
“Wouldn’t it cause soil compaction and damage the ecology?”
“I would support it if it brings economic benefits. But now I know nothing about it.”
3. Results and Discussions
In general, both questionnaires and interviews showed that the condition at Zhoushan Fishery was not optimistic.
The overall answer distribution is showed in Figure 1.
Figure 1:The questionnaire results in general(“NULL” is also a choice taken into consideration)
Figure 2:  The result after removing all null answers. The answer of some questions shows obvious unify.
Figure 3: Other result of those choosing negative choice in Q4. As you can see,“NULL” appears in many groups.
Figure 4: Other result of those choosing positive choice in Q4.Then, ”NULL” disappeared.
We also found that many respondents had little knowledge about ecological restoration measurements, thus gave ambiguous answers to certain questions, which caused incomplete and biased results for our analyzing (Figure 3). Therefore, we took out distracting feedbacks according to the answer of Q4, and got a relatively clear result (Figure 4).
Q1 and Q3 analysis
We can see from figure 1&2 that the answers towards Q1 and Q3 are convergent:
Q1. Do you feel that the output of Zhoushan Fishery is decreasing in recent years? Yes
Q3. Do you think that Zhoushan Fishery has overfishing problem? Yes, the problem is very serious.
Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that most fishermen agreed that the Fishery was under bad management.
Q6 analysis
Q6. What’s your opinion on government’s restrictions on fishing tools, methods and time? I understand the necessity. But it’s hard"

The Erusian Meetup
On July the 24th, 25th and 26th, we attended the Erusian meetup hosted by TU Delft and BGI college iGEM teams. This was a great opportunity for us to present our project to others. We delivered a formal presentation, and explained our project at poster sessions. We were also able to find out more about other teams’ projects and their work.
We were able to set up links with some of the teams there which led to some of our collaborations. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams with more experience and get advice on things like poster design or presentation skills.

GreatBay_China is another high school team in Shenzhen, China. We met first on WeChat and then we co-hosted a meetup .(see the link about the meetup:  https://2018.igem.org/Teams/Meetups#ShenzhenHS )
They also mention us on their page!: 2018.igem.org/Team:GreatBay_China/Collaborations
What we did for them:
We discussed both wiki development and modeling, giving them lots of advice and actionable tips. We later gave them some advise on human practices. We co-hosted the Shenzhen highschool meetup.
What they did for us:
Their advisor gave us advice on how to picking the topic. They also helped us on some fundraising issue and procedure problems. Their teacher gave us advice on how we can examine the results of our projects and point out some potential flaws in our project design which we later worked on to improve.

Introduction
Unlike proteins, nonribosomal peptides are not synthesized through translation, but rather through sequential condensation of amino acids by large multimodular enzymes, called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS)[1,8]. It is this complex pattern of condensation of amino acids that attributes to the biological activity of nonribosomal peptides (NRP). NRP synthetases do not rely on an external template for synthesis of their products. They can be divided up into modules that are each responsible for incorporating one additional amino acid onto the growing peptide chain, much like an assembly line (Figure 2) [9]. At the end of the assembly line, the growing peptide is released as a linear or cyclic peptide. 
Figure 2. NRPS are highly modular. Tyrocidine Synthetase (tycA-C) consists of ten modules, two epimerization domains, and a thioesterase (TE) domain. Tyrocidine precursors are assembled one-by-one in an assembly line manner. The TE domain cyclizes the tyrocidine upon releasing it from the NRPS.
Each module, with the exception of the initiation module, consists of at least three domains. These domains are responsible for activating the monomer (adenylation (A) domain), holding the activated monomer (peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain), and amino acid condensation (condensation (C) domain). The C-domain is lacking in the initiation module and the terminal module contains an additional required domain responsible for termination and release of the product called the thioesterase (TE) domain [8].
Adenylation domains
The adenylation domains are responsible for activating and attaching the amino acid monomers to the PCP domain. They act as gatekeepers, ensuring that only the desired monomers are incorporated. They may be highly specific and only bind a single amino acid, or as in the case with Tyrocidine, (see below) allow multiple similar amino acids to be incorporated in the peptide [2]. 
Peptidyl carrier protein domains
The monomers are covalently bound to the PCP domains through thioester bonds. Before they can accept the monomers, they must be activated by posttranslational modification. A 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTase) transfers a 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-PP) moiety, carrying the sulfhy"

(iii) The pore enables a component(s) of  the T3SS  to sense  the elevated pH of the  host  cell  cytosol,  and  a  signal  is  transduced  to  the  SsaL/SsaM/SsaB  complex, which dissociates. (iv) Relief of effector secretion suppression enables their translocation [10] .
   As mentioned before the T3SS encoded in SPI-2 naturally function inside of the phagosome of the target cell [8] . So, it requires acidic pH to be assembled functionally [7] . However, if the T3 apparatus is assembled successfully under low pH(pH=5.0) condition, only the translocator proteins are secreted through T3SS but effector proteins are not. And it was reported in 2010 that the translocator complex assembles a pore on the phagosome membrane of the host cell enabling the T3SS to sense the neutral pH condition of the cytosol, and this pH elevation switches the function of the T3SS to start secretion of effectors (Fig.6) [10] . In addition we found that initial growth in MgM7 before the growth in MgM5 improve the production of GFP fusion protein in E. coli (data not shown). So, 10 hrs before exposure we transferred E. coli [SPI-2+GFP-T3signal+RFP] overnight culture from LB + arabinose to MgM7 + arabinose and grow for 4 hrs to charge sufficient amount of GFP fusion protein. 5.5 hrs before exposure, bacteria were transferred to MgM5 + arabinose and grow for 4 hrs to assemble T3 secretion apparatus. 1 hr before exposure, bacteria were washed with RPMI5 three times to remove toxin secreted from E. coli. Then it was resuspended diluted with RPMI5 + arabinmose (final ΔOD = 0.06 at 600 nm). On the other hand RK13 cells were seeded on 6-well plate (2x 10<sup5</sup> cells/well) in antibiotics free RPMI7 at 20 hrs before exposure to the E. coli. When the preparation is completed cell culture medium was replaced with 1 mL of the E. coli suspension (ΔOD = 0.06 at"

Those BioBricks will help future iGEM team working with XylR to better characterize this part as they would be able to quantify and purify it.
In the same way of monitoring XylR synthesis, we designed XylR coding device with mRFP. This device is composed of Pr-RBS-XylR-RBS-mRFP-Terminator. It permits us to prove that the XylR is synthesized: colonies becomes red thanks to the mRFP.

Verification of homologous recombination via colony PCR
Co-culture of E.coli and G.xylinus
Second, we found a strong promoter -J23119, linked it with the PGM, at the same time                                 linked it with c-di-GMP which is a signal molecule could improve the yield of cellulose                                 synthase.
The results show that the yield of BC was not significantly increased, but the yield is increased compared to PPGM-PGM-331 plasmid, specially  J23119-c-di-GMP.
We acquire gene sequence J23119 and complete its linking with PGM and c-di-GMP
We insert gene segments into plasmid pSEVA331 and transform it into chemically-competent E.coli.

Third, due to G.xylinus is co-cultured with E.coli in the environment of pH=5 as we                                 designed, we also try to linked PGM with the acid-controlled promoter PAsr, and linked                                 c-di-GMP with PAsr. We explore and compare the effects of overexpressing PGM and                                 c-di-GMP on the yield of BC in the environment of co-culture and pH=5. At the same                                 time,the effect of it and pH-responsive promoter PAsr on BC production will be                                 compared.
The results showed that the yield of BC was further improved than that of the second step, especially when PAsr was connected with c-di-GMP, and the yield of BC was significantly improved under mixed culture.

Step 6, (Figure 1(f)), is the production of a BioBrick sequence from the produced model produced in step 3. Newcastle University is currently researching such a model-to-sequence conversion algorithm. This step would make use of the GetVPSequence and GetSites workflows, to retrieve physical part sequences and check them for specified restriction sites.

Club
Synthetic Biology club were established in The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University by team numbers Weihang Guo and Haoyu Zhou. In the first club time, we presented our program and introduced the history and purpose of synthetic biology. After that, they showed their enthusiasm about synthetic biology and also were eager to participate into next year’s IGEM competition.
In order to let club members acquiring academic knowledge about synthetic biology and enjoying their study time, we asked for our instructor Ni’s suggestion to arrange curricular hours as well as experiments. Till now, we have taught about basic instruments in laboratory as well as the overall process about how to edit plasmid, including restriction enzyme, DNA polymerase and PCR. About experiments, after the training of laboratory safety, we instructed club numbers how to use pipettes and centrifuge. With the supervision and assistance of instructor Ni, club members made LB culture medium by themselves and coated the plated using E.coli.
About future activity, we plan to teach basic knowledge to all club members as soon as possible and then focus 2018 IGEM experiments.
Fig1. This group photo was taken on Oct. 19th. In that class, we were talking about lab safety and how to use pipette and centrifuge.
Questionary Intro
Gut inflammation is a disease that infects a large number of people, and the public’s opinion and experience is important to our project. We therefore conducted a survey to gather information about people’s diets, opinions on probiotic treatments, and methods used in inflammation testing. This survey was conducted both online (via WeChat) and off-line (paper survey) in the Tsinghua Campus. In the end, we gathered and analyzed the answers from a total of 467 people.
Result
General information
Among the survey population there were more females (59%) than males (41%), but not in an unacceptable disequilibrium. The largest age group was the respondents under-eighteen (128) followed byrespondents between 41 and 50 (162). A large proportion of the survey respondents preferred light (40%) or spicy food (36%), while a smaller proportion liked fatty food (17%), and a still smaller proportion liked other kinds of taste. This result can be considered as reasonably representative of Asian (Chinese) people’s taste preferences.

Eindhoven
Team Eindhoven can be seen as our main collaborator as they are the team we had the most contact with. We were informed by our iGEM contact that they worked on a project similar to our LLPS approach to metabolic channeling. Their project called GUPPI uses the concept of membraneless organelles to form a gel like structure which could be used in various applications. This was exciting news for us since they concentrated way more on the detailed properties of the droplet forming proteins.
They agreed to a first skype call during which we had a very informative and interesting exchange about our projects. Our teams agreed to a mutual collaboration by helping each other out with problems and talking about overall experiences we had during the projects. The main talking points were Human practices approaches and ideas how to efficiently explain their project to the public. They helped our wiki team getting started by providing HTML and CSS literature. We also set them up with a contact regarding the modelling of their project.
At the end of summer, we kept in contact and had further skype calls and the collaboration continued by them helping us in a crucial part of the iGEM medal requirements with simulating and modelling our LLPS system. This gave us a better and more detailed understanding of the inner workings of our project. General communication continued in the form of regular skype conferences. Furthermore, our wiki teams kept in contact and provided feedback for each other’s wikis. We also agreed to help each other during the Giant Jamboree by listening to each other’s project presentations before the main Giant Jamboree talk.

Human Practices
This year, as we worked on our project, we also considered what sort of effects our final diagnostic product would have besides on the horseshoe crab population. Upon further research, we discovered a few different assays that worked in a similar fashion to ours, however, most of the assays use equipment that is both expensive and highly-inaccessible. We decided to make our assay a simple, user-friendly tool in order to increase its accessibility. Once we completed this, we wondered how it would affect and if it would even be applicable to our larger society. We decided to contact the Ugandan iGEM team to learn if our diagnostic tool would provide a useful additional tool in regions that don't have the same access to resources in order to provide the best of healthcare, and if having an easy diagnostic tool would reduce the cost of the importation of the endotoxin test.
The following questionnaire was prepared by Bio Without Borders concerning their project and sent to iGEM Makerere University Team to help collect data concerning the questions provided in. The questionnaire was presented to field veterinary practitioners among them there is a professor of Pathology and these were their answers concerning the questionnaire.
Question.1. Do you use injectable drugs in your medical Practice?
YES.
Question 2. Are the injectable drugs/ medicine sourced locally in Africa or imported from other areas of the world?
Imported and locally sourced.
Question 3. Have you ever had a problem with an injectable that was contaminated?
Not sure.
Question 4. Would a simple and inexpensive quality control test for endotoxin contamination in injectable formulations be useful either for your practice or for enabling the manufacturing of injectable drugs locally?
YES. Since we are not sure if these injectable drugs are always contaminated with endotoxins or not it will be a good idea to test them to enable us have a better stand and better the lives of animals and people.

I am a recent graduate of METU Molecular Biology and Genetics       department and now studying towards my masters degree on Molecular       Bioengineering at METU. My interest in synthetic biology did       start during my undergraduate years and after graduation I started       up the Sentegen company which is the first biotechnology based       company focused on synthetic biology in Turkey. I continue my       research and training in synthetic biology while also contributing       to the development of the field in my country. We need new scientific       revolutions to solve huge problems of life and emerging field       of synthetic biology is best candidate for biotechnological       revolution. I am interested in synthetic biology applications,       along with Lab-on-a-Chip devices for molecular biology techniques,       and we are designing gene synthesis chips to produce biobricks       - raw materials of synthetic garage biology- faster and cheaper.       I enjoy snowboarding, cycling and write poems.

Biotechnological High School Albstadt-Ebingen and Abi Startschuss 2017
Human practices is a big part of iGEM.                Our mission is to explain people what we want to reach with our project and what synthetic biology actually means.                A lot of people are still afraid when they hear about genetic engineering and genetically modified products, due to unlucky inccidences that are related to this topic.                By spreading out our knowledge we want to make sure that people get educated in this field to build up their opinion without prejudices in the future.               As we know that education starts with young people and the next generations will be responsible for our future we aimed to go to schools and education exhibitions to start with our outreach work here.                For this we are going to visit the Biotechnological Gymnasium (High School) Albstadt and the Abi-Startschuss Messe in Stuttgart. Our focus is to explain kids what synthetic biology provides for the future and how many interesting and diverse career opportunities they are in this field.                We want to explain about iGEM the competition itself and the chance what it means to work as a team on a completely autonomous scientific project.
Lab Supply Exhibition 2017 in Münster
We also realized that outreach goes hand in hand with our fundraising work.  To convince people to sponsor our project we have to indicate the people and explain them why it would be worth it to finance the eco-friendly tube cleaner.  Therefore we made a big tour from south to north Germany and visited the Lab Supply Exhibition 2017 in Münster.  Four of our team got familiar with the different exhibitors that participated at this day.  It was a great exchange of knowledge as we not only got the chance to introduce our project to the different companies, but also to get informed what is recently on the market to equip a good laboratory.  It was the first time for us to get the chance to visit Münster and we were happy to get a sneak peak of the city after a successful outreach day.
"
NYU_Gallatin,2012,Team:NYU Gallatin#Project#Cloning#Primers_-_-_TEXT.html," the end the new nucleotides will be added to as the piece of DNA is synthesized. You need approximately 20 base pairs of your target sequence on the 3' END. Ideally, the very last nucleotide region is gc-rich, as these have 3 hydrogen bonds instead of the 2 that A-T pairs have, and this will decrease nonspecific amplification.
However, the 5' primer end does not have to match the target sequence, and this is what comes in handy when designing these gibson-assembly primers. The 5' sequence can be completely different, and in fact, what we WANT is for the homology to be to a DIFFERENT sequence - the sequence preceding the target sequence in the final plasmid product. This will facilitate the ends being ""sticky"" for each other when incubated with the exonuclease.
These extra ends can be upwards of 60-100 bases long - however, remember that each base costs money, so it's a balance between ensuring you will get the desired final product and cost/efficiency. We need 40 base pairs at the 5' end that will be homologous to the next sequence, in order to facilitate gibson assembly. Incorporating the ribosome binding sites may or may not count as homologous sequence, depending on how the DNA pieces are amplified. (This becomes simpler when drawn out, so try using different colors for gene1, gene2, the ribosome binding site, the plasmid backbone. Draw the primers and the amplified products using these colors. It really does help to clarify the cloning scheme.)
This can all be a bit confusing, so refer to the website I linked, and to the image I attached. The image I attached is the scheme for designing the primers for our plasmid (I'll detail this more below).
First up: how to design a primer
When designing a primer, you need to remember that sequence is added 5' --> 3'. Thus, the forward primer is easy to design; in the above sequence, it would be:
5' ATGnnnaaannnccc 3'
But the complementary sequence is also generated 5' --> 3'. And when we order primers, the company requires they be written in the direction of synthesis, so instead of writing:
3' tttnnngggnnnATT 5'
we have to write
5' TTAnnngggnnnttt 3'
This is the reverse of the complement sequence (in reference to the ORF of our genes). The sequence"
BHU_China,2016,Team:BHU China#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

UT-Tokyo,2010,Team:UT-Tokyo#Consideration_-_-_TEXT.html,"・iGEM Summer Meetup in Japan (in Kyoto)
6 teams in Japan met in Kyoto University in order to practice presentation in English.
・iGEM Summer Meetup in Tokyo
UT-Tokyo asked Tokyo-Tech for cooperation to hold it. 5 teams near Tokyo met there. We hosted it for the purpose of the activity with teams that could not join the above.
・Questionnaire
5 teams in Japan, mainly Kyoto University, worked it. (In part, UT-Tokyo did by itself.) The purpose is to find statistically the relationship between an image of biology and one’s background, collecting answers from lots of people.
・Made a poster presentation in BioEXPO
UT-Tokyo and TMU made a poster presentation together in the exhibition for bioscience companies and laboratories. (Osaka University helped partly.)
Safety
Our whole project is executed only in laboratory. Especially, the assay of MS2 virus is done only in clean bench.
The parts we used including MS2 phage don't raise any issues because MS2 virus is not infectious to human or have toxicity. MS2 virus is infectious to E.coli but there is a lot of E.coli infected by MS2 virus outside laboratory and the function of our E.coli is not hazardous if one or several bioparts change their function or stop working as intended.
We have concluded that the method of containment the applicant  implemented fulfills the safety requirements we have set forth.  The applicant possesses the ability to practice laboratory safety,  and the relevant equipment abides to Japanese law.

In vitro reconstruction of caffeine biosynthesis pathway after dialysis: chloroform extraction
Investigator: Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the extraction of potential reaction products, to be able to start a LCMS analysis in order to detect the synthesized caffeine.
Operational sequence:
We added 1 ml of chloroform to the 100µl reaction batches, mixed a few seconds and stored the tubes for about 30 min at room temperature, to get a proper phase- separation. Afterwards, the lower phase (chloroform) was pipetted in tubes (glass tubes would have been better than plastic tubes) (1ml) and incubated for about 60 min at 60°C (=drying) until total chloroform removal.
The tubes were then stored at -80°C over night until further usage (LCMS)
In vitro reconstruction of caffeine biosynthesis pathway after dialysis: LCMS analysis of extracted compounds
Investigator: Ingmar
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the detection of the chemical compounds, having been extracted of the reaction batch of our enzyme assay. We hoped to detect the metabolits 7- methylxanthine, theobromine (3,7- dimethylxanthine) and caffeine (1,3,7- trimethylxanthine).
Operational sequence:
First of all, the dried extract was solved in 200 µl of 70% methanol, mixed and than transferred into small glass tubes (LCMS tubes) and applied to the LCMS machine.
