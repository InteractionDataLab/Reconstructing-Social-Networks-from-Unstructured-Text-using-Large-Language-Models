1. Introduction
Fig. 2-3-1. E. ninja turns to farming.
In our story, E. ninja retires from being an undercover warrior, and turns to farming (Fig. 2-3-1).  Our improved part for phosphate sensor and a new part for cytokinin synthesis will lead us to our goal, which is to create ""Farmer E. coli"" that could increase plant growth by synthesizing several plant hormones depending on the soil environment.  As for sensing soil nutrients, we focused on phosphate and nitrate because these are known to be especially important for plants.  When nutrient levels are low, plants are in danger of withering.  Therefore, we are proposing E. coli to produce the plant hormone ""auxin,"" which promotes the growth of plants' roots.  Also, when the soil is rich in nutrients, plants can grow quickly.  Therefore, we want to make E. coli produce the plant hormone ""cytokinin,"" which promotes the growth of plants' shoots (Fig. 2-3-2).
Fig. 2-3-2. Our goal to create ""Farmer E. coli""
Our ""Farmer E. coli"" can be implemented by combining our improved phosphate sensor part ( BBa_ K1139201 ), our newly constructed cytokinin production part and two pre-existing parts which are the nitrate sensor part (Edinburgh 2009"
NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"% of GDP [3]. Indonesia has a similar economic situation with export revenues of 18.90 billion USD. To replace this high quantity of income from somewhere else would be a difficult challenge [1]. During the last years, companies have established awareness for their influence on the environment and the founding of biosynthetic palm kernel oil would be an additional risk factor for the palm oil industry.
The outcome of our project may also have the ability to influence the circumstances of the plantation workers. The launch of biosynthetic palm kernel oil may lead to job reductions in the Indonesian and Malaysian palm (kernel) oil industry. Over millions of people from these two countries are dependent on this industry for their living. For this reasons it is important to perceive the possible impact of a biosynthetic palm kernel oil on every conceivable sectors in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia where the palm oil industry plays a significant role.
Long-Term Implications
If the launch of biosynthetic palm kernel oil will occur, countries with a large palm oil industry like Malaysia and Indonesia may struggle to manage the impacts that this project could exact them.
One important question is, how easy it would be to change the crop type after the land was used for palm oil prior or the industry in general. Several studies proved negative impacts on the soil under oil palm plantations. For instance, there are variations in the soil resulting from oil palm trees planted on the soil over years and experiments shown a remarkable influence on soil chemical properties like Nitrogen, Phosphate, Potassium, Calcium and Magnesium status. As a matter of fact, intensive cultivation of oil palms leads to intensive soil degradation and lower the soil fertility status. For this reasons, changing crop type is not that easy, because every crop type needs specific requirements of nutrients, which are very low after the soil is used for oil palm plantations [14,15].
CURRENT PRODUCTION AND THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
In recent years the general public has become very aware of the disastrous environmental impact of palm oil and palm kernel oil production (survey LINK), as it has often been criticized by NGOs and in the food industry, the label “palm oil free” is used for marketing. This was also our main reason to choose the production of a synthetic alternative to palm kernel oil as our project. One of the first steps for our Human Practice work was to research the ecological problems within the current palm (kernel) oil industry, because this allows us to better assess the positive effects our project might have.
Impacts on Environment
Deforestation
To clear the land for oil palms, rainforest often gets burned. Thereby,"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," agreed to help the JS_S team with protein extraction using SDS-PAGE. To spare our workload, the JS_S team had also agreed to help us with Gibson Assembly. The result of SDS-PAGE done by our team for collaboration had shown to be successful. Reference can be found from the HKJS_S team’s wiki here

Copper is an essential element to be added to the laccase module to enhance the efficiency of the laccase enzyme. However, copper ions might be added in excess if our MFC are supposed to be maintained by the potential users. This might be toxic to our Shewanella or might even pose hazards to the environment if any accidental release occurs. We therefore aimed to find any collaboration on potential safeguard mechanism to be implemented to our laccase module as a solution to this concern.
Team Hong Kong JSS project focuses on engineering bacteria to absorb accumulated copper in aquaponics and we therefore arranged for a meetup in their school to learn more about each other’s project and discuss the possibilities to integrate their design to help absorb our excess copper. In exchange, we will provide them with modelling guidance.
However, the collaboration is unsuccessful in the end due to our obstacles in cloning for the laccase protein and therefore could not achieve any characterization data to support the needs of absorbing excess copper.
Team SCUT_ChinaA and SCUT_ChinaB
Date: 27 July 2018
Upon discovering that the SCUT China team B was working on PET plastic degradation, a small meetup was organised by the HKUST team during summer for exchange of ideas in project and experimental design with the 2 teams of SCUT China. Issues such as the ratio of enzyme subunits, surfactant to enhance the attachment of enzymes to the plastic surface for better degradation reaction were discussed. However, we could not identify any possible collaboration on system design and therefore this meetup was just used as a share of experimental insights.
Throughout the summer, we have also attended the following meetups organised by our fellow iGEM teams in attempts for project sharing and discussions :

Methods for Producing Recombinant Silk Films
Dialyzing silk to remove ions and prepare for lyophilization
Following recombinant protein expression and purification, the solution contains many ions and other molecules, which are easily removed by dialysis. We dialyzed the solution in a SnakeSkin tube with 3.5 kDa MWCO against 5mM ammonium bicarbonate for 24 hours with 2 total bath changes. Dialyzing against ammonium bicarbonate also prepares the solution for lyophilization, as ammonium bicarbonate facilitates the sublimation of water in the lyophilizer.[5]
Lyophilization
We froze the dialyzed silk solution using liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized the frozen sample in a LabConco FreeZone 4.5-105. Lyophilization allows us to recover all of the protein that was purified, which is around 5 to 8 mg from 1 L of recombinant cell culture.
The lyophilized silk can be seen on the walls of the tube. In this form, the silk is pure and without any solvent.
Dissolving in HFIP
Very few solvents are capable of dissolving pure silk. HFIP, a highly polar organic solvent, is one of them.[1] We dissolved our recombinant silk in HFIP to obtain a dilute silk dope of 5% w/v (50 mg/mL).
Casting films and water annealing
We pipetted 100 uL of silk dope into a small weigh boat and let it dry in a fume hood for 24 hours. We then removed the film from the weigh boat and placed it into a vacuum desiccator along with water in a separate container. Vacuum was then applied to the desiccator, and the film was allowed to anneal for 24 hours. The water annealing process encourages further formation of the silk's secondary structure, giving the film stability in aqueous environments as well as added strength.[4]
Measuring thickness of the film
A Vernier micrometer was used to measure the thickness of the film.
Mechanical testing
Just as with the fibers, strips of the fiber were mounted onto cardstock frames with 10mm gauge lengths. The mounted strips were then loaded into the Instron for testing.

The construct is part of a two-plasmid knockout system published by Jiang et al . This part, the pTargetT, contains the sgRNA to target the glgP coding sequence. Additionally, the construct consists of a repair template with two 400 bp homology arms for homology-directed repair. To succesfully knock out the glgP, you need a second plasmid, pCas. It contains the pCas gene as well as a temperature-sensitive repA101ts ori. To increase recombination efficiency in E. coli, it also expresses lambda-Red genes behind an inducible arabinose-promoter. Upon induction with IPTG, a sgRNA is transcribed to cut the pMB1 ori of the pTargetT. After cloning both the targeting plasmid and the pCas plasmid in BL21 Gold (DE3) and inducing with arabinose, the Cas9 gene is expressed. Guided by the sgRNA, it cleaves the double strand at the beginning of the glgX gene. The succesful genome editing could be verified by sequencing.
Sequencings of the respective genomic region have shown that glgP was successfully cut out.  In further experiments, the effect of this gene knockout was characterized. The expected consequence was an accumulation of glycogen due to the absense of a glycogen phosphorylase degrading α-1,4-linked glucose. We confirmed this by iodine staining with Lugol's iodine, which dyes glycogen in a brown color. If more glycogen is present, the color of stainend cultures is darker. In the picture below, the BL21 Gold (DE3) ∆glgP strain is much darker than the wild type.
glgP gene knockout
The knockout was achieved cutting out most of the coding sequence of glgP, thereby inserting a short coding sequence that contains multiple stop codons in both frames.
Iodine staining of BL21 Gold (DE3) glgP knockout compared to BL21 Gold (DE3) wild type
Iodine staining was performed with overnight cultures in M9 medium which were adjusted to the same OD. The darker color of the glgP knockout strain shows that more glycogen is present. Thus, the effectivity of the targeting plasmid is shown.

Cloning of N-CPPs into pSB1C3
Since we realized that the method we used for cloning the N-CPPs can cause also the intervening sequences to insert into pSB1C3, I decided to redo some clonings. Since the intervening sequences were designed with unique restriction sites, digestion with these endonucleases should prevent cloning of these.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html,".0 at A600 was achieved. We made several replicates of these cultures and generated a reference curve involving change in absorbance reading as a function of 1% xylose added. This way, future cultures can be diluted more efficiently.
Finally, our team was happy to receive the B. subtilis parts we ordered from iGEM HQ. These were in the form of a liquid culture, so we incubated them shortly after. We also received the custom primers we requested from the University of Calgary synthesis lab the week prior. These were diluted immediately and stored safely for future use. Now that we have the B. subtilis parts, the custom primers, and ample B. subtilis glycerol stocks, we will transform our B. subtilis with the Detective team’s genetic circuit as soon as possible.
Week 8: June 16 - 20
By the beginning of this week, we had in our possession a sufficient supply of B. subtilis integration vectors (SacA, thrC, amyE) and began tinkering with them. However, the iGEM registry stated that the integration vectors needed to be linearized with the ScaI restriction enzyme before any transformations could take place. Upon a closer look at the ScaI enzyme, we soon discovered that it had two cut sites, although we required only one. We carried out restriction digests on our vectors of interest to confirm that ScaI cuts them only once and refrains from cutting in unwanted places. The restriction digest of our SacA vector met our expectations, but we decided to conduct a second set of digests for the other vectors.
Our team also continued with the ligations from last week, attempting to combine GFP with the Pveg+RBS ligation product we had created earlier. Both the first and second attempts failed, but we decided to try a third time towards the end of the week. Samples of DNA from previous weeks were also sent to the sequencing centre and the results came in quickly.
We prepared for the transformation of B. subtilis - a major milestone of our project - by preparing M9 minimal media, inducing supercompetency in our B. subtilis, and linearizing the integration vectors. With our B. subtilis colonies almost ready to be transformed, we worked together to gather as quickly as possible the parts necessary to build our reporter system (i.e., the genetic circuit). Although we were busy in the lab this week, we also kept the community outreach portion of our project in mind and began preparations for our next event; painting with fluorescent"

In the procedure of modern industrial fermentation, the tiny fluctuation of pH will tremendously influence the physiological function of bacteria. For example, it will affect the growth activity of cells and subsequently decrease the yield of desired production. People usually solve this problem by adding alkali or acid straightly into the bacteria solution and keep an immobilized pH in a narrow range. Our project will show you a completely new idea about how to create a suitable environment and keep the intracellular pH homeostasis for the engineered bacteria by themselves.
The main application field of our project will be the industrial fermentation. The products from industrial fermentation are widely used in our daily life. A large proportion of food and medicine come from this field. So, the safety of our project is of vital importance and it’s our duty to explain any questions concerning safety.
If you ask us whether our project is safe or not, we will say yes and it won’t do any harm to humans and the environment. The main reason is that we don’t use anything dangerous in our whole project, from the sequences of our genes to the chassis we used. For the acid and alkali producing genes, we have built a simple library to avoid producing something harmful. In the future, we are willing to expand the range of the chassis, like the Pichia pastoris which is a recognized safe chassis."

APPLICATIONS
Human Practices highlight the impacts that a project could have on humans and the world around them. These impacts can be economic, social, environmental as well as medical. They can be beneficial or harmful.
Our project, as a foundational advance, aims to transcend disciplines. It has the advantage of being able to affect many applications, specially quorum sensing applications as, for instance, biosensing [1] and distributed logic gates [2]. Of course, depending on the spatio-temporal context, the possible applications of our project may raise ethical and legal issues.
We will, in this part, show that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages which, in turn, can be overcome.
Laboratory aspects
As part of the Human practices project, we were interested in how to apply our system to an existing research project. To do so, we have received valuable advice from researchers in the field of synthetic biology and microbiology.
CO-CULTURES
After our meeting with V. DÖRING, we have wondered if we would be able to apply our PEPTalk system to their GM3 machine.
The small disadvantage we found in this machine is that we can only grow simple cultures, and all research projects using this machine are focused on simple cultures. We are developing a system that is able to make co-cultures possible and stable. So we asked Mr. Volker DÖRING, project manager, and Ivan DUBOIS, GM3 engineer, to tell us if it was possible to link our two tools. The farm team told us that our system can be applicable to GM3.
Besides the fact that we have to take into account a lot of culturing parameters that are quite restrictive when we talk about co-cultures such as the compatibility of our strains in terms of nutrient medium, temperature but also interactions between them. Our system can be a serious asset in the study of mutations. The GM3 is a perfect tool to study these mutations because it allows us to study them over long generation times, monitoring the time of evolution of our modified strains. Mr DÖRING suggested that we focus on the rest of our tests at this point.
If we are able to bring co-cultures to GM3, we are sure to pave the way for many interesting research topics around co-cultures.
LOGIC GATES
During the interview, J. BONNET helped us to find some applications that our PEPTalk system could improve and optimize.
A first application would be to give to each species of bacteria in the coculture a different peptide"

Fig.1 Differences between induced and uninduced ccdB broth.
Visible difference can be seen between non-induced and the induced ccdB, so we can qualitatively conclude the ccdB works as expected.
Since miniColicin was hard to construct, we changed our order several times and obtained a plasmid with missing RBS and an extra integration mutation behind the start codon, so we perform the characterization exam quite roughly.

But still, the ccdB broth has left in the well for 2 days long, and miniColicin had stayed in for 1 day, the well with IPTG added showed visible clearness, which also indicates it is functional as a lethal gene.

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", in the biorefineries’ ultimate embodiment, Synechocystis and E. coli would simply live together in the same compartment. Although straightforward, there are downsides to this approach: most significantly, each species has its own specific preferences with regards to its optimal environment for growth happiness. Combining both species in the same medium likely results in a suboptimal environment for both (e.g. light blocking by E. coli in the vicinity of Synechocystis). Since the E. coli growth rate and its final product titer will be a direct function of the carbon compound secreted by Synechocystis, such suboptimal conditions would be an impediment to productivity. As an alternative, Atsumi suggested a two-compartment system, one in which Synechocystis and E. coli grow in separate, optimized media. These are then connected via a semipermeable membrane filter and a pump that transfers the acetate-containing media of Synechocystis to the E. coli-containing compartment. This approach would allow for carefully controlled optimization of growth parameters for each species, without light-blocking inhibition otherwise induced by E. coli’s presence near Synechocystis.  These considerations reflect the important choices that must be made when it comes to constructing the actual biorefinery. Nevertheless, they are based on the concept of a simple land-based based biorefinery that consists out of relatively simple vessels. Depending on the type and location of application though, the actual biorefinery variations might be even more diverse, as the below scenarios illustrate."

Imperial_College_London,2010,Team:Imperial College London#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html," system to create a simple bio-TV. However the project would have been too similar to the original project so we dropped it quite early through our project development process.
Rhyzobium bacteria
We considered engineering Rhyzobium bacteria to fix nitrogen in larger quantities so they could be used more easily as fertilizer. Furthermore, but almost more importantly, we wanted to manipulate them to interact with a greater number of plant species, as to enhance the range of crops that could benefit from our project. However this would have been a very complex process that would probably not have fit into the time and labour constraints of an iGEM project.
Logic gates
Extending the logic gate concept developed in previous iGEM competitions, we considered whether a cell could have its logical state altered by an external input, for example frequency or intensity of light. This would in effect create a biological multiplexer with every input being a different logic gate, and the multiplexer stage being defined by a third input.
Rapid response system
Another idea that continued to keep our attention was the concept of a fast response. Most products of synthetic biology require a long time for gene expression until an output such as a pigment can be seen. We considered many different approaches, basically all involving an input to stimulate a two component system. The signal transducer was to activate a previously inactive enzyme and act on a substrate. The substrate was either to be colourless and only become visible after the enzyme acted on it, or be concentrated, such as a tight chain of pigments, that are than cleaved apart to colour the whole cell.  We later settled for a more simplified, yet still highly efficient variant of this system to make our sensor more robust.
Fv-fragment guided input module
In order to detect molecules for which no natural receptor exists, we considered using antibody based receptors, either fused to the signal transduction portions of bacterial receptors, or by introducing the whole Fc-binding receptor of the mammalian immune system into bacteria and combining it with whole antibodies. However antibodies are complex, glycosylated proteins that cannot be expressed by bacteria easily and supplying antibodies to each detection kit would be very expensive. Furthermore introducing genes essential to the human immune system into bacteria, such as E. coli was considered a very risky idea and the human practices side of our project would be weakened.
The Story behind the fast response module..
An initial idea during the brainstorming sessions was to engineer a system which responded to an [unidentified] input and resulted in an instantaneous colour response. This was hoped to be in the form in pigment production. We envisioned explosions of pigments similar"

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production"

We were also able to learn more about their microfluidics systems, for example their take on volume dispensing on a chip. Although we were not able to integrate their system into our existing workflow, it offered an alternative method of metering using external systems. During the call the possibility of integrating multiple flow layers into our chips was discussed in detail. While we are not equipped to create multi-layer chips at this time, we are excited to explore this area in microfluidics further in the near future.
Fraunhofer
During the last weeks of summer, we had the opportunity to tour the Fraunhofer Center for Manufacturing Innovation located on BU’s campus. Through this tour we were able to better understand how they approached designing and implementing microfluidic technology for research purposes, and how this translated to mass manufacturing. We were able to see chips housed on-site such as  a rapid diagnostics chip for septicemia and a PCR chip being designed for mass scale manufacturing.
Over the course of the tour we were able to discuss their goal of moving research into mass manufacturing and industry, as well as what types of barriers need to be overcome in order to do so. Many of the points they covered, such as lack of documentation, high levels of specialization and lack of standardized manufacturing, were all barriers we have been looking to overcome. Although we were interested in solving similar issues, our workflow would not necessarily impact the microfluidic fabrication industry directly. Our workflow would have an impact, however, through allowing synthetic biologists to:
Rapidly replicate and prototype chips designs
Easily, quickly and cheaply produce iterations without reaching out to industry manufacturing
Keep standardized design files and documentation to pass on to companies for mass manufacturing
Blacktrace - Dolomite
Blacktrace are a company involved with designing and manufacturing modular microfluidics for research and industry. Our conversation with them revolved around how they approached quality control, as well as what types of problems they encountered when handing off microfluidics to consumers.
This led to an in depth conversation regarding the types of educational materials they have designed for first time microfluidics users. If a complex microfluidics setup is being installed in a lab, Blacktrace typically hosts a two-day training seminar covering the basics of using and maintaining the hardware. For smaller scale chips and devices, they include detailed information in the form of manuals and web support.
Throughout the conversation, Blacktrace stressed the importance of easy to understand educational materials and gave a few suggestions regarding what we should include in our own project. What we were able to take away from this outreach was the"

Pantothenate Kinase II (panK) ( Top )
PanK is a pantothenate kinase that activates the first protein in the anabolic pathway for coenzyme A. E. coli has this protein as part of its core genome, but the kinase from E. coli is strongly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism.  However, an increase in coenzyme A and its thioesters will inhibit the activity of pantothenate kinase. Staphylococcus aureus requires a higher amount of coenzyme A as it lacks glutathione and thus relies on a coenzyme A based reductase system to repair oxidative damage Leonardi, R., et al. (2005). ""A pantothenate kinase from Staphylococcus aureus refractory to feedback regulation by coenzyme A."" J Biol Chem 280(5): 3314-3322. . As a results the staphylococcal panK is not feedback regulated, and we have thereby taken advantage of this by adding the specific panK to our construct. The BioBrick ( K1692020 ) containing staphylococcal panK was created by the iGEM Standford Brown team 2015 .

A protein from one organism do not necessarily recognize all its native target proteins in another organism. Additionally, it could be able to phosphorylate proteins, which it did not phosphorylate before. We have therefore performed an iTRAQ analysis of staphylococcal panK (pantothenate kinase II) in E. coli. For an iTRAQ analysis , the entire proteome of the cells are extracted and digested. The peptides from each sample are then tagged with one of four different tags that binds to the free N-terminal present on tryptic peptides. The"

Note: Each sample was documented as to which well it was placed in. This was useful information for comparing conditions and reactants of the PCR so that if an experiment was repeated, it could be improved for better results.
8. The lid was put on the well and set so that the samples are starting closest to the negative (black) end so that the samples would run toward the positive (red) end.
9. The voltage machine was set so that it read between 100-120 V so that the separation could occur in a timely fashion.
10. The gel was run until the dyed bands were approximately halfway through the gel.
11. The gel was removed from the well and then ultraviolet light was used to compare the ladder to the samples that were run.
12. If the band was in the correct region for the desired product, the experiment proceeded to gel extraction. If not, PCR was repeated altering one or two of the reactants in hopes to improve the end result.
Gel Extraction
Purpose: Gel extraction is the next step after the desired results from gel electrophoresis have been obtained. For this procedure, the band from the gel is cut out and then the gel is dissolved and filtered so that only the DNA from that segment of the gel remains. This DNA is then used for subsequent experiments and can be sequenced when it is inserted in a plasmid.
Procedure:
1. Microcentrifuge tubes, equal to the number of samples that were extracted, were weighed and recorded.
2. An extraction knife and tweezers were wiped with ethanol in order to remove any contaminants.
3. The desired bands of the gel were cut out and put in to the pre-weighed microcentrifuge tubes.
4. The tubes were weighed again, with the gel inside of them.
5. Three times the weight OF THE GEL in µL of Agarose Dissolving Buffer (ADB) was added to the tube.          Example: If the microcentrifuge tube was 0.98g and the tube with the gel was added weight 1.28g, then 90 µL of ADB should be added to the tube.
6. The gel was left to dissolve in an oven at 60 C until the agarose was completely dissolved. It was periodically taken out of the oven and vortexed to assure that all of the gel was adequately dissolved.
7. After the gel was completely dissolved. The contents of the centrifuge tube were added to a Hi-Bind column and then"

UPO-Sevilla,2010,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Modeling#Chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html,", this detection influences the motion of the flagellar motor [Topp and Gallivan, 2007] .
E. Coli has two main motion modes, which we will name:
Random Walk
Gradient climbing
Random walk mode
When no gradient of chemoattractant is present, E. coli is in random walk mode. In this case, the bacteria performs smooth runs followed by tumbles.
Mathematically, we will model this as a Brownian motion:
where x is the position of the bacteria and v is the velocity. This (vector) velocity is is defined as:
where u(t) is an unitary vector and s is the speed. The vector u(t) is randomly sampled from the unit circle. The speed is randomly sampled from a normal distribution:
where μ is the mean displacement velocity of E.Coli, and σ models the variations from this mean velocity.
The bacteria will move for a time Δtrm with constant velocity v(t). At the next time instant the bacteria tumbles, selecting a new velocity vector (randomly).
Gradient climbing behaviour
When a positive difference of concentration (a gradient) on the chemoattractant is detected, the bacteria enters into a new mode that we will call gradient climbing.
In this mode, the flagellar motor tends to move counterclockwise; as a result, the smooth runs last for more time, and the tumbling frequency decreases.
In order to model that, we use the same model than above, but a larger tumbling interval (smaller tumbling frequency) Δtgc;

Modeling Tools
The Dry Lab has created a program using Java to simulate the previous equations and dynamics. The program has a visual interface developed using the graphics library PulpCore .
You can download the bacterial crowding simulation here . You will find a readme file explaining how to execute it. Moreover, the source code is also included.
The simulation allows to control several parameters, like the diffusion coefficient, the velocity of the bacterias, and so on. Moreover, the simulation shows visually the evolution of the concentration of chemoattractant and the position of the bacterias. Below you can see the evolution of a simulation in 5 different time steps. The bacterias are represented in green, while the concrentration is depicted using colors:

Public institutions such as the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), the National Institute of Industrial Technology (INTI) and the National Agency of Scientific and Technological Promotion, promote biotechnology in partnership with the private sector, contributing to innovation through projects in research and development. Cooperation between public and private institutions reflected in more than 100 biotechnology products funded by 40 companies, generating investments around AR $ 150 million. As the successful experiences of cooperation between laboratories and universities, including the Universidad Nacional del Litoral with Bioceres and the National University of Quilmes with INSUD Group (Chemo).
REGULATIONS FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
As shown above in the biotechnology industry, Argentina shows no significant production of synthetic biology to be one specific regulation. For producing organisms using techniques of synthetic biology, the regulation for modern biotechnology is used. This regulation was produced in 1991 and is overseen by the following agencies: Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries; Board of Biotechnology; National Advisory Commission on Agricultural Biotechnology (CONABIA); National Health Service and Agro Food Quality (SENASA); and the Technical Advisory Committee to the Use of GMOs (CTAUOGM). The goal is to ensure every organ in the oversight of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the experimental parts to the possible commercialization of a new product  Argentina has 29 transgenic plants to produce goods derived of cottom,corn and soybeans from companies like Monsanto Argentina S.A.I.C., Dow AgroSciences, Pioneer Argentina S.A, Syngenta Seeds S.A. e Novartis Agrosem S.A..

uniCAS App for Illumination
To further improve the illumination of cells we developed an smartphone app like the one from Washington 2013 . But instead of using a tablet we wanted to use a smartphone as it is easier to handle and better available. Furthermore with our software we wanted to provide an easy way to perform spatio-temporal gene expression experiments.
Unfortunately caused by a lack of time we were not able to completely finish this software project. Up to know it is only possible to do simple blue light and red light experiments as well as mapping the word iGEM onto your cells. Nonetheless we want to share our first beta version of the app with you. If you want to you can also further develop it and make it more functional!

Virginia,2014,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," is a physiological state of bacterial communities where the cells are encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix.  This makes the colony incredibly stable and resistant to mechanical dislodging as well as immunological attack and other harmful conditions.  E. coli, as well as other eubacteria, use the polysaccharide poly-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PGA) as a primary adhesin between cells of a biofilm.  In E. coli, the creation and export of this polymer requires the four genes of the pgaABCD operon.9 pgaA and pgaB have been shown to be necessary for export of the PGA polysaccharide, while pgaC and pgaD are used in the biosynthesis of the molecule.10 All four genes are necessary for biofilm formation, and overproduction of PGA has been shown to increase biofilm formation in E. coli.11
SEM image of the exopolysaccharide connections that hold a biofim together8
The biofilm formation portion of our project focuses on the overproduction of the pgaABCD operon gene products in order to increase biofilm formation.  This is done through two pathways—the insertion of a plasmid containing the entire operon into the cell, or the insertion of a plasmid containing the transcriptional activator ''NhaR''.  NhaR is a DNA binding protein within the LysR family of transcriptional regulators which has been shown to be necessary for transcription of the pgaABCD operon.12 NhaR is transcribed in unaltered E. coli in the presence of monovalent cations and alkaline conditions, leading to biofilm production under these stressful conditions.13 Expression of NhaR under a constitutive promoter on a plasmid enables us to create a biofilm under all conditions within our filter.  The adhesive nature of this biofilm will then prevent our cells from being swept away in the flow of the water through the filter, enabling long term functionality within a water treatment plant.
Nylon Degradation: The Benefit of a Biological Filter
In order to create a strain that would degrade nylon, we created two strains that each secreted a different enzyme shown to have nylon degrading activity.  The first such enzyme was Manganese Peroxidase (MnP) which originates from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium.  MnP is used by this fungus to degrade lignin, a complex polymer found in woody plant tissue composed of"

Integrated Human Practices
Introduction
The impact of our project and research conducted to bring it to fruition, will reach all the way from Earth to Mars. For that reason, we decided to define human practices in two different ways: how it will effect Mars and how it will effect the Earth.
For Mars, unfortunately, because there are no users on Mars (yet!) it was impossible for us to engage with end users of our habitat. For that reason we decided the most effective approach would be to discuss with the experts who would be utilizing this design. During our interviews we discussed the parameters of our design and what cautionary steps we would need to talk in our design to not only protect travelers to Mars but the planet as well from contamination.
For earth we explored that technological implications of mycelium composites and how they could be used in sustainable industrial products and housing.
Below is how we engaged with experts and members of the community who had a stake by our research, for “Martian” and human practices.
Martian Habitats
The idea of people living on Mars is an inherently exciting prospect, and it can be a great deal of fun to dream of what the homes, or even cities, of a future martian colony would be like--will they be giant geodesic domes filled with lush greenery that dot the martian landscape and are connected by underground tunnels? Or will they be totally underground, an endless maze that will shield its inhabitants from the harsh cosmic rays? Or perhaps even crafted from ice--creating glistening ice sculptures upon the martian surface?
However, for our team just as alluring and fun as the imaginative aspect of designing for Mars is--which we certainly explored--was the challenge of designing our habitat to be a highly cost-effective, protective, and functional design.
There are a lot of moving parts that go into generating a design like this. We needed to understand what are the basic functions that a general habitat needs to fulfill (i.e. places to rest, to work, and to socialize. Certain degrees of privacy and lighting are also requirements) and what new"

Many people feel bored to read something contain nothing but words, especially when the words is about academics. After entering college, I realized that the illustration is textbooks are too limited. We do not want others to feel the same when they try to read our pamphlets, so we made it a beautiful picture book, printed and separated.

Lecture in high school
High school students are young, vibrant, and always open to new things.
Last year, our team had a Lab Open Day for some high school students. One student named Zhang Herui showed great interest in iGEM competition and synthetic biology and is recruited into our team this year. For this year's project, considering there are few references of miRNA mentioned in textbooks, we walked into her school to fill the blanks and introduce our project.
Moving our glow sticks for synthetic biology
In June, our team was invited to give a lecture on iTED Sharing held by the Squirrel Club of NUDT. The theme of the lecture is biotech 2.0-the synthetic biology and iGEM in my eyes. Through this lecture, we gave the present students an introduction of our research field. We aimed to share our ideas with undergraduates and get feedbacks form the interactive section. Additionally, the popularization of synthetic biology is achieved.
Attentions on policy-making
MiRNA antagonist therapy is a brand new area that is in the lack of regulation policy; however, we decided to grasp the trend of policy. As the product developer, we also shoulder the responsibility of advising the government when needed. Thus, we consulted Professor Ling Li and teaching assistant Shuo Tu on things that need attention when making a policy for miRNA antagonist therapy.
For new therapies and new technology, effectiveness and safety are two important indexes. In clinical application, there must be a strict regulation, including the indications"

Good luck to the first Israeli iGEM HS team!
We hope that our vision will pave the path to many more Israeli HS teams.
SynBio Lectures & Activities
As part of our outreach we developed a set of SynBio lectures and activities. By using educational tools we wanted to show the public the unique aspects synthetic biology brings to the table. Our SynBio activities were meant to enrich the audience with new knowledge regarding synthetic biology, which enables us to build complicated biological systems from scratch and utilize them in solving everyday problems.
Below are the main activities we have initiated.

Lysis Solution(20 µL β-Mercaptoethanol/ mL RNA Lysis Buffer)
RNA Wash Solution(206 mL RNA Wash Solution + 350 mL 95% ethanol)
Inoculate 10ml of growth medium with a single colony of your bacterial sample. Incubate overnight at the appropriate temperature with shaking. Do not use the overnight culture directly for RNA isolation; instead use it to inoculate a fresh culture as described in Step 2.
Dilute the overnight culture 1:50 and grow to an optical density (O.D.600) of 0.6–1.0 by spectrophotometry. This should only take a few hours. If growth is too slow, reduce the dilution factor by adding a larger volume of inoculum to fresh medium. Note: The doubling time of E. coli is approximately 20 minutes in rich medium. The growth rate depends on the growth medium, temperature, strain and degree of oxygenation. For most purposes, the culture should be harvested in mid-log phase. A stationary phase E. coli culture generally contains 1–2 × 109 cells/ml, depending on the culture medium and aeration.
Transfer a volume of culture containing a maximum of 1 × 1010 cells to a centrifugal tube. Centrifuge at 5,500 × g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Carefully remove the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet as dry as possible.
Resuspend the cell pellet in 1ml of freshly prepared TE buffer containing lysozyme. Do not exceed 1ml per prep. Tap gently to mix. Note: For Gram-positive bacteria use 3mg/ml lysozyme; for Gram-negative bacteria, use 0.4mg/ml lysozyme.
Incubate the resuspended cells at room temperature. For Gram-positive bacteria, incubate the cells for 5–10 minutes; for Gram-negative bacteria, incubate the cells for 3–5 minutes.
Add 1ml of Lysis Solution containing BME. Vortex vigorously until lysis is complete and no clumps are present. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes to complete the lysis. Optional: Homogenize the lysate at high speed, using a rotor-stator homogenizer (such as a BioSpec Tissue-Tearor™), until no visible clumps remain.
Proceed to Lysate Clearing.

Therefore, we can define our need as it follows: a way to address the growing problem of antibiotics’ presence in the aquatic environment of the Baltic Sea Region by removing SMX from wastewater in order to prevent antibiotic resistance and minimize their ecotoxic effects.
Stakeholders Analysis
Stakeholders analysis is key to assess their needs and expectations as well as their potential project impact if the need is not met. Therefore, we map the interest and power of each player (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Stakeholders interest/power grid.
Market Analysis and Customer Discovery
The identification of customer’s needs, wants, and demands is a priority for us. In order to meet our clients’ needs, maximize the benefits and minimize the risks, a market analysis allowed us to select the most profitable and attractive segments to launch Biotic Blue. Through this analysis, we were able to identify our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and, consequently, we could define our business strategy and plan activities accordingly.
Market Segmentation
We will be serving different business markets , which at the same time have several customers and needs. We carried out a market segmentation in order to understand each segment behavior and identify which ones offer better opportunities. There are four types of segmentation: demographic, behavioral, psychographic and geographic [8]. In this case, we first performed a geographic segmentation . We decided to operate in the Baltic Sea Region, consisting of 9 countries: Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Sweden. The reason why we focused on this region was because of its ecosystem, which is particularly sensitive to pharmaceutical pollution due to its low biodiversity, low functional redundancy, the physiological stress many species experience as an effect of the brackish water environment and the slow water exchange rate, which means long retention time for pharmaceuticals [6].
We chose Sweden as the initial country to launch Biotic Blue. Its prosper economic situation, and strong environmental-friendly culture will presumably offer more implementation opportunities for our product. Moreover, Sweden is among the countries in Europe where the tertiary treatment is more established in their plants [9]. According to the Swedish EPA’s report in 2016, 95% of urban wastewater undergoes both biological and chemical treatment [10], which we assume will lead to a better acceptance of advanced treatments.
Secondly, we undertook a demographic segmentation by the type of industry. Different industries were analyzed according to their suitability in regards to Biotic Blue implementation. These include municipal WWTPs, private WWTPs, non-municipal"
Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," and applications, isoforms of proteins can be produced and manipulated for the desired effect or product. Applications of this project can be found here.
The Prion Domain
The prion domain, derived from Sup35 of S.cerevisiae, was employed in the design of this project. The utility of Sup35 is based on its ability to manifest in either an infectious or non-infectious state (Dale et al., 2012). In [PSI-], the non-infectious state, the protein acts as a translational termination factor (Dale et al., 2012). In the [PSI+] state, however, the protein confers prion-like properties (Dale et al., 2012)). [PSI+] is often observed upon overexpression of Sup35, which results in protein aggregation (Bradley & Liebman, 2004). Based on the discovery that only the N-terminal and a small portion of the middle domain are essential to the propagation of the prion state, only the coding sequence of the first 137 amino acids was incorporated into the plasmid design (Bradley & Liebman, 2004). Decreasing the size of the plasmid was expected to aid in plasmid construction and transformation. This prion domain is referred to as “PrD”. As we wanted the prion domain to be a modular tool, we created a biobrick and placed it in the registry ( BBa_K2475000 ).
Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC)
BiFC is employed as a means to visualize protein interactions within live yeast cells. The method is based upon the principle that fragments of a fluorescent protein do not have the ability to fluoresce without interacting with one another in the form of a complex (Kerppola, 2008). In applying this principle to our project, the objective was to utilize the prion domain as a tool to give rise to functional proteins. The interaction of the N-terminal of YFP fused with PrD ( BBa_K2475003 ) and the C-terminal of YFP fused with PrD ( BBa_K2475004 ) is expected to result in the emission of fluorescence when both split proteins come into close proximity in an aggregate.
Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
FRET represents another method to visualize intracellular interactions. The premise underlying this technique is that the transfer of energy from excited fluorophores to non-excited fluorophores can occur when the two fluorophores are within a distance of 5 nm (Alberts"

Collaborations
iGEM Concordia
We collaborated with iGEM Concordia to validate the functionality of our constructs BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002. We have shipped our DNA samples to Concordia iGem on September 2016. Following protocol was executed by iGem Concordia for the preliminary results:
Transformed E.Coli DH5a cells with BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002 separately.
For control groups untransformed E.Coli DH5a cells were used.
10uM and 100uM gold(III) metal ions were added to the control and experimental groups along with XGal
Blue color change was observed.
Results:
After the 2-3 hours, visible blue color was observed in 10uM and 100uM tubes containing E.Coli BBa_K2048001. Faint blue color was also observed in 10uM and 100uM tubes containing E.Coli BBa_K2048002.
After 24h, tubes with BBa_K2048002 device also showed dark blue color. In addition, BBa_K2048002 tubes had a darker visible blue compared to BBa_K2048001.
Concordia iGEM teams results further validated the functionality of our devices BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002. Moreover, they proved the expression levels can be observed at 100uM gold(III) levels in presence of XGal.

Functional silencing experiment
Goal: Silencing eGFP in CT26 eGFP cells co - transfected with pcDNA3 mRuby2 and our scRNA construct. The scRNA construct is designed to be activated by mRuby2 mRNA, becoming a dicer substrate and finally silence eGFP.   Method: We gave a different treatment for each of our four groups:
We conducted the experiment both in 24 well plate (for flow cytometry) and in a chamber slide (for confocal microscopy).
The cells were plated on the appropriate plates for the different tests (100,000 cells per well in the 24 well plate and 15,000 cells per well in the chamber slide) and incubated for 24 hours at 37?c.
After 24 hours, the incubated cells were transfected (according to the different treatments detailed above) with one or more of the following:
pcDNA3 mRuby2 -  1.0 µg
scRNA – both detection part A + hair pin part B - 100 pmol for each of the parts (A+B)
Transfection was done by lipofectamine (protocol), and then the cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37?c.
Preparations for image stream were done by the general protocol (protocol).
Results:
Image stream (flow cytometry):
Treatment 1 – Negative control
Treatment 2 – transfected with pcDNA3 mRuby2
Treatment 3 – transfected with scRNA
Treatment 4 – transfected with pcDNA3 mRuby2 & scRNA
Confocal microscope:
Co-expression of mRuby2 and eGFP was validated in all relevant wells.
Conclusions:
GFP negative population: The  first parameter to compare that comes to mind when looking for silencing is the  percentage of GFP negative cells of the entire population – if a significantly  bigger portion of the population is GFP negative, then the silencing worked.  However, when looking at the population distribution of the different control  groups, we can see no significant difference in the GFP negative population.  This might not the result of unsuccessful silencing – we are using a stable GFP  expressing cell line, but no matter how stable"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Inhibition Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ides might inhibit the reaction, as the larger amplified DNA product bands fade as more substrate nucleotides are added, just as the model predicted. The DNA smear seen in the gel is a characteristic part of the rolling circle amplification. The final concentration of substrate-bound dCTP molecules was chosen to be 25 µM in the amplification reaction.
Figure 3. Phi29 amplified DNA dependence on the concentration of nucleotide concentrations.
DNA, amplified using multiple displacement amplification was synthesised using 750 - 100µM dNTP concentration with or without 25µM substrate nucleotide concentration. Decreasing the concentration of dNTP’s decreases the amount of DNA amplified only when concentrations lower than 200 µM are used. Red dashed line highlight the chosen condition for MDA reaction.
Next, we seeked to determine the lowest reference nucleotide concentration for the MDA reaction usable with the corresponding 25 µM concentration of substrate nucleotides. While substrate dCTP concentration was constant, the concentration of dNTPs was gradually lowered. In addition to this, reaction without modified nucleotides was carried too, to determine whether the nucleotide concentration or ratio to substrate-dCTP is the product limiting factor. The results indicate that 200 µM and 100 µM final concentrations are too low to be used with 25 µM sub-dCTP (ratios 1:8 and 1:4), because the upper DNA product fades considerably. Taking this into consideration, 300 µM was chosen to be the final working dNTP concentration.
Conclusions
To conclude, the phi29 mathematical description solutions allowed us to acknowledge the potential DNA fragment size shift as a result of inhibitory effects of substrate nucleotides. Based on the output of the model we set out to investigate the inhibitory effects caused by substrate nucleotides in the laboratory. The results generated by the model fit with the experimental data well - higher substrate nucleotide concentrations indeed inhibit the production of long DNA molecules and lead to the synthesis of short ones. This model has immensely helped us to improve our CAT-Seq prototype by showing the possible crucial negative effects of substrate nucleotides. This has helped us to successfully optimize the substrate nucleotide concentration in laboratory in order to receive best possible and sequencing quality and the dynamic range for activity measurements.

The Bright Future
So far, we has concentrated on increasing the quantity of nitrogen fertilizer being spread on the leguminous plants which have root nodule. That means plants without root nodule cannot benefit from our project. In order to apply our project in more aspects, we hope to make non-legume species adopt rhizobia actively and they become the symbiotic partners afterwards. In this way, crop yields would increase and the nitrogen dependence of agricultural industry would decrease. We intend to achieve our goal by getting more understanding of immunologic mechanism. Why would leguminous plants not regard rhizobia as enemy like facing other deleterious bacteria? The recognition system behind it would lead us the way to go further.
Modern agriculture not only relies on mechanization but chemical fertilizers as well. In natural world, biological fertilizers provide most nutrients for plants. Biological fertilizers include metabolite and debris of microorganism. We use microorganisms to deliver molybdenum to the plants which need this element to uptake nutrients. These E. coli we use would bring the metabolite and debris to nurture plants. Through our project, we hope to arouse people’s interests on biological fertilizers and put forward more creative ideas. We also hope that, in the near future, biological fertilizer would become the main nutrient source for agriculture industry as well.
When pollution of heavy metal or petroleum happens, microorganisms have already been used to gather and degenerate the pollution. Our project also provides a new solution to degenerate the pollution of molybdenum.

Laboratory exhibition
On June 22, 2017, the LAB-SUPPLY exposition took place in the ESTREL Convention Center in Berlin, a chance our team could not miss. This regional trade fair for instrumental analytics, laboratory technology, laboratory chemicals, and biotechnology attracted more than 900 visitors (among them our iGEM team).
We got the chance to hear presentations about the newest innovations in the field of lab technology as well as lectures from a few equipment manufacturers.
Furthermore, the visit was an opportunity to directly get in touch with the companies to promote the iGEM competition and our team. For instance, we gained the support of companies like eppendorf, OMNILAB and LABOR PRAXIS. To sum up, the convention gave the visitors the chance to gain information from the trade exhibition by around 100 producers coming from lab- and analytic technique, to listen to lectures about the newest trends concerning the application technique in the laboratory, and also to gather tips for the daily work in the laboratory.
Did you see this?

Main sponsors:"
Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Forensic Toolkit#FluID_-_-_TEXT.html," as an initial test to exclude some suspects however, blood type alone is not enough to identify a suspect because lots of people will also share the same blood type.
There are currently several different methods for detecting blood at a crime scene, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The main methods used are Luminol or ALS (alternate light source) ‘crime-lite’.                These crime-lite’s are essentially a box of different coloured torches. Different biological fluids will absorb light at different wavelengths and are thus more visible to the naked eye using this technique. However, a positive reaction using this technique is not really confirmation for the presence of body fluid since other substrates may also fluoresce. It can also be a very slow process at the crime scene, with different crime lights, being used one at a time on all surfaces to try and identify any body fluid present.
Luminol (which you might have seen on TV programmes such as CSI) is a compound used to detect blood at a crime scene. The investigator prepares a solution of luminol and sprays it on the area under investigation. The lights are then turned off and any traces of blood show up as a bright blue glow. This is because the luminol reacts with iron in blood to produce chemiluminescence (which is the emission of light during a chemical reaction).                The main advantage of Luminol is that it glows in the presence of very small quantities of iron so even trace amounts of blood can be detected. However, the disadvantages of this technique are that the chemiluminescence can also be triggered by a number of substances such as copper and bleach. This means that if a crime scene has been cleaned with bleach, the bleach residue will cause the entire crime scene to glow blue and this camouflages any traces of blood that might be present. In addition, the reaction tends to be very fast, only around 30 seconds before it stops glowing. Our spray will hopefully fluoresce for much longer, giving plenty of time for the scene to be analysed and photographed without the need for constant reapplication of the spray.
For the blood detection we have decided to exploit the interaction between haptoglobin and haemoglobin.
Figure 1 - Structure of the human haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex.
Haemoglobin is the tetrameric protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It is composed of four polypeptide chains, which in adults consist of two alpha (a) globin chains and two beta (b) globin chains. In blood plasma, haptoglobin binds free haemoglobin released from red blood cells, inhib"

Outlook
To sum up our results and findings, one can say that we achieved many of the aspired aims that were formulated during the foundation phase of our project. We were able to establish a new selection assay and elucidated two adjusting screws for E. coli’s motility. Last but not least we identified two new receptors from our Tar library and their chemical counterparts triggering chemotaxis.
Nevertheless, there is room left for improvements: We would like to achieve a higher diversity with our library and many of our designed BioBricks should work better with a suitable ribosomal binding site. The selection system itself could be further improved and even better results could be achieved using fast and well-swimming bacteria. One important issue of Synthetic Biology are “ready for the market” products. If we start to think ahead, now that we are at the end of this year’s competition, many possible applications are imaginable. Exemplarily, we would want to apply our approach to the search for cancer or tumor cells and the tracking of specific mixtures of attractants. A paper from the Arkin group at UC-Berkley already describes various modified bacteria targeting tumor cells more often than healthy cells under certain conditions.
Some of our initial questions could be answered during our experiments, but many additional ones were raised. For one, would it be possible to use probiotic bacteria instead of E. coli, to prevent pathogenicity-related risks? Could this be the basis for an advanced and directed treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease? Furthermore, other fields of application are possible. One could, for instance, visualize intestinal sources of disease by fluorescence markers or other detecting methods. Finally, as we speak about Synthetic Biology, the expansion of the genetic code might open even more and completely new possibilities of improving what we have accomplished so far.

Deferoxamine acts by binding free iron in the bloodstream and enhancing its elimination in the urine. By removing excess iron, the agent reduces the damage done to various organs and tissues, such as the liver. Also, it speeds healing of nerve damage (and minimizes the extent of recent nerve trauma).
It is currently used of on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. But it is used in the treatment of many others diseases as well.
Desferrioxamine B may modulate expression and release of inflammatory mediators by specific cell types.

Test of our biobrick proteins production using a SDS PAGE and coomassie blue staining. - : no induction ; + : induction with 0.02% arabinose at Abs(600nm)=0.4
We investigated if the DesA, DesB, DesC and DesD proteins were well produced by our biobrick BBa_K1951011 using SDS PAGE.
To do this we performed SDS PAGE (protocol) and stained with coomassie blue using cells containing this biobrick. From an over night starter, cells were diluted and grown from Abs(600nm)=0.2 to Abs(600nm)=1.  Then 1UOD of cells (1.67ml at 0.6OD) was collected and centrifuged at 5000g for 5min.  After removal of the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50µL SDS-PAGE sample buffer.  We heated the mix at 95°C during 15min. The sample was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and migrated during 50min at 180V.  Staining was done using coomassie blue.
We compared the production of proteins in different background :
- E. coli TG1 strain with pSB1C3 containing the RFP coding sequence (negative control)
- E. coli TG1 strain with des operon ( BBa_K1951011 ) before and after induction. (You can observe the production of the 4 proteins on the figure on the right; left : before induction, right : after induction)
Results showed the production of the 4 proteins DesA, DesB, DesC and DesD, all involved in the desferrioxamine B biosynthesis pathway. We can notice that a leak of the promoter pBAD, indeed we note the production of Des proteins without arabinose induction.

Enzyme reaction fused to S-layer protein
To test an exemplary enzymatic reaction fused to an S-layer protein SgsE | luciferase was assembled and expressed. The fusion protein shows high luciferase activity inside the cells but unfortunately the purification and stability at room temperature has some issues which have to be solved in future applications.
Expression in E. coli
For characterization experiments the SgsE gene under the control of a T7 / lac promoter (<partinfo>K525303</partinfo>) was fused to firefly luciferase (<partinfo>K525999</partinfo>) using Freiburg BioBrick assembly.
The SgsE | luciferase fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli KRX after induction of T7 polymerase with 0.2 % L-rhamnose and induction of lac operator with 1 mM IPTG.

About the team
SJTU is short for Shanghai JiaoTong University, one of the most famous universities in China. Known for its  abundant teaching resources and cutting-end scientific researching level. SJTU not only keep its edge on traditional advantage fields like naval architecture, engineering and electronic, but also make great progress in fields like life science, medicine, finance and so on.  Though the school of life science and biotechnology of SJTU does not has a long history, it has developed dramastically during these years, especially bioinformatics, which ranks first in China.
SJTU first had software team in 2014. This year, we have a brand-new software team: the 2015 SJTU software team. Our team is supported by the school of life science and biotechnology. Three professors of our this school became our mentors who helped us to organize the team and provided us with helpful advices. The team members are most from Bioinformatics. Some from the school of electronic, information and electrical engineering and one is from the school of media and design. The combination of students from different majors let our team be more creative and efficient.
We spend most of our time finishing the software in the bioinformatics computer room where we can use computer and Internet freely and close to mentors’ offices. Here we have some pictures about our daily work situation. Although the summer in Shanghai is hot and sometimes coding was boring and drove us crazy when we had to work 24/7 for the deadline. We still had so much fun this summer and finished our project finally!

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," pigment system can be seen below.
This system shows red, green, and blue light repressing the production of cyan, magenta and yellow pigment respectively, theoretically being able to produce the full spectrum of colours.
The Biology
Light to pigment repression.
The focus of our wet work is the creation of three independent 'light to output' pathways in E. coli. Each pathway will control the transcription of selected genes using red, green or blue light. Incident light will prevent the transcription of the selected gene.
In our bio-camera the controlled genes will be those that code for the production of cyan, magenta and yellow pigments:
Red light prevents the production of cyan pigment
Green light prevents the production of magenta pigment
Blue light prevents the production of yellow pigment
Each sensor prevents the production of its opposing pigment, producing the pigment which is the same colour of light that the light sensor detects. The mix of pigments will reproduce the colour of light incident on the bacteria.
Red light pathway
This pathway uses the well characterised Cph8 red light sensor (composing of Cph1 and Envz). When there is no red light present, this protein causes the phosphorylation of OmpR, to OmpR-P. This then diffuses away from the red light sensor, and can bind to a specialised ompC promoter sequence. This is upstream of an RBS B0034 and the K592011 gene which is just the coding region of the cyan pigment. This is then transcribed and cyan pigment is produced. It can be noted that there has been no terminator added to this bio brick, due to there being one present in the plasmid backbone.
When Cph8 is exposed to red light, the phosphorylation of OmpR ceases. The OmpR is not capable of diffusing away from the red light sensor, so does not bind to the ompC promoter before the cyan pigment gene. This means that the cyan pigment can not be generated.  Cyan pigment in this system will be repressed, whereas magenta and yellow pigments will still be produced, which when mixed create a red pigment.
The red light sensor has been worked on by several iGEM teams for a variety of purposes, and features in several academic publications .
Green light pathway
The green light module works differently to the red and blue light modules but it still uses a light sensor (CcaS), intermediate protein (CcaR) and a specialised promoter. However, when the system is exposed to green light, CcaR is phosphorylated and CcaR-P is generated, allowing the synthesis of"

As said yesterday, we grew the two arg auxotrophs together, and they grew substantially more (~0.15 OD600) than the negative control. The wt grew to an OD of about 1. We are growing them for another night to see if the OD of the mix increases at all.
Since sequencing confirmed a MetA biobrick, we transformed K12 cells with the remaining stock of our plasmid, so we could amplify it.
All relevant transformed strains from yesterday grew well on the plates. We are now ready to properly do the fluorescence calibration experiment, but due to time constraints, we are going to do it on Thursday.

We tested the growth rate of our 3 main auxotrophs in various (log scale from 100 pM to 10 mM) concentrations of the amino acids to do monod kinetics. We also miniprepped our metA biobrick (so we have enough to send to the registry and use for experiments), new potential candidates for other biobricks (tyrA and ArgC), our construct which is identical to 13M on plate 3, except on a different plasmid, and a biobrick that we received from the registry. Sequencing to follow.
Joe has, to the best of my knowledge, identified potential biobrick colonies for the DszB,C, and D. Again, sequencing to follow.
It appears that Joe and Grace were attempting the fluorescence calibration experiment, but things apparently were going wrong, and we have not yet analyzed the data completely.

As a child I loved putting together puzzles. My first encounter with the largest puzzles in the world, science, happened during third grade at a science fair. I realized at the time that science is not just a simple puzzle but a puzzle with many missing pieces. So I made it my goal, at that instance, to find as many of these missing pieces as possible in my lifetime.  I wish to pursue an MD/PhD in neurobiology and aspire to become neurosurgeon.  So hello, my name is Ann Lin.

Hello; my name is Chris Giuliano and I am a sophomore Chemistry major. I’ve wanted to be a scientist for as long as I can remember. As a child, I would spend hours watching my grandpa perform magic tricks before my eyes; but I was never content with the visuals - I needed to know how the magic worked. I view science in the same way, and hope to earn a PhD in my path to peeking behind the magician’s curtain. My non-science interests include Art, especially drawing with pen and markers, reading, and spending too much time watching Netflix.

BostonU,2017,Team:BostonU#JudgingCriteria_-_-_TEXT.html," concerns are addressed in another component of our integrated human practices: our Circadia Synthetica art project.  After hearing these concerns and considering our conversation with Dr. Zaman, we solidified our project as a foundational advance. We wanted to then use this art project to convey the importance of foundational advances in the field of synthetic biology.
2. Modeling
We characterized the expression capacity of our in-house cell-free system using a logistic dose response model. The goal of our model was to determine optimal DNA concentrations to be used in our cell-free system, which would then inform our future experimental setup. Our initial thoughts were that the expression could be modeled using a single logistic curve that describes the carrying capacity of the system. We found that instead, the model required a double logistic curve in which one curve is subtracted from the other. We believe that one curves represents the carrying capacity, while the other represents mechanical burnout of molecular components when overloaded with DNA. This model helped us determine that maximum expression is achieved when approximately 20 nM concentrations of DNA are added to the cell-free system."

iGEM Paris Saclay
We collaborated with the Paris Saclay team by sharing with them how we implemented the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) ideology into our project. The Paris Saclay team saw an opportunity in iGEM teams to spread the concept of RRI through the scientific community and the general public as well, thanks to our involvement and compromise with our community. This collaboration helped them to assess the level of implementation and awareness of responsible research worldwide, and it also helped to spread the importance of taking into account the duty we, as scientists, have with our society while doing research.
Thanks to this collaboration we were also able to asses the impact of our project in our society, and what actions we were taking in order to make our research useful for solving the problems that our community faces nowadays. We believe RRI should be an essential aspect of any scientific project and it should be implemented from its core. Spreading the RRI ideology will undoubtedly have a great impact in the development of society as a whole, because by doing research with this concepts of responsibility in mind we will be aiming scientific research and technological development towards society’s needs.
iGEM Toulouse
We collaborated with the iGEM Toulouse team while one of our team members was studying abroad in France. She got in contact with the team and organized a meeting in which they discussed several important issues about both projects. They shared the progress of each individual project, the issues encountered so far, talked about sponsors, and gave each other feedback in all of these aspects. They also talked about the support each institution gave to their respective teams.
The final resolution of the meeting was to clarify the misconceptions that both teams had about the way research is facilitated in both, Latin America and Europe, and mainly discuss the development of iGEM projects in each one of the continents. Something great about this collaboration is that, as several members from the Toulouse team were going to the European iGEM teams meeting in Paris, they took the opportunity to share some of our struggles with the other European teams."

Policy and Practices
    Last southern summer, Brazil, as a tropical country, faced an enormous dengue fever epidemic problem. Dengue is transmitted by infected mosquitos within the genus Aedes, which lay its eggs in standing water containers. During brazilian summer, it is used to rain a lot and, if there are rain-water-exposed recipients, the chances of spreading dengue fever increases.
    Based on that issue, Brasil-USP and UFSCAR-Brasil teams organized a play to be presented to children,and, in a playful manner, aware them about dengue's disease danger and transmission, as well as to counsel them on how to avoid a new epidemic. Our teams met children from ‘PROVIM Dom Luciano Mendes de Almeida’, a communitarian center intended to attend children from a not so wealthy neighborhood in São Carlos/SP, and presented them a play called “The Mighty Bacteria against Dengue”. At that presentation, it was possible to show them a little about dengue fever disease symptoms, a little about what one may do if under those symptoms and ways to prevent it of happening.
    With that, we were able to introduce, in a very simple way, how science - in especial synthetic biology - could help. Both of our projects (UFSCar-Brasil team’s and Brasil-USP team’s) were represented at the play by two super bacteria: a mosquito-repellent one and a rubber-digester one.
    By the end of the day, all those children were divided in groups in order to plan Crotalaria juncea, a plant that helps in dengue control. Children’s feedback was very positive. They"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics results_-_-_TEXT.html," approach is limiting because there is always ""room to go deeper"". However, as innocent as reducing life may appear to be it also has the ability to devaluate our perception of life itself. It is this fate, more than any other possible negative consequence, that is the true threat of synthetic biology and science as a whole.
The reductionist approach is limiting to the extent that it does little to explore the emergent properties of complex systems which may be at the core of our perception self-awareness and other concepts usually considered to be meta-physical in nature; the nature of our soul and the need to assign meaning to life (beyond mere survival).
A beautiful paradox that one might or might not agree with: although life is not consciousness, strangely enough for us, consciousness is life.
As in chaos theory, combining biological subsystems to make a bigger system, that is considered to be living, such as a bacterium (or else) is more than just the combination of their properties. The constituting subsystems are not inert with respect to each other. Instead there is crosstalk, which results in emergent properties of the entire system, none of which were part of the subsystems. This concept has nothing magical or superstitious about it. It is merely the manifestation of the butterfly effect in chaos theory. Emergence adds a layer of complexity that is much more difficult to unravel than to understand subsystems individually because it requires a full understanding of all subsystems and their mutual interactions. In any case, the reductionist approach is necessary to get to this stage because it simplifies the initial characterization of subsystems.
Correlations
The survey was created with the possibility to do correlation calculations on certain questions after all the results were obtained. There are strict guidelines on how to conduct a survey when it is used to show cross-correlations between the results of multiple questions, to show significance levels of typical levels, or to be able to generalize certain answers as if the whole group supports them. Although our survey does not completely follow these guidelines (the main aim of the survey was to raise awareness of the discussed ethical issues), some correlations were calculated for the proof of principle.

Finally, the player-side interface should be a relatively simple HTML and Javascript page, containing an embedded video player with the video stream, and passing on keyboard or button presses as GET requests. Button presses would be easier, as the video player might have a tendency to ""steal"" keyboard input from the rest of the page.
The above is sufficient to implement an initial prototype.

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
EMSA on both the Tn5 and dxCas9 portion of the fusion showed that these portion individually were able to load adapter or sgRNA and EPO. Following this, integration assay was performed to test the integration of adapter DNA by fusion protein.
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

Tianjin,2014,Team:Tianjin#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," discussion on our projects. We each  made a presentation and exchanged the ideas on both. Through their  illustrating, we were well impressed by general idea and delicate design of their  project. Apart from the project, we also consulted Professor Zhang Xunwen from School of Aerospace Engineering on some  experimental devices, namely an ammeter with accuracy at a magnitude of 10-12.  Though we didn’t get the proper device at last, we gained a lot of helpful  suggestions. We did learn a lot!
This meeting helped us come to a better  understanding and not only of the limitations of our project itself but also of  the innovative thinking for developing an overarching structure for a new  biological system.
（3）Cooperation with NKU iGEM 2014
We carried out a work of mutually help  collaborating with Nankai   University iGEM Team. We planned  to help each other in several ways. To begin with, we launched a exchange  conference in Oct 13, 2014. Both team made a brief introduction about the  project firstly. Through their illustration, we were pleased to know that their  project is about the synthesis of rhamnolipid from microbes to assist the oil  exploitation. Then our team introduced our project and shared the experiences  and difficulties on the experiments. In the following part of “Prospecting”, we  exchanged our idea about our project on potential applications and blueprinted  our further cooperation.
In  addition, due to the lack of experiences and related laboratory reagents, we  were not able to do SDS-PAGE to identify our target protein and roughly  estimate its concentration. So they helped us do the SDS-PAGE and analyze the  results. We were very grateful about that!
④Collaborations
In this busy but unforgettable summer, we  have devoted our greatest passion; put all the thoughts in the iGEM  competition, so as the companions from other universities, I believe. Luckily,  however, we utilized our strengths to aid members of the iGEM community and  received considerable kind and helpful instructions from other teams so that we  can get through many tough moments or come up with new ideas by these joint  efforts.
Collaboration  with Beijing Institute of Technology（BIT）
BIT iGEM team and our team have collaborated  in mutual.

We are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).  We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.

Can we detect enzyme inhibition in waste water?
In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water. We performed this experiment using triplicates of 15 nM P. falciparum FabI. It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water…
This shows that our biosensor works in waste water!

Confirm inhibition data in waste water correlates to known levels of triclosan in a wide variety of waste water samples
Continue rounds of enzyme engineering to enhance another 60-fold (~10 more 1.5 folds… or 1 60-fold)
Forward predictions based on unknown samples where the biosensor, ELISA, and MS are used in parallel
