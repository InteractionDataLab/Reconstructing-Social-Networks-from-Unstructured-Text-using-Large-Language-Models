miRNAs function as posttranscriptional regulators which have distinguished features compared to transcriptional regulators, intervening late in gene expression process, with the capability to counteract variation from the upstream processes (Margaret et al., 2012). Research shows that while conducting experiment on an incoherent feedforward motif in mammalian cells, posttranscriptional regulation results in superior adaptation behavior, higher absolute expression levels and lower intrinsic fluctuations (Bleris et al., 2011). miRNAs can serve as buffers against variation during gene expression; transient increases in transcription factor activity would propagate to increases in target miRNA transcription while would be counteracted by increased miRNA and vice versa. Therefore, under the miRNA posttranscriptional regulation, protein output can be uncoupled from fluctuations in transcription factor concentration or activity (Margaret et al., 2012). miRNAs also possess good stability which, consistent with theoretical constraints, meets the need for enough molecules of a regulator to achieve a small reduction in the noise of a target gene (Lestas et al., 2010).
Experimental Characterization
We took advantage of another fluorescent protein(mkate ) as reference gene, which has no influence in our design. Published literature generally supports the view that in transient transfections, fluorescence depends linearly on the copy number of transfected plasmids (Tseng et al, 1997; Pollard et al, 1998;Cohenet al,2009; Schwakeet al, 2010). While strictly speaking, this reporter level also depends on many other potentially fluctuating parameters such as global synthesis and degradation rates(Leonidas Bleris et al,2011),it is more legitimately use the normalized quotient to instead of the value of EYFP.
Apparently, the output of circuit C is lower than circuit B .Having the negative feedback compared with circuit B, the expression of EYFP in circuit A is strongest. Then we analysed the output of constructed designs varies with the DNA copy number. Facing with the difficulty of counting the copy number directly, we employed the reference gene to reflect .We think the copy number is high when the expression intensity of mkate is strong. One hundred thousand positive Hela cells was collected to obtain the relationship between EYFP and make.
From the figure 2, we learned with the increase of the expression intensity of makte, the specific valve of EYFP and mkate decreases. In another word, the circuit A’s output reaches saturation fast with the increase of copy number. We came to a conclusion circuit"

PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Agarose gels were prepared using 0.8% (w/v) agarose, 1× TAE buffer (40mM Tris, 20mM acetic acid, and 1mM EDTA), 1× SYBR® Safe DNA gel stain and then run at 115 V in an electrophoresis chamber for 40-60 minutes. Samples were loaded into the gel with 1× of DNA gel loading dye (NEB). A 1kb DNA ladder (NEB) was used as molecular weight marker.
Moclo Assembly
Throughout the project two Moclo assembly protocols were evaluated, the first one in accordance to the CIDAR Moclo protocol consisting of: 10 fmol of each DNA component with up to six components total (for this case either double stranded synthetic gBlocks or previously made MoClo DNA parts as well as the appropriate destination vector), 10 U of BsmbI, BsaI or BbsI (NEB), 10 U of T4 DNA ligase (NEB), 1× T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB), and nuclease free water to at total volume of 20 μL. Reactions were performed using the next parameters: 1 cycle (37 °C), 15 cycles (37 °C 1.5–3 min, 16 °C 3–5 min), followed by 50 °C for 5 min and 80 °C for 10 min and were then held at 4 °C, afterwards using 5 µl of the reaction for the transformation protocol (Iverson et al. 2016). The second protocol was a modified version of the previous one, its main difference consisting in using a greater concentration of DNA: 100 ng of each part was combined with 50 ng of destination plasmid, while following the same parameters from the previous reaction (Moore et al. 2016).
However, due to several negative results from the level 1 assemblies, even after trying both assembly protocols, another level 1 acceptor plasmid, pSRKM_AE, was used. This plasmid was designed and provided by the MSc. Student Matin Nuhamunada.

MSU-Michigan,2017,Team:MSU-Michigan#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," transports the energy from mtrA to mtrC which is then capable of donating the electron to an external acceptor molecule. MtrB is the bridge between mtrA and mtrC, allowing the contact necessary for electron transport. In the absence of mtrB, it is predicted that mtrA will no longer associate with mtrC and therefore will hinder the external electron transport pathway.
Mtr External Electron Transportation pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 Lactate dehydrogenase metabolizes lactate to pyruvate, transferring the released electrons to a quinone cycle in the membrane. CymA, coordinated the transfer of electrons from the quinone pool to mtrA. MtrB facilitates the interaction between mtrA and mtrC as the electrons flow to mtrC where they are accepted by an external molecule.

3.Reporting part
        Because cell lysis process usually happens extremely fast, we set a threshold that when the degradation of outer membrane is over 0.5, the cell lyses and intracellular proteins come into the system completely. After the cell lysis, β-galactosidase comes out of the cell, accumulates to a relatively high concentration and produces oNP, a colored substrate which can be easily detected by any kind of photographic equipment.
4.The whole process
        Eventually, we put all the four parts together, and finished the buildup of the model, which is shown in the flow chart.
        Getting such a flow chart isn't a hard work, but parameters fitting can recede one's hairline. Table below is the theoretical fitted value of the parameters used in the model. The match result of the model and the wet lab data is shown in the figure.
        As a result, our model successfully predicted the result of wet lab, not only that the protein concentration of SRRz matches the real value, but also that our model realizes a cell lysis process at about 3.6x103, which is approximately an hour, matching the wet lab data. We must greatly thank the Simbiology program of matlab for the help of the modeling work.

Macquarie iGEM 2016
We're building on the work of last year's Macquarie University iGEM team by transforming E. coli with the genes required to complete the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and create Photosystem II in this bacterial species. These systems will allow for the use of solar energy to split water into positively-charged hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen. Our next goal is then to combine the hydrogen ions and electrons produced in this hydrolytic process in a hydrogenase enzyme complex in order to produce hydrogen gas.

Synthetase and tRNA are constitutivly expressed in a plasmid with low copy replicon, taking into account that expression results in metabolic stress, but are not under IPTG control for he purpose of avoiding abrupt and unpredictable effects considering extra time and energy needed for their assembly. Whereas the reporter plasmid containig two fluorescence proteins, is kept under operon control for IPTG induction likewise on a low copy plasmid with ColE1.
Figure 7: reporter plasmid pRXG
This reporter plasmid and the corresponding measurement of protein formation is previously used in both an amberless E.coli strain and BL21 DE3 gold. The use of the latter is resulting in competion of the supressor tRNA with release factor one at the amber stop codon at the usual 321 amber stop codons. Most synthetases are used with low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The reporter should also be used with a low copy replicon. Assemble the part provided here into a low copy plasmid, make sure to use replicons from different incompatibility groups, eg. ColE1 and p15A and different selection markers. Keep under operon control for induction. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

In the process of reviewing articles, we also found that a certain amount of lactate is produced during the yeast fermentation, which has a strong inhibitory effect on the whole beer fermentation system.
We had cooperated with Fujian Normal University. Under the guidance of the students of Fujian Normal University, we had visited the beer factory inside the college to learn about the whole production line of beer production and the function of each step. In the course of the visiting, we retrieved a portion of the beer fermentation liquid to observe the experiment, and used chemical methods to detect the lactic acid content in the fermentation process.

S. pneumoniae σx promoters module
Figure 1. σx-Com-Box promoter mechanism
The reporter system contains a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for Com-Box promoter induction. σx will then bind to Com-Box promoter and express green fluorescence protein. The whole construct was built in E. coli DH10B strain.
In order to achieve the functionality of pneumosensor, we must have a highly specific reporting system which will only give fluorescent signal under the presence of S. pneumoniae. In search for the suitable gene circuit, the discovery by Prof. Morrison on the competence for genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae which depends on quorum-sensing system to control many competence-specific genes acting in DNA uptake, processing, and integration has provided the ideal framework for this module. (Lee and Morrison, 1999) There is a link between this quorum-sensing system and the competence-specific genes, which is an alternative σx (ComX protein) that serves as a competence-specific global transcription modulator. (Luo and Morrison, 2003) In S. pneumoniae, competence (a state capable of being genetic transformed) happens transiently during the log phase growth, and is regulated by a quorum sensing system utilizing the Competence Signal Peptide (CSP). Upon stimulation by CSP, σx will be expressed and associated with RNA polymerase apoenzyme. The resulting holoenzyme will then be guided by σx to initiate transcription of a set of “late” genes enabling genetic transformation and other unknown functions. Characterized genes regulated by σx were found to contain an 8 base pairs consensus sequence TACGAATA known as the Cin-Box or the Com-Box. (Piotrowski, Luo, & Morrison, 2009). Taking advantage of this competence-specific mechanism, it is now"

Other:...
Venter et al.
One of the biggest contributors to synthetic biology research and possibly the most controversial researcher in (synthetic) biology is Craig J. Venter. His project on creating a minimal genome is groundbreaking and raises a lot of questions, primarily by media machinery. How does the synthetic-biology-research community think about his research and bold statements?
References: Check, 2002 | Conner, 2008
4. Craig Venter is one of the lead researchers in the minimal genome project. He intends to synthesize a bacterial genome from scratch, and then insert it into a cell (a Mycoplasma bacterium, from which the original genome is removed) to see if it can have the normal functions of the organism (Hutchison, 2003). Do you think Venter's approach is typically new?
Yes, his approach is novel; he uses new techniques
No, he just uses genetic engineering principles
Other:
5. (See previous question) Venter says he will be able to create a life form artificially. What is your perception on his statement?
Venter is playing God by trying to create a new life form artificially
Venter is only applying genetic engineering to artificially change this bacterium
Other:
6. (See previous question) What do you think the perception of the public would be?
Venter operates controversially by trying to create a new life form artificially
It is just research, he is not able to really create life. He is only able to put biological components together
Other:
Risks
As outlined in the background information section, one of the main issues in synthetic biology concerns bio-safety and security. To obtain information on how researchers in the field think about this subject, we questioned the relevance of these concerns. Both the dangers of errors and terrors are addressed, as well as the attitude towards risk-taking in this emerging field of science.
References: Caplan, 2009 | Adams, 2009
7. Synthetic biology may enable us to create biological systems artificially. There is a possibility that someone will create something dangerous. Are you afraid that synthetic biology might result in the production of a biological system containing some sort of error, which makes it hazardous?
Yes, I acknowledge this possibility, but think it is not significant because there is sufficient regulation
Yes, I recognize that this is a possible outcome and think new regulations/policies should be enforced, to minimize this possibility
No, I think that researchers approach synthetic biology careful enough"

Der var så dejligt ude på landet; det var sommer, kornet stod gult, havren grøn, høet var rejst i stakke nede i de grønne enge, og der gik storken på sine lange, røde ben og snakkede ægyptisk, for det sprog havde han lært af sin moder. Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet! Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#proof#domain_-_-_TEXT.html,"ch et al., 2009). Central region of TAL protein generally consists of 10 – 18 highly similar tandem repeats. Each repeat is 34 amino acids long. Almost all but two hypervariable amino acids at positions 12 and 13, between different repeats and different TAL effectors are conserved. As reported, these two amino acids define the binding properties of a single tandem repeat. Tandem repeats are interchangeable in nature, and can be shuffled as needed. What is most important, the code for recognition of specific nucleotide in DNA sequence by hypervariable pairs of amino acids is known. Because of modular nature and known recognition code TAL proteins seem to be an ideal platform for designing novel specific DNA-binding proteins with uniform properties.
Figure 1: Modular structure of synthetic TAL DNA-binding protein. Each box represents one of the tandem repeats in the central DNA-binding region. Hypervariable pairs of amino acids defines binding specificity and are marked with red triangles. Predicted binding nucleotide is given next to each pair of amino acids.
We designed TAL protein with the same predicted binding sequence as Tet operator. For purpose of our project only central DNA-binding domain of TAL protein was preserved, but parts of N-terminal, and C-terminal regions were eliminated, since they have been shown to mediate signaling and transcriptional effects in plants. This modified nucleotide sequence was assembled on a computer and the actual synthetic gene was ordered at GeneArt company. We confirmed specific binding of our novel TAL protein to Tet operator in vivo, using our universal device . At the end we decided not to choose TAL effectors as DNA binding domains for our project, mainly because designing TAL proteins is still in its early stage.
Zinc fingers
At the end we chose zinc finger proteins as DNA binding domains for our project. Zinc finger proteins form a small, independently folded zinc containing mini domain that recognizes specific nucleic acid sequence. They are present in eukaryotic cells as transcriptional factors and are involved in regulation of endogenous gene expression by specific DNA binding. However, some zinc finger proteins are able to bind to RNA or proteins as well. It is estimated that human genome encodes for more than 700 Cys2His2 zinc finger coding genes, thus being the most common DNA-binding proteins in eukaryotes. Nevertheless, recent biochemical and phylogenetical studies confirmed that they aren't restricted only to eukaryota but are also present in prokaryotes.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"modified parent strain: growth rate, toxic effects and growth requirements.
Effect of the synthetic organism on the environment
In case the modified bacteria finds a niche in the environment, it may interact with other organisms as well as with the environment itself (e.g. changing the composition of the soil). The risk of a synthetic bacteria affecting the food webs and the biodiversity of the ecosystems is difficult to assess, as it will depend on the environment considered, and a lot of unknown factors will come into play (e.g. the bacterial composition of any ecosystem is still unknown). In our opinion, the best approach would be to decide the most likely environments where a spread of the synthetic organism might happen, based on two conditions: native environment of the unmodified parent strain and the environments where the synthetic cell will be applied. Once a limited number of environments have been selected, samples will be inoculated with the genetically modified bacteria in a controlled environment. Using metagenomic analysis, the samples will be studied to look for synergistic or toxic effects that the synthetic bacteria might have caused in the natural population.
Evolution and adaptation of the synthetic organism
Environmental supplementation happens when the environment contains a component that will render the biocontainment method useless and therefore will allow the bacteria to proliferate. Both horizontal gene transfer and mutagenic drift work at the DNA level, directly inactivating the biocontainment mechanisms or unlocking an alternative way for the bacteria to survive. Although the environmental supplementation and horizontal gene transfer might be difficult to predict (because they depend on a great extent on the specific ecosystem where the organism has been released), the mutagenic drift can be easily assessed by detecting escapees after the biocontained population has been inoculated in non-permissive media. The recommended limit for the number of escapees is 1 out of 108 [9].
Gene transfer from synthetic to natural organisms
Inactivating biocontainment mechanisms is not the only problem associated with horizontal gene transfer. Genetic material can also be transferred from synthetic organisms to natural ones, with possible threatening consequences (e.g. antibiotic resistance). Therefore, the ability of the synthetic organisms for sharing genetic material should be assessed. This could be assessed by mixing the synthetic strain with the natural one. After a time of co-culture, the genetic transfer could be identified through FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), using three different markers: one for the synthetic sequence, the second one for a specific sequence of the synthetic strain and the third one for a specific sequence of the natural strain. The number of genetic transfers will then be analyzed by microscopy or flow cytometry. The recommended limit"

We miniprepped pC13CO, pC13BA, pC13CL cultures and need to quantify and prep for sequencing. We ran a colony PCR on streaked pC13BA and pC13C plates and got a definite correct insert on pC13BA, and a lot of nonspecific amplification on pC13CL. We will run a digest screen and sequence. pC13BF colonies were quantified and gel screened and PgpdA was amplified from G. lucidum DNA, digested, and gel screened.

Another project we had was a ‘BioBreakroom’ – an escape room, based on life sciences knowledge. An escape room is a physical adventure game in which players are locked in a room and have to use elements of the room to solve a series of puzzles and escape within a set time limit. Escape rooms are very popular in Lithuania nowadays. Our ‘BioBreakroom’ was life sciences themed: it had a microscope, Petri dishes with fake medium and fake bacteria and some other basic lab equipment such as lab coats, gloves, falcons and so on. Participants had to use their biological knowledge, such as using periodic table of elements, recognizing and using Sanger sequencing gel picture, translating DNA into amino acids using codon table and other, in order to complete the quest of saving the future from a heavily pathogenic bacteria, synthetically created by a mad scientist. All puzzles were created to introduce school students to basic lab equipment and enthuse them about scientific work. We also exposed the problem of lab safety while working with microorganisms: participants had to pick the fake medium to take out a note. For this, players should have used gloves and a pair of tweezers that were provided. The note inside warned about unsafe behaviour with unknown, potentially harmful microorganisms, which were obviously let into the environment and most likely infected people in the area during the picking process.
We held eight sessions of 45 minutes. All the times were booked in a day weeks before the event, we were greatly satisfied with such interest. 8 teams, each consisting of 5 people of school and university students or scientists participated in our ‘BioBreakroom’. Some puzzles may have been too difficult for younger participants but university students and scientists proved their intelligence and successfully ‘saved the world from dangerous bacteria’. We received very positive feedback from all the teams. We hope that these activities have shown both – demanding and fun sides of science and that the participants were engaged in seeking further knowledge on the scientific fields.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"ynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi"

Integrative standard vector for yeast
Here, a detailed description of the integrative vector for the yeast S. cerevisiae is reported.
The structure of the designed vector, here named <partinfo>BBa_K300001</partinfo>, is shown in Fig.17. Most of its features have been inspired by the pUG6 plasmid (GenBank: AF298793.1), constructed by [Guldener U et al., 1996]. The parts notation is reported in Fig.18.
Figure 17: BioBrick integrative base vector <partinfo>BBa_K300001</partinfo>.
Figure 18: Parts notation.
This is an integrative vector which can be used to insert the desired RFC10-compatible BioBrick parts/devices/systems into the genome of S. cerevisiae. This vector can also be specialized to target the desired integration site in the host genome.
The default version of this backbone targets the Gal system of the S288C strain (<partinfo>BBa_K300979</partinfo>) through the two homologous regions <partinfo>BBa_K300986</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K300987</partinfo>. The Gal system is not essential for yeast survival if the strain is grown on carbon sources other than galactose.
This vector enables multiple integrations in different positions of the same genome. The usage of the KanMX dominant selection marker can avoid the usage of auxotrophic markers. In the industrial framework auxotrophies are usually deleterious for the process productivity because they affect the growth rate of cells. For this reason, this vector can be a concrete solution for the design of industrial yeast strains with novel user-defined functions.
Glossary
A HR (Homologous Region) is a sequence that can recombine with the host genome.
As explained for the integrative vector for E. coli, the passenger is the desired DNA part to be integrated into the genome.

Sporulation Tuning
The bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, used in our project is a gram-positive soil bacterium that, under certain conditions, would commit itself to a developmental pathway leading to the production of spores.(Predich, M., et al; 1992) Therefore, in this section of our project, we hope to control sporulation in our bacterial population, such that we can decide how much of the population becomes spores, and how much continue as vegetative cells. Should the cell sporulate, it would become a ‘metal container’, trapping the sequestered cadmium in its spore.
After the cell sequesters cadmium into its spore, it should not germinate or the sequestered cadmium will be released back into the environment as a result. Therefore, the role of chassis comes into play, where the sleB and cwlJ germination-defective mutants are put into use.
In order to control sporulation, our team is proposing the idea of inducing the synthesis of KinA, with IPTG as a sporulation initiation signal.
Chassis
Since the main aim of our project is to sequester cadmium in the environment into the spores of our engineered B. subtilis, but what happens after the cadmium has been sequestered?
Do we attempt to retrieve the sequestered cadmium? Or, do we simply leave the sequestered cadmium in the spores of our engineered B. subtilis?
For our project, we have chosen the latter. We will not be attempting to retrieve the sequestered cadmium. However, then comes the question of, would there not be chances of the cadmium entering the environment again?
Our solution to this question would be to disable germination of the spores, thus retrieval of the sequestered cadmium becomes unnecessary, as the spores can persist intact for thousands of years.
While we would like to disable germination for the spores that contain sequestered cadmium, not all the cells would have sequestered cadmium, and it is also essential that"

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#perception_-_-_TEXT.html," realization: People have the legitimate right to be opposed to synthetic biology. There is no link between ignorance of SB and rejection of its applications Second realization: Every citizen should have a say in what technologies they want or do not want. Experts should not be the ones making the final call! Third realization: Education is very important. The aim should be to give people all the necessary tools to understand what exactly is going on, and so that they can therefore discuss in the most illuminated way possible if they want or not the technology as part of their world (education’s aim should absolutely not be making people agree with us and accept synthetic biology! This vision is dangerous!!!)
I came from Physics and until last year I didn't know anything about synthetic biology and biodegradation. However, I was always interested in projects intended to save the world. Or, at least, how to deal with problems caused by humanity? Due to that, I always was concerned about the big amount of waste produced by peoples. After I learned that Synthetic biology develops methods to solve those problems, I came up with the idea to degrade insecticide using bacteria, but with a delay: first, to kill insects, and after some delay, to degrade insecticide to avoid side effects. At that time, I had no idea about gene transfer, and that scientists don't release any synthetic bacteria to the environment. For me it was really surprising! How we could benefit from such great ideas like iGEM projects without having any possibility to use bacteria outside the lab? A lot of question appeared. Is it possible to create a safe containment system? What is the risk? Would ordinary citizens be interested in such projects? Those questions gave rise to our iGEM project, and human practice in parallel with theoretical and laboratory work partially gave me an answer to it.
What I found good from the Human practice part, was the interview we had with specialists, which was very interesting, because we could have had different point of views, and in the same time some really good and rich discussions.  Also the report was good for me to keep a trace of the historical events that drive us in our situation. The debate was a good idea and we couldn't have expected more from it.
Concerning teaching to the high school student synthetic biology, it's very disturbing for me, because in one hand, biotech companies give tools to high schools to build transgenic crops, in order to make their reputation better and not in a total altruistic way. On the other hand, we suggest to teach synthetic biology to kids, and for me it's hard to"

Chemoinduction Rationale
In a batch culture system, a defined volume of media is innoculated with a small number of cells. If the cells are being used for protein production, it is vital that synthesis is initiated at the right time. The optimum time for protein production is when there are a large number of rapidly dividing cells in a nutrient rich media.
We therefore choose to induce the system at a critical cell density: below which the cells would be in too early a stage of growth, and above which the culture media may be too far depleted of resources to achieve optimal protein production.

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," start to finish whereas a living being like a bacterium cannot. Thus it appears that the use the word machine is somewhat misleading, because biology is much more complicated than that.
For the competition, we have to build genetic constructs called Biobricks. The name Biobrick is a reminder of the Lego game and this parallel further asks the question of synthetic biology being conceived as an assembly game.
Hence we asked ourselves the extent to which we could consider our experiments commonplace or ordinary.
Human:
Our reflection on these ethical issues led us to realize that the reluctance towards the modification of living organisms could be linked to an anthropocentric vision of the world. Indeed, as long as human actions do not have an impact on man himself, they do not cause much reaction.
However, it has been shown that bacteria are extremely numerous in nature and that they are even a part of human beings (digestive system…). The relationship between humans and environmental bacteria is close, and even more so with the bacteria in our body. Indeed a symbiosis between man and specific bacteria is essential to its survival, and we can wonder what the impact of the modification of bacteria interacting (closely or not) with human beings will be.
Anthropocentrism, which places human beings above everything and particularly above nature, is the utilitarian vision. Naturalists on the contrary believe that nature takes precedence over humans and must be protected from their utilization. For them, humans are not above nature, they are at a level with non-human elements.
Law:
Ethics is in close relationship with law, especially when it comes to modifying living organisms.
If we focus on the human being, according to the law, his body does not belong to him, he only has a right of use. This means that he cannot sell, rent or modify his body.
On a closer scale, mammals, and for instance domestic animals like cats, are less obvious but still recognized legal entities. They are granted sensibility, have a status of slave, their master is held responsible for their actions, and the law protects them to a certain extent.
Finally, some organisms are qualified as “res nullus”. This includes for instance bees, bacteria and all other micro-organisms. Nevertheless the loss of a bacterial colony does not affect us emotionally in the same way the loss of a swarm does. Invisible organisms hold less emotional importance in our eyes.
Connection to nature:
The link we keep with nature is complex and ambivalent. On one hand, we consider nature as fragile and in need of protection whereas on the other hand we see it as strong enough to provide all the resources we"

We had similar problems in the synthesis of our Apa-const-Promoter + LacI cassette + LacI promotor + RBS-PezT + Terminator-Bam-Hind construct. When we analysed the insert, it revealed  to be only about 1000 bp but it was expected to be 2500bp. Unfortunately we had not enough time to repeat the necessary construction steps. While we could not detect the right inserts, we could detect the 2100 bp long backbone of the pSB1C3 plasmids (see figure 6).

HP-Overview
     Human practice is an important part of iGEM. As future scientists, we mainly focused on scientific research which may create new applications and method used in everywhere and everything. Nevertheless, we also have a great responsibility about what and how we provide them.
     As stem cells therapy is unfamiliar for most of the people, we outstretched our project into the discussion of the safety and efficiency of stem cell therapy. So we discussed with lots of fellows and experts in CCiC about our project and the concern of medical treatments. We also introduced the concept and highlights about stem cell therapy to senior high school students and presented our ideas in SYSU-Bio-festival (an important activity in our university) to promote the treatments of stem cells and allow more people to know them. Furthermore, we set up a questionnaire to collect people’s opinions on stem cell therapy.
     During CCiC, iGEMers from different team were also helpful with advice on how we could improve our system. We harvested suggestions for our experiments, poster and presentation.
     For communication with the teams in SYSU, we helped SYSU-Medicine and SYSU-Software with the vital issues during the whole iGEM process and they also gave helpful advice to us. We also collaborated with SZU and FAFU.

Prediction of adenylation domain specificity
antiSMASH predicts NRPS clusters by patially Hidden Markov Models. It also predicts a consensus product by integrating three different methods for predictions of adenylation domain specificity These methods are: NRPSpredictor2, Stachelhaus, and Minova et al.  [7,11]. Stachelhaus et al. alligned the binding pocket of 160 adenylation domains using a structural alignment approach. By trimming of the sequence 10 core amino acids encoding specificity in the binding pocket was identified giving rise to the Stachelhaus code (Table # MISSING). In addition, it was shown that by modying the binding pocket in silico substrate affinity could be altered or relaxed  [4].​
Prediction is sometimes complicated by the fact that adenylation domains sometimes show more or less variability in amino acid specificity. In addition, the Stachelhaus code show some redundance in the 160 sequences [4]. Tyrocidine is an example of this. Tyrocidine is a commercially available mixture of non-ribosomal antibiotic synthesized by Brevibacillus parabrevis. It consists of four decapeptides varying at three "

As our experimental condition is limited, we just did experiments on chemotaxis towards succinate and malate. What’s more, in an attractant gradient, the chemoreceptors monitor chemoeffector concentration changes as they move around. And they use that information to modulate the probability of the next tumbling event. And we searched the pattern of their chemotaxis towards a concentration gradient of attractant using capillary assay. The results are demonstrated below.
Results
We did both agar assay and capillary assay to detect the response of E.coli to different attractants and different concentrations of each attractant. Because the agar assay (Fig.3) is difficult to replicate and collect the data from, we just show the results of capillary assay (Fig.4) . We made a negative control using washing buffer and five concentration gradients (100mM/10mM/1mM/0.01mM/0.0001mM) of attractants. These E.colis were divided into three groups based on the plasmid they have been transformed into. The plasmids are biobricks, BBa_K608003 and BBa_K515102 (they are from 5A and 8F wells in plate1), and the McfR plasmid was designed by us. BBa_K608003 (5A) only has a strong promoter and medium RBS, so it doesn’t have specific chemotaxis towards TCA intermediates. BBa_K515102 (8F) is a biobrick from 2011_Imperial_College_London, which responds to L(-)malic acid (HO2CCH2CH(OH)CO2H).
Fig.3 Agar assay: The three plates shows the chemotaxis results of 8F towards three kinds of attractants, malate, citrate and succinate from left to right. The filter paper of attractants is put on the left, the PBS is put on the right, bacteria is in the middle. Here, 8F swims fastest to malate.

The cells were diluted 20000 times. 5A is a control which doesn’t have chemotaxis towards malate or succinate.
Malate: 8F showed the strongest respond. The tendency of curve of 8F was biphasic with maximums at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and 10-5"

We will check the plates tomorrow hopefully to find plaques showing that arabinose triggered lysis of our lambda. We unfortunately didn't get any growth of our TT25821, so we streaked another plate from our original stab sample and we will try to re-electroporate TT23821 on Friday.
5/31/13
KK, KP NO! Our work over these past few weeks reached its climax today ... we checked our plates, but no dice. No plaques, that is. Lambda was not induced out of lysogeny. We are asking ourselves these questions: Was CRO not actually ligated into our vector? Are our plates not good (we used year old plates)? CRO, when overexpressed, downregulates itself; is there too high a concentration of CRO? Or is it possible that CRO alone isn't a sufficient factor to induce lysis. Dr. Grose talked with us, and told us she had our sequencing!! The results were depressing but revelatory: the sequence for CRO is not in our vector! So, on Monday we will begin the cloning process again. Today we set up a PCR reaction to amplify CRO from strains TT9901 and TT9907 template DNA.
6/3/13
-KK KP Our PCR product was consistent with every other attempt to amplify CRO: it failed. Consistency is only a virtue if you're not a screw-up :) Anyway, our gel showed a faint band at the 300 base pair level, but too faint to be considered successful. We considered a list of reasons why our PCR reaction is failing and discussed them with Dr. Grose: We boiled our template DNA for 10 minutes, but Dr. Grose recommends 5 minutes We added 1 microliter of template; Dr. Grose likes to add 2 microliters. We did not use a master mix to combine our reagents with our template DNA. We added each reagent individually to each tube. Because we are pipetting such small volumes, there is a lot of room for error this way. The Phusion program we used was set to an annealing temperature that was 1 degree too low for Phusion. We did the PCR reaction one more time with Dr. Grose. Tomorrow we expect to see an enormous, fat, band!

ColumbiaNYC,2017,Team:ColumbiaNYC#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," central dogma. We explained synthetic biology, biological circuits, and we demonstrated gene knockdown with Jenga blocks, in that when critical genes are knocked down (or when critical Jenga blocks are removed), this makes a significant impact to the rest of the cells (the Jenga tower falls). For the students ages 10 to 11, we taught them about the DNA, RNA, and the central dogma in more detail, and we explained synthetic biology and our iGEM project. We gave the students an activity for them to write their initials using codons and cut out DNA bases to glue together the bases that make up these codons. This activity was adapted from the DNA name activity made by the 2013 BGU Israel iGEM team, using their DNA letter cut outs and codon table.
Synthetic Biology Initiative
Our team also partook in a collaboration to create and distribute synthetic biology postcards to educate the public during       lectures. The synthetic biology lecture series is hosted by the Columbia University Synthetic Biology Initiative, which       is a club that we created this year to foster science and advance the interest and public understanding of synthetic       biology on our campus and the surrounding NYC community. Within the club, over fifty members are already working on       creating synthetic biology podcasts, video series, and educational curriculum.
Club activities include:
Provide universal synthetic biology education for individuals at all levels of learning (middle school, high school,         undergraduate, and beyond)
Develop consistent podcast discussing current topics in synthetic biology
Create Khan Academy style videos on YouTube channel for everyone to enjoy
Inviting speakers to come talk about biohacking
Brainstorm project ideas for iGEM through journal club
Provide professional development panels and networking sessions with upperclassmen
Offer lectures on various topics in synthetic biology
Poster Sessions
Throughout the summer, we presented our project in various poster sessions, including Columbia's Science Research Symposium (7/31) and Summer Research Symposium (9/27), as well as the ISMMS (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) Undergraduate Research Symposium  (9/16). At the Mt.Sinai Undergraduate Symposium, we were awarded the ""outstanding poster presentation"" in the Cancer and Developmental Biology Track. All of these events were great opportunities to raise awareness of the world of synthetic biology and its applications, interact with the public, reach out to the community for input. The poster sessions allowed us to gauge public interest in our project over the course of the summer, providing us with valuable insight in its strengths and weaknesses, and how to move forward into producing a viable, functional and effective"

Spatial equilibrium model
Chemical reaction model description
Figure 1: Quorum sensing network. The arrows imply chemical reactions.
This model takes the form of a network of chemical reactions that simulate intracellular processes at the population level. Although the same processes seem anything but deterministic upon a closer look at the single cell, the individual variations can be assumed to be independent and identically distributed for each cell and their averaging eliminates the variability at the population level. Consequently, these chemical reactions are simulated as ordinary differential equations.
The centerpiece is AHL. AHL is the small, freely-diffusing molecule that mediates cell-to-cell communication: when AHL levels are low, the quorum sensing switch is turned off; when they’re high, the switch is turned on. The rest of the interactions concern the protein LuxI, which produces AHL, and LuxR, which binds it and then, activated, goes on to induce the “DNA”. The “DNA” species refers to plasmids carrying the Lux regulatory system. Its induction by (LuxR.AHL)2 marks the off->on transition; when most of the DNA is in the (uninduced) “DNA’ form, the switch is off; when most of it is in the “DNA.(LuxR.AHL)2” form, the switch is on.
Figure 2: Dilution mechanism that keeps the growth rate and the cell density constant. These are the conditions modelled in [ 1 ](Adapted from [ 1 ]).
Supplementary to the core QS functionality, DNA undergoes duplication and AHL undergoes diffusion between 2 spaces: the “internal” (intracellular) and the “external”. To understand the latter process, consider all the bacterial cytoplasms conjoined in a single volume separated by a membrane from the outside.
This model has originally been built to simulate an entire bacterial population living in constant exponential growth conditions in a constant volume with continuous dilution.. We consider these conditions not to influence the cell’s internal mechanisms significantly though and expand their approach to other living conditions, only adjusting the DNA duplication and AHL diffusion processes.
We built this first"

Göteborg är Sveriges näst största, och Nordens femte största tätort med omkring 550 000 invånare i tätorten, och över 930 000 i Storgöteborg, se faktaruta. Staden ligger på västkusten vid Göta älvs mynning. Göteborg anlades på initiativ av kung Gustav II Adolf och fick sina stadsprivilegier 1621. Med anledning av sin stadsplanering, kallades Göteborg av holländarna under många år för Nya Amsterdam.[4] På 1800-talet industrialiserades Göteborg till stor del av inflyttade engelsmän och under denna tid fick Göteborg smeknamnet ""Lilla London"", vilket staden kallas än idag.

What are your plans after university?
In future I would like to be mostly focused on Stem Cells and Biomaterials in regard to their interplay in biological systems. Neverteless I am also interested in Cell Biology, Regenerative Medicine, Tissue Engineering and Neurobiology. I consider knowledge from this fields being a natural consequence of my fascination on Stem Cells. Therefore essential for my education and career. Nonetheless, I love Research in-between Biology and Engineering, I believe that in the world of Science elasticity and fast adaptation are the most important features. Therefore, I am trying to be a part of different projects and research fields if possible. In simple words, I think PhD or work for a company connected with my plans would be perfect.
Why did you join iGEM?
It seems to be really nice and interactive student initiative. I hoped to learn how to work in a new and challenging environment on something, which is totally new for me.

HBsu BioBrick Cloning Strategy
Details
Groningen plasmid Mini-prep
Aim:
To isolate the groningen plasmid.
Methods:
We performed a mini prep of the Groningen 2012 integration plasmid DNA grown in E.coli overnight at 37  ̊C. The purity was tested using NanoDrop .
We confirmed the insert size by first cut with fast digest XbaI and BamHI and then running the product on a gel to confirm the presence of the plasmid in the purified pDNA.
Results:
Figure 1: Gel electrophoresis of Groningen plasmid.
Lane 1: DNA Ladder
Lane 2: Uncut plasmid
Lane 3: XbaI
Lane 4: BamHI
Lane 5: XbaI and BamHI
Discussion:
The gel shows that in lane 5 where the plasmid is cut with both XbaI and BamHI, two fragments are present. This is what we expected to have happened as the plasmid is cut at two places, isolating an insert of interest. The smaller fragment is the insert (RFP reporter gene) while the bigger fragment is the plasmid backbone.
BioGame
Further work on the game architecture has been done today. The main BioBrick class been created to provide common methods that all BioBricks will use. A very basic BioBrick has been created, and can be added upon touch to the Bacteria. This is simply to demonstrate what will happen when a BioBrick is added and the possibilities therein.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," showed that it was possible to integrate a linear PCR product with an antibiotic cassette that replaces the gene encoding the DNA endonuclease Dns in V. natriegens by using natural transformation. Around 1-10% of the population had integrated the transforming DNA (Dalia et al.2017) this is the highest rate of transformation in competent species (Lorenz et al.1994) . Thus it was shown that a natural transformation can be well used to perform a scarfree genome editing (Dalia et al.2017) .
A big advantage of the method is that it is possible to perform many genome changes together, where you only need one antibiotics cassette. Therefore cells are incubated with a selected and an unselected product. The selected product had to contain an antibiotics cassette and the unselected product is used for the scarless genome editing of interest at the desired locus. This was also shown with a remarkably efficient up to 80% in V. natriegens (Daliaet al.2017) . MuGENT can be used to rapidly generate V. natriegens strains with several large, scarless genome edits without off- targeting effects at high efficiency.That can be used to prepare highly complex mutant population. Many methods are described for modifying the genome of bacteria, but the great advantage of MuGENT is that it is not limited to small chances. You can efficiently swap, insert or remove whole units. In the future natural transformation could be utilized in combination with genome engineering methods like MAGE and CAGE, which rely on electroporation for E.coli, that could allow more rapid genome designs, such as complete codon reassignments.
The Flp/frt system
There are several methods available to manipulate bacterial chromosomes. As the strain engineering subgroup, we had to decide which kind of strategy to use. Since iGEM means a lot of work in a very short time, we decided to look up for a method that further accelerates our project. We could use common plasmid based methods that rely on selection for plasmid excision followed by its loss. For Gram-negative bacteria these strategy often relies on counter selectable levan-sucrase enzyme, encoded by sacB (Donnenberg & Kaper 1991) . The excision can restore the genotype before insertion or result in an exchange between the chromosome and the plasmid-encoded copy of the modified gene. The disadvantage of this method is that it is time-consuming. First, you need to clone a plasmid and then horizontal gene transfer from a donor to V. natrieg"

As observed in Figure 1, the same unexpected trend is described when Munich’s Cas13a is dried with our CAHS 94205 , hence verifying our CAHS+Cas13a results.
Figure 4: Cas13a activity with CAHS 94205 in RNase Alert Assay by Munich. Fluorescence intensities over time triggered by RNase activity of Cas13a after drying with the TDP CAHS 94205, with and without crRNA and target RNA. Data from iGEM  Munich 2017.
Not only did their results help us discard a problem in our Cas13a or an experimental error as the issue, but also proved a similar behaviour of the TDPs in combination with our  Cas13a’s (which were actually based on the sequences of different organisms and purified according to different protocols) and therefore further substantiated the use of TDPs for the preservation of Cas13a.
Drylab Collaboration iGEM Munich
Both the iGEM TU Delft and iGEM LMU-TUM Munich teams realized that optimal crRNA is a prerequisite in utilizing Cas13a for their respective detection purposes. In addition to sensitively detecting a sequence of interest, modeling the off-target effects of a chosen crRNA is important in assessing the reliability of the system, as it provides information about the probability of a false positive output. Both teams took a different approach: we employed a kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) while iGEM LMU-TUM Munich applied an alignment algorithm. Please find the full model here .
Biophysical modeling has the advantage of providing a unified targeting framework that is able to take into account tiny (local) off-target effects that together may add to affect the reliability of the system. However, it is computationally intensive as compared to homology search and requires the development of the software, which is already available from NCBI for homology search.
We ran 4 off-target simulations for 2 different crRNAs spacer sequences (crRNA1-3 and crRNA4) designed by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA of two different bacterial species (E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis). The on and off-target activities are modeled for sequences on all possible frames on the genome (Figure 4). From the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," light response element in environmental light. The samples were incubated in normal lab lightning. The times indicated are times of the day, not incubation times.
The last plate was incubated in constant conditions (37 Celsius degrees and constant environmental light) throughout the experiment. Moreover, the conditions for all 20 samples were identical. The results are shown in the . Our first observation is that all the samples' fluorescence levels are very close to each other and all the samples have the same profile. It seems like only one sample has values different to the others (the sample with highest fluorescence in the end of the experiment). We also note that the fluorescence is very low in the first timepoint but already second timepoint has the same fluorescence levels as the rest of the points. This also suggest fast response to the change in conditions (here, change from the room temperature to 37 Celsius degrees right after the dilution). The fluorescence levels seems to correspond the constant blue light intensity 2.49 in .
When we examine the results from constant environmental light incubation, we see that the fluorescence level does not change significantly after the second timepoint. This contrasts to our hypothesis that cellular growth would affect the fluorescence levels. Otherwise we should able to see steady rise in fluorescence throughout time. As we see a steady growth in control sample fluorescence we can confirm that the cells are indeed growing in the experiment (assuming that the fluorescence in control sample is proportional to the cell density). The reason for such a steady fluorescence level remains to be undiscovered.
Even though we aimed to have as frequent measurements as possible, 20 minutes was the shortest possible interval in our measurements. This limit is affected by many different factors. First of all, we need to be able to maintain the incubation temperature as steady as possible. The measurements were carried out in room temperature which cools down our samples. We need to have long enough incubation period in between the measurements in order to let the cells thrive. Moreover, the measurements take some time, about 3 minutes per plate. It is reasonable to have incubation in 37 Celsius degrees for at least twice the time taken for measurements. Finally, there were other scientist using the Varioskan fluorometer which caused variability in our measurement interval.
Discussion
According to our experiments, the light response element seems to be capable of fourfold repression of GFP-LVA with blue light. This is already very good result but we need to evaluate whether this is enough for our lambda repressor system. Dodd et al. (2001) made experiments constructing two mutated versions of OR3 operator site. The other mutant (λr1)"

Collaborations
Apart from working on our project, our team also respect the “iGEM values” very much. We believe that through co-operating with other iGEM teams, we can share our passion and assist each other to create better results.
(1) Lab Work and Modelling Collaborations with City University of Hong Kong
For this collaboration, our team members visited each other’s university and presented our projects with the team members and professors. During the visit, we have reached an agreement on collaboration of which we would help them to do characterization on the expression of the lacZY gene. And they helped us to do a part of the modeling for the application part of our project.
CityU team provided us 2 plasmids for the characterization:
1. Pro LacZY
2. Pro LacZ(control)
Theoretically, only the E. coli containing LacZY would absorb ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (OPNG) which is a lactose analogue. Then the beta-galactosidase produced by the LacZY E. coli would convert the OPNG into galactose and ortho-nitrophenol, which is yellow in colour and absorbs at 420 nm. Therefore we can measure OD420 to monitor the expression of LacZY.
Procedures:
1. Prepare an overnight culture of LacZ and LacZY in E. coli.
2. Measure the OD420 of the overnight culture and dilute it into ~0.5 OD.
3. Add OPNG solution into the sample.
4. Measure OD420 at 20 min intervals.

Day 15: June 18, 2012
Sample search for partsregistry.org, which uses keyword search.
Project status update. Currently finding it difficult to dump the database into XML and converting it into RDF because of the huge amount of data—might try to separate the site into smaller parts. While we are not very hopeful with our group’s part of the research because of the size of the database we’re trying to crawl through, we still haven’t exhausted all options and so are continuing with the research. Trying to look for anything similar to what we’re trying to do that had been done in the past, either by previous iGEM teams or not. Reading through the team abstracts from 2008, we weren’t able to find any team who had tried to convert the Parts Registry into RDF format or, in general, tried to create a search engine for it, semantic or otherwise. Veronica did however manage to find something called Knowledgebase of Standard Biological Parts, “a Semantic Web resource for synthetic biology” which managed to transform information from the Parts Registry to make it computable. This seems to be what we are essentially aiming to create, so investigating more on how the this resource was created will hopefully help us progress from our current rut. If we managed to create a structure for the Parts Registry, we would be able to access the information from individual teams’ notebooks. Trying to mine just part of the data (breaking it up into smaller collections), building own crawler, what else is necessary to customize our own engine.
Day 16: June 19, 2012
Planned out the rest of the summer → starting to code/do technical feasibility checks. Initially, started research on web crawlers that pulled data from the Parts Registry website for the idea of having a semantic search engine for the Parts Registry among other things. However, because the process of trying to use Apache Jena is difficult, Conseulo suggested to use a Google Custom Search Engine through C# and have results pop up on a window. Managed to implement Google Custom Search Engine using C#, which is displayed in a DataGrid. Casey managed to code up a server which enables him to drag an image file from a tablet to a window and have it appear on the desktop computer. Linda managed to figure out a format for a data sheet for a part. Going to work on testing out how to search through PubMed and iGEM. Will check the quality of the custom search results compared to"

Characterizing Attitudes on Social Media
Misgivings from Misunderstandings
        The frontier between biotechnology and the public acceptance is a frontier we have been losing lately. With major corporations such as Ben & Jerry's and Chipotle switching to GMO-free foods, the momentum of public opinion towards biotechnology is shrinking the ground underneath our feet. Stirring up the fear of synthetic biology is a misinformation, distributed faster than ever on the internet. If we do not begin tackling public perceptions, the inertia of this movement may defeat this field before it can reach its pinnacle.
...To the internet!
        This is not a trivial issue. Why do people share certain pieces of information over others? To study this question, we turn to the largest social media site on the web: Facebook. With 1.19 billion active users last quarter on this networking website, the trends in sharing and liking can give us insight into what draws people to certain information. Using a Facebook tool to computationally extract article titles, likes, shares, and comments from major news sources to try to identify patterns in the trait informally known as ""click-bait"", or content designed to attract visitors and attention to a particular source. The title of a link or post often the only major decider in whether someone will click.
Where we looked
       With 24,462 New York Times posts, 13,758 Buzzfeed posts, and 14,069 Millions Against Monsanto (a leading anti-biotechnology group) posts, we sought to quantify linguistic metrics of these articles relative to ""like"" total. Using the NLTK and TextBlob modules of Python, we were able to analyze each title for their syntactically element and their sentiment and polarity. Additionally, we could crudely estimate emotional content by using the AFINN emotional lexicon, a dictionary of the most common emotional words with an associated magnitude. This gave us an array of metrics to try and estimate ""likability"" against.
Our results
        What we found is exemplified below- reoccurring trends within individual news sources correlating very well"
Toulouse,2014,Team:Toulouse#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,", safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (and thus in all public facilities working in scientific and technological domains) are set out in the Decree No. 82-453 . This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.
The Decree No. 2011-1177 is related to the use of genetically modified organisms.
There is no one in charge of the biological safety at the INSA Toulouse. However there is an organization which includes one prevention advisor and several prevention assistants in every Laboratory. As far as the LISBP (our structure) is concerned, Nathalie Doubrovine is the prevention assistant.
We have already discussed our project with her. She has given us the safety training and advices about how to respond to an imminent danger.
She raised the problem of GMO and the related policy. She advised us of the special procedure for the destruction of GMOs: we cannot wash this kind of organism down the drain.
We were also informed about the potential chemical and microbiological risks.
The laboratory safety training requirements of the LISBP are detailed into the Rules of Procedures of the LISBP.
The legislation requires employers to inform ""all new employees"" of the risks that they may encounter as well as ways to protect themselves from those risks. Therefore any newcomer must follow an appropriate training and pass a practical test about safety to ensure its own protection as well as protecting his/her colleagues.
Every person that enters in the LISBP has to make this training whatever its status (researcher, PhD student, trainee, etc.).
The training is divided into two parts. The first one is a training concerning general risk prevention in research laboratories. This one is made individually with the NEO software and with the explanations of the prevention assistant. The second one is a training about the techniques used during the occupation.
We also had a training to learn how to sort the different sorts of biological waste and how they are destroyed. We also learned that we cannot use autoclave on our own because a specific training is needed. We did not do this specific training and hence did not touch the autoclave. Only our supervisors could start these autoclaves...
Safety in the lab
""If you don't think it's safe, it probably isn't""
We have organized our workspace. We have a relaxing room where no biological material should enter. In this room, we can eat and drink (a fridge, a kettle and a coffeemaker are available) but it is also the room where we have our meetings and where we can work on our computers. On the contrary, in the lab, we"

Dry Work
Violacein gene
Confirmed that correct protein sequence was present for each gene, by using MUSCLE to compare the gene sequence given by GeneDesigner to the sequence in the NCBI database. All protein sequences were identical.
Prepared the GeneDesigner file and the ApE file of the violacein operon to be sent for sequencing. Jim suggested that we refactor the DNA so that each individual ORF is preceeded by an RBS (the biobrick part B0034) and a constituitive promoter added. DNA2.0 kindly agreed to provide the promoter sequence for us, and add it in along with the operon. We also included the vio E gene after reading the Sanchez paper: http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112732008/HTMLSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0
New Vio Plan
The protein structures given for each gene were also compared with vio proteins from other organisms, ( Janthinobacterium lividum and Duganella sp. B2) to confirm that the ORFs were coding for the correct protein.

Consort iGEM Team
Our third collaboration has taken place with our friends, the Consort, Alberta iGEM team from Consort Alberta. We have also been able to present in front of them and talk to them one on one about our projects meaning that we both have a lot of information regarding each other’s projects. For this reason consort contacted us and asked us if we would right a short report talking about their project, concerns that we have with their project, ways to address these concerns, general advice and more.
Here are our two collaborative pieces:
Canmore’s Write Up for Consort: This year the iGem team from Consort is continuing with their ECOS project, bacteria designed to detect the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in order to prevent any harm to the environment. Consort’s ongoing project is a great concept for many reasons. Firstly it is something that is a local problem in their community and especially hits home for some of the team members, which means that they devote themselves fully to the project. Secondly because the outcome of this project could be very helpful for surrounding communities and possibly could hold some wealth in it. Finally because this project could help save countless amounts of crops and livestock from what is a major threat to them.
The science behind the project is very intriguing as well. The indicator protein is atoned to xylene, which is a very volatile liquid hydrocarbon, which in itself is a good thing to find and remove but it is tied to other dangerous compounds. When these compounds are detected the proteins emit a color indication that would alert the user to the presence of said dangerous compounds. Whilst this all seems simple the biobrick is not, and they have spent years developing this to perfection to start with their prototypes.
The prototype and models of prototypes look to be a very effective method of using ECOS. I was able to see one of the prototypes and it looked good even though I was unable to see it in action, this shows great promise for the team in their upcoming endeavors. I can see much success in the future if this team especially if they have a working prototype at the giant Jamboree, I personally wish them the best (-Joshua Lamb)

We got the structures and the sequences of 19 variants for ethylene glycol receptor and 9 variants for Terephthalic acid receptor. Unfortunately, we couldn’t synthesize these receptors and check their activity, due to time and finance limits but we thought on a theoretical way use them.
We wrote an assay of Terephthalic acid detection that can support the examination of this process. In the future, we also plan to find an ethylene glycol detection protocol.

Human Practices is a field as important as the project itself. Thinking about the possible impacts your project might have on the world and engaging with the public to establish a well informed public understanding are key features of succesful scientific progress.
Our crowdfunding project was born out of necessity for acquiring funds but it also served as a main contributor to bring synthetic biology closer to the public attention in an easy and understandable way.
For our project, we needed a lot of money. We asked loads of big companies to sponsor us; we even sold handmade burgers in front of the cafeteria. Still, in the beginning of our project we could not convince many sponsors to support us so we decided to start a crowdfunding campaign and even filmed a video about our roughly sketched project idea.   A big thanks to Max, a student of Filmuniversität Babelsberg, whose help eventually lead to this fantastic result:
Recording the video was quite difficult (for 3 minutes we needed a whole day) but also fun and great for team building. We also had to write texts and propagate our campaign. In the end, we collected an unbelievable total of  1.820€. This money helps us to present our results in Boston at this year’s  Giant Jamboree.
The big laboratory exhibition was an event for scientists and interested people alike and therefore helped exposing synthetic biology to the public.
On June 22, 2017, the LAB-SUPPLY exposition took place in the ESTREL Convention Center in Berlin, a chance our team could not miss. This regional trade fair for instrumental analytics, laboratory technology, laboratory chemicals, and biotechnology attracted more than 900 visitors (among them our iGEM team).

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling Prediction Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the prediction model. Nevertheless, another problem is brought about because this setting is contradictory to our model as the dynamic of mRNA is ignored before. In fact, the equilibrium of mRNA is a fast process when compared to proteins so we argue that the inclusion of mRNA dynamic will not give a picture differs a lot from the case in which mRNA dynamic is neglected. In addition, the dynamic of inducers is introduced, the cooperativity and the binding affinity of inducer to repressor proteins are also considered.
By applying the findings from the stability analysis to the modeling equations, we obtain the following prediction graphs:
Fig. 5. Prediction model of Tristable Switch. Graphs in the 1st row represent the inducer concentration change over time, in this case, a pulse of inducer molecule 2 is introduced to the system from t=100 mins to t=200 mins. The graphs in the 2nd row represent the dynamic of mRNAs corresponding to each of the three operons in the tristable system. The plots in the 3rd row represent the dynamic of the three repressors (i.e. LacI, TetR and Phl). While the graphs in the 4th row describe the reporter proteins’ (i.e. fluorescent proteins) dynamic over time.
From the graph, when a pulse of inducer 2 is introduced to the system, mRNA 2 and reporter protein 2 respond afterwards with concentrations increase from 0 to a high level, and the outputs (mRNA 2 and reporter protein 2) maintain at ‘on-state’ (i.e. high level of output) without decreasing back to ‘off-state’ (i.e. zero output level). In conclusion, from the prediction model, by applying suitable parameter values obtained from the stability analysis, it is simulated that upon addition of inducers, the corresponding state is switched on, which is indicated by the high and steady output level of the reporter protein. This behavior fits the design of Tristable Switch.
