2.1.2 Give some advises for their project
Our project is focus on Optogenetics and channelrhodopsins. At the meantime, the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai starts their project on halorhodopsin. Since our projects are all basing on the transmembrane rhodopsin, so we communicate a lot about our projects. The transmembrane rhodopsin needs the retinaldehyde(ATR) as its cofactor. However, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai didn’t know how to make the solution of ATR and prepare it for the culture medium of their algae. So we taught them the relevant experimental method and the mixture system.
2.2 Collaboration with SJTU-Software

2.2.1 How we collaborate with each other
SJTU-Software built up a multi-level biobrick evaluation and visualization system。Many existing biobricks are not well documented, which make it challenging to use them. They present a web-based tool BASE (Biobrick Auxiliary Selection Explorer) to search, evaluate and visualize biobricks at part, devise and system levels. Biobrick parts are scored according to their current status, user comments and reviews, times of citation and etc. At device level, features, such as the order of parts and the co-existence frequency of two parts in a device, are added into the scoring system. At each level, the biobricks can be searched, evaluated and ranked according to their scores.
We provide them with our parts using in this year’s project including not only the parts we submit ( BBa_K1634002,  BBa_K1634003,  BBa_K1634004,  BBa_K1634007,  BBa_K1634008 ) but also some parts which we constructed and used in our experiments such as ppD95.75_Pmyo3-chETA-EYFP. Then they use their software to score our parts. Finally, we compared the parts' characterization in our wet experiment with their output, and offered them some feedbacks to help them improve their scoring system.
The analysis result they give us:

The complementary short term research is based on repigmenting the affected patches in the similar effect of make-up while the long term treatment is under progress. This will be carried out by bacteria producing melanin on the skin, which will be absorbed and result in colored skin.
Our aim
Our research project uses harmless bacteria that, in fact, are already living in the human body as biological machines. These helpful bacteria are designed in our research project to become cost efficient machines to produce molecules that are deficient in vitiligo skin compared to normal skin. The goal with our project, until November 2010, is to obtain a “proof-of-concept” by having our bacteria produce and secrete molecules that we know, through previous research, are in a deficit in vitiligo skin. The lack of these specific molecules is thought to be involved in the impaired and disappeared pigment cells in vitiligo affected skin areas, leading to white spots.
Currently, there are not any treatments like ours for vitiligo skin. Our idea is to develop a treatment for vitiligo skin, where an ointment with harmless bacteria is to be produced for applying on white patched skin. The bacteria will synthesize and secrete several molecules of interest, which will then target specific inner skin cells with the aim of repigmentation.
One problem with this type of treatment is that the skin epidermis functions as a very efficient barrier against larger molecules. To help our potentially beneficial molecules reach their destination, we will therefore fuse them to special carrier molecules called cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). As the name suggests, CPPs are small molecules that have the ability of penetrating into cells, but can in some cases also overcome the skin barrier. By fusing our molecules to such CPPs, we can let them hitch-hike over the skin barrier to the target area.
With our research we aim to in the future develop a treatment that works faster and more efficient in achieving a repigmentation on affected skin areas compared to current medicine.

We consider a number of particles that start at some initial location. In our case, this is the outer edge of the circle that represents the cross section of the catheter. The evolution of each particle is then given by the stochastic differential equations
\[X(t+\Delta t)=X(t)+\sqrt{2D\Delta t}\xi_{r}\cos\theta \]                     \[Y(t+\Delta t)=Y(t)+\sqrt{2D\Delta t}\xi_{r}\sin\theta                     \]
Where \(X\) and \(Y\) represent the spatial coordinates of the particle as functions of time, \(D\) is the diffusion constant, \(\Delta t\) is the time size of the time step, \(\xi_{r}\) is a random number taken from the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, and \(\theta \) is an angle taken from a uniform probability distribution in the range \([0,2\pi ]\). We find new random numbers \(\xi_{r}\) and \(\theta \) for each time step \(\Delta t\) and for each particle.
Below, we run the simulation for a typical catheter (with a diameter of 5mm) that initially houses fifty proteins at each point on its rim. We take the diffusion constant to be \(10^{-4}mm^{2}sec^{-1}\),  \(\Delta t\) to be one second, and record a video of the result. Each frame represents one second and there are ten frames per second. The x and y axes represent position (scaled such that the whole ring is of diameter 5mm) and the z axis represents the absolute number of particles at that position, where each tick represents two particles. The nearest quarter of the ring has been cut away so to make the video clearer.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
We conclude that the time taken for the centre of the catheter to reach a concentration >60% of the outer rim is of the order of 5 minutes. This means that we would not need to consider optimising our design because of this effect. The model can be easily adapted to a space with a different shape.

Indeed, it came out from our discussion that cellulose production in a bioreactor was very risky and required tangential flow filtration to maintain a productive system. We therefore reshaped our project and put most of our strength in a E. coli driven production with subsequent purification. In vivo production is still a possibility for Cerberus, but it was no more a priority and the results proved it right.

Françoise Ouarne is the director of the CRITT Bio-industries, a company that enables its customers to develop production processes of simple or complex molecules from diverse raw materials. We went to see her for advice on establishing the selling price of our Cerberus.
She told us that the better way to establish a price is to analyze the market in order to determine what is done and the price of what is already available on the cellulose market. She thought that if we wanted to sell our protein, we must sell it to the high added value industry. It’s in this perspective that she recommended us to test our system with different cellulose types.
We also asked for advice regarding the co-culture with Pichia pastoris and Gluconacetobacter hansenii.  She highlighted the problem of tracking the cell numbers of each species and that we will probably have to often re-inoculate the medium with one of the species.

Aurélie Cayla is a assistant professor at the ENSAIT (Roubaix), her researches focus on the functionalization of different textile materials. Therefore, we contacted her to have an expert advice in textile techniques, especially industrials techniques to functionalized cellulose fabrics.
Because our protein has a high affinity for cellulose we do not need to add a binder in the solution. A simple bath named full bath method would be used.
Moreover, industrials method exists to spin by wet way in to filament the bacterial cellulose, and               after this filament yarns can be weave or knit. In perspectives for Cerberus – Service, we can imagine               providing to the client the fiber functionalized.

The cis-repressing sequence can form a loop form complementary base pairs with the RBS , blocking the ribosome entry to RBS. crRNA is also commonly described as a “lock” because it “locks” the RBS and prevent translation. The “key” to this system is the taRNA. It can interact (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore to activate translation (Figure 1.).

Design
Since pET30a(+) has His protein tag, they plan to add HA protein tag and Flag protein tag to the down-stream of α-tubulin and β-tubulin respectively . The target fragments are amplified by PCR and cloned to T vector and sequenced. Then they link the confirmed gene to pET30a(+) (enzyme site: XhoI, HindIII) .After that，they transform the recombination vector into expression strains(BL21)for culturing. When the concentration of bacterium is appropriate (OD is 0.6-0.8), they induce the strains by 1 mmol IPTG. By using ultrasonic waves to break the cell of bacteria and centrifuging, they obtain the pellet and deal with the inclusion body for the further experiment of Co-Immunoprecipitation(CoIP).

Even the students who have little background of molecular biology are capable of understanding the best structure of proteins in some optimums. When the students knew that the structure of a reverse transcriptase (RT) in HIV, on which scientists had been working for more than fifteen years, was solved by a player in ten days, we saw their great ambitions to participate in solving global problems in the realm they are good at and intrigued in. Well, this was why we held it!
5. The Panel session: This session is almost for students and adults to let them know iGEM, establishment and history of our team built in 2007 and future of synthetic biology and biological technology. Since the public in China recently is concerned about GMO severely, we want to directly and briefly introduce to them the genetic engineering technology and let them judge whether the GMO is safe for our daily requires with our lead tip. We tried our best to landfill the gap between the fast developing science and puzzled people even if we finally managed to influence few. We still believe few can influence more with their constructive suggestion and going into action so that one day people in China, even in all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

For modeling group, we have to prepare our hands out, as well as materials we need to have on the poster. This part of the project is extremely important, because you want to deliver what you have been doing for almost 6 months in the best possible way. You don't also want to oversell your project. Therefore, the best way will be to choose the most important aspects of your project and highlight them in a way that everyone could understand it.

Preparation and group discussion for aGEM
The aGEM competition is fast approaching (next weekend). All iGEM Calgary members met today for almost four hours to discuss what needs to be done before this conference. Handouts, posters and presentations were discussed/reviewd for all sections of the project. The key suggestion to all three of these things for the lab section is to be more results-based. Theory is important when presenting the circuits, but people want to see what we've actually achieved. We will try and put in data that shows the successful construction of the mutant circuits as well as the isolation of AI-2.

Other than aGEM Preparation: Touch-ups in SL
I was able to start adding to three folders for the virtual lab robots to give to avatars when they are requested, which should contain the materials needed to perform specific activities using the PCR machine as well as restriction digest, phosphatase treatment and construction/ligation of circuits. Most materials are circuit parts represented by objects. The only issue I am facing is locating all of the materials I will need to add to each folder and may have to consult with other team members in order to determine what is necessary for each structured activity in the lab.
I also started looking into a way to complete the second ending for the transcription animation, which I hope to complete by October if the virtual lab does not take up a lot of my time. I am in the process of flipping the DNA replication animation as well so the leading strand travels to the centre and the lagging strand will travel to the outside instead of towards the fork. I only flipped it the other way due to convenience, but in order to be as accurate as I can I am going to be spending a little more time on it.

What the team accomplished：
We start in the lab and our brainstorming of HP in May 2018. Most importantly, we started working on our project in November 2017 – inviting well-known iGEMer and professors at home and abroad to give lectures to help students know and understanding the synthetic biology engineering design and construction ideas, so that students really feel the wonders and creativity of this field.
1 We conduct public communication with video and interactive activities at the campus culture festival to promote IGEM and synthetic biology
2 We learned more about hyperuricemia from Hospital through expert interviews, affirming the value of this project.
3 We set up the “IGEM Classroom” and went to Dalian Xianglujiao Primary School in June 2018, and went to the affiliated high school of Dalian University of Technology in September 2018. What worth mentioning is that It is worth mentioning that this time we have established a long-term human practice base with high school and distributed course materials free of charge. After this 2018 competition, we will continue to go to high school to start theoretical and experimental courses on synthetic biology. Here is the syllabus.

Visiting Secondary Schools
In Apil 2012, two students from the Wageningen University iGEM team headed for a secondary school in the Netherlands. The aim was to make the students familiar with biotechnology, synthetic biology, the iGEM competition and also with our particular iGEM project. Among the departments within the secondary school a lot of variation existed with respect to scientific interest. So besides students with interest in biology and chemistry there were also students with interest in social sciences who were not familiar with biotechnology at all. Some of them were even scared of  developments nowadays in genetic engineering. For this particular group it would be challenging to draw their attention.
So the aim was clear: making students of a secondary school around 17-18 year of age familiar with synthetic biology. Before doing so, a few Powerpoint Presentations and other documents with clear explanations about synthetic biology were made and shared with the students to teach them the basics. Also, interesting documentaries about this topic have been shared with the teacher to prepare the students already a little bit. In that way they’ll be more familiar with some basic things and they will more or less have an idea about the progress in biotechnology of the last two decades.
Afterwards, the two iGEM students visited the Secondary School twice. During the first meeting they gave a presentation about some basic genetic engineering tools and afterwards the pupils learned how to extract DNA from fruit with"

Having achieved selective adhesion to colorectal cancer cells we move on to the second half of our device, internalization and transference of genetic material. Strains of the bacteria E. coli can be modified so that they will express two key proteins : invasin and listeriolysin O [ 23-24 ]. Invasin gives the bacteria, the ability to enter epithelial and other non phagocytic cells [ 25-26 ]. Listeriolysin O, on the other hand, has to do with what happens to the bacteria after they enter the target-cell. This particular protein allows the bacteria to free themselves of the vesicle that was used for their phagocytosis, without damaging the plasmatic/cell membrane of the target-cell. This happens due to the low pH of the vesicle (~5.9-6) that is also the optimal pH range for the protein listeriolysin [ 27-28 ]. The modified strains of E. coli, through expressing these proteins are able to not only enter non phagocytic target-cells that express b1-integrins but also to transfer  their load to them, through escaping the phagolysosome [ 23 ]. Finally, we aim to put invasin and listeriolysin O under quorum control, through the use of the lux genetic circuit of Vibrio ﬁscheri, as this operon has been utilized to achieve cell-density dependent invasion. During our communication with the safety committee, we were extremely glad to hear that we submitted a thorough and analytical Check In form and the Committee Members advised us to focus on the safe implementation of our classifier module and then consider a transfer method. As a result, we switched our focus and put great effort to characterize the components of our classifier to demonstrate the while integrating feedback from the scientific community about the health risks of our conceptual anticancer agent, formulating what we term, a 5-STAR security system, which represents the culmination of our proposed modifications:
Level 1: Bacteria preferentially colonize cancer tissue compared to the adjacent healthy Level 2: Bacteria are genetically modified to express a mutated fimH, carrying a colorectal cancer-binding peptide and a point-mutation abolishing its natural substrate binding affinity. Level 3: Bacteria express the invasion mechanism under the control of a lux operon, in order to achieve cell-density dependent invasion Level 4: The classifier circuit, transferred by the bacteria"

Results:
If there is any thaumatin in the supernatant, the silver staining may not be sensitive enough.
Large scale expression (1l) 4
Investigator: Saskia, Kathrin
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the expression of the three caffein genes CaDXMT1, CaMXMT1 and CaXMT1 in selective SC-U 2% galactose expression medium for having enough crude extract for further analysis.
Operational sequence:
The cells didn't grow, because the OD600nm was still 0.4 as we started the day before. Thus we centrifuged the cells, discarded the supernatant and resuspended the cells in selective SC-U 2% glucose medium and grew the cells again in 200 ml of SC-U 2% glucose medium to get enough cells for repetition of the expression. The cells were incubated at 30°C over night.

Aim of the experiment: To check whether caffeine, thaumatin and limonene have a toxic effect on different yeast strains.
One over-night culture of INVSc were inoculated and the OD(600) measured at the next day.
The OD(600) was adjusted to 0,5 in different media and the growth rate were measured after about 2-3 hours.
Caffeine: concentrations of 100mM to 1µM were used, but caffeine did not resolve completely, so the experiment did not show any effect and was repeated the next day.
Thaumatin: a concentration of 1mg/ml was used, by adding 10mg of thaumatin to 10ml YPD medium. The growth rate was measured four times.
Results:
Evaluation of the Toxicity Assay for Thaumatin.
Limonene: following concentrations were used: 100mM, 10mM, 1mM, 100µM, 10µM, 1µM and the growth rate was measured five times.
Results:
Evaluation of the Toxicity Assay for Limonene.
As the negative control (without any substance in the medium) the INVSc strain of the growth experiment was used.

Overview
Our project includes three modules: an input module, a processing module and an output module. In order to realize the principle of our design, we design two rewirable circuits: a repressilator with lox71 site and lox66 site to achieve the alteration from the state of oscillation to the state of a stable switch; and another rewirable circuit which is related to quorum sensing to perform the change from positive feedback to negative feedback. To prevent the leakage of the expression of Cre protein in our input module, we add a riboregulator in front of the coding sequence of Cre protein. As to our output module, we get two devices to detect whether our processing module works or not: one is the fluorescent proteins with Lva tag; the other is the spinach RNA aptamer. Most of our parts are constructed by BioBrick™, but for purpose of meeting the special requirement of our construction that we need to connect some parts reversely, we design a new way based on the BioBrick™ to assemble those circuits.
Furthermore, we have done a lot of work in testing and the collaboration with other teams. Firstly, we have found the unexpected recombination of lox71 site without Cre protein, and we design a device(as shown in the characterization) to verify this phenomenon and finally we test it whether it would affect our results to some extent. Secondly, we conducted plenty of experiments for all these inducible promoters we used in our gene circuits by microplate reader to get some information about their intensity which help us to select the optimum promoter. Thirdly, to test whether our riboregulator works as expected or"

Bands looked a little small when ran out gel for longer
New MAGE oligo
Constructed a new oligo for MAGE knockout of rpoZ, with oligos more than 4 mutations and substitutions the efficiency drops from 15% down to below 5%, so we created a rpoZ knockout oligo with only 2 substitutions
The new MAGE rpoZ knockout is rpoZ_MAGE_Subs
Also ordered primers to test the presence of the knockout rpoZ_MAGE_Subs1+, rpoZ_MAGE_Subs1-, rpoZ_MAGE_Subs2+, rpoZ_MAGE_Subs2-

EcNR2 lambda red colony PCR results:
PCR showed that colonies 1-3 had the insert while 4 did not. Yay! (Note that in the gel image, we accidentally cut off the 300bp band in lane 4)
We will grow up a reinoculated culture of colony 1 for a glycerol stock. If the Wolfe strain keeps not working, we at least have the insert in an EcNR2 line and can hopefully MAGE out the other genes without too much difficulty.

However, the utilization of 50°C Milli-Q water was not performed during the plasmid isolation, which could be a reason for the failure during the process which is shown later on.
With the nanodrop measurement of the isolated plasmids we determined the following concentrations of plasmids:
I13504: 13.85 ng/ µl;
J23101: 13.64 ng/ µl;
J23106: 31.60 ng/ µl;
J23117: 14.50 ng/ µl;
These yields are all very low. Therefore, we decided to start new cell cultures in order to perform the plasmid isolation again the day after. For this, other colonies only for the IL-study were taken.
I13504, the cells for this cell culture were taken from -80°C stock; J23101, J23106, J23117, the cells for these cell cultures were taken from the plate; These cells were grown overnight in 5 mL culture with 1:1000 solution of antibiotics (from 15:10h) at 37°C and 200 rpm.

Plasmid isolation
Small changes were applied to the original protocol, according to Essengüls advice.  - 1.5 mL of all culture is centrifuged before the first step, in order to get rid of the LB media. Water is added (600 µl afterwards); - MQ water at >37°C is used instead of Elution buffer;
Minus 80°C stock
Ligation was done with I13504 (2) (I13504.2) because the concentration was the highest. The DNA ratio of vector: insert used was 1:1. It was calculated by using the Promega Math app that 25ng of vector was required. The insert size is smaller than the plasmid itself so the weight of insert used is less.

Human Practices
Popularization
Survey
Our Human Practices for Gold Medal include the survey we conducted and the collaboration with other teams. We will mainly introduce our Human Practices in the following two parts and demonstrate its positive social influence.
Background
In iGEM China Community, it is very often to see that some students ask for help about how to contact other teams. Indeed, many teams have no idea about how to get in touch with others except e-mails, and so do we. As different teams have their different preference when choosing social software, it is very complicated to get in touch with others. Maybe you like to use Twitter but the team you want to contact like to use Facebook so you definitely can’t find them on Twitter. What’s more, the Chinese government sets the block on Internet, which means we need to unblock it first to use the international resources. As we know, teams from China take a large portion of all. So it’s too complicated for communication.
Our influence in social network
With the help of iMAP, iGEMers can save time and improve their efficiency.
In iMAP, one can simply find the university or school they want to contact. You neither need to go through the team information page on official website, nor to browse some social websites to find the exact information. Saving team members’ time and energy, this software lowers the opportunity cost, thus they can devote more time to the research and experiments.
Also, using the function in Team page, iGEMers can manage their tasks more efficiently.
For example, HZAU wanted to ask UT-Tokyo some questions, yet they found it difficult to find the way to contact them. So they asked us to solve their problem. After we upload the information of UT-Tokyo, they did not have to find the name of University of Tokyo’s iGEM team and go through social networks like Twitter and Facebook, which is fairly time-consuming. Simply by clicking the map, they successfully got in touch with UT-Tokyo.
So take the background information and our example into consideration, it is clear that our software has the comparative advantage, and is a more economic choice for iGEM teams. We believe that our software has a positive social influence, for we not only stimulate the efficiency, but also enhance the communication between teams. And we hope that our software can help more and more iGEMers."

BPUL has a molecular weight of 58.6 kDA and was marked with a red arrow. The band appears in both fractions. There are also some other non-specific bands, which could not be identified. To improve the purification the elution gradient length should be longer and slower the next time.

Figure 4: Fermentation of E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> (BPUL) in aBioengineering NFL22 fermenter, scale: 6 L, autoinduction medium + 60 µg mL-1 chloramphenicol, 37 °C, pH 7, agitation increased when pO2 was below 30 %, OD600 measured every hour.
Another scale-up for E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> was made up to a final working volume of 6 L in a Bioengineering NFL22. Agitation speed, pO2 and OD600 were determined and illustrated in Figure 4. There was no noticeable lag phase. Agitation speed was increased up to 425 rpm after one hour due to problems caused by the control panel. The pO2 decreased until a cultivation time of 4.75 hours. The increasing pO2 level indicates the beginning of the deceleration phase. There is no visible break in cell growth caused by an induction of protein expression. A maximal OD600 of 3.68 was reached after 8 hours of cultivation, which is similar to the 3 L fermentation (OD600 = 3.58 after 10 hours, time shift due to long lag phase). The cells were harvested after 12 hours.
Purification of BPUL
The harvested cells were prepared in Ni-NTA-equilibrationbuffer , mechanically lysed by homogenization and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant of the lysed cell paste was loaded on the Ni-NTA-column (15 mL Ni-NTA resin) with a flow rate of 1 mL"

Biosensors
Nowadays, protein engineering relies on direct or indirect screening methods to sort potentially improved enzymes from all the mutants of a bank.  Among these methods, the most accurate performs direct sensing and quantification of the compound of interest, but they remain expensive and require large devices such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), immunoassays or Mass Spectrometry. Devices that not every lab can afford since you need not only the resources to buy the devices, but also highly-skilled collaborators.
To improve the screening process of mutant banks, we chose to use biosensors for their cost-effectiveness, and efficiency in assessing a chemical’s concentration, therefore relative enzyme activity.
But first, what are biosensors?
Biosensors can be thought of as any biological device capable of sensing: molecules, ions or physical parameters such as pH, temperature, magnetic field or pressure. Even though sniffer dogs from a k9 unit or carrier pigeons with their magnetite beak could be considered as biosensors, this term generally refers to particular genetic circuits in the field of synthetic biology.
Biosensors are used for a wide range of applications, from medical diagnosis [1] to metabolic engineering and have recently begun being used in cell free systems. But they usually operate in a similar manner: enabling expression of colorimetric, fluorescent or selection molecules in response to the presence of the desired compound. This is the behavior that allows their use in quantification or screening methods [2].
We can find many types of biosensor architectures, but the ones most used in biotechnology are the transcription factor based biosensors (TFB). TFB natively exist in all organisms, bacterial two-component signaling systems being a perfect example. These types of biosensors are particularly useful for screening processes since they provide appropriate dynamic range and sensitivity [3]. Transcription factor based biosensors are usually built with well characterized transcription factors (like OxyR for hydrogen peroxide) but you can dig for ‘your favorite’ transcription factor in databases such"

Bidirectional Promoters
Scientists are frequently confounded by wayward promoters; that is, promoters which do not produce   the expected proteins. Some bidirectional promoters are known to exist, but which way they promote   and the degree of expression has not been quantified. This project will test the directionality of   several BioBrick promoters to answer these questions.

Circuit Model
Initial Design
This construct tests the directionality of selected promoters. A small non-coding sequence lies between two restriction enzyme sites; this is the area where each promoter will be inserted. Upstream from the promoter sequence lies a RFP reporter. Downstream codes for a GFP reporter. Thus, as promoters are ligated into the promoter placeholder, the cell fluoresces red, green, or both, indicating the promoter directionality.
Sources
The initial construct for this project utilized the reporters of non-BioBrick parts available in a neighboring campus lab. The Salis Lab generously allowed us to use samples of the pBAC plasmid and mFTV3 plasmid to assemble the construct.
Assembly
The pBAC vector was PCR amplified with 40 basepair overlaps complementary to the ends of the reporter inserts. A RFP reporter and GFP reporter were simultaneously PCR amplified from the mFTV3 plasmid, both containing a 40 basepair overlap sequence complementary to the ends of the adjacent piece.
These parts were finally assembled using the CBAR, or Gibson Assembly, reaction. Gibson Assembly utilizes three enzymes.
An exonuclease, which chews back the overlapping sequences of each piece from the 5' to 3' ends
A polymerase, which fills in the gaps left in the DNA from the exonuclease
A ligase, which heals the nicks in the annealed DNA strand
Annealing the pieces together provided a construct devoid of an actual promoter sequence. By digesting the construct with restriction enzymes flanking the promoter placeholder and inserting promoters isolated from BioBrick parts, the construct fulfilled its purpose.

An easy way of fluorescence detection
We wanted to design a practical test strip for everyone. While superfolder GFP is the ideal reporter protein for in vitro protein synthesis, it is not visible to the human eye under normal conditions ( Lentini et al, 2013 ). We investigated previous iGEM projects with comparable needs and aims, e.g. iGEM Aachen 2014. They used a filter in front of a sensor to detect fluorescence. Sadly, results were not satisfactory. Another approach is to put a filter in front of the flashlight ( Hossain et al, 2014 ). In this study a photo that had been taken with a smartphone camera was analyzed.
Both approaches use only one filter, whereas both emission and extinction require different filters. In our new approach to filters are used on a smartphone in front of camera and flashlight, one filter for emission and one for extinction. With this technique we can detect the fluorescence specifically and display it on an image. Nevertheless, it is still not easily practicable for the end user. Hence, we decided to develop a smartphone app for the analysis of the fluorescence as the output signal. You only have to take a photo with two filters attached to your smartphone and the app analyzes it and displays the information about the substances that were detected. We have successfully applied this to our free biosensor detecting system with several combined heavy metals and date rape drugs .
Furthermore, it is important to take the photo in a dark environment. Therefore, we designed a black case in"

In turn, organizations group to form more complex macro organizations - families group into tribes or ethnicities, communities group into cultures, and workplaces group into firms (Dopfer et al., 2004). Analogous to our genetically engineered bacterium, the three level of social relationship may be thought of as separate functional parts in the large cell we call “society”. We explored the effect our synthetically engineered bacterium may have on these different levels of society, by developing a hypothetical scenario to match each of the three level.
I am the mother of all things green that grow from the soil of this land. I have been reborn onto these lands, bringing fertile life and reclaiming these lakes of blackened ooze. Lakes that seeped from deep within earth and stone onto the surface of green and blue. I have seen time come and time not pass, time mired in stand still seconds, standing stiller in years and decades into eternities. Memories washed upon memories, memories primordial in the slumbering forests, memories etching itself into existence from the stirring present.
In the waking dawn of this once crimson land, I remember my birth bed a palette of rose petals blossoming overhead while the shifting red sands crept over land. As the cool winds mend the fiery red into a burning black, from burning black to cold dull earth.  Soon the earth turned to green when I took form, like the creatures who would come to live upon land I was not given a choice on whether I should come to be. Neither an origin I have known nor a purpose for what I am, only stark and naked existence.
Who are these but yellow, lumbering carrion eating at my backside? These creatures that bares the image of a progeny of my domain, whom tenderly graze within my consecrated groves, whom adorns a crown of horns. That which tears me from the earth, austere and cold as stone, moving lumbered and laboriously and with a soul that I cannot know. Steeds to animals that have arisen from another time, those that bare yellow shells upon their heads. Ought I to fear what awesome powers they hold? For in their wake they have turned the wheel of time against itself, having cast my sacramental green into cold earth. From cold earth they have turned into that burning black. Upon this burning black on which their beasts do so feed.
I have seen cycles of life and cycles of death, cycles of frozen ice and burning fires, cycles permeating ever again. I have seen the land sunder"

We then came up with a set of questions for other teams, trying to evaluate their existing knowledge, their self-assessment of their knowledge, and their desire, if any, to increase that knowledge. Some of us wondered if we'd see evidence of a Dunning–Kruger effect . After implementing our survey using Google Drive, we sent it to team Calgary for testing. They all took it, and verified it worked. Thanks, Calgary! We then sent an email to every team's primary contact , asking them to take our survey and pass it along to their team. We had great turnout, garnering 328 individual responses.
Best Respondents
Big thanks to teams Bielefeld , Bonn , Calgary , UC Davis , and Warsaw for having more than 80% of their team members, advisors, and instructors answer our survey! They represent the best parts of the iGEM community, helping others create knowledge without asking for much in return.
Demographics
These questions were relatively straightforward. We just wanted to know who was answering our survey! Happily, it looks like we got a reasonably representative sample of respondents.
Experience With IP
Unsurprisingly, the size of the ""Yes"" pie slice is almost the same size as the sum of ""Advisors"" and ""Instructors"" pie slices above, but let's look into that further...
While the bulk of respondents are still members with no patent experience, this breakdown reveals that approximately half of the responding advisors and instructors have patent experience and half don't.
Having a larger number of responses to this question than ""Yes"" answers to the previous one was perplexing. We expected those who indicated having no experience with patents to skip this question. A more sophisticated survey might have only revealed this question upon receiving a yes answer to the previous one.
This was a check-box poll, where respondents could select more than one box, and could also fill in a text field for custom ""Other"" responses.  Some of the ""Other"" responses included involvement with software copyrights & patents, research in patent databases, and being in the process of obtaining a patent.
Need a for Guide
The above graph displays responses from three questions. Note that respondent's median self-assessed level of knowledge is 3, while the median desired level of knowledge is 8 and the median level thought to be obtainable from a brief guide is 6. Respondents thought that a brief guide can get them a good amount of the way to their goal, and this reinforced our motivation to produce such a guide. It is interesting to note how many respondents want to"

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," dumbbells or treadmills we usually see in a gym? After we consult the coach, he told us that the main point of “fitness” is not focusing on building bulky muscles but living a healthier life. We were confused by the time we heard this statement, thinking that it might not be what we had expected.
However, after about two hours of explanation, it dawned on us that what he said was all about one core concept:  excess is just as bad as deficiency. Training excessively is damage, while no exercise is unhealthy as well; too much intake of sugar is harmful, while too little sugar consumption is even more dangerous.
Similar to what Dr.Wu had told us, knowing how to adjust one’s own physiological stage and managing a balanced diet is the only way to live a healthy life. How wise it is. Perhaps this is the kind of thing we won’t be able to learn from the coach who’s pro in developing six pack abs. In the end of the discussion, he even taught us a breathing method used in training which helps regulate our breathing. To be honest, we had a special experience after today’s visit.
In sum, this interview has surprised us - even ordinary things such as breathing has variations, but also let us learn a lot about regulating daily nutritions. Before finishing, he also suggested us to consult to the nutritionist, assuming that we might receive a different response. However, the two experts made similar proposals in the end, showing us the part our work needs to improve.
We summarized our project to the fitness instructor. He told us about his work. He has his own workshop, where he focuses on designing lessons, trying ways to stimulate advances in physical function, such as improving the ability of impairment. He said that what he does is absolutely different from those who conduct training for the purpose of body strengthening. 
We: Can we say that, this is similar to what we call OT (occupational therapy)?               Coach: Probably yes. But, I am just a coach for assistant purpose.
We: Will you recommend any kind of health supplements to your clients?
Coach: No. Due to the differences of individual needs, I think it is more appropriate that doctors do something like that instead of me. But, I can give them advices on what efficacy they may need for their supplements. 
We: Any examples?
Coach: Sure. Let me take weight losing. It’s easy to understand that if a person want to lose weight, the amount of calorie he consume must exceed the amount he take in. So, in the initial phase,"

TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams. This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 28 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. Interestingly, we were lucky to have dinner with two former iGEMers Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements.
TMMU-China Meet-up:After several attendances of meet-ups, we hold a meeting one month before the opening ceremony. Although small in scale, this meet-up aimed at further promoting projects and better preparing for the whole competition. It is worth mentioning that with only one month from the competition, many teams felt they were under great pressure. Professor Rao Xiancai from TMMU-China shared with us his story. He told us that with the advent of the information age, acquiring knowledge and exchanging information had become much easier than decades ago, with iGEM as a good example of integration of network information and international communication. The whole world is enjoying a golden age of information exchange and multilateral communication. He hoped that given the chance, all the young adults could seize the moment to learn more, not for medals or awards, but to stand on the frontier of the age, and by working together, we would make a difference. Professor Rao’s speech inspired us all and we therefore deepened our understandings of scientific research. At last, the exciting hot pot dinner lighted up the happy atmosphere for every team member to enjoy the meeting and refresh for future challenges.

We have a lot of experience and knowledge to share with a starting team. Representatives from Lund and Uppsala met at NIC conference and decided to talk about how to run a team. We had a Skype meeting with Lund to share general tips and tricks for running an iGEM team. The tips were everything from how present in the best possible way at the Jamboree to organization of the team. Lund initiated most of the general questions and we were happy to help out.

Impairing the DNA fidelity mechanisms
Abstract
Organisms ensure the fidelity of their DNA by three overlapping pathways namely base selection, proofreading and mismatch repair.     These pathways cumulate in replication fidelity of ~10-10 mutations per bp per generation in E. coli (Lee et al. 2012).     Overexpression of dominant negative variants of major players in this system can increase the mutation rate substantially. Recently,     mutation rates up to 6.2×10-6 mutations per bp and per generation were obtained by using a plasmid-borne mutator system     (Badran, Liu 2015). We aim to make this mutator plasmid available for the whole iGEM community by rebuilding it with defined iGEM parts     (see our BBa_K208117 ). We envision an application in the     directed evolution of our binding protein. Furthermore, implementation in other directed evolution approaches could be feasibly     in which our plasmid pose an in vivo alternative to error-prone PCR (Wilson, Keefe 2001) or exogene mutagens (reviewed in Wong et al. 2006; Steensels et al. 201"

$$ Erythroblasts_{n+1} = Erythroblasts_{n}\times e^{\beta_{Erythroblasts} \times \Delta t} \tag{29}$$
Upon reaching the age of 18 days, erythroblast cells differentiate into marrow reticulocytes.
Marrow Reticulocytes
For the marrow reticulocytes, where the marrow transit time varies with EPO concentration, the same mesh method is used. Even with sufficient iron supply, a constant fraction of marrow reticulocytes is phagocytosed ( Fuertinger et al. 2012 ). This is represented by a constant apoptosis rate independent of EPO concentration.
$$ Reticulocytes_n = Reticulocytes_{n-1}\times e^{-\alpha_{Reticulocytes} \times \Delta t} \tag{30}$$
$$ Reticulocytes_{n+1} = Reticulocytes_{n}\times e^{-\alpha_{Reticulocytes} \times \Delta t} \tag{31}$$
The amount time it takes for marrow reticulocytes to leave the bone marrow and enter the blood decreases as the concentration of EPO increases. A faster marrow transit time means marrow reticulocytes spend more time as blood reticulocytes. The oldest marrow reticulocytes will become RBCs first when marrow transit time decreases. To account for the change in transit time, the stage boundary between reticulocytes and red blood cells is allowed to shift depending on the concentration of EPO.
Figure 17. The effect of EPO on reticulocyte marrow transit time.
The logistic equation that governs the marrow transit time can be seen below.
$$ \mu_{Reticulocytes,max}(EPO(t)) = a_2 - \frac{b_2}{1+e^{k_2 \times EPO(t) - c_2}} \tag{32}$$
Figure 18. The effect of EPO concentration on marrow transit time. The injection 141 billion copies of the EPO cDNA in adenoviruses occurs at day 0. The infected cells produce extra EPO leading to a maximum concentration of EPO of 31.3 mU/ml (3.2 times more that the steady state EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml). As EPO concentration in the blood increases, the marrow transit time will decrease, shifting the boundary between marrow ret"

I have compiled a dictionary of over 200 chemicals determined by the EPA to be toxic linked to their respective Kegg IDs. I followed the tutorials for creating a webpage with django and have decided that this will be a good fit for our project. The dictionary of chemicals was made into an HTML drop down menu. In the upcoming weeks, I will make the html form linked to our SQL database so that it can be automatically updated as the EPA list is updated. I am working on making a simple layout for the page where the user can select a toxin from a list as well as select a desired product- the page will respond to these selections and indicate that it recognizes the choices made. Although this is an unimpressive feat, it will lay some foundation for our pages IO. I am also currently investigating how to improve the pathfinding algorithm that Palak found on the net. It is nowhere near efficient enough for our purposes. Ideally, this algorithm will be able to quickly scan the huge network of reactions and show every possible series of reactions that can go from input compound to output compound. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning because we will have to then determine our method of choosing which path will be the most realistic and also optimal in the sense of production.
In other news, I'm still not on the Illinois iGEM mailing list so I don't find out about things like team beer pong tournaments and birthday celebrations. (I assume I'm not missing much- but if I don't get invited to summer thanksgiving I'll be pretty upset).

So after receiving Donny's intimidating email, I finally feel like I should write in the lab notebook. I am still without my laptop, which makes it harder to work on code. But for the last week I have been working on getting COBRA sources codes uploaded to our program. I found a program called OMPC. Apparently, OMPC allows running MATLAB®'s m-files using Python interpreter. OMPC reads m-files and translates them into Python compatible code.
Note having a laptop, I have been unable to check if this program works. Hopefully my laptop comes in tomorrow, so I can check this out because it will save us a lot of time by note having to convert about 30-40 COBRA source codes written in MATLAB to Phyton.

INP is an outer membrane protein that promotes ice formation at temperatures above freezing, allowing bacteria to generate frost damage on plant hosts 4 . Chimeric INP fusions have previously been shown to transport proteins of up to 119 kDa into OMV membranes 3 . ClyA is a membrane porin that serves to increase infectious toxicity by puncturing the target cell’s membrane 2 . Both were used to direct saCas9 to the outer membrane, a fusion that in the case of ClyA decreases the efficacy of the native protein’s toxic function 5 . A truncated form of INP was extracted from the existing Biobrick part ( BBa_K523013 ) along with a short flexible linker, while the ClyA sequence was referenced from the similar fusion done by Dr. Matt DeLisa at Cornell University (GFP-ClyA) 2 , and ordered by the team as a g-Block.
Figure 1: Periplasm-directing parts in tet-SB1C3. Tat (TorA), Sec (DsbA), and SRP (YcdO) peptides are cloned onto the N-terminus of Cas9 in order to correctly traffic through the Tat and Sec pathways. A truncated form of INP is also cloned onto the N-terminus per the specifications of the existing part on which it is based (BBa_K523013).
Figure 2: Cas9-ClyA in tet-SB1C3. The ClyA periplasm-directing device fuses ClyA onto the C-terminus of Cas9, which displays Cas9 on the inside of the outer membrane vesicle 4 . The additional His6 tag on the C-terminus of ClyA decreases porin toxicity to the target cell. This part was designed but not constructed.
Once we cloned our parts into the BBa_R0040 Tet promoter, we became concerned about low levels of protein expression for our protein characterization steps. We hypothesized that using a stronger promoter such as T7 would increase protein expression, so we transferred the Cas9 cassettes into a pET28a vector in the BL21 E. coli strain to utilize a T7 polymerase system to increase expression for testing (Figure 3).

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 7_-_-_TEXT.html," for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Project Abstract: Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

The combination of GroEL and GroES led to synthesis of all subunits in soluble form suggesting a functional similarity to the chaperone genes contained in the M. capsulatus genome. A closer look at the sequence of the mmo operon reveals that the operon is followed by an open reading frame whose sequence shows similarity to those of chaperones [7]. This proximity indicates a role of  the respective chaperone in folding of the mmo gene products. Based on this, further research could be aimed at creating a library of presumed chaperone genes from M. capsulatus. These chaperone proteins could then be coexpressed with the sMMO subunits in order to find optimal expression conditions.
An important question for possible applications of E. cowli is whether its growth is inhibited by the two plasmids. Therefore, we tested E. cowli in comparison to the strain only carrying chaperone plasmid C2. The growth curves (figure 7) show that cotransformation in fact results in a more distinct lag phase, probably due to greater replication stress owing to the additional plasmid. However, as the bacteria reach the stationary phase both systems grow to the same OD. Therefore, the cotransformation does not seem to limit the final OD of the cultures and no toxic substances are involved.

Introduction
Mechanosensitive channels (MS channel) are present in the cell membrane of both eukaryote and prokaryote and responsible for sensing mechanical stimuli，such as touch, hearing and balancing [1] [2] . They also participate in cardiovascular regulation and osmotic homeostasis. In our project, we aim to use synthetic biology as a research tool to systematically explore the MS channel’s properties of feeling mechanical stress. Thus, careful control of parameters is of utmost importance. So far, the most widely accepted method to examine the sensibility of MS channel is patch clamp technique [3] [4] . However, patch clamps cannot be applied to this scenario as the pressure exerted on cells membrane is usually between 10 mmHg (1330 pa) and 20 mmHg (2660 pa), which is much bigger than necessary to activate MS channels.
Here, we successfully activated two MS channels (Piezo1, TRPC5) at 0.01 Pa by using custom-designed microfluidics chip. This is consistent with the recent literature that the stress needed to activate some MS channels is less than 1 Pa [5] [6] . The microfluidics we designed is used for quantitative and precise measurement of the MS channel response to programmable shear force in a repeatable and flexible fashion. Furthermore, we adapted the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method and computer vision in our microfluidics study to compare the designed value with computer simulation and experimental measurement. We are proud that all three of them are quantitatively consistent to each other. We believe the chip can be widely used to study any MS channels expressed in adherent cells.

Tsinghua University professor Sui Senfang visited the University of Electronic Science and technology, at the forum, members of iGEM and professor discussed why the experiment was not detected in Hhec, Professor Sui provided some instructive thoughts to us:
（1）Probably because our protein expression is too low, the protein can not be polymerized to form tetraploid , and can not be detected.
（2）Page electrophoresis can be used to determine whether the product is a monomer or a four polymer.

Soil survey
The breadth and efficiency of the project are our top priorities. We hope that we can grasp the basic conditions of China's TCP pollution, in order to evaluate, the environmental complexity forour super plants.
We recruited 61 volunteers in 57 districts and collected hundreds of local soil samples from their hometowns. Then we examined each and every one of them.
The results show that there are TCP contamination in Gansu Province, Hebei Province and some parts of Sichuan Province (Panzhihua, etc.), and there is no TCP in Guizhou, Anhui, Liaoning and Shandong provinces."

Results
We determined the optimal erythromycin concentration for E. coli and L. Brevis containing the PIB184 plasmid with erythromycin resistance. For E. coli, a concentration of 8 ug/ml ended up being optimal. For L. brevis, 0.25 ug/ml was determined to be the best.
Initially, Lux and Las systems were transformed from the 2016 kit. However, the number of ligations required to build each system was too high. We instead designed gblocks (synthesized DNA pieces with our desired sequence) for the Lux and Las system. Our first set of primers proved to be faulty and amplification of the gblocks did not work.
New primers were designed, and amplification of the Lux and Las constituent gblocks was successful. However, all attempts at stitching the gblocks together in a stitch PCR protocol failed.
This shows the successful Las1 gblock amplification
An ELISA was attempted to characterize IL-2 production in E. coli first. The results proved inconclusive.
Future Plans
Our future plans involve successfully stitching the gblocks together to create a complete Las and Lux system. These will be characterized by using mCherry as the reporter. Optimizing the ELISA assay for detecting IL-2 is pertinent.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Cadets2Vets,2017,Team:Cadets2Vets#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," reactions made by bacteria or yeast.
The violacein pigment is produced through a series of 5 different genes and altering the synthetic pathway can produce different colors. This project is also developing an analytical system that monitors the turbidity and color of the culture in the bioreactor. There are many possible applications of this technology for monitoring metabolic reactions while maintaining affordability.
We discussed the possibility of sharing some reagents to help each other characterize some Parts. Cadets2Vets is looking for collaborators to measure the GFP fluorescence from the plasmids we made and Washington is looking for ways to characterize some of its plasmids in a similar way. ​​
Interlab collaboration with lab pats air force research lab
Cadets2Vets had a Skype call with Dallas McDonald from the Lab Pats team.
​The results obtained from the Lab Pats Interlab study were different from Cadets2Vets. At the 6 hour time point, the plasmids with highest to lowest GFP fluorescence were:
LB + Chloramphenicol
Negative Control
Device 6
Positive Control
Device 1
Device 4
Device 5
Device 3
Device 2
After sharing these results, Cadets2Vets were curious why the results were so different. The Lab Pats team speculated that the difference may have been due to pipetting errors or differences in the instruments. Te Lab Pats used a SpectraMax M5, which uses monochromators to excite the GFP instead of filters, which is what Cadets2Vets had in their FilterMax F5 instrument. Cadets2Vets went back to their transformation plates and tried to assess whether the bacterial colonies sill expressed GFP and if the intensity was similar to the pattern gain from the plate reader.​
Cadets2Vets’ one-month old transformation plates were still fluorescent, and we used a hand-held blacklight to qualitatively observe the colonies. The order of highest to lowest fluorescence using this method was:
Positive Control
Device 2
Device 4 = Device 1
Device 6 = Device 3
Negative Control.
Device 5 was omitted due to the few colonies present were on the edge of the plate and difficult to see clearly.
The sensitivity of using a blacklight was much lower than using a plate reader, and so it was hard to see the differences between some of the plates. However, it appears that the pattern of fluorescence we observed in the plate reader is consistent with the bacteria in the plates. ​Washington also shared the results of their Interlab study.

This part originated from the Streptococcus mutans genome This is a THF riboswitch from S. mutans with expression platform from Bacillus subtilis on both sides. The expression platforms were used in the original paper to carry out experiments that measure the regulation strength of vitamin B9. It is very well characterized as the binding strength and level of regulatory response with different molecules have been determined through experimentation. The two locations of binding are also very well documented. This switch was chosen due to its potential as a standard for the characterization of other THF riboswitches.

Amplification of FlhDC with Pfu and mutation of restrictionsite, located in FlhC
Experiment done by: Sheila
Date: July 16th
Protocols: CP1.1
Note: Polymerase used: Pfu. Three different samples were prepared as was done, when the new primers were tested with Taq (one, copied the entire operon, the second copied the gene from FlhD to the restriction site in FlhC and the third copied from the restriction site to the end of the FlhC gene), and run at three different temperatures: 50,8˚C, 56,1˚C and 64,5˚C respectively. The temperatures were chosen based on the clearest bands in the gel run in the before mentioned experiment.
Methods: PCR on purified E. coli MG1655 chromosomal DNA from Gel electrophoresis.
Primers used: FlhDC fw, FlhDC rev, FlhDCmut fw and FlhDCmut rev.
Results: At last, we have PCR results. The gel showed clear bands of both mutated pieces of the gene, as well as the entire operon. And because this PCR was run with Pfu, we can actually use these results and move on with the project.

The SLE can be mild o severe. Mild SLE can be controlled without many complications. Severe SLE can cause the death of the patient.
The cause of lupus has not been determined, but it's known that genes play an important role, although lupus is not determined just by them.
Our goal is to find an effective and specific treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), minimizing secondary effects by attacking the reason of disease: over production of lymphocytes. This goal can be achieved by the altering of the immune dysregulation of SLE, interfering the pertinent apoptotic pathways. There are some genes, whose activation or deactivation, would nullify the problem of overproduced cells: Fas/Apo1/CD95.
The main objective of this proposal is to use designer bacteria to substitute the insulin injections to control glucose level in blood, by making the bacteria attach to the pancreas and then release the insulin when it is necessary.             Diabetes type 1 is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, which is a hormone that regulates the blood sugar levels. Nowadays, more than 220 million people in the world has diabetes, and in 2005 approximately 1.1 million people died from diabetes. It is believed that diabetes deaths will double between 2005 and 2030.             For that reasons, the project “Salmonella insullinae” would be a great option for the treatment of diabetes type I. The modeling of this project would consist in four phases: bacteria encapsulation, sensor, attachment, insulin production.             Predicted results:
Obtain a designer bacteria to substitute the insulin injections to  control glucose level in blood, by making the bacteria attach to the pancreas and release the insulin when it is necessary
Doing in silica experiments and if it´s possible we could do some experiments in vivo with mice we can probe that the Salmonella insulinae is a theoretical real option for diabetics.

Modelling
Overview
We decided to follow a deterministic approach for the mathematical representation of our genetic circuits. The simulations were made using MATLAB’s Simulink, according to the following general expressions for the genetic inhibition and activation elements present in the ODE systems. These expressions were adapted from Mendes, P, et al., (2003).
The effect of an inhibitor was modeled as follows:
where α is the maximum transcription rate of a gene, K is the dissociation constant of the inhibitor, I represents its concentration and n is its Hill coefficient.
In the other hand, the effect of an activator was expressed as follows:
where α is also the maximum transcription rate of a gene, K is the dissociation constant of the activator, A represents its concentration and n is its Hill coefficient.
The maximum transcription rate is used instead of the basal transcription rate under the assumption that inducible promoters should not present significant basal activity and that repressible promoters are active at this maximum rate in the absence of an inhibitor. The maximum transcription rate was calculated according to the Team Beijing iGEM 2009 ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:PKU_Beijing/Modeling/Parameters ).
The general form of the differential equations used to model the change of the mRNA concentration of a gene is as follows:
This general form represents an hypothetical gene, whose transcription is affected by an inhibitor I and an activator A. Different Hill Coefficients (n1 and n2) are used for the inhibitor and activator. The equation includes also the degradation rate, µ, for which we used the same numerical value for all the genes included in our circuits, cell division rate (1/30 min) plus substance degradation rate (1/"

1 An Introduction of RibB
1.1 The biosynthesis of riboflavin inside E.coli
Riboflavin,also called vitamin B2, can be synthesized by various kinds of plants and animals. The basic synthesis principal is similar, that one molecular of GTP and two molecular of ribulose 5-phosphate undergo a series of enzymatic reaction[1]. However, the operons vary from bacteria to bacteria. At present, we have made the principal clear in most kind of bacterium and in this project, we chose E.coli in which the riboflavin synthetic genes emerge as nonlinear gene cluster and was distributed into nonhomologous chromosome.
Fig 2-A shows the process of riboflavin synthesis and its relevant genes including RibA (coding GTP cyclohydrolase II), RibB (coding 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase), RibDG (coding a kind of bifunctional riboflavin specificdeaminase/reductase), RibH (coding lumazine synthase) and RibE (coding riboflavin synthase). The distribution of these gene can be seen in Fig 2-B[2].
Fig 2-A The riboflavin biosynthesis inside Escherichia coli[2].
Fig 2-B RibA, RibB, RibDG, RibH and RibE inside the E.coli are not on the same transcription unit but separate to different transcription units which have different promoters.
Genes in yellow are related to the synthesis of riboflavin while the grey are not known to be involved in flavin biosynthesis[2].
1.2 ribB and its function
The synthesis of riboflavin is complicated because there are so many genes involved in this process. Besides, those genes are not focus on a same operon. According to some research, RibB is of vital importance to the synthesis of riboflavin which in charge of coding DHBP synthetase and can catalyze the synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate[3]. Researches conducted by Danielle Pedrolli and other researchers show that the FMN riboswitch, which is in the untranslated region of 5' terminal of RibB, can regulate the expression of RibB so that it can inhibit the biosynthesis of riboflavin. Thus, the enzyme translated by RibB becomes a limiter of riboflavin synthesis. Therefore, we can evidently"

HUMAN PRACTICES – OUR INTEREST
As we mentioned before, talk about Synthetic Biology to people not related with science is difficult. We though in a way to get us in touch with society and Synthetic Biology, for this we worked in High School.  Reasons for working in High Schools:
 High Schools are very accessible.
 Dealing with student is interesting and pretty fun.
 Students are the best way to diffuse information.
In our Human Practice our main interesting for this year is letting people know about what is iGEM, Synthetic Biology and our Project. For this we were using newspapers, radio, Facebook, classmates, relatives, but the most important media for us were High School´s Students.
If Synthetic Biology is define as an art of engineering new biological systems that do not exist in nature, and is also redesigning existing systems so as to understand their underlying mechanisms (1) , make students understand this is not easy at all. That’s why we needed to use an easy way to help students to learn about this topic.
We chose to begin, with Basic Science or Ciencia Basica , such as what are DNA, RNA, Cell, Genome, Gen and Living Organisms etc., then we continue with some others term a little more complex like Plasmid, Biobricks, PCR, Enzymes, Mutagenesis, Electrophoresis and Cell transformation. After that we continue with Synthetic Biology or Biología Sintetica , its importance to let people know why we called it Science Urgency, and also including a brief history of how this term was mentioned by Barbara Hobom in 1980, and how"

Starter culture failure: Electric boogaloo
As per usual, the colonies attempted to pick for stater culture creation yesterday were unsuccessful.
Most likely due to the plates being very old; having to withstand steep changes in temperature and environmental conditions.
Decided to simply re-plate the colonies on an LB agar plate supplemented with 50 ug/uL Ampicillin (created on 4/12).  Plate was briefly warned to room temp, and 4 separate glycerol stocks were picked using glycerol stocks and streaked out on 4 separate plates.
Plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius overnight.  Will check tomorrow.
Preparation of Zymo Mix n' Go Chemically Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) expression strains.
Picked colony from BL21(DE3) plates given to us by Dr. Mark Arbing of the UCLA Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry DOE Protein Expression Core Facility in Boyer Hall.
Inoculated colony in 10 mL LB broth, shaken overnight at 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours.
Inoculated 500 uL of starter culture in 50mL of 4 degree Zymo broth.
Incubated shaking at 25 degrees Celsius for 30 hours.
Will check culture at 1500 tomorrow for an OD600 of at least 0.3. Target OD600 before glycerol stock preparation is 0.4 (optimal cell content/competency OD).

I split the successful starter culture between 2 150 mL cultures in LB with Chlor diluted 1000X; so 5mL culture in each
grew one culture at 30C and one at 37C both overnight. I did not check OD
In todd's lab we never checked OD and got good results so I am seeing how this works here and will do a comparison test. If you dont care about OD this reduces timing issues with culturing
Both cultures worked. I then spun down"

Nitric Oxide Sensing & The Hybrid Promoters | The Comparator Circuit | Theoretical Projects
NRP-UEA-Norwich Project Overview
Sensory BioBrick systems have been a large constituent of previous iGEM projects in which teams have combined impressive amounts of logic with limitless creativity in order to produce synthetically engineered organisms with the ability to detect the presence of specific substrates; this was achieved by combining various promoters and reporters to produce novel gene systems of great breadth and depth.
We too have taken a sensory approach to our project and have produced systems involved in the sensation of nitric oxide (NO). Originally we set out to develop a bacterial and mammalian hybrid NO-sensing promoter (which we have achieved); we then looked into ways of quantifying the levels of highly reactive and difficult to measure NO within a system, leading to us producing a novel gene regulation system known as the comparator circuit. Throughout the project we went on to look at theoretical alternative approaches to the gene systems we have produced.
Overall in our project we have produced 6 sensory BioBricks, 2 BioBricks involved in gene regulation, and have further characterised 4 more BioBricks. All 8 of our BioBricks have been submitted to the registry and the 6 sensory BioBricks have been characterised. Our project consists of three components, read their summaries on this page or click on the images below to see more detailed information including our BioBrick characterisation data.
6 BioBricks created: BBa_K774000 -- BBa_K774001 -- BBa_K774004 -- BBa_K774005 -- BBa_K774006 -- BBa_K774004
2 BioBricks created: BBa_K774002 -- BBa_K774003
Theoretical BioBricks: BBa_K774100

As well as explaining what is iGEM and what our project is about, we thought that we have to study more about the project.So, we decided to visit several companies and give them presentations so that we can get advice.
In February, we visited Leave a Nest, a company mainly engaged in science business. Since Leave a Nest was holding a competition of researches regarding intestine environments. We gave a presentation and got many pieces of advice since we just started the project and our protocols had a lot of mistakes.   On February 19th, we visited University of Kyoto and participated in meeting with many iGEM teams from Japan.   In detail, look at the collaboration page.
＜Laws and regulation＞
Creating GMOs/ GMMs (genetic modified organisms/ genetic modified microorganisms) is happening quite often in our labs. However, we thought we have to know about how the laws and regulations work in Japan when we look ahead to the future with our projects. Our team created a document of GMM legislations with other 8 iGEM teams from all over the world. We were surprised of the differences between each country of GMM legislations. Each country has a different view of GMMs and it appears to the laws and regulations. For the document, look at the collaboration page.

Am 7. September um 16 Uhr füllte sich der Hörsaal des zentralen Hörsaalgebäudes der Universität Göttingen mit interessierten Besuchern. Diese kamen, um sich die Vorträge über Synthetische Biologie im Rahmen der Informationsveranstaltung „Legoland für Naturwissenschaftler“ anzuhören.
Einige Wochen zuvor waren wir sehr mit der Planung dieses Events beschäftigt. Die erste Idee war es, die Umfrage auszuwerten. Aber um das geplante Event weiter auszuschmücken, entschieden wir uns dafür einige Experten aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Politik, Ethik, Wirtschaft, Journalismus und Wissenschaft einzuladen, um mit diesen die Umfrage Ergebnisse zu diskutieren. Diese Experten für unsere Veranstaltung zu gewinnen, erwies sich als schwieriger als erwartet. Einerseits waren in Deutschland gerade Sommerferien und die meisten eingeladenen Personen waren im Urlaub. Desweiteren wollten wir das Event selbständig komplett ohne die Hilfe unserer Betreuer organisieren. Da wir aber noch nicht sehr bekannt sind, war es sehr schwierig die Personen zu kontaktieren.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," we wanted to prove and analyze the efficiency of the light induced backbone cleavage with a microwell plate coated with biotinylated BSA, because this is very common in lab everyday life. At this stage, we already had the idea to irradiate the plate with our LED-panel and so the panel was designed in the microwell format, such that other teams can use it for other microwell experiments. Soon we realized how big the potential of this ncAA is, and what diverse uses are thinkable. We were inspired by a paper from Peters et al. 2009, which described the cleavage of a short linear model peptide. We picked up this idea and thought about this model peptide as a protein linker to design a novel elution technique as an alternative to protease restriction sides. To realize this idea, we started in designing our own purification column.

To realize this idea, we started in designing our own purification column. For an elution mechanism aiming on purification, it is also crucial to reach a high value of purity. We decided that it would be better to use a directly biotinylated glass plate instead of a BSA-coated carrier material, such that the BSA could be eluted in the purification process and would not be covalently bound to the surface.
Three microscope glass slides as basis for biotinylated surfaces for the purification column.
There is a way to directly biotinylate glass slides by hydroxylation and a treatment with APTES so that NHS-Biotin can bind covalently on the surface. We aimed at biotinylation of a whole glass slide in size of a microwell plate and irradiate it with UV-light through our LED-Panel also designed for a usage in microwell plates. Then we considered it would be better to treat a higher number of smaller glass slides and assemble them to a column. As we were sure that this would be a practical way to bind, irradiate"

University_College_London,2012,Team:University College London#Notebook#Week7_-_-_TEXT.html," For those that were successful we continued with the miniprep, digest, gel electrophoresis and nanodrop. This demonstrated that the Double Terminator (BBa_B0015) was a success - it produced bands of the correct size, and a useable plasmid concentration. The Ribsome Binding Site (BBa_B0034) and the Constitutive Promoter (BBa_J23119) however have inserts that are too small to detect against a 1000bp ladder. We will therefore investigate how best to demonstrate whether the transformation was a success. The plasmid backbone for each, however, is of the correct size, which is promising.

BNU-CHINA,2015,Team:BNU-CHINA#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," “the production and operation of GM food should be labeled according to the law.” This law will be implemented on October 1st. China has the strictest regulation on GM agriculture. In 2001, the State Council enacted the Regulation on the Safety of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms, which is the highest regulation of the GM crops in our country. According to this regulation, the Ministry of Agriculture formulated three regulations, including the Implementation Regulation on the Safety of Import of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms, the Regulation on the Biological label of Agriculture Genetically Modified Organisms and the Regulation on the Safety Assessment of Agriculture Genetically Modified Organisms.
Besides the GM problems, the Chinese government also has formulated several regulations to standardized the biological safety in experiments. The State Council also enacted the Regulations on Biological Safety of Pathogenic Microorganisms Laboratory. According to this, the Ministry of Agriculture formulated the Regulations on Biological Safety of Highly Pathogenic Microorganisms Laboratory. And the Ministry of Environmental Protection formulated the Regulations on the Biological Safety of Pathogenic Microorganisms Laboratory Environment.
Overall, the Chinese government is very cautious to the issue of biological safety, especially the safety of GM food. The Chinese government is cautious about commercial production but strongly supports the GM research.
Interviewer: Are you familiar with the Primary-level Agricultural Technology Promotion  Station in rural areas? Is there any relevant regulation to standardize it?
Yan: I am not really familiar with this. But it could be found online that there are Agricultural Technical Promotion and Service Center belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture in every province. China has limited amount of arable land and a large population. The primary-level agricultural technologists play an important role in farming process.
Interviewer: What kind of regulations have been formulated by Chinese government on protection of peasants’ rights? Does the government have corresponsive measures if there were to be large-scale damage caused by insects?
Yan: There aren’t many special laws for peasants because all people are equal to the law. People have the same fundamental rights. However, if there are large-scale insect pests, there are some regulations that could help peasants. One of the important regulations is the Regulation on the Aid of Natural Disasters, which is a social security mechanism formulated in 2010. The special fund is managed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Besides this, the Ministry of Agriculture formulated Development of crop disease and pest information management Regulations. This regulation regulated the technical problems about spraying the pesticides in cultivation avoiding the pesticides’ overuse due to the lack of professional knowledge.
Besides this, the State Council formulated the Agricultural Insurance Act in 2012."

Dilution of dried pUCIDT- Amp vector, which contains the gene synthesis products. Afterwards, transformation of pUCIDT_CaXMT1, pUCIDT_CaMXMT1 and pUCIDT_CaDXMT1 in chemo competent XL-1 blue e.coli- cells, to make the genes available for cloning in pSB1C3 and pTUM104
Operational sequence
Basical vector data of pUCIDT
length: 2752 bp
resistance: ampicillin
About 2 µg of dried vector (containing our inserts) were delivered. By dilution with 20 µl bidestillated water (after centrifugation), a final concentration of about 100 ng/µl was adjusted.
Transformation
Transformation in chemo competent cells was performed as previously described. Unconcentrated plating (100 µl) was performed on ampicillin containing LB agar plates, whereas the rest of the transformation- batch was stored in the fridge at 4°C (previous experiments showed, that unconcentrated plating led to enough colonies). The plates were incubated at room temperature over the next two days.
Repetition of plating of newly prepared chemo competent cells

Aim:
Test of newly prepared chemo competet cells, due to present chloramphenicol resistance
Operational sequence
Because 12 colonies were grown on chloramphenicol containing agar plates after incubation at room temperature over the weekend (although ""empty"" competent XL1- blue cells were used), this plating was repeated and incubation was carried out at 37°C over night.

Normal Liana leaves are green-colored. However, when a wound is detected, the Liana sap close to it will turn orange.
When there is a presence of brown rot fungi, the sap turns red.
When the tree has white rot, the sap turns blue.
Liana will be removed if it covers most of the surface area of the tree leaves.
3) Opportunities and Challenges
Aspect
Opportunities & Challenges
Technological
Opportunities:
The existence of Science Park in Hong Kong as a biotechnology equipment hub.
Tailor made for consumer as the parts can be change to detect other types of fungi and wounds. Tool kit and specific sites for changing the parts will be provided.
Challenges:
Range of concentration by which phenolic and sap flow compounds can be detected is minimal.
Inability to differentiate between damage from fungi versus natural occurrences.
Economical
Opportunities:
The parts are reusable, the average cost drops and reduces the invention costs.
Interchangeable. Setting up a library for certain companies, inventors and scientists to access and exchange their parts.
Protection of public property and human life: Prevent the trees to accidentally fall down.
Reduce the cost of maintenance, human resources need to take care of trees.
Reduce pesticide usage. Once the product is applied, no refill is needed.
Early diagnosis: It can be used to prevent tree from falling down.
Legal
Opportunities:
Risk assessment protocols have not yet been developed to assess the potential ecological risks associated with synthetic biology and the product.
Challenges:
Environmental safety protocols that regulate the release of biotechnology devices into nature are mostly against constructs made through synthetic biology.
Must seek approval from Convention of Biological Diversity in order to proceed with product development (UNEP, 2012).
Environmental
Opportunities:
Protect the Heritage Trees: Old and valuable trees
Reduce fungicides usage: Pesticides can diminish biodiversity, disrupt natural biological equilibrium and contaminate other non-target areas.
Challenges:
Using hosts with short reproductive cycle such as Lianas may enable a rapid distribution of the tri-stable trait across the species, which can create consequences that are unknown to us.
Disruption of the flora’s rhizosphere due to unknown interactions.
Political
Challenges:
Hong Kong government is setting up a Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan – which means that tighter supervision and higher standards will be given by the Innovation and Technology Bureau towards newly formed biotechnological projects such as the tri-stable switch (HK Policy Address, 2016).

These plates were then left on the bench for 1 hour. Three plates were taken from the stack and placed in the 42ºC incubator to dry off.
Once the plates had dried, a grid of 46 squares was drawn onto the base of the plate. These squares were then numbered from 1-46.
Within square 1, a mark was made in the agar surface (in the shape of an 'X')with wild type Bacillus subtilis.
Within squares 2-46, marks were also made on the agar surface but this time it was with our transformed Bacillus subtilis (which should have taken up gfp-rrnb)
The plate was then left in the 37ºC incubator overnight.

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," done 'in the field'. There were a number of important things to consider when designing exactly how our test would work. This is where Phil Leighton came into our project. A highly experienced vet, we accompanied Phil to a TB test on a Cornish farm and also spoke extensively about our project. Blood testing in cattle, the size of needles/tubes to collect samples and also blood clotting were all things Phil highlighted to us.

Phil Leighton
Penbode Farm Vets
We hosted Phil Leighton at the University to explain to him what our project aims to do. As Phil is involved with XL Farmcare, a company responsible for all bTB testing in the South West, we wanted to know the practicalities we would have to consider for our test to be effective. Phil invited us to a TB test on a farm in Cornwall where we saw the testing of 11 Bullocks and also got the chance to chat with the owner of the farm.
Sample Collection
The target of our test is RNA meaning a blood sample is required from each animal that is being tested. Prior to our meeting with Phil, we believed as a team that the simplest way to collect blood from a cow would be a skin prick. However Phil made it clear to us that this is not possible due to the depth you would have to penetrate with a needle. Current blood testing is done from the base of the underneath of the tail. As cows are in a crush during bTB testing, collecting a sample of blood from the tail is easier and safer than the current Tuberculin test that occurs at the neck of the animal. Phil explained how cows are much more accepting of a vet approaching and working with their tail as oppose to their necks.
Sample Collection
Furthermore Phil showed us the current needle and tube that is of standard use for collection of blood from a cow. Initially we believed the components of our test would be in a tube the size of a standard Eppendorf. Logistically Phil said this would not be possible. Collection of blood from the tail into a tube the size of an Eppendorf would not only be extremely difficult it would not contain the blood in a sterile environment - something highly important.
As a team this gave us a number of things to consider when designing how best to contain the cell free aspect of our test. The tube has to contain our test, collect a sample in an efficient and sterile manner and also only allow a small"

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," this may also have undesirable and unforeseen impacts on the rhizosphere.
To further our understanding of this topic, we began to look at existing legislation surrounding the release of GMOs and the environment. We read official documentation relating to the use of GMOs in contained environments (GMO Legislation).
Therefore, we highlighted early on the necessity to explore the use of our bacteria in contained environments – this way we comply with safe project design / responsible innovation standards.
(Wetware/Hardware)
When planning the wetware side of the project and determining what experiments would be required to reach our goals, it became immediately obvious that there would be the need to develop a device that enables high-throughput experimentation (as we are working with plants over a relatively short period of time). This led to the idea of making our own hydroponic system. (See Hardware)
Step 2: Stakeholder Engagement
Once we knew we were searching for applications of our bacteria within the agriculture industry, and that we would be doing so in the context of contained growth environments – we began to line up meetings with relevant stakeholders.
GrowModule365 - 03/08/2018
We were lucky enough to arrange an interview with GrowModule365 . As a company, they produce shipping containers that contain hydroponics systems. Their concept adopts a new approach to farming, allowing crop production in unconventional places. The visit allowed us to see how traditional farming is being challenged and to gain an insight into hydroponics systems. We gained lots of useful information from the meeting; we learned which wavelengths are most effective for increased yields, the alternative growing mediums available, the market's perception to innovative farming and which control parameters are most important. Paul Brown (Director) gave us lots of useful contacts within the industry and seemed very passionate about our project, however, he did mention some areas of the market may be sceptical when it comes to eating produce that has been grown using genetically engineered microbes.
KWS Seeds - 17/08/2018
We had a Skype meeting with Chris Tapsall, Research Director, at KWS Seeds. KWS one of the top five biggest seed producers in the world. The meeting was eyeopening, we discussed consumers views towards the use of GMOs in crop production and how some markets may be more accepting of our product than others. For instance, retail would not be willing to use GM products because of the stigma attached, but governmental bodies may be more accepting as it could be used to address food related issues in harsh environments. We learnt about certain EU regulations, and methods in which a manufacturer could apply our engineered bacteria to a seed"
Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Synergy (MATLAB model)_-_-_TEXT.html,"ucose and cellobiose, which are the products of cellulose hydrolysis, are assumed to ""competitively inhibit enzyme hydrolysis"".
All reactions are assumed to follow the same temperature dependency Arrhenius relationship (shown below). However, in reality it should be different for every enzyme component, ""because of their varying degrees of thermostability, with β-glucocidase being the most thermostable. Hence the assumption is a simplification of reality"".

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," to consider in our project. In Stockholm we participated in an ethics workshop. This gave us a lot to think, since our project’s final product was designed to be a genetically engineered organism used outside the lab. We want to stir up the conversation about GMO legislation, and be part of the discussion about how GMOs could be used outside of the lab and by general public. More about our ethical considerations can be read below.
In both meetups, we were presented with the idea of patenting one’s work. In Stockholm, the SDU team couldn’t present their full project because they were in the process of patenting it. In Paris, we participated in a panel discussion where part of the discussion was about patents and the openly communicated nature of iGEM projects. After hearing about this, we reconsidered our project from a broader point of view and decided to look into business aspects of it. Although neither the topic of our project nor the nature of iGEM made patenting seem like a relevant concern, we nevertheless thought it would be useful to gain an understanding of this aspect. We met up with Merja Penttilä from VTT to discuss these subjects. We received a lot of valuable information which would prove useful if at some point our project was developed forward and commercialization was a relevant question.
Meeting with companies
We got a chance to practice our presenting skills when we met with different companies and tried to convince them to sponsor us. What we got from them was advice on how to give presentations and how to emphasize our strongest points. We also got good practise on how to communicate with people who don’t have much background in biology, not to mention synthetic biology. Later in the project, we had a meeting with Algol, one of sponsors, where we presented our results. We were asked great questions on how we are going to motivate our choices and how we plan to explain the results at the Jamboree. Even though our presentation there was for people who don’t have a biological background, we had to think of e.g. how to explain that cyanobacteria are a problem for people who don’t live in Finland and don't have the same problems with it as we do.
When we met with companies, there was also a lot of discussion of the potential commercialization of our project, which meant patenting our idea. As discussed above, our conclusion was that it didn’t seem relevant to our project.
