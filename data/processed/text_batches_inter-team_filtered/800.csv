Aalto-Helsinki,2017,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," Clearly, patents sometimes result in extremely unethical situations, such as keeping the price of a cancer or HIV drug incredibly high. Yet, we do not have to see patenting as a scary boogeyman but as an option that can sometimes even speed up the development of innovations which might ultimately help humanity and make the world a better place. This is not to say that open source would not be a honorable goal. However, as long as we have a capitalistic economy, companies need some sort of incentive to invest their own money in innovations, especially in synthetic biology and related fields where the development of the products and getting the permit to sell them can take years and incredible amounts of capital. Without patents, it is difficult to imagine this could be achieved, unless the countries themselves were responsible for such efforts. Therefore, it should always be carefully thought case-by-case which option is the most ethical. One may also be against patenting in principle, but still see it as a better option in practice.
Ethics in Synthetic Biology and iGEM
Team Uppsala had three interesting discussions about ethics (see in Youtube) with other iGEM teams, which we were unfortunately not able to attend due to their schedule. Nevertheless, the discussions were filmed, which enabled us to watch them and think about some of the questions that concerned our project or synthetic biology in general.
In the videos one of the questions was if iGEM increases injustice between countries or continents. This is not such a simple question, because obviously richer countries have more resources to make new innovations and test them in the laboratory, but on the other hand this sort of competition also produces innovations on cheaper versions of the common laboratory equipment that can be more accessible to poorer countries and solutions to problems with e.g. diagnosing and treating patients that can be caused by lack of electricity or other basic resources that people in richer countries take for granted.
Science Communication and Responsibility
All results should be published. Otherwise, the research statistics are skewed from the fact that negative research results do not get published. Therefore, it is easy to draw wrong conclusions in meta-analyses.
Communicating about the projects and science in general to the general public is essential. The world is going forward at a growing pace and the amount of data is so vast that no one can know everything. At times it can be absolutely terrifying to find one’s own place in the world to be quite insignificant. The best way to fight fear and misinformation is communicating as clearly and honestly about science, even when the results might not be what we hope. It doesn’t help anyone to use a lot of jargon in order"

Kyoto,2010,Team:Kyoto#Project#Goal A_-_-_TEXT.html," a high copy number plasmid is used. The E.coli transformed with pSB4K5 was also used for correcting the autofluorescence signal.  We picked up three colonies from each plate, and cultivated them in M9 medium supplemented with 50 µg/mL of kanamycine at 37&#3x2103; for about 16h. The precultures were diluted to 1:100 in pre-warmed fresh M9 medium supplemented with 50 µg/mL of kanamycine and incubated with shake at 37℃. After 3h or 3.5h, we measured OD600 followed by GFP fluorescence of the culture.  We measured the GFP fluorescence of some samples after cell was lysed by the cell lysis reagent and collected the supernatant which contains GFP protein. Unfortunately, we run short of the lysis reagent, the other samples are measured without using it.
The measurement of GFP fluorescence after cell lysed by the cell lysis reagent is illustrated in the figure above, and the measurement of GFP fluorescence without cell lysis is illustrated in the figure below.
To know more detailed procedures, go Protocols .
We measured OD600 every 30 minutes after dilution to ensure that cells are in log phase growth.
RPU is calculated as follows.
We also use these rough calculations;
Here, F3h and F3.5h are the GFP fluorescence measured at 3h and 3.5h, respectively,
ABS3h and ABS3.5h are OD600 of the culture at 3h and 3.5h, respectively.
From the experimental data of cell growth from 2h to 4h after dilution, we assumed cell growth from 3h to 3.5h after dilution can be approximated as linear. Thus, the mean ABS can be calculated as described in (3). If GFP concentration in cell is in steady states, the increase of GFP fluorescence depends only on cell growth. We used the first approximation based on these assumptions to calculate RPU.
Measurement of lactose concentration is done by using Lactose Assay Kit (BioVison) [4] .
Result
At first, we measured cell growth from 2h to 4h to confirm our assumption that cells are in log phase growth when we measure RPU. The growth curves are shown in figures below. These graphs indicate that cells were in log phase growth and cell growth from 3h to 3.5h after dilution can be approximated as linear.

Moving in to the CIME, a biology teaching platform, free for the summer vacation. Preparation of new storage. PCR results from last week cloning.
Moving in of the whole team to a new lab
We are taking advantage that the school year is over to move in the CIME, a teaching platform of biology.
Cheking of DNA concentration into our Biobrick Miniprep :
OD cheking was performed on all our Biobrick stock to have an idea of the DNA rate into our preparation. We also made a PCR cheking to make sure that the DNA rate really corresponds to our Biobrick. We got an average rate of 100 ng/µl. Which is a much lower than expect, so 10 times more DNA products would had been necessary to get great constructions.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship#Main_-_-_TEXT.html," time needed to be awarded the PCC grant and to optimize our experimental protocols, we aim to convince this group to implement our method within three years.
Broader Interest
During our customer discovery process, we spoke with other parties that could be interested in implementing (part of) our project. We investigated both doping use in the equestrian sports with the Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association and application of our targeted sequencing approach outside of the anti-doping field with Dutch Blood bank Sanquin , exploring opportunities for less invasive prenatal screening, and the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research (RIKILT) for food safety applications.
Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association
We investigated the need for and interest in a gene doping detection method for equestrian sports with the Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association (Nederlandse Draf- en Rensport, or NDR). We spoke with Mr. Camiel Mellegers of the NDR, who is in charge of doping testing for the Dutch matches in Trotting and Flatracing. He has explained to us that anti-doping policies differ in quite a few ways between human and equestrian sports. We will shortly discuss the differences that are relevant to the case of gene doping.
The threat of gene doping is a worrying topic in equestrian anti-doping. It is one of the topics discussed on October 8th of 2018 in the 52nd International Conference of Horseracing Authorities in Paris, France ( Chesser, 2018 ).
The anti-doping criteria in horse racing are stricter than in humans. The human anti-doping list consist of substances that check two of the three criteria of increasing performance enhancement, endangering athlete or community health and being against the spirit of sports. Equestrian sports are stricter; they do not allow any substance that is not naturally present in the body of the horse or that is present in elevated concentrations. Mellegers explained to us that this is because horses are never consenting parties when it comes to doping use, and so they must be protected more strictly.
EPO is not a suitable target gene for equestrian gene doping, as it does not have a performance enhancing effect in horses. Other genes have been identified, that e.g. enhance muscle mass and strength, regulate oxygen, help overcoming pain, enhance injury repair or are involved with angiogenesis and the energy metabolism ( Wilkin et al, 2017 ). Due to the versatility of our method, detection of other genes is easily achievable. Our model on the determination of the detection window will have"

As an additional safety measure we use SYBR Safe instead of Eidium bromide. Its use is identical in all the protocols but without carcinogenic risks.
Access to the laboratory
As we are a multidisciplinary team formed by biotechnologists, engineers and artists, not everybody knows how to behaviour in a laboratory. That is why we did several seminars directed by Alejandro Vignoni and Yadira Boada to teach the basics of their laboratory. However, as a security measure, they decided that not everybody would be allowed to work in the lab alone, only biotechlogists and biomedical engineers could be there without surveillance due to their experience and knowledge adquiered during their degree.
Over the course of these seminars we were informed about the evacuation protocols, waste management and our rights and liabilities as UPV staff. These information can be seen in the information sheets they gave us and that you can download through these buttons:

Strains
Printeria uses E.coli and V.natriegens as chassis. Both are classified as risk 1 so the harm which can cause to people is minimal. The E.coli are from strains DB3.1, 10G and TOP10, for V.natriegens we use the strain  ATCC 1404 from CECT (Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo). To do constructions we use  biobricks and parts supplied by IDT prepared with the Golden Gate grammar.
Safety by design
Paris-Bettencourt 2012 team was right when they said in their page ""How safe is safe enough?"": “Biosafety is an exciting design challenge, an essential enabling technology for synthetic biology, and a fundamental ethical obligation of all bioengineers”.
This sentence describes perfectly what we did with Printeria.  Printeria was designed to ensure safety for all audiences, to be safe enough for the world. In the next table you can see different safety problems we saw with our instructors help, and how we solved them.

Osaka,2011,Team:Osaka#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," users to radioactivity (detected as DNA damage). In a previous iGEM project, ""colrcoli"", we attempted to use E.coli as a paint tool. To that end, we examined biosynthesis of carotenoid pigments as a way of producing color. Here, we attempted to use biosynthesis of the carotenoid lycopene as a reporter for DNA damage.
Carotenoid is a family of natural pigments. Many plants such as fruits and vegetables contain these pigments. For example, tomato has lycopene(red), carrot has carotene(orange). Xanthophyll(yellow) is found in almost all plants.
Biosynthesis of carotenoid pigments starts from FPP(FARNESYL DIPHOSPHATE). FPP is formed from isopentenylpyrophosphate(IPP) and dimethylallylpyrophosphate(DMAPP), which can be biologically produced by two distinct pathways, the mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathways. In E.coli, FPP is formed through the non-mevalonate pathway. By the introduction of heterologous enzymatic genes colorless FPP is then converted to orange-red lycopene, which has a peak absorbance at 407nm that is easily measured.
As shown in the figure on the right, the heterologous enzymes CrtE, CrtB, CrtI were introduced into E. coli to complete the biosynthesis of lycopene. We used a lycopene biosynthetic gene cluster provided by 2009 Cambridge (<partinfo>K274100</partinfo>).

chromium ( BIT 2013 , BBa_K1058007 )
We improved the characterization of these biosensors by performing tests in vivo as well as in our CFPS. In particular, we improved the chromium sensor by codon-optimization .
Both of our biosensor designs make use of fluorescence as an output signal because this requires no cofactors or subtrates and offers a good sensitivity. However, fluorescence can usually not be seen with the naked eye. Nevertheless, it is possible to easily visualize fluorescence using a smartphone and filters. In 2014, iGEM Aachen have demonstrated this possibility using a filter for excitation. We improved this idea with a second filter in front of the camera, which enables everyone to specifally detect fluorescence by taking an image with their smartphone.
In summary, our project builds  upon the projects of several previous iGEM teams. We managed to improve the function and characterization of several of their BioBricks.

Team Shuttle Vector
To get the tAOX1 fragment for the shuttle vector, we run a primer gradient from 0.1 µM to 1 µM in 0.1 µM steps with a primer annealing time of 15 s and 20 s and the usual Phusion PCR protocol. No fragments could be detected.
A DNA template gradient from 10 ng to 250 ng in 50 ng steps was choosen. But no fragment could be detected. Also the primer annealing temperature was varied in 15 s and 20 s. But only small unspecific fragments with from 100 bp to 150 bp could be detected.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
After our laccases are not produced or not detectable we decided to try to express the laccases with a constitutive promoter. Therefore we searched for appropropriate promoters and found different promoters from the Anderson promoter family . We picked three different promoters with different promoter strengths. We chose the parts BBa_J23103 , BBa_J23110 and BBa_J23117 and for all three promoters the RBS BBa_B0034 .

Additional regulation
We picked a lac operator for improved silencing and reducing leaky expression situated downstream of the T7 promoter.
Spacers
Spacers were added based on estimates of translation calculated on Salis Lab RBS calculator.
NikR
Nickel is a naturally occurring substance in ground water; in very low concentrations it is beneficial to the growth of plants. Factory waste and sewage disposal can result in leakage of this substance, which increases the concentration in water making it dangerous to humans. As a solution, we hereby propose a Nickel binding construct integrated with our project.
A hexahistidine tag is the most obvious Nickel binding protein available but it does not have a particularly high affinity. In solution, Ni-NTA has an affinity of 10μM for a single hexahistidine tag. A double histidine tag (6xHis + short spacer + 6xHis) showed an affinity nearly 10 times higher. However, an even higher binding affinity is achieved by the enzyme NikR which is a transcription activator that responds to Nickel. Additionally, E. coli has a NikR enzyme that  is very well characterised .
NikR is a small 133 amino acid long molecule of known structure [1] with an affinity of 6.8 pM. It has two domains and the C-terminal domain alone, which is made of 86 residues from Gly48 to Asp133, is sufficient to bind nickel tightly at 2.2 pM [2].
We inserted NikR in our BioBrick2.0 construct to standardise it. This can now be used to modularly characterise biomaterials through our innovative system. Materials functionalised with our NikR construct could be applied as filters to purify water from Nickel which is a very common pollutant. Together with our endocrine disruptor construct, these are an example of how our plug and play split inteins system is not only a method that could greatly help in research, but it is also aimed at real world applications that could affect millions of people.
Estrogen Receptor
Endocrine disruptors are chemical substances that can interact with parts of the endocrine systems and, at high concentrations, compromise their functions. Dangerous quantities of these chemicals have been registered multiple times in sources of water that are accessible to the public like rivers and springs. The concentration of estradiol 2 (17 β-estradiol) in the river Ahr at Blankenheim is on the order of 4–12 ng/L and "

Plan: Write note on UI&input, discuss UI&input with Soimort. Discuss ODE solver with Kun. Settle the final edition of DB. Writing DB of EPF-Lausanne with 2 junior students. Have fun working.
Summary: Write a detailed note on UI&Input and discuss it with Soimort. I believe it is not easy for him to understand the whole design of UI&Input and its connection with the database, I should spend more time to explain the details for him. Kun says he has finished the L2V4 update of ODE solver, he is now working on the boolean value judging module which will be used in Liao’s code. Liao’s first edition of document on DB standard is done, it’s now my turn to refine it and fix the bugs. Zhengda He has written part of the DB of EPF-Lausanne 2009 under my guidance, we can see the whole DB by next week, hopefully. Another junior student Zhaoyi Li is working on synchronized E.coli oscillator, a biological breakthrough published on Nature 2009. Last but not least, this is a busy week for scheduling trip, paying fee and talking to sponsor. Handling these things cost me lots of time, we should have a secretary for this, luckily we find one, she is Jue Wang. My boss doesn’t push me so hard on finishing his assignment, and I’m grateful for that, he must know that I don’t have much time. I do have fun working this week!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

Diagram 1. Flowchart of collection, formatting and storage     of devices data algorithm
Information about the iGEM parts had to be collected in a standardized     format for our application to function properly. Following data collection     custom subprograms is needed to parse and forward the data the application’s     database. In order to achieve this we have designed and implemented     the algorithm shown in diagram 1. In this algorithm, the first stage     was to find the list of part IDs of devices which were supplied by iGEM     in Spring 2010 distribution. This information has been collected from     two sources 1) plate files in excel format which was available online     2) device data provided in xml format, both provided by iGEM. The last     step in the algorithm was to send the collected partID data to the application’s     database.

Diagram 2. Flowchart for BioGuide execution before and during     user interaction
Diagram 2 presents the main algorithm, which shows how BioGuide application     works. In BioGuide the major components are device and Biobrick graphs.     While the device graph represents input-output (promoter-regulator)     compatibility combination of iGEM devices, the Biobrick graph represents     combinations of atomic parts assembled in a device or system. The flowchart     shows how these graphs are created and embedded into the program, which     displays both of the graphs to the user when launched. Application presents     few interactive options to the user when started, which were shown on     the flowchart under the horizontal, bolded line. As shown on the diagram     2, there are four interactive tasks BioGuide can do, where the device     and Biobricks graphs are utilized. Upon clicking a node on a devices     or Biobricks graph, that node changes in size and color and the various     functions shown on the flowchart can be performed then after.

During our project we have been in communication with numerous teams.
These discussions have lead to collaborations with the team from:

FLIM experiments with Oxford iGEM
The Oxford iGEM team wanted to test their copper chelators using Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM), previous research by Hötzer et al (2011) had shown that GFP lifetime was modified in a copper concentration dependent manner. Therefore, it was hypothesised that if the chelators where functional then the lifetime of the fused GFP's would drop. The Cardiff Bioimaging facility possesses a confocal laser scanning microscope with FLIM module so we offered to test their samples.
Oxford sent us three cultures containing constructs that we grew overnight in the presence of 5uM copper sulphate -/+ 2mM Arabinose (which induced expression using the pBAD promotor).
These constructs were:
1. A constitutive GFP
2. Inducible CG:GFP copper chelator protein ( BBa_K1980001 )
3. Inducible MG:GFP copper chelator protein( BBa_K1980003 )
With help of Dr Anthony Hayes in the Cardiff Biomaging facility we obtained the following FLIM data for their constructs. This has helped with their characterisation as described on their Wiki
GFP-Cu chelator FLIM experiment
Tables shows triplicate (i.e. 3 regions per cover-slipped area) values of the peak lifetimes resulting from measurements using Excitation=483nm, Emission=500-550nm.

McMasterU,2016,Team:McMasterU_-_-_TEXT.html,". Thus, we can learn a lot from the experiences of these researchers. In order to publish their patent, Deming et al. would have had to submit a patent application and pay the appropriate fees. The application must include experimental results, drawings and sketches, and an explanation of the product. Deming et al have included their pHENOMM vector as a representative drawing in their application. Due to the nature of our project, we would likely do the same. It is also necessary to write a clear claim, which defines the legal boundaries of the invention.2 PHEnominal claims as a composition to treat PKU, comprising of Lactobacillus reuteri and a gene expressing an enzyme to degrade phenylalanine. The claim also specifies about the pHENOMM vector, gene sequence, and the drug administration.1
In the description of their product, the researchers establish the patent criteria for novelty, utility, and inventiveness.2 They discuss advantages over conventional treatments for PKU, possible administration, and construction of the probiotic. It has been proposed that PHEnominal can be administered orally in different forms, depending on patient circumstance. In comparison to synthetic foods, the proposed classification of this product as a “drug” may also make it more accepted by insurance companies, thus contributing to affordability. These are all factors we should consider in our project.

CASE 2: Laws and regulations
In 2015, a group of researchers engineered commensal bacteria Lactobacillus gasseri to secrete glucagon-like peptides-1 (GLP-1), which reprogram the intestinal cells into cells that secrete insulin in response to glucose as a possible treatment for hyperglycemia. They looked at the effects of feeding the bacteria to diabetic rats and found increased levels of insulin and greater tolerance to glucose, indicative of the bacteria’s potential therapeutic effects against diabetes.2 In addition, researchers were also able to genetically modify commensal bacteria to secrete keratinocyte growth factor-"

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Government Officials
Robin Rosenbaum, Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA) Plant Industry Section Manager
GMOs are subject to many rules and regulations through the state and federal government. After unsuccessful attempts to speak with someone at the FDA and USDA, Jordan and Jessica met with Robin Rosenbaum, the Plant Industry Section Manager at the MDA. She was a great resource for learning more about the government standards that apply to GMOs, as well as the history of government regulations for GMOs at the state level.
What are the regulations regarding GMOs in Michigan?
There are no regulations for conventional crops. GMOs are mostly regulated by the federal government. State governments can either concur or not concur with the federal ruling about a GMO. The federal government also oversees interstate movement of GMOs, while state governments oversee intrastate movement of GMOs. Exporting plants requires that the USDA look into the host country’s regulations to decide if the plant is allowed to enter that country. Some plants may be prohibited.
How have GMO regulations changed in your 30 years with the MDA?
GMO regulations have stabilized and I do not see them changing drastically anytime soon, even as more GMOs enter the market. I think the plant pest laws have been in place since the 1930s and are still used today. However, science is constantly changing so the future of GMO regulation can be difficult to predict.
What is the process of getting a GMO approved by the MDA?
The time frame depends on how simple and well understood the genetics are; that said, the Biotechnology Regulating Service (BRS) wants early communication about an upcoming GM product. Well known GMOs may be labeled as ‘unregulated’ or ‘deregulated’ by the BRS. In this case, the GMOs can be used with just a notification to the BRS. Lesser known GMOs have a longer approval process. The public also has a chance to comment on the federal and MDA regulations of GMOs.
How does marketing and selling GMOs work?
Farmers may have more difficulty marketing GMOs to the general public. For the most part, farmers try to keep the fact that a product is a GMO underwraps. Most people don’t know and understand enough about GMOs, so they often steer clear of the products. There should not be any legal problems associated"

Introduction
Since the earliest stages, we have decided to explore an entrepreneurial side of our project and not only present it in the Giant Jamboree but also try to prepare it for the the market. We put an effort into clearing a market demand for our system by consulting with our sponsors and other professionals while in the same time establishing a potential customer network. Also, to protect our idea for the future implementation, we have submitted a patent application covering our solution and prepared a short guide on what the future iGEM teams should take into account in order to protect their intellectual property. Lastly, we have covered important factors and indicators that will help to turn our project into business.
Market demand
Using enzymes for compound synthesis has great advantages over chemical synthesis, such as shorter synthesis routes, reduced waste and high product yields. Moreover, enzymes are biodegradable and thus are a better alternative considering ecological aspect.
Yet, each unique enzyme takes years to develop, while the industry demand for biocatalysts is growing at a rapid pace. Numerous amino acid combinations form enzymes, but only a handful of them can transform a given substrate into the required product.
For example, after pharmaceutical company fully develops a particular drug, it takes an average of two additional years to develop the enzyme(s) that can facilitate synthesis of such molecule. And even advanced screening technologies and protein evolution cannot fully satisfy these market needs.
The enzyme industry has experienced significant growth due to the global growing demand for cleaner and greener technology, according to 2017 BCC Research. Moreover, the global market for industrial enzymes is expected to grow from nearly $5.0 billion in 2016 to $6.3 billion in 2021. Provided there is an increasing demand for enzymes in global market, it is safe to say there is also an increasing demand for protein engineering solutions"

Safety Q&A | Human Practice
PART 0 Safety Q&A
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Is there a local bio-safety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local bio-safety group think about your project? If no, which specific bio-safety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through.......

PART 1 Human Practice
Since the beginning of its development, Synthetic Biology has always been rooted deeply in the concept of ""cirtuits"". With scale of circuits becoming larger, researchers believe that traditional ideas may not match Bio-systems well enough......

This gel confirms our his-tag is present but it is unclear on whether or not it is part of our construct. We will start liquid cultures tomorrow and perform protein extraction using nickel columns to see if the cultures are properly extracted with their his-tags
●
Started 100 ml liquid cultures of VV, BB, LO, and SO from the colorful colonies on the plates and placed into the 37 °C incubator/shaker overnight. Tomorrow we will transfer to the 25 °C incubator/shaker for another night and perform a protein extraction on Thursday on these 4 chromoproteins
Tuesday, 9/27
●
The sequencing data from DT came back and showed we did not have the correct sequence. We will keep troubleshooting this today by picking a different colony from the DT plate and seeing if a colony PCR works on a different colony.
●
We ran part of the colony PCR on a gel saw a band around 200 base pairs like we did yesterday. We will not send this colony PCR in for sequencing because the gel did not work. Because this construct is not the correct one we will re do the Gibson and transformation and plating and hopefully get the correct construct.

Order from left to right: Ladder, DT. The amplified band of DT is around 200 base pairs which is not at all close to 1000 base pairs which is where it should be.

We moved the 4 100 ml liquid cultures from the 37 °C incubator/shaker to the 25 °C incubator/shaker and will perform a protein extraction on these chromoproteins tomorrow. When transferring the cultures the BB erlenmeyer flask broke and the liquid culture went everywhere so we need to restart this liquid culture.

We started 4 100 ml liquid cultures for protein extraction on Friday. We started cultures of BB again, SP, MP, and VV. We placed these cultures into the 37 °C incubator/shaker and then will transfer to the 25 °C incubator/shaker tomorrow and perform a protein extraction on Friday.

Team Hong Kong-CUHK
We are very honoured to have the chance collaborating with Team Hong Kong-CUHK. They have mentored us on laboratory skills and have reminded us what should be included in our protocols, which, helped us a lot throughout our whole project. In early July, we had our first meeting with them at their campus. We have exchanged our project ideas during the meeting. They also gave us some advice and questions which helped us improve our presentation skills and experiment design.
They have also shared their project with us and asked us whether we can help them make their device by 3D-printing it. We designed a model and printed it out. We sincerely hope it can really help them make the device easier to produce and bring benefits to the public. We have also helped them to modify their prototype in return.
In the middle stage of our project, they have provided us alternative solutions when we encountered difficulties which made our experiment much more effective.
In the last stage of our project, they have also helped us to send our parts for sequencing to check if it matches our parts. We are very grateful for their generous help.
Team Hong Kong-HKUST
We are lucky to have Team Hong Kong-HKUST sharing their experience of participating in the iGEM competition with us, for example, they have given a talk in our joint school iGEM camp (details of the camp can be found in public engagement page under Human Practices), and the talk is about how to start a good iGEM project.
Team SCU WestChina
We have in addition collaborated with Team SCU-WestChina from Sichuan, as we are working on the same topic and the same gene, ygfu, so we consulted their idea for a part of our project. We contacted them through Facebook messenger and had skyped in May and we have exchanged our idea on the topic of uric acid in blood, which has helped us a lot in our project.

We designed primers that add the pad sequences to our parts outside of the BsaI sites and inside the BioBrick Prefix and Suffix. This leads to a part that looks like the following:
Figure 10: Schematic of the format of a 3G part in the WM Pad system
The sticky ends will, of course, vary, depending on which part we are working with. However, the pad sequences will remain the same. We put the same pad sequences on the high copy vector we commonly work with: 1C3. Then, we can easily use Gibson assembly to put our parts on the backbone and clone them. We created about seventy composite parts through this method. These parts can now be used by any team for 3G assembly, and can be viewed here .
Part Two: General Cloning
Whenever our team needed to construct multipart circuits, we used 3G assembly. Our results were generally excellent. We designed and created 45 circuits, only some of which we are submitting to the registry. An example of a transcriptional unit we created can be seen on this gel:
Figure 11: Gel extraction of WM18_03_10_19, expected length=1043
Part Three: Mixed Assembly
Our team’s project, like many iGEM projects, required us to create circuits with very specific desired behaviors. However, we were unable to perfectly anticipate what parameters would lead to the behavior we were looking for. Utilizing the modularity of 3G assembly, we took multiple variants of each part and combined them during the Golden Gate stage. This created an enormous number of transcriptional units that could be tested once put on circuits. We then screened for circuits that operated in the way we were looking for. The full plate reader experiment can be found here
Figure 11: Construction of multiple circuit variants in a single reaction
Overall, 3G assembly has provided boundless opportunities for our lab, and we are excited to share this powerful tool with the iGEM community.

After ligation, we dialysed them and transformed them into TOP10 and plated for growth at 30oC over the weekend.
WEEK 17
This week we did colony PCR of the DNA submission transformants, as seen in the gel below.
We then set up overnight cultures of the colonies represented by the lanes indicated with red arrows. Plasmids were extracted the next day before sequencing. The remaining plasmid was diluted to a concentration of 25ng/ul so that we could dry them in the submission plates ready for shipping to Boston.
After the results of the sequencing came back, we put 10ul of each plasmid to be submitted into a 96 well plate as per instructions, and sent them off to iGEM! We had a wonderful summer and we feel lost without our DNA now!
In the spirit of iGEM, we also prepared everything for storage in the SBRC's central culture collection for future iGEM teams and the centre to use as they wish."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and"

Although there are proteins of similar molecular weight in the wild type, darker bands in experiment group meaning a high amount of proteins could prove the existence of high amount of CysDes. From the result of SDS-PAGE, we could confirm the expression of CysDes.

3.Growth curve of E.coli(BL21) under different concentration of Cd2+
In our project, we added Cd2+, which is toxic to bacteria, to our media to generate CdS nanoparticles under the catalysis of our engineered E.coli. Considering that CysDes catalyzes the reduction of cysteine and Cd2+ is transformed to CdS precipitation to some extent, the existence of CysDes can strengthen bacterial resistance to Cd2+. But the substrate of CysDes, cysteine, is a kind of necessary amino acids for bacterial growth. So the reduction of cysteine may affect the metabolic pathway which could lead to the depression of bacterial growth.
To figure out the impact of different concentration of Cd2+ and CysDes on the growth ofE.coli and determine the appropriate concentration of Cd2+ for growth, we measure OD600 as a data for bacteria concentration at various conditions and time respectively. Then we draw the scatter graph and fit the growth curve with a smooth line to show the tendency of growth (shown in Figure 3).
Figure 3. Growth curves of BL21 under different concentration of Cd2+
According to the graph of growth curve, we can reach these conclusions:
(a) Adding of Cd2+ to media impedes the growth of wild type E.coli. But after 18h, wild type bacteria grow in low concentration of Cd2+ media (lower than 0.2mM) will reach the same platform stage as the group of media without Cd2+. Higher concentration of Cd2+(over 0.4mM) will limit the platform stage to a lower OD600.
(b) The metabolism of cysteine by CysDes slows down the growth of E.coli and delays the start of exponential stage compared to the wild type. But BL21 expressing CysDes can still reach the platform stage after 18h in the nearly same bacterial concentrations as the wild type.
(c) Adding of Cd2+ to media can also obstacle the growth of E.coli expressing CysDes and delay the start of exponential stage. But the change of Cd2"

Some may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).

The shift, however, is only intuitive. We need more accurate methods to study the quantitative properties. To do this, we plot transfer functions of each group. Transfer function demonstrates the relation between the input level (Dox concentration) and the output level (amount of florescent protein). Plot the function, and the shape of the curve is highly informative.
The transfer functions of all seven groups are illustrated below. All values are in logarithm space. Note that for the convenience of plotting, the points where Dox=0 are plotted at Dox=0.01. (or the point will fly out far to negative infinity)
In the leftmost figure, EBFP2 without intein sequence show relatively low affinity and thus low expression level. Nevertheless, their leakage level is low as well, and Dox induction leads to approximately  fold change. As for the middle and right figures, both split EBFP2 with intein and intact EBFP2 have about  fold change when induced by Dox, but split EBFP2 have lower leakage level.
Meanwhile, if one half of EBFP is driven by constitutive promotor CMV, the leakage level remains the same but the induced multiple suffers. This is expected beforehand because with one constitutively-expressed part, the circuit can only sense the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though TRE-EBFP2N + CMV-EBFP2C leads to poor fold change, the transfer curve is significantly steeper when the dimerization process is reversible. This means better switch-like properties. With the presence of intein, the effect is weaker but still visible.
Normalize transfer curves to the range of 0 to 1, we can find that the shapes are different. Lines representing split proteins are later to rise and steeper.
If we normalize the initial EBFP2 level to 1, split EBFP2 with intein displays better properties than the other two settings. From fig. we can clearly see that it has the highest multiple among the three, even significantly higher than that of the intact EBFP2. The result shows that split proteins, with high binding affinity, can defeat original undivided proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.

Safety training received
Prior to the researches of the project, our team members received all basic trainings on biosafety and laboratory safety in turn ,lectured by professors in the laboratory.The safety training included  many aspects, such as the proper usage of all the equipments, how to deal with the experimental rubbish correctly, and wear rubber gloves, lab coats when making operations. Before using the super-clean bench,we must sterilize,etc.
Environment safety issue and biosafety group
Hela cells are commonly studied in labs, and they are not generally considered to be dangerous. Minor risks are contained in our research since the organism and plasmids, which causes no severe infection to human and animals, will be handled properly by well-trained personnel after every and each experiment, and the chemicals in frequent use are proved to be friendly, except EB ,which is separated along with related devices in a special section, the contact with which requires such protections as a pair of rubber gloves. Thus no major safety problem will possibly be encountered, which will be under control if they would emerge. We are supported and financed by Department of Automation, instructed and supervised by its professors and engineers studying life sciences. And laboratory assistants give us quite a lot of instructive suggestions including problems on biosafety. safety form 2(part1) safety form 2(part2)

II Chassis Organism Safety
    The chassis organisms used in our project are E. coli MG1655 ΔsidA ΔlacI and E. coli EPI300, both of which are classified into Risk Group 1 and Safety Level 1. Because of this, they do not cause disease in healthy adult humans and are allowed to be operated in open bench. Our genetically modified bacteria were cautiously operated and discarded and surly not released to the natural environment to prevent interference to the natural environment.
III Experiment Safety
    In order to minimize potentially risks that could be brought about by certain instruments and reagents, our members were requested to use normative protective equipment and follow the safety manuals throughout our lab time. Instruments like alcohol burner, centrifugal machine and hazardous reagents like ethidium bromide were carefully used and discarded according to the safety manuals. Gloves, lab coats, pants and close-toed shoes are demanded during lab time, and it is not allowed to touch about when wearing gloves. Besides, no food or drink is allowed in the working space.

Defining our constants
Now that we have our equations, we must now define our constants. This step is very important, but unfortunately we didn't have the resources to find the constants experimentally ourselves. So instead, a lot of effort was put into ensuring we had accurate values based on the literature we could find online. These are the values we found, along with their source (note that if multiple values or a range of values were found, we indicated the value we used in a bracket {x} after the values).
For the transcription and translation rates, we used the table from Eyal Karzbrun et al [7], as it describes the rate in a cell-free system using RNA Polymerase. Transcription is described in terms of rNTP/s (ribonucleoside tri-phosphates per second) (1.0±0.5 -we used 1.5, as it was closer to other literature values [10]). We could then work out kTX by dividing the number of rNTPs in each mRNA by 1.5s ((1128/1.5) = 752s for LacI, (669/1.5) = 446s for amilCP) to get the time take to transcribe one mRNA, then finding its reciprocal ((1/752)~1.33e-3/s for LacI, (1/446) = 2.24e-3/s) to find the transcription rate.
We then did the same process for translation. Eyal Karzbrun et al [7] also describes the rate of protein synthesis in terms of a rate of amino acid production. It describes the rate as >4 rNTP/s, but from other"

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

b. UCCKE Sharing Session: How to start an iGEM project (05/08/2017)
Unlike our previous activities where the theme circulates around synthetic biology and biosafety, we were invited by         the UCCKE team to share our iGEM experience and general approach on how to design an iGEM project to high school         students. After the sharing, a few high school students actually planned to join the iGEM in future!
For an easier brainstorming method, we introduced “Top-down Design” using summer vacation planning as an example, which         is to build a system at hierarchical level (from large to small). We also mentioned some important issues that they         should pay attention to. For example, biosafety and fundamental knowledges of synthetic biology.
3. Hong Kong 2017 InnoCarnival (21/10 – 29/10)
As Jamboree is coming close! We were also prepared to showcase this year’s HKUST iGEM project to the public in Hong         Kong. InnoCarnival is a great platform for us to do this as it combine different projects across different universities with the theme of modern innovation.
We had an interview from the South China Morning Post prior to the InnoCarnival where we could share our iGEM experiences         and ideas. In the booth itself, we had our handmade DNA cloning model, as well as our project’s animated video for         better visualization and understanding. Leaflet containing biosafety information and our written articles were also         distributed.

With positive feedback from our workshops in the Summer Science Party, we have gained a number of followers on our         Facebook page. We therefore used this platform to teach them more about synthetic biology.
We have written articles to introduce synthetic biology and tackle the misleading perception based on the survey results         we got during Science Park Party. We wished that by posting this on our facebook page, the followers we gained from         the Science Summer will have a better understanding on the current GMOs issues and will contribute to a well-thought         point of view.

Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," range of biological properties.
Well-known cases are artemisinin, the drug with the most effective mechanism against malaria-causing P. falciparum, and taxol, a mitotic inhibitor used in chemotherapeutic cancer treatments. Both of them are produced in plants (a fern-like shrub and the bark of a tree, respectively), but their yields are usually low and the demand for their medical use is significantly high. Other examples include lycopene, the precursor in tomatoes for beta-carotene, and limonene, which is present in most cosmetic products distributed nowadays.
The biological pathway through which terpenoids are synthesized in eukaryotes is the mevalonate pathway, which includes a series of molecular transformations from Acetyl-CoA to isopentenyl-5-pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate. These isomeric molecules are the common precursors for all terpenoid molecules. A bioengineering approach for terpenoid production involves using the mevalonate pathway and the appropriate synthases in order to end up with the desired molecule. The yeast P. pastoris already uses the mevalonate pathway, but it has been reported that the HMG-CoA reductase involved in its rate-limiting step is heavily regulated. This can be bypassed by a reported N-terminus truncation that renders it still functional but increases the total yield of the process.
Applying the aforementioned modular biofactory design strategy to this model, it is possible to implement a biological platform for the synthesis of terpenoids. Using the production of lycopene as a proof of concept, the separate genes required include the truncated HMG-CoA reductase, GGPP synthase (CrtE), phytoene synthase (CrtB), and phytoene desaturase (CrtI), each with a transcription promoter, RBS and transcription terminator.
Additionally, another module may be implemented to further optimize the platform for terpenoid production. P. pastoris utilizes a great part of the molecules produced in the mevalonate pathway to feed its sterol pathway, starting with the production of squalene. Silencing the squalene synthase gene, ERG9, would enable the use of precursors for terpenoid production.
Although P. pastoris has no known RNAi mechanism, it has been shown that introducing genes for Dicer and Argonaute from Saccharomyces castellii successfully provides S. cerevisiae with the silencing mechanism. Introducing the AGO1 and DCR"

Xcode
  For us, the programming tool is Xcode. Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. First released in 2003, the latest stable release is version 4.4.1 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for Mac OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion users.
  
  Similar to other programming tools, Xcode can support many different programming languages, like C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, AppleScript, Python and so on. However, the major language we use is Objective-C.
  
  What makes Xcode unique is that it includes interface builder. Interface Builder is a software development application for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. It is part of Xcode, the Apple Developer Connection developer's toolset. Interface Builder allows Cocoa and Carbon developers to create interfaces for applications using a graphical user interface. It is very user-friendly. There are many components, like buttons and sliders, listed beside the main window, users can just drag the components into the main window, and then these components can be showed when running the program. If don’t use Interface Builder, users will have to write lines and lines of statements to set a component, but now, just dragging can simply set its properties. Moreover, if users set a link between the component and statements, then this component can be controlled by the program.

Finally, our project would consist of testing for the binding affinity of the spores on the cellulose before we could construct our bioHYDRAs. To do so, we used the cellulose binding affinity protocol that the 2015 Edinburgh team sent us in light of our collaboration.
Data and Results
Our results show promising initial results for future teams to expand on this project.

Vid. 1 HYDRA from 50% humidity to ~0% humidity (in the desiccator)
Recreating HYDRA: We were able to successfully create HYDRA by expanding on the work of Chen et al. . This was done as a proof of concept that this technology works and can be easily reproduced in a small lab setting. We constructed full lengths HYDRAs as described in Chen et al. [1].
Fig. 4. above shows our first functional HYDRA. On the left is a video of the HYDRA in action.
BioHYDRA: We were able to successfully create the fusion protein cotZ-aeBLUE-CIPA in E. coli . This construct was ligated into the pSBbs1C backbone ( BBa_K823023 ). We then transformed E. coli to grow our plasmid. We are excited to have been able to use our newly developed CRATER technique to better select for our plasmid when transforming, which accelerated our project substantially. By running the plasmid through a gel and by sequencing, we were able to confirm that we had the right size (8 kb) and sequence for the plasmid.
We then transformed our construct into B. Subtilis. This was our main setback for this project, as many protocols did not seem to function. We believe that our 8 kb construct was very large and thus was hard to transform. After trying Xylose competence induced cells and electroporation, we decided to use the LMU Munich's MNGE transformation protocol. by picking certain colonies and undergoing colony PCR, we found that certain colonies seem to contain our part, which was confirmed by sequencing.

Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," to study this system from a theoretical standpoint. Our team studied the 3D structure of both enzymes involved to confirm that the enzyme could in theory be attached to a linker in this manner, while Oxford team did stochastic modelling to determine how reaction rate changes when the linker length, labeled D on the diagram, changes.
As a first check, it was necessary to determine whether anchoring these enzymes to our star would be sterically possible. We studied the structures of FdhA and DcmA determined by crystallography using data from the protein data bank. As no crystallographic data was available in the databank for DcmA, GST was examined as a proxy, as GST is structurally homologous to DcmA.
The crystalographically resolved structure of FdhA enzyme (Tanaka et al., 2002) from the protein data bank revealed the following image:
The crystalographically resolved structure of GST was as follows (Chang et al., 2014):
It can be seen that the amino- and carboxy-terminals are located away from the active site. This suggests that both enzymes, DcmA and FdhA, might be linked together via linkers that are used in our star peptide. That is, the active site will not be sterically hindered by attachment to the star peptide. That said, it is difficult to predict how anchoring the protein to the star will affect its tertiary structure. Further, it is difficult to predict how limiting the rotational degrees of freedom will affect enzyme activity.
The Oxford team modeled this system and found that, indeed, the star peptide as an enzyme linker was favourable to enzyme kinetics. Their work can be found here .

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html," wanted our yeast strain to be able to produce progesterone when grown on a variety of substrates, including glucose. To use this promoter, we would have to modify the MIG1 binding site for the promoter to function on glucose-enriched media. According to Dr. Hans Ronne of the Department of Forest Mycology and Plant Pathology at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, maintaining galactose inducibility would entail a risky manipulation of the CYC8-TUP1 co-repressor complex.
We researched other methods of eliminating glucose-mediated repression, but deemed it more practical to use a constitutive promoter like TEF1. Constitutive promoters enable constant gene expression, while inducible promoters turn gene expression on or off depending on a certain factor. Controlling the amount of product produced is a critical element in creating a specific dose of medicine. To control dosage the consumer could heat-shock the yeast after a time calculated from the progesterone biosynthesis rate, as opposed to controlling the amount of galactose in the growth media.
Terminator
We originally chose the Tsynth27 terminator recommended by Dr. Hal Alper1 for its short length (66 bp) and high gene expressivity (Curran et al., 2015). When we ordered the sequence from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), we received an error regarding the length of the efficiency region; the long, repetitive sequence of TATA base pairs, which was originally designed for higher efficiency, made synthesis of the gene block impossible.
We decided to use another short synthetic terminator, Tsynth8, also designed by Dr. Alper. Tsynth8 contains a shorter efficiency region yet still allows for high gene expression and low cryptic promoter activity in Y. lipolytica.
GENE CONSTRUCT ASSEMBLY
Initially, we determined that Gibson Assembly (GA) was the best option for plasmid cloning for two reasons: our mentors and team members have prior experience with the method, and Gibson can assemble many DNA fragments of any length. However, we wanted to explore other possible methods of cloning before making our final decision. We reached out to Dr. Jean Marc Nicaud and he suggested we consider Golden Gate Assembly (GGA) for plasmid construction. Dr. Nicaud informed us that GGA was an ideal method for Y. lipolytica plasmid assembly. Dr. Rohinton Kamakaka also advised us to use GGA as it offers a seamless, single-reaction assembly of DNA fragments (Celinska et al., 2017), similar to GA.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton
This year the UrbanTunda_Edmonton team also worked on a space-related project. They developed an automated prototype for ClO4 extraction, its conversion to rocket fuel, and its genetically engineered biodegradation to oxygen. We helped the high school team by connecting them with our contacts within the Canadian Space Agency to answer some of their questions. Not only did this benefit UrbanTundra_Edmonton, but the questions they asked raised a new perspective on the economics of synthetic biology and space which we did not consider ourselves.
aGEM Workshop
We helped organized the Alberta iGEM (aGEM) competition in collaboration with MindFuel and GeekStarter. This competition helped to prepare the Alberta high school and collegiate teams for the international iGEM competition by mimicking the presentation layout expected at Jamboree and providing the opportunity to meet with well-known iGEM judges such as Megan Palmer and Todd Kuiken. It included the three collegiate teams in Alberta: Ingenuity_Lab, University of Lethbridge and us, UofC_Calgary. It also included the high school teams of The Breakers, Lethbridge High School and UrbanTundra. Through this collaboration, we were able to help mentor the other high school teams by preparing them for what to expect during their presentations at the Jamboree, as many students were new to the competition. We were also able to share protocols with other teams on wet lab work we had done to help improve their projects.
Through this collaboration, we gained a better understanding of the needs of other iGEM teams and how we could contribute to their projects. These presentations really emphasized the strengths of all teams, but it also illuminated our weaknesses and allowed us to explore how we could better improve upon different aspects of our projects before the Jamboree. We also got a chance to meet and network with the other teams and judges and discuss our interests in synthetic biology.
iGEM
iGEM is an international competition promoting synthetic biology as a means to solve social, economic and humanitarian problems around the globe. The iGEM Jamboree is held in Boston annually. In 2016, over 300 teams are competing against each other.

Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"BBa_K1694002 : Lpp-OmpA-NcoI/pSB1C3
Improved part by Mingdao in 2016:
BBa_K1991004 : Lpp-OmpA-BamHI/pSB1C3<
BBa_K1991007 : Pcons-RBS-LO-BamHI/pSB1C3
Lpp and OmpA are outer membrane proteins of E. coli. Lpp-OmpA (LO) hybrid can direct heterologous proteins to bacterial cell surface. In 2015, NCTU-Formosa used it to display scFv (single chain fragment variable) antibodies on the surface of E. coli. They found that a fusion protein cannot be possible to be created under the standard BioBrick assembly rule, that is EcoRI(E)-XbaI(X)-GENE-SpeI(S)-PstI(P). The A part of EX-LO-SP and the B part of EX-scFV-SP, for example, are connected by cutting and ligation of SpeI plus PstI for the A part and XbaI plus PstI for the B part. The SCAR generated by XbaI/SpeI (ACTAGA) will form a stop codon just in front of the ATG start codon of the scFV protein of the B part. This situation has been officially mentioned by the BioBrick standard assembly .
Figure 5: Limitation of cloning a fusion protein by standard biobrick assembly
Therefore, in 2015, NCTU-Formosa created a novel part ( BBa_K1694002 ) putting NcoI site between the LO part and SpeI site. However, when considering cloning, we found that an extra NcoI site is present on Cm resistance gene making it difficult be a vector for gene cloning.
In 2016, Mingdao improved the part by replacing NcoI site with BamHI site ( BBa_K1991004 ). Also, we’ve confirmed and prove the function of LO directing a fusion protein to the cell surface with enzyme activity in our project.

Intergrow
Intergrow has been producing hydroponically grown tomatoes year round since 1998. We talked to them to learn about alternative methods of growing hydroponically. They specialize in drip irrigation to water their plants since tomatoes don't grow well in NFT or deep water systems.  The drip technique involves individual pumps pouring nutrient solution onto the base of each plant and collecting the solution in a bottom tray.  Intergrow grows plants in rockwool and uses drop moisture techniques. They're extremely tech-oriented in their approach, with two giant mixing tanks on top of the facility to handle nutrient mixing. With already implemented technology, Intergrow seemed not too worried about certain variables.

Red Acres
Red Acres is a 6th generation family farm in Maryland that primarily grows lettuce hydroponically. We hoped to learn about the problems that plagued hydroponics in earlier days. Red Acres faced several issues with their lettuce growth: they were unaware that the lettuce would be smaller and take longer to grow during the winter. On the other spectrum, very hot days cause bolting in the lettuce, which makes it bitter. Tip burn, where the leaves of a plant decay due to calcium deficiency or rapid growth, can also happen year-round. In order to combat these issues, they use automated systems and computers to regulate their plants.

Aerofarms is an aeroponics farm located in Newark, NJ.  Aerofarms is one of the few farms that grows their plants by constantly misting the crops’ roots. This technique, known as aeroponics, is done with a large number of machines that allow for a tremendous density of produce.  We hoped to discover any differences between aeroponic techniques and deep water hydroponic techniques.  A big problem for them is employee discipline since mental rigor is required to repeat similar tasks, maintain conditions, and watch everything carefully. They also lack the equipment necessary to spot disease early on.
