Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Determining if expression of glycogen branching and debranching enzymes affect E. coli glycogen content (2)
AIM:
To analyse the effect of GlgX (glycogen debranching enzyme) and GlgB (glycogen branching enzyme) expression on glycogen content in E. coli. As we were not able see any differences in whole-cell extracts we decided to extract the glycogen from the bacterial cells and analyse it directly.
METHOD:
E. coli transformed with inducible GlgB and GlgX were grown up in media that promoted the accumulation of glycogen as described in Glycogen Content 1 to give 1 L of induced and non-induced cultures for each construct. Glycogen was extracted from the cell pellet according to a glycogen extraction protocol, that we initially optimised for E. coli transformed with a control plasmid. This yielded an amorphous white solid that was confirmed to be glycogen by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The weight of the solid was recorded and induced and non-induced samples were compared for each construct.
RESULTS:
    •  GlgX Non-induced:glycogen extract mass = 31.8 mg
    •  GlgX induced with IPTG: glycogen extract mass = 14.6 mg

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Fermentation_-_-_TEXT.html,"         Based on this results, we decided that ampicillin is indeed an adequat selective marker for our system, as long as we keep the quantitative aspect of the beta-lactamase expression as low as possible.    To achieve this, we integrated our reporter construct into the genome of the E. coli strain we were using.    As it can be seen in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the lower the plasmid copy number, the more influence has ampicillin.      It can be seen in Figure 2 that a higher ampicillin concentration is directly associated to the elongation of the lag phase of the respective culture.    As our selection construct is meant to express beta-lactamase corellating with the binding properties of our Evobodies,                  we switched to different fermentation methods to change ampicillin concentration over time.
Continous cultivation with a secondary feed in a turbidostat
Repeated batch fermentation with different ampicillin concentrations per cycle
However, as our selection system directly correlates to the expression of the beta-lactamase, we can assume that a selective advantage through higher beta-lactamase expression would have the same impact as a lower ampicillin concentration.   But what does this mean in context of the ability of ampicillin to work as a selection marker?
Usage of a low budget turbidostat to increase selective pressure
To further characterize the mutation system used in our evolutionary process, we used a low budget turbidostat provided by the departement of molecular              biotechnology of the University of Potsdam. After doing reversion tests in shaker flasks we took the leap to the turbidostat and applied selective pressure             in form of antibiotics. By doing a continuous fermentation while constantly increasing the ampicillin concentration in the Medium             feed, we were able to optimize the revertant frequency in culture. Inoculation was done with E. coli JS200 pEPPolI and freshly transformed earlyStop beta-lactamase .
The complete setup can be seen in figure 3. After autoclaving for sterilization the antibiotics were added under sterile conditions. To             increase the selective pressure a  second feed bottle was connected to the primary feed and 2 g/l Amp LB has been pumped with a rate of about             18 ml/h. The primary feed was adjusted to keep the OD in the bioreactor at 0.5. To sustain a minimum of thermal degradation the 2 g/l Amp LB was stored             on ice for the duration of cultivation. A clean inoculation was done through a sept"

PHB
Previous iGEM teams ( Tokyo Tech 2012 and Imperial College team 2013 ) have retrieved promising results in improving the production of PHB. With our introduction of a secretion system, the PHB production might end up being a financially beneficial solution to the current plastic consumption. Here is some of the ideas for PHB’s future application.
Implants and coating for guided bone regeneration ( Top )
PHB is biocompatible and biodegradable. This makes it well suited for application inside the human body due to the hydrolysis of the polymer that produces a ketone body, commonly found in blood Rodriguez-Contreras, A., et al. (2016). ""Modification of titanium surfaces by adding antibiotic-loaded PHB spheres and PEG for biomedical applications."" J Mater Sci Mater Med, 27, 124. . These properties gives PHB the capability to become an implant that could be broken down slowly under the healing process of the bone. The slowly degradation of the plastic makes it useful to guide the bone regeneration. Using PHB as an implant could allow us to 3D print the structure of a joint, and by that fulfill the medical field’s wish to create treatments adapted to each patient.
This type of plastic is also suitable for load-bearing orthopedic implants, as the moduli of elasticity, tensile strength and strain properties of PHB are similar to bone material Meischel, M., et al. (2016). ""Adhesive strength of bone-implant interfaces and in-vivo degradation of PHB composites for load-bearing applications."" J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 53, 104-18. . PHB’s strong alkaline ester linkages makes its surface more hydrophilic. This gives human osteoblasts the opportunity to proliferate and inhibit the growth of S. aureus on the surface of the implant Karahaliloglu, Z., et al. (2015). ""Antibacterial Nanostructured Polyhydroxybutyrate Membranes for Guided Bone Regeneration"" J Biomed Nanotechnol, 11, 2253-63. Karahaliloglu, Z., et al. (2015). ""Antibacterial Nanostructured Polyhydroxybutyrate Membranes for Guided Bone Regeneration"" Hua Xi Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi, 18, 215-8. . PHB will therefore be able to create a secluded space, where it"

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," fragments used for this experiment.
Here we show that our optimized system was specific enough to detect the target DNA region in the presence of 100-folds added background of original fragments and plasma as a background itself. Here again we demonstrated the utility                       of such system down to the fM range.
Conclusions
Here we demonstrated that our system effectively worked to detect point mutations with high specificity after an initial amplification from plasma in the case where our target was next to the PAM sequence but also when we introduced                       the PAM sequence during amplification. We conclude that this system has a great potential to be used for the personalized cancer vaccine monitoring. Moreover, this detection scheme can be used for the detection of ctDNA in the case                       of follow-up as explained in the section below.
Early relapse detection
In this part we want to detect biomarkers that are found in blood in order to predict relapse emergence. We are interested in chromosomal rearrangements, miRNAs and single point mutations as biomarkers.
As described in detail in the section above, we were able to detect single nucleotide polymorphism in plasma. Those results can be applied for relapse detection too, by changing the target, i.e. using Ginga to find other SNP characterizing the cancer.
Chromosomal rearrangements
Introduction
The aim of this assay is to have a qualitative readout corresponding to the presence of a specific translocation using our Cas12a assay. This test would allow a doctor to regularly check for the presence of this relapse indicator.
We decided to base our assay on the very well documented Philadelphia chromosome, which is a classic example of chromosomal rearrangement.
This translocation is characterized by the transfer of a part of the chromosome 9 on the chromosome 22 ( de Klein et al., 1982 ). This chromosomal rearrangement is often                       called Bcr-Abl, as these are the two genes that are fused together. More specifically, we want to detect a 17-base-pair-long sequence right where those two genes are fused, which is also called “the junction”.
Figure 11. Representation of the Philadelphia chromosome which we detect in plasma using our Cas12a assay. Here, released by an apoptotic tumor cell.
We wanted to prove that detection of this junction at low concentration is possible with our system. To do so, after some trials in buffer, we set out to amplify the junction using PCR from plasma followed by our usual Cas12a assay                       (more details in the Protocols ) and observe different fluorescence signals depending on the presence or not of the junction.

iGEM offers the opportunity to hang around with teams from all over the world, get to know their cultures, share experiences, and, above all, work shoulder to shoulder towards the development of synthetic biology. During our time at iGEM, we seized this opportunity. From discussing our projects to characterizing a promoter, iGEM Tec-Chihuahua joined forces with our fellow iGEMers to build a tighter community through collaborations.
Characterization of Tec Monterrey’s inducible promoter
This year, team Tec-Monterrey is working in the development of a system that can store data in vivo of different stimuli by changing the promoter. In an effort to contribute to the achievement of their goals, team Tec-Chihuahua characterized the PyeaR promoter (Part BBa_K381001: PyeaR-GFP composite) by proving its sensitivity to different concentrations of nitrates.
The collaboration developed as follows: On April 14th we established the first contact through a video call in which we shared our projects, troubleshot some of our problems, and shared some advice regarding raise funding and collaborations. On May 28th, we defined the objective of the collaboration.  On June 10th team Tec-Monterrey sent us the protocols to follow. Finally, from June 14th to June 25th, we performed the required protocols to get the results. We are happy to mention that during the development of this characterization, we had the opportunity to know and work with one of the members of team Tec-Monterrey in our lab.
The complete protocol followed during the characterization, including the results, can be seen below.

Although first seen as a little shy, Vivian quickly came out of her shell, giving excellent advice and listening and responding to problems or concerns. In her spare time she enjoys playing the piano, eating out and enjoying a good cup of tea.
Christopher Wall
Studying in the first Synthetic Biology Masters in the country (alongside Rob), Chris completed a BSc in Biology at the University of Sheffield before moving to Newcastle.  As one of the more experienced members of the team, Chris' extensive lab skills and resourcefulness have made him the first person other members turn to when an experiment goes wrong or a protocol needs adjusting. Found in the lab at weekends and late into the night, Chris' enthusiasm and maturity have enabled him to successfully juggle iGEM with the end of his Masters project. When not in the lab, Chris can be found playing or watching football, and is also something of a movie aficionado.

Vincent Leonardo
Vincent is amazing, he radiates positivity and he has a black belt at being good in everything from cooking delicious food to excellent lab skills. Also, Vincent is like a ""Wikipedia of genetics"", if anyone has a question about it, he is the person who will give great advice about it. In his free time Vincent gives brilliant piano lessons, and plays it beautifully himself, also dreams of being a GREAT king in the future. Furthermore, he has an amazing 30 pairs of shoes collection, which would be enough for 3
iGEM teams! Recently, during iGEM, Vincent become proud and loving father of Betty and Bertie (the first L-forms he grew on a streak plate).

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," amyloid fibres (Romero et al, 2011;2014). Since TasA forms the bulk of the amyloid fibres we decided to overexpress the tasA gene specifically. The genes for the TasA fibres were isolated from the B. subtilis 168 genome and were submitted to the parts registry as the K1597002 biobrick. However, early overexpression of tasA might be toxic for the cell because tasA is a prion and also has high metabolic burden on the cell, so a constitutive promoter was not considered an option. To bypass the toxicity of tasA, the production of TasA proteins should be postponed to a later stage in the life of the cell. This is why the choice for an inducible promoter was made. Specifically a salt inducible promoter as seen in figure 1 a & b, which is explained in more detail further on.
Hydrophobic coating (BslA)
BslA is another prominent biofilm protein. It forms a hydrophobic coating on the outer layer of the biofilm. Bacillus subtilis mutants lacking BslA lose the ability to repel water (Kobayashi et al, 2012). Since our biofilm should be robust under water, a continuous expression of this hydrophobic coating gene bslA seems desirable. The bslA hydrophobicity gene was also isolated from the Bacillus subtilis 168 strain and submitted to the parts registry as  biobrick K1597003. Just like tasA, early expression of this gene in the cell life could be toxic. Therefore, a salt promoter was added to regulate gene expression in the same manner as for tasA as seen in figure 1 c & d.
Salt promoter
The expression of the tasA and bslA genes should be under control of an inducible promoter since early expression of those genes could result in toxicity for the cells. So to control the expression a salt inducible promoter K1597000 is created, which is already present in the B. Subtilis 168 genome and is is called PproH. The promoter was isolated and engineered in front of our tasA fibre genes and bslA hydrophobicity genes. This gives us the ability to control the expression of the biofilm genes tasA and bslA by placing the B. subtilis in a salty environment or not. Since our Bacillus subtilis will come in contact with seawater, this provides an elegant way to regulate the expression of the TasA amyloid"

Just finished my second year of a BSc in Biochemical Engineering and Business Management and am enjoying life in London. Really into entrepreneurship and everything creative but also enjoy the occasional visit to the lab. I have a talent of pushing people's buttons and using that to my own entertainment. Love yoga, pilates, matcha lattes and GMO cheeseballs. Master of iGEM rules and Deadlines and life in general. #hashtag
Amandeep
Being one of the youngest members of the iGEM team, I’m the perfect guinea pig for our healthy ageing project! Currently in my second year of a Biochemical engineering MEng degree and I love looking for new challenges, being inspired by synthetic biology and popcorn filled movie nights. I wanted a summer packed full of fun, blood, sweat and tears and and iGEM fits the job perfectly!
Abbie
I am a 4th year Biochemistry (MSci) student obsessed with antibodies, ageing and antibiotic resistance. Synthetic biology for me is a creative science and can be most powerful when combined with other fields like architecture, art or computer science. In iGEM I experiment in the lab and tell the world about it whether that is documenting our progress on social media or giving talks to students and the public. Aside from this I enjoy meeting and interacting with new people - whether that’s other iGEM teams or the public. Thus I hope to be able to bring the two together through organising events to engage everyone with synthetic biology! I am the early riser of the team and love waking up to sunr"

Indeed, the theme of our meetup was: what can I do after iGEM? In this perspective, we organized round tables on entrepreneurship in biotech, open science and organized a pitch contest with experts, such as Lorenzo Croati of the Pitch School. Almost all the French teams took part in the meetup. We really thank Bordeaux, Evry_Paris-Saclay, INSA-UPS_France, IONIS-Paris, Paris_Bettencourt and UPMC_Paris.

For our Banana project, we needed to create agar plates that would sustain both the Fusarium oxysporum and E. coli, so we tested out different combinations of potato dextrose (for the fungus) and LB (for the E. coli) and found a 0.5x solution of both worked best. We also received our phlF gblock (the sensing part), inserted it into a backbone using Gibson, and transformed it. We got a new antibiotic this week too! We created our Kanamycin stock and made some agar plates with Kanamycin.
Our progress on the TetR regulatory part:
July 17 - July 21
We tried again at our Cas9 Gibson assembly, but again were not successful. Our many trials of this Gibson kept failing, so we devised new ways to take action. We also tried to attach an RBS at the end of our TetR part using 3A assembly. Unfortunately this too did not work. Our gblocks for the metal detecting parts came and we successfully used Gibson assemblies to attach two of them into a backbone, the third did not successfully assemble. These plasmids are meant to make E. coli fluoresce different colors in the presence of Zinc, Copper, and Lead (one fore each). We also had our first round of testing TLP expression and function. We plated our TLP producing bacteria with the fungus and looked for zones of inhibition. As it goes, we found it did not work. We figured a disc diffusion assay with extracted TLP would be our next step.
July 24 - July 28
We ran into the same issues as we had before with our Cas9 project. The Gibson of Cas9 was not working - our gels were not producing the bands we anticipated. Additionally, we were not able to attach and RBS to the end of our TetR construct using a 3A assembly. On the bright side, we were able to extract a histidine tagged protein (which we hope is TLP) from our TLP expressing E. coli. We also attempted a 3A assembly of our phlF sensing part with a GFP marker to be used for testing. And our individual metal detecting plasmids were completed!

As the act of patenting is costly, we were also introduced to the concept of strategic patenting. This practice ensures that the patentee has a much time as possible to work on their IP while being protected before fully committing economically to the patenting process. Since we will be disclosing the majority of out findings on the iGEM wiki in late October, the ability to file a patent in many international markets are limited as they immediately label any knowledge on the internet as public domain. For a patent in Canada/United States, there is a one-year grace period after the date of disclosure in order to file a patent before the IP becomes part of the public domain. During this time period, one can file for a provisional patent valid for Canada and the U.S, the function of the provisional patent is to serve as a place holder for a patent down the line and lasts for a year from the date of filing. After the 12 months, one can go straight into a U.S. patent which lasts 20 years or can file a Paris Convention Treaty Patent, which would extend protection by 18 months which allows for more time to get research funding, additional development and entrepreneurship.
As a team we were also curious to see how intellectual property rights in emerging markets affected patenting. The rationale behind this exploration was to explore intellectual property in other emerging markets and see whether or not dNANO could potentially commercialized. We then contacted and collaborated with the Sichuan University (SCU-China) iGEM team in order to compare and contrast intellectual property rights in Canada and in China.
We realized that some countries have compulsory licencing where the government is able to licence out one’s IP without prior consent of the inventor. Usually, these are granted under special circumstances such as a national emergency and ultimately undermines the inventor’s autonomy with the IP. P

Entrepreneurship
Most patents lead to business development in some capacity. As a project that originated from the university, share of the venture would be divided in a way where a third is assigned to the university, a third is assigned to the inventors and the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their"

Constructs for bacterial surface display are hereby already well known in the field of protein engineering of therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies. There, they are used to screen libraries of different antibodies concerning their affinity towards a given therapeutic target.
We based our design on the autotransporter EspP [23] .
The autotransporter system itself is established and functional (see Fig. A [24] ), and here we ""bricked"" it down into RFC[10] and RFC[25] BioBricks. At first we tested different inducible bacterial promoter systems (e.g. ""TetR repressed GFP""; BBa_K577893 ) that are available in the parts registry, but when we saw that two of the available systems did not work in our own hands, we decided to built the system on our own. We used the Tet-Repressor generator that was available on the distribution plates ( BBa_I739001 ) as we believe that it is very important for the standardization in SynBio to use available parts. Downstream of this repressor generator we designed and fused a BioBrick ( BBa_K2170141 ) that encodes a double Tet-Operator (Tet-Repressor binding site together with a bacterial promoter and an signal peptide of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA [25] ) from E. coli that has a 3' RFC[25] restriction site, allowing the protein fusion of proteins that are secreted into the bacterial periplasm when expressed with this BioBrick. As a protein fusion, we then assembled a protein cargo domain that is generally exchangeable for any protein that is so small in size that it can be transported through the outer membrane by the EspP autotransporter. In our project we used the same extracellular domains as for the eukaryotic receptors: enhanced monomeric Avidin (eMA; BBa_K2170204 ), single-chain Avidin (scAvidin; BBa_K2170205 ) and a composite part composed of a N-terminal Biotinylation acceptor peptide (BAP) and a C-terminal NanoLuciferase (together shown as BAP; ; BBa_K2170118 , see Fig. B). Further downstream our design features a A3C5-epitope tag that can be recognized by a high affinity Fab-fragment and is generally used to detect and quantify the surface display of the cargo domain [26] . Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP"

, or
. This equation calculates the inhibitor concentration that corresponds to a certain relative level of GzmB.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the main chronic inflammatory diseases made worse by elevated GzmB activity. We will use this as an example to show how the calculator works. GzmB concentrations in synovial fluids (joint fluids) of arthritis patients were determined from Tak et al., 2009 (summarized in Table 3). There is a significant GzmB concentration difference between the control group and RA patients. The equation that returns a concentration of inhibitor can be used here, as it takes in relative GzmB levels and returns the amount of inhibitor needed.
Table 3: GzmB Concentration in Synovial Fluids. GzmB concentration in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis obtained from Tak et al., 2009.

If a patient has a GzmB level that is X times the amount of control (around 34 pg/mL), then proportionally, X/100% = 100%/Y, where Y is the factor we want to decrease the patient’s level by (relative to his original level). Therefore,
, and the amount of inhibitor needed [L] can be calculated. For example, if an RA patient has a GzmB concentration of 3400 pg/mL, then the patient has about 100x the normal GzmB level. Therefore, the Y factor would be 1%, and [L] can be calculated to be around 130 uM.
It should be noted, however, that there is a large standard deviation for GzmB levels in RA patients, which means there are significant variations: if treatments are to be given, it would be better to conduct treatments on a case-by-case basis.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html," model, closer to reality, gives a greater amplitude than the homogeneous isotropic model. This phenomenon - due partly to the insulating effect of the extraneural electrode - allows to expect a more easily measurable amplitude at the electrode. We also note that the extracellular action potential has a high frequency ripple, we will call this ripple a High Spatial Frequency component (HSF). This ripple is due to the spatial discretization of transmembrane current sources due to the nodes of Ranvier. The position of each peak is related to the location of a Ranvier node and the period of the ripple is directly related to the distance between two Ranvier nodes. Finally, it is interesting to note that the amplitude of these peaks is significant for the low ρ' distances, that is to say when the axon is close to the surface of the nerve, and this whatever the model used.
Figure 9: Example of calculation of the extracellular action potential at the surface of the nerve for two reference distances (ρ0=200μm and ρ0=500μm) between the observation point and the axon. (1a and 1b) Distribution of nodal currents along the axon (identical). (2a and 2b) Transfer function of the medium according to models homogeneous isotropic model (2a) and nonhomogeneous anisotropic model (2b). (3a and 3b) Distribution of the extracellular action potential as a function of the position of the observation point along the nerve[4].
Whatever the model, the transfer functions behave like low-pass filters whose slope depends on the depth of the axon within the nerve. The high frequencies are all the more attenuated that the axon is far from the point of observation.
The high frequencies are attenuated according to the depth of the axon. The amplitude of the peaks decreases rapidly according to the depth of the axon, while that of the low frequency component is only slightly affected.
The low frequency component is a global phenomenon. It is interesting to note that conventional extra-neural electrodes are sized to be sensitive to the low frequency component of extracellular potential, and therefore measure the overall activity of the nerve. In this type of conventional measurement, the position of the axon will not influence enormously the measurement.
V. Extracellular potential generated by a fascicle
The purpose of this section is to ensure that axon studies can be generalized to fascicles. It is a question of understanding the evolution of the high frequency component of the signal during the superposition of action potentials. Finally, the extracellular action potential"

RESULTS: Only some of the colony PCR have worked. This may be due to suboptimal primer     annealing temperatures. Colony PCR was carried out as 10µL volumes an annealing     temperature was 580C using the Pfu polymerase. All colonies were inoculated to LB broth and grown overnight at 370C     in a shaking incubator.
Thursday
Two samples of each of the LB cultures were selected and     plasmid extracted using the QIAprep kit. PCR was then     done on the extracted plasmid in order to confirm DNA insert. This was done as     we had not managed to get good bands for all the colony PCR’s. The PCR results were variable. Again, this may have been due to     annealing temperatures used in PCR. The samples were analysed on the nanodrop. Nanodrop results were     as follows:
But it has now been found that the concentrations we have     are too low to send for sequencing and still have enough for sending to iGEM     parts registry. An attempt to concentrate the samples was made by putting the     samples in a spin vacuum. Disaster!!! I have mixed up the lids! Colonies were     quickly re-picked and inoculated to LB for growth overnight.
Friday
The parts have arrived from DTU Denmark. PCR has been set up     using Pfu Turbo. DNA template used was as follows:
ALDH1A1 (BBa_K940000) extracted     plasmid
mCherry (BBa_K678067) DTU
terminator (BBa_K678067) DTU
hygromycin (BBa_K678049) DTU
ALDH2 (BBa_K940000) extracted plasmid
Neomycin (BBa_K678067) DTU
Biobrick     backbone (pSB1C3) unrestricted
RESULTS: Unfortunately we did     not get any bands. Plasmid was visible on the gels which were run. This may     indicate that the plasmid concentration was too high for the PCR reaction. Plasmid     extraction was done using QIAplasmid prep kit. PCR     was done on the extracted plasmid, but again the PCR was not very successful.
NEXT STEPS: Plasmid template was diluted 1/1000     and another PCR set up using the Pfu. Hygromycin is the only part which was amplified. Mg2+  was included"

In preparation, we met with Dr Martin Spitaler who advised us on how to prepare samples for the confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy is much more precise than conventional light field microscopy as it eliminates background light by focusing the laser through a pinhole (Mark Scott, oral communication). The confocal microscopy will focus on imaging GFP expressing bacteria inside Arabidopsis roots to show that uptake of the bacteria takes place.
Staining of wt roots with DiD, a lipophilic dye that stains the plant membranes and does not interfere with the absorption or emission spectra of GFP and Dendra, was unsuccessful. However, natural fluorescence was measured in a root in a spectrum that does not interfere with measuring GFP. We should therefore not need to dye the roots before imaging.
Stack of wt Arabidopsis root. The root can be imaged at around 488nm. Imaging carried out by Dr Martin Spitaler.
We may also try to stain the roots with propidium iodide, which is also a strong indicator of cell wall break down.

We prepared the GFP-expressing bacteria for plant infection. They were spun down and media was exchanged prior to incubation at 37°C to reach exponential phase. Bacteria were then spun down and resuspended in wash buffer (5mM MES) to reach OD 30. 8ml, 4ml and 2ml were added to separate flasks, containing 100ml of half-MS media each. 4ml and 6ml of wash buffer were added to the flasks containing 4ml and 2ml bacteria, respectively. 8ml of wash buffer was added to the negative control. Ten Arabidopsis seedlings were distributed into each of the flasks. Incubation was carried out for 15 hours prior to imaging.
Friday, 5 August 2011
Prior to imaging, roots were washed in PBS to wash off bacteria and facilitate imaging. We imaged the plants incubated with 8ml of bacteria and were able to find bacteria inside one of the roots. A 3D picture was taken of uninfected roots and roots containing bacteria by taking a Z stackk image using confocal microscopy.
This video shows an image put together from successive images taken at different depth levels. The GFP-expressing bacteria are clearly visible within the root.
We also imaged roots that did not contain bacteria via a similar Z-stack scan. This image is shown below.

NCTU_Formosa,2015,Team:NCTU Formosa#more details_-_-_TEXT.html," lot of other methods, but IHC and FISH is the two most common methods.
7. Is there an unclear detection limits when using cell staining technology?
Ans: Of course there is, but currently the staining chemical agents and detection equipment are both improving, so the detection limits are decreasing.
8. What is the purpose of serum test?
Ans: In clinical pathology, serum test can be used both before and after cancer therapy. It doesn’t have to be a specific kind of cancer to be serum tested. For example, how do we determine whether the cancer has reoccurred after cancer treatment, we observe if the cancer has grown in the cancer image. Using CA125, which has an 85 percent correct rate, if the result rises there must be a chance of the cancer reoccurring.
9. Can our product make practical contribution to the medical field?
Ans: It’s a great product. Pre-detection of targeted therapy is very important. Your product provides another method of pre-detection and it can quantize the result. Currently Elisa has problems to quantize its result. Therefore if your product can prove that the antigen concentration in blood is positive correlation with the antigen on the cancer, then it would have great success.
10.  How long does it take for the result of Elisa to turn out in hospitals?
Ans: Since Elisa already has a Standard Operation Procedure, so once the hospital personnel get the sample ready, the rest is left to automatic machines. The result will turn our in a few hours.
11.  Is the marker tested in every hospital different?
Ans: All the hospitals follow the cancer organization’s rules, so every cancer has an opposing marker. Every procedure is standardized.
12. Does the doctor decide the dose of targeted drug?
Ans: The dose of targeted drug is related to the patient’s weight.
13. How is the accumulation of medical records systematically used to help improve cancer therapy determination?
Ans: Cancer therapy statistics are divided into stages to help improve cancer treatment. For example, the five-year survival rate of first stage cancer is accumulated. Then the five-year survival rate of second stage cancer is accumulated. The individual difference of patients is not considered in the statistics.
14. If e.coli were handed alive to the hospital, would the hospital hesitate to use it?
Ans: No, live e.colis doesn’t cause big problems.
15. If cancer is detected, is targeted drug used first or cancer surgery?
Ans: Cancer surgery is conducted first. Cancer surgeries will try to reduce the tumor to less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The purpose of targeted therapy is"

We allowed the bacteria to incubate until 4:20pm, and measured the optical density again. T4WT=0.487, M91x=0.506, M9 2x = 0.527, and M9 1x extra phage = 0.442.  This showed us that the bacteria was still actively dividing (hadn't all been lysed yet), but that the doubling time is very slow.  We left the bacteria in the shaker overnight and refrigerated them the next day until we could process them.

Week 18th -24th July
This week we designed the strategy for cloning all the proteins that we want to test in the pCOLA vector, and at the same time make everything compatible with the phytobrick format.
The table of proteins that we are working on is the following:
BG1 - beta-glucosidase from Vinis vinifera
bpul - laccase from Bacillus pumilus
catA - catechol-1,2-dioxygenase from Acinetobacter pittii
Cellulose Binding Domain
POO2 - polyphenol oxidase from Camellia sinensis
tanLpI - tannin acyl hydrolase from Lactobacillus plantarum
xylE - catechol-2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida
How to clone using the pDUET – Golden Gate adapted plasmids
The first thing that you have to do it to codon optimise your sequence for E. coli. For that we used the IDT’s Codon Optimisation Tool (https://eu.idtdna.com/CodonOpt).
After doing the codon optimisation we checked if our sequence had any recognition site for the BpiI, BsaI and BsmBI. Those enzymes are widely used in the Phytobricks and there can therefore be no recognition size outside of the purposely designed (https://2016.igem.org/Resources/Plant_Synthetic_Biology/PhytoBricks). Correct the recognition sites using a codon usage table.
Attach the following to your optimised sequence:
To the 5’- attach a BsaI recognition site that will allow you to fit the part in the Phytobrick. The sequence must be as follows, to be able to fit in the already defined i"
BJRS_China,2018,Team:BJRS China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," to coastal residents and ecology. In the same way, the potential risks of synthetic life technologies are not something scientists can simply avoid through technology and self-discipline.
In our experiments, we found some biological reagent in the name of the individual purchase is a very easy thing. The purposes of synthetic DNA fragments also become more and more convenient and the incomplete specification development of science and technology is a great hidden danger, if be criminals to drill the holes of institutions, consequence is unimaginable. Our project is to improve the oxygen-carrying capacity of engineering bacteria through the surface display of VHb, so as to improve its ability and competitiveness in the low-oxygen environment to a certain extent. If applied, for example, maintaining the oxygen content in water to be stable, the ecological environment in water may be damaged, resulting in the overflow of something. In the laboratory experiment stage, some incompletely successful engineered bacteria which is not properly treated and flows into the environment, which can easily cause ecological damage. Therefore, while synthetic biology provides us with the possibility of convenience and development, it also has some hidden dangers. Without comprehensive consideration and regulation, the consequences cannot be borne by any individual or organization. We should regulate the process of operation and disposal of waste liquid and discuss and weigh the application degree and aspects.
Therefore, we also looked up some biosafety guidelines and audited a discussion on biosafety.
The purpose of biosafety specification is to ensure the biosafety of the experimenter. The sample quality is not affected, and the environment is not polluted, including risk assessment and risk control, classification of biosafety protection level in the laboratory, design principles and basic requirements, facilities and equipment requirements, etc.
In 2009, the iGEM team of Peking University had no laboratory, which was very difficult for them to finish their project. They can only buy equipment from teachers at their own expense, and materials in the name of the laboratory. Then they wondered what would happen if they bought reagents on their own rather than in a laboratory. As it turns out, 90% of companies send directly to a neighborhood or school in a non-lab area. Although some general agents are cautious, the agents at the next level or levels do not consider any security concerns, as long as they have the right reasons to distribute the reagent wherever they want.
In recent years, with the rise of shopping on the Internet, the iGEM team found that vendors selling dangerous reagents could be easily found on the websites of shopping, and they had little demand from customers who bought their products. To take an inappropriate example: a dangerous"

Planned out future experiments, did research on protocols. Went down to image cells and induce with delta and dox. It does seem that ""our"" UAS is not very leaky at all as seen with UAS:mKate. Of course, could be effect of citrine having high stability compare to mKate. Also, we have H2B citrine, thus explaining the nuclear signal we keep observing. Also we can test for pDisplay-vasopressin-myc on cell surface with my proposed Immunofluorescence protocol.  Added Dox to cells tranfected yesterday ([iGEM2011:TRE.GAL4 UAS Activation]&nbsp;\- see bottom). Did not see any UAS leakage with UAS:mKate. Ken suggested that our UAS is different for that Elowitz used with UAS:citrine. Also imaged monoculture cis-inhibition. Ali did a repeat. Transformed 4 LRs (by robot yesterday) and 8 of Divya's LRs.

For BSL-1 (level-1)
These microorganisms are unlikely to cause human disease or animal disease of veterinary importance. Ideally, however, staff members should be subjected to a pre-employment health surveillance procedure regarding past medical history.
Prompt reporting of illness or laboratory accident is desirable and all staff members should be made aware of the importance of maintaining good laboratory safety practice.
For BSL- 2 (level-2)
Pre-employment or pre-placement health surveillance is necessary. This screening should include the past medical history. A clinical examination and the collection of a baseline serum sample would be advantageous and, in some cases, may be necessary.
Records of illness and absence should be kept by the laboratory director and it is the responsibility of the laboratory worker and his own medical adviser to keep the director informed of all absences due to illness.
Monitoring should ensure that:
Only highly trained personnel are entering in the facility.
Person working in the facility are not transporting the laboratory materials including hazardous organism outside the laboratory environment either without permission or without proper transport strategy with prior approval from competent authority.
Person working in the laboratory are well aware about the microorganism(s) to be handled and its associated risks.
Accidental spill or splashes are cleaned immediately, reported and recorded.
BSL-3
Protective solid-front laboratory clothing shall be worn by workers when in the laboratory and shall NOT be worn outside the laboratory.
An eye protection policy should be in place. Eye protection devices must be worn when the chance of eye contamination exists.
Respiratory protective equipment should be used if the microorganism has higher possibility of spread through aerosolization.
Appropriate gloves must be worn. Frequent glove changing and handwashing is standard practice.
Cleaning and re-use conditions (if permitted) should be clearly defined.
Medical examination of all laboratory personnel working in the containment laboratory is mandatory. This examination should include a detailed past medical history and clinical examination.
A baseline serum sample should be obtained and stored for future reference.
Employees either immunocompromised or being treated with immunosuppressive drugs should not be employed in containment laboratories.
BSL-4
Personnel who enter the suit area are required to wear a one-piece, positively pressurized, HEPA filter-supplied air suit. Air to the suit must be provided by a system that has a 100% redundant capability with an independent source of air, for use in the event of an emergency.
Worker must pass through a suit decontamination room before entering and leaving the working area.
Same as BSL-3 rules.

Those teams are available 24/7 to prevent the sometimes life-threatening situations that occur.  Lt Col Bergman: “This work is not without danger. A colleague of mine lost a part of his arm when removing a bomb attached to a traffic enforcement camera.”
For the detection of unexploded ordnance in national operations, first a screening is done. This kind of area screening is mostly done in the preparation of large building projects. Such a procedure consist of the research of historic documentation and doing sample measurements with a metal detector. Bergman: “We increasingly also “walk in the area digitally”, making use of explosives detecting robots.”
For the out-of-area missions, people of the EODD are deployed in foreign countries (often war zones) to remove explosives hampering military operations or endangering civilians. “We have been active in recent conflicts such as the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. Currently, people from the EODD assist special forces deployed in Mali, West-Africa. Also, the EODD is investigating the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 [plane with about 200 Dutch citizens shot down above the East of Ukraine], trying to resolve how and by whom the plane was shot down.”
“In Afghanistan we encountered a lot of IEDs,” Lt Col Bergman continued. “At first they were made with a lot of metal, which we could easily detect with a metal detector, but then the Taliban started to make IEDs with less or even no metal at all. This rendered our metal detectors useless, so we used dogs to detect the IEDs. Dogs are very good at detecting explosives, but the problem is that they indicate the main charge, while you would like to find the trigger.”
We were wondering if the “traditional landmine” was still in use, since you hear mostly about IEDs in the news. Unfortunately, it is: “Landmines are used in every conflict. Besides that, it takes a couple of seconds to lay a landmine but it might take decades to remove it. There is still a lot of trouble with landmines laid during the conflict in the Balkans and the war between Egypt and Israel.” Besides landmines, also cluster bombs provide a large threat. Cluster bombs are large bombs with many small mines/bombs inside; these small bombs are spread around the site of impact.  Bergman: “"

The schematic form of bilirubin (Figure 1B.) is almost never present (if so the molecule would have been directly polar and lipophilic) (Mugnoli et al. 1983). The more stable and dominant formation of bilirubin (Figure 1C.) is present when bilirubin is in liquid and solid constellations (Le Bas, Allegret, et al. 1980). In these forms the pigment creates several hydrogen bonds between the NH/O-groups and OH/-groups, which in turn makes the hydrophilic COOH- and NH-groups not available for polar interaction with their environment. Consequently the bilirubin becomes insoluble in water and methanol, but easy to dissolve in chloroform (Mugnoli et al. 1983). Even at the pH-values where the COOH-group is in an ionic state the formation of Figure 1C is predominant. These features also occur in well-known lipophilic compounds such as dioxins and polychlorated biphenyls (PCBs). Common properties for these compounds, among which bilirubin is included, is that they can diffuse through biological membranes in the placenta, blood brain barrier and hepatocytes.
Figure 1B: Linear structure of bilirubin. (Antony F. Mcdonagh et al. 1985).
Figure 1C: Crystalline and liquid structure of bilirubin. (Antony F. Mcdonagh et al. 1985).
Bilirubin is naturally excreted in the liver by, with the help of enzymes, conjugating with the sugar glucoronic acid to create glucuronides. Since the glucoronic acid contains several COOH- and OH-groups the bilirubin conjugate becomes more hydrophilic than the bilirubin alone. Thereby it becomes possible for the bilirubin to leave the liver and go along with the bile, through the kidneys and then finally get excreted with the urine.
One chain of glucuronic acid is enough to make the bilirubin excretable, but diglucoronides can also occur in the human bile. These contains two glucuronic acids per bilirubin molecule and the compound seems to simply be an effect of bilirubin’s three dimensional structure. No indications that the diglucuronides are"

How do we engage in our community?
We always try to educate the public and influence our community in a multifaceted way—not only by speeches but also by penetrating people’s life. Thus, we did four things to engage in our community:
1. Wechat Subscription Account for Public Education
2. Speech about Synthetic Biology to Middle School Students
3. Open-Lab Activity for Teens in Shenzhen
4. Synthetic Biology Popularization in Lianhua Mountain Park
1. WeChat Subscription Account
a) What’s WeChat subscription account?
WeChat is now the most popular app in China with 889 Million monthly active WeChat users globally (Source: Tencent Biznext, 2016). We registered a WeChat subscription account: When we send messages, people who follow our accounts will see the update information in the subscription area.
We are the only team in China that use our WeChat subscription account to introduce our Synthetic Biology project in detail (Other teams always only introduce their projects briefly). Our articles are also the best in quality and quantity
b) What can we do with subscription account?
We send our articles regularly. Articles include introductions to Synthetic Biology, iGEM Competition, our team, and our project.
c) How does it relate to the public?
People can know more about our team and the scientific knowledge in our articles. It is easy to follow us on WeChat, just scanning the QR Code or searching for our team’s name. People can glance over our articles in their spare time and share our articles on the “moments,” a function in WeChat that would allow all of their friends to see our work. If people appreciate our work, they can click the ""like"" button or discuss on the discussion board under our article. We would reply and answer their questions in the discussion board.
d) What do we achieve?
For all of the twenty-three articles we sent, hundreds of people read them and click the “like” button. When a new article comes out, our friends and classmates are pleased to share these articles on their “moment.” Since we use lively and interesting tone to share our knowledge on Synthetic Biology, most people appreciate our works and are willing to share these articles.
Most importantly, our subscription account recently became a Verified Original Subscription Account in Science, an honor title"

Project Conceptualisation
Initially, the idea of the project came from one of our team members Ruby Kell and one of our advisors Mateusz Jurga. However, later on Piotr Janas, redirected the idea from examining both MRSA and UTIs, to just UTIs. This was to eliminate any false positives from commensals appearing in our sample. Urine is considered sterile, therefore culture urine and focus on UTIs.

Project Design (Science)
All Biologists (Harindi Jayakody, Ruby Kell, Thea Chrysostomou, Piotr Janas) researched current diagnostic tests and what was already in the field, and then collaborated with the rest of the Sheffield iGEM team to produce our final device. The team was guided by the supervisor Dimitrios Michailidis. During the development of the project, they all helped to arrange and attend meetings with relevant academics at the university of Sheffield, clinicians from abroad and microbiologists to ensure that the biology behind the idea was sound. They then went on to produce some antibiotic resistant bacterial strains by transformation of iGEM biobricks. These were initially used to produce bacterial growth curves, and then used for the 96 well plate reader experiments, which were then analysed. We have used Kanamycin, Chloramphenicol, Carbenicillin and wild type (control)  as strains and we tested whether E. coli is resistant or sensitive to the particular antibiotics. Then using the well plate reader we obtained our results and analysed them.

Combined with easy to use software, high resolution cameras, and brilliant LED illumination, these inverted research systems are flexible to see the expression of the fluorescent protein EYFP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through high speed imaging, using the external fluorescent filter wheels, we obtained fast and accurate fluorescent images as following show. It tells that our bacteria that we constructed express EYFP successfully and continuously in oscillating system. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity detected was very bright, indicating that the expression of EYFP was at a high level.

The utility of threshold limitation
Much as excessive signal levels can destroy a radio transmitter, excessive genetic expression can cause damage in living systems.  While cells are usually well-equipped to modulate their own transcriptional behavior, an investigation into pathological gene expression indicates that many situations arise wherein the expected regulatory response fails.  Our device is designed to augment endogenous gene regulatory pathways.

Physically, our contribution to the community is twofold:
This summer we created Neptune, an integrated microfluidic design suite. This is a single software tool that spans the entire microfluidic design process. In Neptune, users can create microfluidic chips design schematics with the aid of algorithms that optimize the design. Neptune allows microfluidics to be designed through LFR, a specification we worked to create. With LFR, designs are parametric and the design process is simple. Neptune also allows researchers to run experiments directly through the interface by providing a control page. Users can upload a chip design to Neptune, and then use Neptune to manipulate valve states and actuate pumps to generate fluid flows in the chip.
We did not stop there. This summer we also created a full hardware control infrastructure for microfluidic chips. We developed original designs for controlling valve actuation and fluid dispension using low cost servo motors and 3D printed components. These designs are both parametric, and the they have high precision in their fluid dispension. Further, we designed 3D print schematics for a pump array to control a microfluidic chip; these 3D print schematics are all served through Neptune.
Thus, we have developed everything a researcher would need to design, fabricate, and run experiments on their microfluidic device. Accessibility, though, has always been our biggest goal. We developed this entire workflow with the synthetic biology community in mind. Microfluidics have always been very difficult to fabricate, and costly, with tools for fabrication and design costing nearly $100,000. Further, control infrastructure is also costly, and most software tools to control microfluidics are specialized to single hardware pieces. We developed our workflow to interface with and use only open source, low cost tools. We designed 3D printed hardware for the purpose of providing a more accessible alternative, and we use the MakerFluidics fabrication protocol to keep fabrication costs as low as possible.
Please, follow this link to see the documentation for Neptune, and our hardware pieces."

To make navigation as easy as possible, we've used the default iGEM pages and spent a long time thinking about the structure of the rest of our site. The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .

Introduction
The purpose of synthetic biology is to create artificial biological systems. We connect a certain amount of gene to build gene network, making them run like a circuit. According to this principle, the game players play an engineering bacterium and look for gene fragments in each level of adventure, to form a complete genetic line, so that the engineering bacteria can be changed to special bacteria that are used to solve disease or environmental problems.
The operation of this game is simple and flexible. The left key controls the role move towards left and the right key controls it move towards right. In this game, player tries to find possible solutions about the disease and environmental problems which human beings pay close attention to. The game involves the knowledge of synthetic biology, including gene lines, transformation of engineering bacteria, disease monitoring and so on, which can introduce synthetic biology to a certain amount of teenagers, and deepen their understanding of the ways to solve disease and environmental problems.
The goal of making this game is embedding science into game, to expand the accepting crowd of scientific knowledge. This game is a 2D horizontal board scroll category casual games. Each level of the game contains the method of a specific disease environmental problem, and different levels have different story backgrounds and ways of playing, which make the game become more interesting to play.
Design
Dr. Lee has troubles when he solve environmental and disease problems by transforming engineering bacteria. So he decides to ask his students Keith to use VR technology to simulate the visual angle of Escherichia coli, looking for the genetic fragments to build the right genetic route, changing the engineering bacteria to special bacteria which can solve environmental and disease problems. Dr. Lee will give instructions to Keith while he looking for genetic fragments.
Postgraduate
Dr. Lee (NPC): Our research has encountered difficulties, so I need to investigate which step has problem in the genetic line. The whole device related on simulation system based VR that it gives prominence to the operation of the user. By which I need you to play the role of Escherichia coli to discover correct gene line, and I will give you instructions in the process.

2.    Prepare iDUET101a (Addgene) in which EF-1alpha promoter was cloned from. This plasmid contains EF-1alpha promoter and EGFP reporter. We have transfected this plasmid for positive control for EF-1alpha characterization.
3.    Culture HEK293FT cell line (see below)
4.    Transfect EF-1alpha characterization construct, CMV construct, negative control and positive control plasmids in HEK293FT cell line.
5.    Observe GFP signal under fluorescence microscope
Cell Culture and Transfection
We cultured HEK 293FT cells following American Type Culture Collection’s standard procedure, except that we used DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in our culture medium. For transfection, we  followed the manufacturer’s protocol of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) and used serum-free and antibiotics-free DMEM to form the DNA-lipofectamine complex.
Result
Figure 1: GFP signal of EF-1alpha observed. HEK293FT cells were transfected with iDUET101a (positive control), pEF-1alpha-GFP, pCMV-GFP (alternative mammalian constitutive promoter), and GFP without promoter. Cells transfected with pEF-1alpha-GFP showed weaker green signal compared to those with iDUET101a and pCMV-GFP. This result agreed with the result reported by Qin et al., that the EF-1alpha promoter gives weaker activity than CMV promoter in HEK293T cells. Our negative control, GFP without promoter did not give any GFP signal. Scale bar = 0.1mm
At the time of regional jamboree, no GFP signal could be observed in cells transfected with GFP reporter driven by EF-1alpha promoter. Originally, we thought that the sequence of EF-1alpha promoter cloned from i"

In order to achieve the functionality of pneumosensor, we must have a highly specific reporting system which will only give fluorescent signal under the presence of S. pneumoniae. In search for the suitable gene circuit, the discovery by Prof. Morrison on the competence for genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae which depends on quorum-sensing system to control many competence-specific genes acting in DNA uptake, processing, and integration has provided the ideal framework for this module. (Lee and Morrison, 1999) There is a link between this quorum-sensing system and the competence-specific genes, which is an alternative σx (ComX protein) that serves as a competence-specific global transcription modulator. (Luo and Morrison, 2003) In S. pneumoniae, competence (a state capable of being genetic transformed) happens transiently during the log phase growth, and is regulated by a quorum sensing system utilizing the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). Upon stimulation by CSP, σx will be expressed and associated with RNA polymerase apoenzyme. The resulting holoenzyme will then be guided by σx to initiate transcription of a set of “late” genes enabling genetic transformation and other unknown functions. Characterized genes regulated by σx were found to contain an 8 base pairs consensus sequence TACGAATA known as the Cin-Box or the Com-Box. (Piotrowski, Luo, & Morrison, 2009). Taking advantage of this competence-specific mechanism, it is now able to produce the S. pneumoniae sensing device of high specificity by incorporating this system into E. coli.
iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST Team has cloned σx from S. pneumoniae strain NCTC7465 and characterized its ability to initiate transcription of two downstream promoters with different lengths: PcelA ( BBa_K1379000 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_K1379001 ), which have the consensus Com-Box sequence. Though much information about the promoters is readily available nowadays, its characterization of promoter activity, specificity, sequence, as well as the biomolecular mechanism can be greatly enhanced with further investigations and experiments. Hence, we were interested in reproducing this gene circuit with all the associated genes and promoters to be combined into a single transcriptional unit. Despite the suggested susceptibility to leakage and other factors that may hinder or interrupt the mechanism, researches have reported that the pathway was highly specific to certain environmental conditions and stress, suggesting minimal or no leakage"

For us:
Teammates of Lanzhou helped us to construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor                                         Rho-OR1A1. Since the position of the initiation codon 64bp in the OR1A1 sequence                                         contained the EcoRI site which did not conform to the RFC10 standard, they used the                                         primer containing the synonymous codon to mutate the site and successfully mutated                                         the GAA to GAG.
With ZJU_China
Another partner was ZJU_China, we had a leisure talk about projects with their teammates                                         in their laboratory in the end of the July.We later had collaborated in fluorescence                                         detection tests. In their project, they only observed the fluorescence by fluorescence                                         microscope, while we used Microplate Reader to detect the EGFP expression in the                                         hyphae of T. atroviridewe.
First, we cultured Trichoderma that has been transformed EGFP and wild Trichoderma,                                         and then we picked mycelium for fluorescence detection, the following table for the                                         data:
The data we provided them were more quantitatively and measurable which proved that they have succeed in expressing heterogenous                                         gene in our aiming chassis.
For us:
The iSmeller biosensor constructed in our project will activate the cAMP pathway after                                         binding of the odor molecule with specific olfactory receptor. To determine whether                                         the activation of the cAMP pathway can be used as a test indicator for our reporter                                         gene (luciferase), the igem team of Zhejiang University has helped us to make a luminescence                                         detection by stimulation of forskolin which is a kind of adenylate cyclase activator.

We also helped Nankai University to verify the function of the lyase gene. We synthesize the lyase gene whose sequence from Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp10 and transformed it into Enterobacter sp. FY-07. After we added the inducer (arabinose), it is obvious that the bacteria begin to die which will ensure that the bacteria will die after working, and will not affect the environment.

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html," 2-4 days just to get a quote. Emailed Dr. Pamela Silver questions about using IDT as a synthesis (they did it without G block synthesis, so probably used the mini-gene option.)  If correspondence goes well, then hopefully we can get her to look at our sequence. It might be more expensive than anticipated, but we’ll see. Also working with Anthony on how to tether split GFP to PUF. will flip one of the PUF binding sites in order to put the split GFP closer together.
Thursday, 7/5/12  - Adi, corporate/entrepreneurship - Been working with Alex on the entrepreneurship wiki, went to Chicago to do design the website with Alex. At this point have the entire structure of the wiki, but are hosting it on a different domain so that the code can get perfected and then uploaded to the iGEM wiki. So far, it looks so good. The iGEM entrepreneurship wiki should be up in around 2 weeks. Once there is data it will get uploaded and the entrepreneurship code can get transferred to the normal wiki if necessary. Also, obtain $250 from the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center, Courtney has given the approval to use this to buy enzymes. SARSTEDT is also going to sponsor us, but they have not specified an amount yet.  - Anthony, PUF biobricking - looked at gel of PSB1C3 run by Asha. The bands were not correct, so digested more. Each had 2 bands and none of them were the right size. Will use linearized plasmid next. Made LB and autoclaved more 1.5 centrifuge tubes.  - Asha, PUF - still waiting on WT PUF/ pBAD primers, so in the meantime I made 11 tubes of DH5a cells. And plated YFP constructs from glycerol stock to do colony PCR again.
Friday, 7/6/12  - Adi, Entrepreneurship - same as yesterday. entrepreneurship wiki, money from Roy J. Carver (for sequencing), some sort of sponsorship from sarstedt. DWR and Fisher haven’t really responded, so Courtney will contact them personally to try to get a response. Will contact Ginkgo Bioworks next. Will also set up times outside of advisor’s meetings to meet with Joe Bradley.  - Anthony, PUF - PCRed 2 tubes of WT PUF, started 3 ligations with 3 different digestions and the one type of PSB1C3"
LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Application#Diagnosis Treatment_-_-_TEXT.html," Therefore, verification by a molecular biological test is recommended. Current biological tests (e.g. coagulase) require a time-consuming (18-24h) culturing step. Based on the test results, rapid and strict hygiene rules, e.g. separation from non-infected persons, seem to be very effective to lower the spread of health-care associated MRSA.
Here, we suggest an alternative strategy that can potentially facilitate the current diagnosis procedure.
The BaKillus S. aureus diagnosis tool:
We are planning to develop a ready-to-use diagnosis tool for point-of-care testing by the professional staff in hospitals, pharmacies or medical offices (see Fig. 2). A smear of a patient into a BaKillus-reporter culture could be enough to verify the presence of S. aureus within 0.5-2 hours (just limited by the time for BaKillus spore germination and reporter gene expression). This culture-independent detection could be precautionary used by patients of certain risk groups. The fast result would enable health-care institutions to directly start subsequent treatments/hygiene measures just after arrival of the patient and thus contact between infected and non-infected patients and therefore the spreading of multi-resistant pathogens could be lowered.
Figure 2: Basic concept of the BaKillus diagnostic tool. BaKillus spores are stored separately in a self-contained device. About one hour before use, spores and medium are mixed and incubated for the germination of the spores. The sample of a patient (e.g. a smear) can be applied into the culture and after about 30 minutes the result can be analysed (e.g. pigment production or luminescence as a reaction to pathogens)
Table 1: Discussion of the BaKillus diagnostic tool.
Strengths
Weaknesses
Detection & Identification of AIP-dependent pathogens discriminating them from the opportunistic non-pathogenic state
Application is limited to targets that exhibit QS-dependent pathogenicity.
Pigments would be ideal to use as bio-reporters (the output of the detection device). The change of colour can be observed by eye and thus the product needs no high-end technology or electricity. Therefore highly portable and independent device for usage in abroad and crisis regions
Initial assessment of the sensitivity of the test and tests for reliability of the tool required
Self-contained device prevents release of GMOs and thus the product only requires a proposal for release (personal communication Dr. Ulrich Ehlers, Commissioner for GMO-release in Germany, BVL and Dr. Hans Schrubar Commissioner for Bio-Safety in Bavaria)

May 29: First Day of Research
First Day of Research
I woke up bright and early to be surprised that the whole Lakehouse was already bustling with activity. Then, I realized that almost everyone was doing research at Wellesley, so pretty much, everyone walked to the Science Center together!
Today was the first day of research. My group met together, did some intros, and gave an overview of the whole lab. We went over briefly what kind of projects we’re going to be working on and the activities that we’re going to do. And they’re all going to be super exciting!
I’m going to be working with another lab partner on building softwares on the Beast (aka a tabletop interaction surface, but it’s almost the size of a bed!), something unique and made especially by and for our lab. But first we had to make sure that it can display images well, so our task today was to align the mirrors that project the image of the beast to create a desktop smooth background. However, these mirrors were very sensitive and we had a limited amount of space to work with! We were under the table for the whole time and everything took a lot of patience. We all knew that we can get our images aligned and calibrated, but it’s just going to take time. So there we are, under the table/ screen, fiddling around with the knobs, and trying to figure out with way to turn it tighter/ looser (lefty loosy, righty tighty) for the whole day. But wala! It finally worked. We were able to get our images align and smooth out the pattern on top. It was very satisfying to see it work and to know that we did it!
May 30: Simple day
Today was a relatively simple day. I did a lot of research and reading, which was fun. I learned a lot more about where HCI and how the Beast compared to other systems that are already being developed already. And this made me realize that there are other simpler ideas and machines out there. But, it is still a relatively undiscovered field. There are many questions being asked and many being answered. It’s very interesting to see the type of approach and solutions they came up with. With that, I’m really excited about the potential of the Beast. From what I have read today, there isn’t another system like this. The surface is so big that it can’t really be compared nor can results"

I am planning to specialize in the field of Cellular and Molecular  Microbiology, which deals primarily with investigation of bacteria. This year, I  will be helping to promote iGEM with the Marketing and Finance team as well as  assisting with the wetlab components. I joined the iGEM team because of the new  and exciting field as well as the opportunity to work hands-on with a group of  people.  Synthetic biology is a very new field with massive amounts of potential  and I am excited to be a part of this team. I love sports and am a huge Calgary  Flames and New England Patriots fan.

In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour in the tourist center of the city and ended up having dinner with a picnic in the Parc Guell. A viewpoint that have views of the entire city at night.
During the morning of the last day, to close the meet up, we were able to attend to some enriching expert talks. They offered us their views on synthetic biology and they explained the works in which they are immersed today.
Back to Meet up Index
Organization of a Meet Up: Another European Meet Up
Reason
After attending two meet ups we realized that these meetings are very enriching experiences in preparation for the Giant Jamboree. One of the main reasons for these meet ups is to get to know and know the project of other teams. Other reason is that its also serves to practice the presentations of the project and its results. And finally serve to open the network of contacts beyond the contest itself.
We realized that the events to which more teams come are usually the first ones to be organized, and in these although if they serve to obtain collaborations, do not fulfill so much the function of practicing to present the results of your project due to at the beginning of the summer there are no results.
This year the European meet up was on July 20. Date in which novice teams, without sufficient contacts do not yet know how to deal with these events and do not have the necessary funds to attend. And teams with more experience do not yet have conclusive results. With this context we proposed this ambitious project: Make another European meet up. We invited all the teams of the continent in mid-September. A date that was supposed to be the best for the organization of new teams and with the possibility of simulating the final event.
Event
The event was organized between September 14 and 16. Although this event was given as much publicity as possible and contact was made with all possible teams in Europe, attendance was low due to several factors:
- Spain is geographically at one end of Europe and travel is expensive.
- The teams were short of funds and were saving for the trip to Boston.
- The event was announced at the beginning of September, many teams did not have room to maneuver in their organization to attend.
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.

UNebraska-Lincoln,2018,Team:UNebraska-Lincoln#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," express pathway for the biosynthesis of 7-epi-sesquithujene. Following the procedure of an article that describes the purification of volatile sesquiterpenes produced from unidentified terpene synthase genes (Kazutoshi et. al, 2018),  we decided to use a culturing condition that requires a two-layer culture media consisting of Terrific Broth and octane. The E. coli cells were first cultured to desirable cell densities, IPTG was added for induction of the enzyme expression and octane was then added to culture media. The cultures were shaken for 2-4 days. The octane was then separated from the Terrific Broth via centrifugation and collected in an Erlenmeyer flask. The resulting cell pellets were stored in a -80 C freezer for ensuing protein analysis.  More detailed explanation of these procedures can be found in the lab notebook, experiments and results sections.
Future Outlooks: Where From Here?:
The next step would be a scale-up operation to see if the cells would be viable in a larger bioreactor with such a large amount of organic solvent in the media
For verification of production, further purifying 7-epi-sesquithujene for analytical techniques such as NMR and IR would be beneficial. A procedure has been outlined in Kazutoshi et. al for a wide range of different sesquiterpenes, and preliminary trials were ran with purification of amorphadiene.
Discussing with trap manufactures and further researching the amounts required for effective baiting in modern Emerald Ash Borer traps.
Further collaboration with the Nebraska Forest Service and potentially collaborating with the U.S. Forest Service to see if our initial research could be helpful in any way.

World Heart Day takes place on 29 September every year which focuses on creating heart-healthy environments this year. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the world today: over 17.3 million people die from cardiovascular disease each year. According to REPORT ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES IN CHINA 2014, there are 290 million people suffering from cardiovascular disease in China and one in every five adults suffering from it. An estimated 3.5 million people die each year from cardiovascular disease, namely 9,590 death every day. People find out that 80 percent of cardiovascular disease is caused by coronary heart disease and its complications such as heart failure, valvular heart disease and congenital heart disease, which can also lead to sudden death. However, the current standard treatments like coronary artery bypass surgery, intervention and drug therapy can only delay the development of the disease but not cure it. These three treatments are also have some shortcomings such as the high risk of failure, limited treatment effect and a wide variety of side effects.
Facing the grim situation of cardiovascular disease, we wish to solve a particular problem of cardiovascular disease through the methods of synthetic biology. Before designing project, we read a lot of literature and statistical reports of cardiovascular disease. Then we read all iGEM projects in health and medicine track in the past five years and analyze the types of diseases and their treatments that were concerned in different regions each year. We analyze the following five topics from Health and Medicine track of interest to us: cardiovascular disease, cancer, detection or fighting against pathogens, drug carrier and obesity. It has played a very important role in our project designing that allows us to propose a specific project design idea by combining the design concept of synthetic biology and the current situation of the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The following is the analytical report of the projects of these five topics.

But acceptance of blue bio energy opens the door for other applications as well.  The use of GMOs in all kinds of products like food and toilet cleaning supplies would also be a concerning development. The impact of introducing GMOs in everyday life can not be without second thoughts. We as a society have the responsibility to leave this planet nice and healthy for the next generations. So regulations regarding these kind of changes which could influence the society and the globe in general is something we are obligated to do for the next generation. Nevertheless, it is a relief that new techniques would be used to solve world problems instead instead of just focussing on local problems. A future where new techniques are used to solve problems on a world scale (problems that threaten the existence of the world as we know it) would be an improvement. But exaggerating and using GMOs whenever you feel like it without thinking about the consequences for the future would be a bad development. The ethical principles which we think that are slightly more important than the others are environmental sustainability and ethical duty, these are both taken into account in the second scenario in which the use of blue energy and GMOs is allowed with restrictions.  Dit is ook terug te zien  This is also seen in the replies of the survey we did. The most picked scenario was scenario 2 - Blue Bio energy. The ethical principle that people decided that were the most important were environmental sustainability and human rights. The ethical principle that people saw most represented in the scenarios that they preferred was almost unanimous environmental sustainability.  The response wasn’t broad enough to connect results towards a specific stakeholder.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"FP expression. This appears to be the case, with almost no change in CFP levels with OD600.
YFP levels divided by OD600. Because YFP should be a measure of cell density along with OD600, we expected that this ratio should approach a constant value. This appears to be the case, although only at higher cell densities.
A difference in CFP has also been observed between uninduced and induced (1mM IPTG) plates under the fluorescence microscope. Unfortunately, we were unable to test this induction (and the consequences of ratiometric measurement on the reliability of resulting data) with the plate reader before the deadline (possibly due to difficulties with culturing the cells in M9 minimal medium). We will reattempt this assay before the jamboree and are confident that results should be as expected.
Transformation of B. subtilis with the plasmid has also been attempted- unfortunately we are still finetuning our B. subtilis transformation protocol. Again, we hope to show that this works before the Jamboree.

Lanzhou,2017,Team:Lanzhou#Questionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html," new on the farming lands, they will spray herbicides for one time in advance.
9. How do you get the instruction on how to use herbicides and fertilizers?
Most farmers chose to listen to the description from those salespeople, because the packages or forms of herbicides and fertilizers were rather different. Only some of them used them according to the enclosed instructions. Integrated with answers from question2, farmers still relied on experiences and other peoples’ advice and experiences because of their low literacy to a certain extent.
10. Will the fertility be influenced by the application of herbicides or fertilizers?
The answers to this question were predominantly no. Because of the limited farming lands every family possessed, they could only plant on the same lands continuously. Thus, the natural fertility of this land had already been lost. Only by using fertilizers can they solve the dilemma of lacking fertility.
11. Are there any apparent changes after the application of herbicides or fertilizers?
The crops on which the herbicides were sprayed on grew better than before. All farmers in the village spray fertilizers on their own plants, which actually force pests to eat those plants without being sprayed by pesticides. Therefore, those plants without being sprayed can’t grow as well as other plants.
12. Is there any harm brought by the application of herbicides or fertilizers?
According to what they said, the skin and respiratory tract were really hurt after the application of herbicides, especially of glyphosate.
Conclusion
According to the data and information we had obtained from local farmers living in northwestern region of China, we could reach several conclusions. First the crops planted in this region were only limited in certain species, so when we were designing our part and choosing target gene, we must expel the essential gene of wheat, corns and other local crops. Second, the path from which they local farmers obtained herbicides is really fixed, because of their habit of using these herbicides and their customs. It is really hard to change their habit of using this kind of herbicide, unless our bio-herbicide is much cheaper than glysphosate. Third, up to now, those farmers haven’t felt any great discomfort brought the usage of glysphosate. From their point of views, glyphosate brought more good than harm.
As far as we are concerned, since the genuine harm brought by glyphosate have already been revealed, more propaganda of glyphosate advantages and disadvantages need to be spread. The industrial structure needs to be transformed to a certain degree to fit green industries which is harmless to human and nature instead of those industries which release toxic chemicals.

TetR - RFP system
Description
This first readout system is the simplest one; it is composed of TetR driven by a constitutive promoter with RFP (red fluorescent protein) under Ptet control. If TetR binds to Ptet, then RFP is repressed. By applying different concentrations of ATC (anhydrotetracycline) to the cells, RFP is expressed - the stronger the TetR mutant binds to Ptet, the higher the ATC concentration needed to have full expression of RFP. The genetic cascade is depicted in the illustration below.
The TetR and RFP genes were put on two different plasmids: pSB3K1 pConst-TetR and J61002 Ptet-RFP. For more details about them, please refer to the Plasmids details page.
Experimental validation - with wild-type TetR
ATC induction
To validate our first readout system, we performed platereader experiments with different concentrations of anhydrotetracycline (ATC). This molecule binds to the TetR dimers and induces conformational changes that make the transcription factor unable to bind to Ptet. As a result, RFP can be expressed in the cell, as shown in the cartoons below:

ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine ( Leventis, 2010 ), which is a membrane lipid usually found in the inner part of the cell, but in cells undergoing apoptosis it is exposed to the outer membrane due to the activity of flipases ( Leventis, 2010 ).
Annexin V is a soluble protein which has an unknown role in mammalian cell except its binding properties to membrane components( Gerke et al, 2002 ). As we want to express Annexin V in the outer membrane we need a protein that will export it. For this purpose we chose INP and changed the YFP, present in the part ( BBa_K523013 ), for a human Annexin V protein optimized for Escherichia coli codon usage (ThermoFisher Scientific GeneOptimizer(R)). We used a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), a low expression promoter ( BBa_J23114 ) and a low copy plasmid with a pSC101 origin of replication to avoid an excessive stress for the cell, as it is a membrane protein.
Results
To test our construct we used:
J23114-B0032-INP-Annexin V in pSEVA371 (low copy plasmid)expressing RFP in TOP10 cells
J23114 expressing RFP in TOP10 cells
As a first test, we did an assay with beads. We used magnetic beads coated with Protein A, which we incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-Annexin V antibodies (Affimetrix) for 30 min and then with the bacteria with different constructs. Unfortunately, we were not able to detect binding of our cells.  We also did a Western blot to analize the expression of our construct using our anti-Annexin V antibody (Affimetrix) and we observed no band at the height where Annexin V is expected (35.9 kDa).
We wondered what could have gone wrong, so we checked with an RBS calculator ( Salis et al, 2015 ) whether the expression would be high enough with our design. There, we realized that Annexin V showed a very low calculated translation initiation rate, which might indicate low or no expression. Using B0032 with INP-Annexin V we were getting a translation initiation rate of 410 a.u., while if we changed the RBS to B0034, we would get 12 000 a.u. Therefore, we changed the RBS of INP-Annexin V and Annexin V to B0034. As"

Quorum Sensing and Synthetic biology
This system has already been used in the field of synthetic biology to create new behaviors. For instance, Lingchong YOU et al. (2004) designed a bacteria that regulates the maximum density of bacteria inducing a controlled suicide via intercellular communication. With this system, even if the population is stable the genome is expressed as if they were in exponential growth.
Fig 2 : Structure of two different AHL. In orange the common part to all AHL. A : 3OC6-HSL synthesized by LuxI. B : 3OC1-HSL synthesized by LasI
Other quorum sensing systems has been described in different species of baceteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The system has the same architecture with protein LasI that synthesize the AHL that binds to LasR, the intracellular receptor. One of the differences between those to systems is the structure of the AHL (Figure 2.)
The use of two quorum sensing system is possible. This is one of the challenges that Frederick K. BALAGADDE et al. (2008) carried out successfully. They constructed a synthetic ecosystem that imitates the prey-predator relationship in two different strains of E. coli.

Design and Assembly
Assembly of Bicistronic Expression Operating Units<\p>
(Parts are not depicted to scale)
We originally planned to synthesize the BCDs with double terminators included as gBlocks. This would give them the exact same sequence after GGC as those sent to us by V. Mutalik. However, the hairpins of the BBa_B0015 sequence made gBlock synthesis unfeasible. Therefore, we combined the BCDs with BBa_B0015 and the pSB1C3 plasmid through standard assembly. The intent was that future users would start at step 2 of the above figure after synthesizing a compatible promoter and coding sequence of choice.
Existing promoters and coding sequences can be made compatible with this assembly by PCR primer overhangs or re-synthesis including the necessary BpiI flanking regions and sticky ends.

If not for time and budget constraints, we would have synthesized or PCR amplified many more (10-20) coding sequences with flanking BpiI sites for insertion into the BCDs. As well we would make monocistronic operating units with the the same promotors (Ptrc*) and coding sequences. This would have allowed us to calculate variances and compare BCD with MCD much the same way as did Mutalik et al. in their original paper.
Results and Conclusion
After we cloned in Golden Gate, we managed to successfully culture BCD constructs 7, 18, and 23 in liquid culture. After growing these up to a good OD, we spun them down and ran them through a fluorometer to measure the red fluorescence of mrfp. This indicates that the BpiI-GGC assembly scheme, our mfrp1 gene with synonymous DNA base substitutions and the Ptrc* promoter work at least in the context of a bicistronic expression operating unit.
