UCL,2018,Team:UCL#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," protein work whereas Catherine and Stefanie continued cloning. Protein
Our RFP, GFP and Intein Passenger plasmids were transformed into E. Coli BL21 for expression. As seen in the photo below, the expression was successful. They were induced with 400 μM IPTG when OD reached 0.6. Expression was done overnight at 25˚C and 37˚C to test for optimal conditions. Some of our 50 ml LB overnight cultures were contaminated and had to be repeated. Fluorescence was measured using our BMG plate reader. The cells were sonicated, and the proteins purified and run on an SDS gel.
As the Intein Passenger is ready we can start cloning in our nickel binding peptide (NikR) and our estrogen binding peptide (ER). We first amplified them through PCR, as seen on the first gel. Another attempt of GFP cloning gave the second gel; it looks like GFP2C1 (colony 1) could have worked. To compare our improved mScarlet-intein BBa_K2842669 construct to Heidelberg’s 2014 RFP-intein construct BBa_K1362101, we cloned their construct into BL21 cells.
Week 24 (October 1 - October 5)
Dry Lab Overview
We started planning the art exhibition with the CSM artists and brainstormed ideas as to what could be used. We decided to break the project down into history, current applications and future applications of spider silk.
Wet Lab Overview
More fluorescence measurements were completed, comparing our Intein Passenger to Heidelberg’s construct.
Our new GFP Gibson Assemblies were sent for sequencing. A colony PCR of Intein Passenger containing NikR and ER gave a promising gel. These samples were also sent for sequencing and confirmed to be correct. Our constructs were prepared to be shipped to Boston.
Week 25 (October 8 - October 12)
Dry Lab Overview
We talked with UAL students to plan an spider-related art exhibition. They utilised chemicals to simulate spider silk polymerisation.
Wet Lab Overview
Even more fluorescence measurements were completed, comparing our Intein Passenger to Heidelberg’s construct.
Week 26 (October 15 - October 17)
Dry Lab Overview
We finalised all the Wiki and BioBrick Registry content.

Introduction
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a gram-negative facultative anaerobe capable of transferring electrons from the cytoplasmic space to electron acceptors outside the outer membrane (OM) [1,2]. In particular, the Mtr respiratory pathway of MR-1 is required for the extracellular reduction of metals and metal oxides 2. The Shewanella Mtr gene cluster encodes three outer membrane cytochromes (OMCs), MtrF, OmcA, and MtrC, two periplasmic decaheme cytochromes, MtrD and MtrA, and two alleged OM b-barrel proteins, MtrB  and MtrE. The current model of Mtr respiration begins with electron transfer from carbon source catabolism to CymA, a cytoplasmic membrane (CM) cytochrome protein via the menaquinone pool. From there, electrons can be transferred to a number of different periplasmic electron carriers (PECs). MtrA, a decaheme c-type cytochrome and the predominant PEC for reduction of iron(III) and flavins, is physically associated with MtrB, a b-barrel protein spanning the  outer membrane. Together, the MtrAB complex transfers electrons to OmcA and MtrC, two outer-membrane c-type cytochromes, which can function as the terminal reductases for a number of different metal substrates [1,4].

Table 1: Nanodrop results
Packaging: The Packaging team prepared DNA samples and analyzed the samples with the Nanodrop device. Later, the team used restriction enzymes to slice open the DNA and then ran the samples through gel electrophoresis. The project idea continued to progress with the team finding parts form the iGEM inventory and researching DNA sequences of the various parts.
Week 3: June 12-16
Monday (06/12/17)
The whole team met in the morning to discuss the Wiki and each group’s project.
Sense/Respond: The students went to a group meeting within their labs. Students streaked bacteria onto agar plates and put back into the incubator. The rest of the day was spent collaborating on website design and graphic design. Two coding novices, Annie and Jason, worked on learning html, CSS, and Javascript. Graphic designer Tina created a new mascot microbe. Assistant graphic designer and artist Annie created a drawing of the original Wright Flyer and assisted in Photoshop drawing. Stenographer Hayley typed up protocols and helped organize team documents.
Packaging: The RX team observed the preparation and running of PCR. The team made LB broth and agar. Later the team observed the purification of the PCR results and the analyzation of the results with Qubit.
Tuesday (06/13/17)
Sense/Respond: The students removed the agar plates with bacteria from the incubator. Two tubes were filled with LB broth, one labeled as a blank and one containing the bacteria. Using a sterile toothpick, a single colony was picked from each plate, and placed in the culture tube. An unused sterile toothpick was added to the blank tube, to verify that the process was sterile. These tubes were then shaken in an incubator for 3 hours.
The students conducted an experiment using culture growth to see if the bacteria will turn green with the addition of the quorum sensing molecule to the bacteria.
The next morning, the plasmid should glow green indicating it is present.
Packaging: The RX team attended a Materials Lab meeting. Afterwards, the team poured agar plates and transferred LB broth from"
ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," = g([AHL]) = f([AHL]) + aLeakiness. We obtain the expected information that the signal over noise ratio is greater by one order of magnitude for the riboregulated system than for the non-riboregulated system. A drawback from the riboregulated system is that the amplitude of the signal corresponds to the amplitude of the noise in the non-riboregulated system.
The experimental design also allowed us to detect eventual cross-talk with other signaling molecules, the one corresponding to the las system and the one corresponding to the rhl system. No cross-talk was observed with the signaling molecule of the rhl system. However, the las system signaling molecule activated the Lux promoter. We chose to model this cross-talk, which corresponds to the induction of a promoter, by an Hill function. This fitting allowed us to verify that the Hill function was adapted to describe a cross-talk phenomena. The derived parameters indicated that the concentration in the las signaling molecule had to be high in order to have an effect on our system (It was two orders of magnitude away from the needed concentration of AHL to activate the system). Nevertheless, once activated, the effects of these crosstalk are not to be neglected. Check the following article for more information on the experimental setting.
These results are promising and we look forward to fit the dynamic data of this system.

We have a lot of results for cross-talk experiments. Check the corresponding article for more details. For the moment lux promoter doesn't respon to other AHLs. This is a good step towards orthogonality.
Current challenges :
AHL producer strains are not producing enough. We have to improve the RBS.

First cross talk experiments
Friday, 11th August
After having constructed the necessary regulator and sensor plasmids we were able to start first cross talk experiments. Therefore we transformed competent cells with different combinations of regulator and sensor plasmids. One example would be the strain siG0024 which contains the regulator plasmid piG0041 producing LuxR under a constitutive promoter and the sensor plasmid piG0051 that encodes for sfGFP. The latter is under control of a pluxR promoter, hence it will be transcribed in the presence of"

Edinburgh UK iGEM Meetup
On the 23rd and 24th of June 2009 Newcastle attended the UK iGEM team meetup in Edinburgh, Scotland. The event was hosted by Edinburgh University, a fellow iGEM competitor.
The trip
Day One
Team Newcastle visiting Edinburgh Castle.
Not all of the team were able to attend, but 6 students, one advisor and two instructors met at Newcastle Railway Station at 10:30am to catch the 10:59am train to Edinburgh. The reserved seats were on two different coaches, but due to the number of free seats, we were able to sit together.
Upon arriving in Edinburgh we had lunch in a restaurant across from Edinburgh Dungeon, and then proceeded to walk to Edinburgh University's Informatics Forum building on Crichton Road. Firstly, Alistair Elfick and Randy Rettberg gave an introductory presentation about Synthetic Biology and iGEM.
All of the students were put into mixed groups and asked to design and build a remote control buggy which was to collect a package of waste material and navigate a course. Our team member Goksel was on the winning team.
Dinner, a buffet was held at the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The Newcastle students then headed to their accommodation for the night, Pollock Halls, a student hall of residence/summer hotel, to drop off their bags before joining some of the other teams at a pub, All Bar One.
More pictures of the trip taken on Day One can be further below.
Day Two
Mathew and Jess giving Newcastle's presenation on Bac-Man.
The second day in Edinburgh began with breakfast provided by Pollock Hall, this was just a basic English/Scottish breakfast. Morgan went to the instructor's hotel"

TU-Eindhoven,2017,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Team#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," one of our supervisors. He himself hadn’t used it, but knew someone who did, and he needed to use Linux to get it functional. We, having a Windows system, therefore needed to instal a Virtual Box, together with Linux, NFsim and Matlab. This took quite some time and was very frustrating and unrewarding. Especially as we discovered that we could still use Windows by using NFsim somewhat differently. After the installation was successful, we walked through the manual and tried to understand the new language and experimented with example models.
September - Trial and Error
Learning a new language takes some time, but luckily, it was doable in the limited time given by the iGEM deadlines. Of course it took some time to implement the system, but after some trial and error, we ended up with a model that could be simulated with NFsim. However, there were still some problems left, including generating an output in the desired format and having reliable parameters of our system. This led us to dive back into the literature and contact some experts. Both led to success, but then a new problem arose: we only saw a equilibrium state of our system, but no transition form every unbound to a (small) network formation. Different simulation times, steps, rates and so on were tested, but an improvement was not found yet.
October - Enlightening
Units, remember, those are very important!. After doing a unit control, we discovered that we made a small mistake, with large influences on our simulation. So that you know, NFsim works with molecules instead of concentrations. Being used to an ODE solver, we missed the fact that we had to translate the association rate to a molecule dependent value instead of a concentration dependent value. We knew that we were working with molecules instead of concentrations, so we already implemented a volume definition, and together with the number of Avogadro, converted them. After also converting the association rate, the simulation worked much faster. Another insight we gained was that most times, the process is better visualized on a logarithmic time scale. Doing some simulations with different time steps, we could make such a logarithmic time scale plot, and indeed, we saw the transition from the begin state to an equilibrium!  Having the simulation working for our system, we could work on simulating the system of the iGEM team from Potsdam.

ITCCC
In July 13th, we got an invitation to introduce iGEM to preparatory members of high                                 school team                                 in ITCCC (INTERNATIONAL TEENAGER COMPETITION AND COMMUNICATION CENTER). Our team leader gave a                                 speech about iGEM and some of team members answered the questions. After the speech, the high                                 school students had a further understanding and got more interests about iGEM. In which, we                                 brought our years of experiences on iGEM to them.
BCU
Between July 17th and 21st, our team and team BCU conducted an                                 communication of iGEM, mainly                                 about the InterLab experiments. BCU is a young iGEM team. So, as an experienced team, we                                 BIT-China helped them. We provided them with some conveniences on instruments and reagents. In                                 five days, we completed the InterLab experiments, analyzing and discussing them based on the                                 experimental data obtained. This exchange established the foundation for the communication of                                 the two teams in future projects, and we all benefited from this exchange.
Education to younger generation
Back in high school, if someone would show us the beauty of biology, we think there would be                                 more students choose to study biology in college. Therefore, to expand the influence of                                 synthetic biology, we delivered a lecture to high school students of Capital Normal University                                 High School in Beijing, during which we introduced iGEM giant jamboree and our project, WHO CAN                                 GET AN A to them. Through the lecture, not only did high school students gained a better                                 insight into such a meaningful competition, but also we knew more about our own project and                                 started to think a new way to let public understand our project.

Monday Christian made LB-KAN liquid cultures of E. coli containing KZ144 in a pUC57 plasmid (x2).
Tuesday Christian did a miniprep of the two KZ144 E. coli cultures to isolate pUC57 plasmid containing the endolysin. He then ran a PCR to isolate the gene, but the wrong primers were used. A gel was used to analyze the PCR.
Wednesday Christian and Jasmine started making RM media and other buffers. Christian and Jon did a miniprep of GFP, OMPA, and 4 different colonies of OMPA+GFP. They then did a PCR of these genes and ran a gel of the products. Thursday Christian and Jon did a miniprep of the endolysins for Xanthamonus and Erwinia from their original plasmids. Christian and Jon did a PCR purification of Jasmine’s PCR product for her 2 endolysins.
Friday Jon ran an Invitrogen control PCR to trouble shoot some issues which had arisen.  Christian grew liquid cultures LB-AMP of the pBAD TOP10 expression control. He also grew 6 liquid cultures of LB-AMP-CM to make sure the X-pBAD BL21 cells have both AMP and CM resistance.

Researcher Safety
Organisms
All the organisms utilized in the Haynes Lab comply with biosafety level 1 (BSL1) and do not possess the potential to cause disease in individuals. All organisms, despite having no association with disease, are treated as potential pathogens, thus personal protective equipment such as gloves, laboratory coats, and protective eyewear/goggles are used to prevent contact with bacteria and yeast samples in the lab, to prevent splashes, and to avoid sources of ultraviolet radiation.
Standard protocols were followed for all genetic manipulation, including PCR, plasmid assembly (restriction, ligation, and transformation), and DNA extraction. These protocols standardize specific safety procedures encountered in day to day labwork.
The following organisms are present in the lab and directly utilized in our project:
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) [1]
Escherichia coli NEB-10 Beta [2]
Biosafety training
All members of our team were required to attend biosafety and bloodborne pathogen training according to Arizona State policy before working in the lab. This course satisfies the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens training requirement as well as the Biosafety requirements for working with recombinant DNA. The Laboratory-Specific biosafety training checklist was followed [3] to ensure all team members were adequately trained.
Biological Reagents
Reagents and equipment including solid and liquid bacterial growth media, and yeast culture media, micropipette, volumetric pipette tips and centrifuge tubes are autoclave sterilized (heated to 121 degrees celsius at 15 PSI) both preceding and following use, ensuring there is no threat of waste contamination of outside the lab. This is in accordance with Arizona State University's biological waste procedures [4] .
Flammable Reagent Safety
All team members were required to complete fire safety training prior to working in the lab. Reagents that are potentially flammable (e.g. ethanol and isopropyl alcohol) are stored"

Project Description
The Problem
     At its core, synthetic biology is the practice of genetically engineering novel organisms to perform a particular function. However, recent review studies estimate only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible. A 2014 survey conducted by the University of Michigan Biological Software Team confirmed that the repeatability problem exists in synthetic biology, with every scientist surveyed reporting prior struggles with replicating protocols. The majority of these scientists indicate unclear language and missing steps are the greatest contributors to the irreproducibility of synthetic biology protocols. A follow up study was conducted by this year's Software team, resulting in similar conclusions. ProtoCat 2.0 is designed to address both of these issues by making it easier for scientists to share troubleshooting techniques and submit edits to existing protocols.
The Solution
     Every respondent indicated that they would use a database to browse and download protocols, with over 85% indicating that they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed. ProtoCat 2.0 is a free database of crowd sourced protocols designed to make existing protocols more repeatable and enable more accurate computational models of biological systems. We believe this can most efficiently be accomplished with a commitment to open source protocols and a broader more active community of digital troubleshooters. ProtoCat 2.0 works to establish such a community by giving anyone with an internet connection or smartphone access to a repository of synthetic biology protocols collected from all over the world. Additionally, ProtoCat 2.0 encourages the development of higher quality, more repeatable protocols by allowing users to document trails, rate, review, and edit existing methods, and easily locate related protocols.

Streptococcus uberis: Streptococcus uberis is Gram-positive and is the most common Streptococcus species that causes bovine mastitis. S. uberis are commonly found in manure, bedding, and other organic matter. Therefore, it often spreads to uninfected cows through environmental contact. S. uberis can also spread from cow to cow during milking [15].
Parts Origin
Bacteriocins are incredibly diverse and have very specific activity against target species. Below we list some of the species that produce bacteriocins that are known to target the pathogens that cause bovine mastitis. We optimized the gene codons for overexpression in E.coli.
Bacillus subtilis: Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive endospore forming bacteria.  It is able to withstand high temperatures and dry environments, and it is commonly found in soil, air, or plant compost.  When B. subtilis is active, it produces many enzymes.  Research indicates that it can easily be genetically manipulated, and that it can be used as a broad spectrum antibiotic [16].
Klebsiella pneumoniae: Klebsiella pneumoniae are rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria that are ubiquitous in nature. They are known to colonize in gastrointestinal tracts and form large polysaccharide capsules to prevent phagocytosis. They are especially common in farms around New York and are gaining antibiotic resistance. K. pneumoniae and several species are known to be opportunistic pathogens [17, 25].
Lactobacillus salivarius: Lactobacillus salivarius is found in human, porcine, and avian gastrointestinal tracts. L. salivarius is a probiotic species because it exhibits probiotic properties such as the ability to modulate gut microbiota, produce antimicrobial substances (namely, bacteriocins), and stimulate protective immune response, among others [18].
Lactococcus lactis: Lactococcus lactis is informally known as Lactic Acid Bacterium because it ferments lactose to lactic acid. It is Gram-positive and the producer of a few of the bacteriocins we worked with, including Nisin F, Nisin Z, and Nisin A.  This bacteria is found to be associated with plants, mainly grasses, and from there, can be incorporated into milk [19].

Dam methylase
Dam methylase, or DNA adenine methylase,  is from Escherichia coli (strain K12).
It methylates the N6 position of Adenine in the sequence GATC.
Dam methylation has multiple roles within the cell.  The most documented role is in recognising parental DNA in post-replicative mismatch repair, but the methylation state is also known to be a signal that is recognised by other systems of the body, including replication, transcription of certain genes, transposition and segregation of the chromosomes.
In E.coli K12, about 2% of Adenines are methylated by the native Dam methylase.  Dam methylases are present within Dam positive strains at a low concentration of the order of 100 molecules per cell.

Human Practice
For the human practice part, we have four main events. First of all, we did a presentation to introduce iGEM competition and set up an iGEM club in our school. Secondly, we did some questionaries for our project in order to understand some basic opinions around people and whether they would prefer the product we designed. Besides, our team members went to Navy General Hospital to complete an interview with a doctor. It's mainly about the suggetion from those experts and the superiority for our project compare to the current way of detecting the gut inflammation. Last but not the least, one of our team captain also wrote a mini novel about synthetic biology and published on Zhihu (the biggest knowledge network in China).

With these various promoter constructs in hand, a swimming assay was performed. This experiment revealed promoter J23100_TAR_QC in pUC18 background giving the best swimming abilities (data not shown). To generate a chemoreceptor library our method of choice requires the absence of the BsaI restriction site in both, the insert and the vector backbone, of the cloned plasmid. Since pUC18 contains a BsaI restriction site in the plasmid backbone within the selection marker bla gene, this vector is not appropriate for targeted saturation mutagenesis. Thus, the construct was cloned in the BioBrick vector pSB1C3.
The promoter constructs in the new vector backbone were tested in chemotaxis assays for swimming towards L-aspartate (Fig. 10). Thereby, all eight tested promoter constructs were dropped around in the same distance to an octahedron Whatman paper soaked with L-aspartate. As a control serves the strain BL21 transformed with Tar_QC under the control of the eight promoters. ∆Tar was complemented with Tar_QC. As expected, the strongest promoters (18C = K777001, 18K = K777002) show the strongest movement. It was not possible to evaluate 18O (K777004). All in all, the complementation worked, but not to the expected extend.
Further proof came from a SDS-PAGE using where we observed an additional protein band in lysates from cells producing tar from one of three strongest Anderson promoters. The results were consistent with the previous swimming study (data not shown). The construct J23100_TAR_QC gave the best results in these experiments and was therefore used in all further experiments.

We reviewed the results from the restriction enzyme testing experiment conducted last week.
We interpreted electrophoresis gel results
XbaI did not perform well
SpeI appeared to be contaminated
We discovered that although 3.1 buffer is ideal for Pst when doing double digest it is ideal to use Cutsmart or 2.1.
New restriction enzymes are expected this week.
Conducted PCR of three backbones so we would have more stock available (CAM, Kan, Amp).
Mike re did our digest test of restriction enzymes. Ran electrophoresis gel of PCR’s and digests. Q5 didn’t work at all and KOD did not work for Kan.
Mike’s digests worked out.
The changes he used included Smart cut buffer used across all enzymes and digest extended to 90min.
The team re did the digest and re did Kan PCR again. Ran gel again. Digests look great but still no success with Kan PCR. Ed has suggested we try again with a lower temp for annealing as it’s possible our anneal temp was too close to the primer melt temp. He has suggested that the CAM and Amp pcr’s were not very successful either considering the main bands were weak and primer dimer bands strong.
We grew overnight subculture of three colonies from each of three plates- Fer, Hyd1, HydEF. The next day we extracted the plasmid using miniprep (Qiagen) followed by digestion using EcoRI as well.

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," us understand what our team wants to make. Let’s go to the journey to the gene constructions and systems.
Gene Constructions and Systems
The constructions we want to make are explained below. The flame “SITUATION” indicates compounds such as RNAs and proteins that exist in the cell at a specific time are presented and the flame “PRODUCTS” shows products as the result of mRNA expressions. The upper right circles represents the fluorescent color the E. coli is emitting. The 8 genes below are our system to create multiple phenotypes over generations.
So, how these genes go?.
From the beginning, arabinose is added into the culture medium.
Arabinose induces the expression from mRNA of the gene 2. As a result, genes 3,4 are expressed under a positive feedback. Because of this positive feedback, the genes will be expressed stably without arabinose here on. The mRNAs transcribed from gene 3 are translated, while those from gene 4 are not because of the lack of  trigger RNA.
Then, we remove arabinose from the culture.
At this time, despite of the degradation of the expressed factors at gene 2, new factors continue to be expressed from gene 3. Notice the cell is still not dividing at this point.
green sigma factors are made from gene 3, which in turn bind with the green sigma promoter and make more new green sigma factors. In this way, the gene promotes its own expression and this leads to the stable expression.
And what happens when cell division occurs?
Gene 1 expresses and  trigger RNAs are produced when cell division occurs. Then, let’s focus on gene 4. Genes downstream can only be expressed with both the existence of a green sigma factor and the trigger RNA, which seem like an AND gate,a kind of basic digital logic gates.
Now we obtained a trigger RNA and a green sigma factor still remains, so  the gene 4 finally begins to be expressed and red sigma factors are produced. Then the gene expression will change as below.
Under the existence of red sigma factors, genes 5,6 are expressed . Red sigma factors, green anti-sigma factors, blue sigma factors are made. While red sigma factors work on the red sigma promoter, newly-made blue sigma factors do not affect the blue sigma promoter because of its small number against the many blue anti-sigma factors that exist already. On the contrary, the small number of newly-made green anti-sigma factors cannot block the already-existing green sigma factors’ effect on the green sigma promoter completely.
Here is the state after cell division.

We started our liposome fusion experiment, in which we tested if P.pastoris absorbs liposomes enclosed fluorophore. A colleague of our PI, Thomas, showed Benedikt how to work with the fluorescent microscope.
The iGEM Team Stockholm sent us their parts and we designed and ordered primers for their parts.
Week 13 24.09-28.09
We designed suitable primers for our inserts to ligate them into the pSB1C3 vector. Our inserts had some forbidden restriction sites, so we had to mutate them via PCR.
We had the idea to mutate the vector in a way, that we could use it in a Golden Gate assembling.
Finally, our MRE elements worked and we got positive sequencing results for BB1_FS1_p35S-830_MREx4_p35S-90_FS2. We solved this problem by pre-ligating the individual MRE elements and then cloning them into the backbone.
Doris und Theresa repeated the measuring of the ethanol system in P.pastoris, but some of the shake flasks broke on the shaker, so they were not able to finish their experiment.
For the first time, David was able to catch some good photos on the fluorescent microscope of the Liposome fusion experiment.

Sunday, 11 September 2011
Vincent ran another plate-reader experiment, this time for lysis. We tested three different IPTG concentrations: 0 uM, 100 uM, 250 uM, and 500 uM. Two different types of dilution were used: 1:10 and 1:20 (to see how the initial dilution affected the lysis curves). Finally, we checked to see how C2 behaved versus C11 (which does not have the lysis cassette but has T7-const) and versus T7-RFP (as far as induction time is concerned). Results should be appearing shortly.

Lilia prepared minipreps of the 5 muTetRs in Biobrick standart (pSB3K1), they will be send for sequencing. Here is the updated list of available mutants that are being characterized:
Nadine started liquid cultures for tomorrow's platereader experiment. She also made the PCRs for putting TetR mutants into the pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR plasmid by Gibson. We can see the expected band at around 700 bp! Unfortunately, amplification of the pSB3K1 backbone didn't work...
The mutants used were:
BP1col5 (V36FW43S)
BP2col6 (E37AW43SA141
BP3col1 (P39K)
BP4col1 (Y42F)
BP4col6 (Y42FK108E)

Tuesday, 13 September 2011
Nadine re-did the PCR to amplify pSB3K1 backbone, this time using the right template DNA and it worked! She had strange results on the platereader experiment again, but it's because she diluted cells in water instead of LB medium. The experiment will be re-ran a 3rd time!
About the T7 biobricks, the sequencing results show that we already have T7 const (1) and T7 Lac2 030 (12). The other most interesting promoter variants are: T7 030 (3), T7 054 (4), T7 111 (6), T7 lac2 054 (13) and T7 lac2 111 (15).

Innovation in Disruptive Technologies
DNA origami is an example of disruptive technology, where innovation impacts pre existing value networks and generates a new market place. The implications behind the technology are usually broad and leads to accelerated development of varied downstream technologies. For example, the dNANO project is an application of DNA origami that aims to create standardized nano circuits which builds off the work of DNA origami. After speaking to Dr.Ferguson Pell, a biomedical engineer at the University of Alberta, adoption of these new technologies are hampered by the cost and accessibility at the time. Both these factors make early adoption of innovation unfeasible and therefore growth in these areas are likewise slow. For example, the field of synthetic biology has become a recent field exploration due to disruptive innovations in low cost sequencing and nucleotide synthesis making it economically feasible for innovators to innovate.
Our team recognized limitations which made DNA origami difficult to work with such as abberent base pair interactions, a lack of readily accessible resources, a lack of standardized documentation for structure construction and a community that is able to foster exploration with DNA origami. So we aimed to develop an open source repository for DNA origami. Open sourcing is a model in which information is able to be shared amongst a developer community composed of early adopters and enthusiasts, the benefit being knowledge spreading leading to rapid development. We then played around with the idea of sending DNA origami as a biobrick as iGEM has its own infrastructure for open source development. However, after realising the biobrick standard was incompatible with DNA origami, we decided to create our own initiative, the DNA origami library. Our tentative library would serve as a catalogue of entries for DNA origami shapes.
Each entry in the library will then contain the following:
Sequence of the template strand
Sequence of staples
An in silico visualization of the structure
A TEM of the actual structure
A detailed protocol that was utilized in the constructions. Parameters such as oligo concentrations and incubations will be some of the mandatory requirements included in each entry
Any other notes that may assist in reproducibility the structure"

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," people working with yeast made our work a lot easier and taught us much. However, this was not the case for every team working with yeast this year. One of our collaborations was in fact helping the Uppsala team by giving them protocols for working with yeast and also some advice we had received from our lab, since the Uppsala team did not have anyone at their institution who could have helped them.
“ This is why we want to provide an easy and affordable way to detect and degrade microcystins ”
Detection
Background
When studying the toxicity of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin-LR in higher eukaryotic cells, we found out that it causes oxidative stress in them. This is due to inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) which then leads to hyperphosphorylation of target proteins. This excessive phosphorylation in turn increases the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in a oxidative stress response. (Campos and Vasconcelos, 2010) This is presented in the figure 3. Reactive oxygen species have many effects in the cell. For example, catalase production is significantly increased in the presence of ROS. Catalase is an enzyme found in nearly all living organisms that catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. It is one of the most important enzymes in protecting the cell from reactive oxygen species meaning that its production is activated when there is oxidative stress.
Figure 3. Effects of microcystin-LR in eukaryotic cells.
We found out that similar toxicity effects can be observed in some lower eukaryotes, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . (Valério et al., 2014, Valério et al., 2016) Realizing this made us think of how we could use MC-LR's natural toxicity effects to sense the toxin concentrations.
Stress Promoters
Various articles (Estruch, 2000, He et al., 2005) indicated that oxidative stress increases the activity of certain transcription factors in S. cerevisiae cells. Two transcription factors activated by oxidative stress are  Skn7p and Yap1p. These transcription factors have specific binding sites in the promoter areas of genes that respond to oxidative stress. Skn7p binds to OSRE (oxidative stress response element) and Yap1p binds to YRE (Yap1p response element). Some of the best characterized promoter regions that these transcription factors bind to are those for the genes TSA1 (thiore"

Characterizing an existing biobrick
2009 Cambridge brick K274210
The K274210 brick was cultivated from the 2010 kit plate 3 well N6 in the PSB1A2 plasmid and transformed into ‘’E. coli’’ strains TOP10 and MG1655.
Characterization
UV-vis determination of beta-carotene production
In this experiment cells were prepared and harvested according to protocol EX1.1 . This experiment was performed with four different strains of E. coli:
Wild type TOP10
Wild type MG1655
TOP10/pSB1A2-K274210
MG1655/pSB1A2-K274210
TOP10/pSB1A2-K274210/pSB1C3-K343005
MG1655/pSB1A2-K274210/pSB1C3-K343005
K274210 were constitutively expressed.
The measurements were performed on cells both in the exponential and stationary phase. The resulting graphs are presented below:
Figure 1:UV-VIS measurement of beta-carotene concentration in four E. coli strains in Log phase
Figure 2: UV-VIS measurement of beta-carotene concentration in four E. coli strains in Log phase
In order to assess the results, a series of standard dilutions of beta-carotene were made. The concentrations were 1mM, 100 µM, 50 µM, 25 µM, 10 µM, 5 µM, 1 µM, 100 nM and 10 nM. The standard dilutions were also measured on the spectrophotometer. The resulting graphs are presented below:
Figure 3: UV-VIS standard curve of different concentrations of beta-carotene
When combining the graphs of the samples and the standard dilutions, it is clear that the spectra are uniform. This similarity of the spectra"

Fig.ω2 Fixed antibody pattern
If we define a \(θ_2\), which represents the effect that we would like to achieve when                         immobilizing an antibody, it is generally the antibody concentration that can disrupt the                         percentage of gray that the liquid crystal reaches our defined full brightness. At this time,                         there is also a relation (6):
$$[R_T]=C_2exp[Qt]+P\tag{6}$$
When the reaction is sufficient, it is assumed to be \(t_0\). For the relationship between the                         reaction \(\beta\):
$$K_a(1-\theta_2)[R_T]=K_d\theta_2$$
$$\theta_2=\frac{[R_TA']}{[R_{T0}]}$$
Combining relation (4), we can get relation (7):
$$\frac{[R_{T0}]}{A_0}=\alpha+\frac{\beta}{C_1+n}\tag{7}$$
Among them, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) have a large correlation with \(\theta_2\), but have little                         correlation with \(\theta\). From our experimental data, it can be given that \(\theta_2\) meets                         our requirements when it reaches 0.5~0.7. Under the preconditions, relation (8) and Fig. 4 can                         be derived:
$$\frac{[R_{T0}]}{A_0}=K\theta_2+b\tag{8}$$
Fig.4 The relationship between the optimal ratio of antibody                                 antigen concentration and θ2
When we determine the residual antigen concentration and time relationship when fixing the                         antigen and the residual antibody concentration and time relationship when immobilizing the                         antibody, we can use this model to give the optimal concentration ratio for immobilized antigen                         and antibody by combining the given \(\theta\) and \(\theta_2\).
At the same time, it can be concluded that the proportional relationship is closely related to                         our expected \(\theta_2\), and there is no clear relationship with our expected \(\theta\).

Protein Structure Prediction
Why do we need to predict the tertiary structure of proteins? - MOTIVATION
Proteins consist of amino acid chains that fold in 3-dimensional space in ways we do not yet completely comprehend. Each protein chain spans from a handful of amino acids to more than a thousand residues, rendering the problem of determining the relationship between primary and tertiary structure immensely complex .
In our project, we employed a mutated fimH modifiedby adding the RPMrel peptide in order to achieve selective adhesion of our E. coli strains on cancer cells. In particular, we the fimH sequence was altered by substituting 1 (Proline to Glutamine) and inserting 28 new residues (RPMrel, SpyTag, HisTag). We would like to explore how these changes affect the 3-dimensional structure of the fimH protein.
To this end, we embarked on a journey to create an artificial neural network model that, given a protein's primary structure, can yield sufficient information to reconstruct the full 3-dimensional structure.
The idea is that our model can provide insight as to how the tertiary structure changes after the modifications, in that we can compare the native structure of the protein with the structure of the protein's modified sequence.
Moreover, such a model would be invaluable as it could predict structures de novo for proteins for which we do not yet have structural information. Such a protein is Apoptin, the toxin we used as our classifier's output in order to induce selective cell death.
Therefore, our motivation is 2-fold:
to study how a protein's structure changes after altering its primary sequence profile (in our case FimH)
to predict the de novo tertiary protein structures based solely on primary structure information (in our case Apoptin)
What we propose is an end-to-end pipeline that solely requires the amino acid sequence of the protein (primary structure) as input, predicts its corresponding secondary structure & contact map and finally recreates and visualizes the full 3-dimensional tertiary structure.
From Amino acids to 0s and 1s - ENCODING PROTEINS
In order to unravel the protein sequence-to-structure mystery one inevitably needs to summon the power of neural networks due to the aforementioned complexity and data volume. To fully exploit the general"
BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#KyleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the comb that molds the wells when the gel is made as well as too little buffer.  Also, the RFP+Term only has one band that is slightly higher than its uncut form.  This band is also around 3kbp which indicates that it is not the ligated part that we had hoped for as the part should be around 4-5kbp in length if the backbone had been cut.
7/6:  This morning I checked the re-transformed plates from 7/3 using the same samples and same plates.   The negative control (T10 cells only on KAN plates) grew culture and all of the plates looked the same.  It seems that the plates simply did not contain the antibiotic as all of the growth of bacteria was on the surface.  Thus we have to make new KAN plates.  In the meantime, I used LB plates and spread a 1% Kanamycin solution on them before using them for my transformations.  I used the same samples from 7/3, however I just used the 6:1 ratio samples.
7/7:  Our ligation/transformation troubles continued as none of our reactions from 7/6 grew anything.  The negative control looked fine and the cells seemed good (still growing on just plain LB).  Thus we are almost certain this is a ligation problem and are going to look into buying a new ligation mixture, a strong and quicker one, that will hopefully solve these problems.  While we are waiting for the new ligation enzymes, we are going to stock up on plasmids that we have used up or will need. I made plasmid preps with RFP, GFP, and Terminator.
Today was also our Joint BU/Wellesley iGEM meeting.  Each team (BU Comp, BU Wet, and Wellesley Comp) gave updates on their work so far.  We also discussed further collaboration between the teams as well as possible community outreach opportunities.
7/8:  Today there is not a whole lot to do.  I started off doing mini preps of the plasmid preps from yesterday.  Because we had 24 samples, we did half in the QIAcube and half by hand.  Also, I wanted to see if there was any difference in the concentration of the plasmid samples from the QIAcube or by hand, so I made two tubes from the same sample.  Some values had a significant difference (20 ng/ul difference) while others were pretty close (0.1 ng/ul difference"
DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," an, for the experiment conducted, appropriate buffer to minimize the above mentioned risks.
Even though venom diluted in a solution is less dangerous we still work at concentration potentially harmful to humans. Hence, experiments with venom took place in fume hoods wearing gloves and no sharp objects were used. All solutions containing snake venom was disposed off in sealed containers and afterwards sent to destruction in the same way as solid biohazard waste.
Biosafety
In order to further minimize the risk of working with GMO choice of host microorganism is an important aspect. Luckily, many laboratory strains are available and the well characterized Escherichia coli K12 DH5-alpha was chosen [3].
It has undergone several mutations that weakens its ability to compete for habitats with wild types. To mention a few important mutations, it is less efficient to adhere to the human intestine, its natural habitat, so it cannot colonize the tissue should you by accident swallow it. The strain is no longer able to transfer genes to other cells by conjugation. This is especially important as antibiotic resistant genes are often used for screening. Lastly, the strain has vital gene deletions that makes them deficient unless they are grown at media supplemented with the missing factors [4].
The project also entails work with human blood. This poses not just safety considerations for us as an iGEM team but also for the potential consumers of our detection device. Here it is important to minimize the risk of getting uncontrolled bursts of human blood due to malfunction or faulty design. Therefore, the device will operate under vacuum instead of pressure so there is less chance of the device coming apart and expose the operator to the patient's blood. In order to get human blood from a reliable source we got samples from a department at DTU that frequently works with blood and have the appropriate safety precautions in place.

The Best Design Platform
The needs in Designing a Circuits were considered seriously to achieve the best user experience. Simple interaction logic, beautiful UI.
The tree of words
Simply by clicking the words, you will see the subordinated words. After few repeats, you will finally get the projects that you want. This function is designed to help specify your need, to help you construct your idea better.
Interaction Analysis
This function is implanted in the design platform which will tell you the potential parts interacting with the chosen one. Use your imagination, ponder how to utilize these interactions.
Simulation
Even though it’s difficult to develop a model that fits in all the circuits, it worths a shot. Our modeler developed a general model to allow users to simulate any circuits.
WHY S-Din?
Background
Biosciences research is now facing an increasingly severe problem that most works were ignored and not evaluated properly. Numbers of research articles are published every year. How to utilize previous works to aid the current problem should be considered by everyone.
Image source: http://blogs.nature.com/news/2014/05/global-scientific-output-doubles-every-nine-years.html
This year, SYSU-Software is trying to ameliorate this situation in Synthetic Biology, exploring treasures buried in the ocean of projects.
To make a full use of our predecessors' geniuses and efforts in Synthetic Biology. We concluded two problems.
How to find the project you need much faster and more accurately?
How to integrate parts of the project you found into your own work?
Following the standardization in Synthetic Biology, we standardized all aspects of previous projects, no matter they were from published articles or iGEM projects, into a New data format to provide you a clearer, better view when using our search engine.
Network analysis: designed to uncover potential connections between projects, helping users to locate exactly what they need.
Customization:The most exciting part of S-Din is that searching and designing are seamless. Once you find a project that might be useful, you can start editing in design platform immediately. Or you can just simply create your own from scratch.
Extensible: To ensure the database can be updated, new information can be added manually or ‘Spider’(Web crawler).
Inspiration
iGEMers have been complaining that tackling obstacles in a project is doable, but deciding what to do is exasperating. Catching your muse is like grabbing swirling smoke.
We extend S-Din further, not only satisfying the need of starting a project but also guiding you to a clearer path"

It is said that in China, the Criminal Law and the Law of Criminal Procedure Law aim to embody the humanitarian. Deaf and mute are given appropriate preferential treatment and Summary Proceeding cannot be applied in these cases:
Cases of crime by deaf-mutes can be dealt with leniently.
A deaf and dumb or blind criminal is expected to receive a lighter or mitigated punishment or even be exempted from punishment as the case may be.
A deaf and dumb should be provided for with people familiar deaf and dumb gestures;
A deaf and dumb with no defender should be provided with legal aid;
Forcing disabled people to beg constitutes a crime;
Utilizing and abetting the crime of persons with disabilities should be cracked down according to law, etc.
Advanced Technology
The most efficient way to improve hearing so far is using hearing auxiliary equipment. There are two main types of hearing auxiliary equipment: hearing aids and cochlear implants.
Hearing aids: for conductive hearing loss;
Cochlear implants (CI): for sensorineural hearing loss.
We consulted Prof. Chen Fei who studies hearing aids and speech recognition technology for cochlear implants. He stressed the importance of attention to hearing-impaired people, because this big problem has not been concerned enough as it deserved.
Beyond hearing loss, pathologically caused hearing loss may also cause complications. The lowered hearing nerve activity for long is potential to cause inactivation of these neurons and lead to impermanent hearing loss. More significantly, due to communication difficulties or discrimination, hearing loss may cause psychological problems.
CI, together with hearing aids, bring sound to those who have never heard anything. However, the cost of a CIs is higher than 10,000 dollars and requires high medical operation expenses. There are only 20,000 people can enjoy the ease brought by CI due to the high price. As a result, we need people to focus on this issue. We hope people can devote to take part in research, charity or simple spread this idea, to make more people able to enjoy the sound.
At the same time, he believes that though hearing aids and CIs are the most direct and efficient way currently, they cannot solve the problem of hearing loss thoroughly. Protect our ears to prevent more hearing impairment cases, together with elaborate studies on hearing using biological methods, tend to be the profound and lasting resolution. He mentioned that our project idea is good to solve the root of the problem.

Conclusion [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Even if we could not give the proof by our own experiments, many studies show that to bring a wild-type version of a tumor suppressor gene into a mutated tumor cell for this gene permits to launch the apoptosis. In vivo studies on Human in the framework of the prostate, ovary and lung cancers have already been hold and present convincing results.
The implementation of this study has been originally done to determine if the DVS , application in the fight against non small cell lung cancer, is feasible or not. Because we have not been able to conclude, the implementation of the study has been done by analyzing several publications. According to these publications, the application is first confirmed in the framework of the chosen pathology but it can also be reached to others cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma, on which the fact to bring a gene suppressor of tumor launch the apoptosis process. The only limitation is set by the tissue vector tropism.

We helped the 2010 Bielefeld team with characterizing their brick K389016. It is a VirA/G receptor system with an mRFP reporter gene. Our task was to replicate their experiment which showed that acetosyringone induced the promoter and thereby increased expression of mRFP.
We recieved a miniprep with K389016 in pSB1C3 together with a list of experiments and characterization assays the Bielefeld team would like us to carry out.
We transformed the plasmids into E. coli strain MG1655 and ran a colony-PCR of four different colonies the following day. Over night cultures of the colonies was made and used for fluorescence measurements. The picture shows that cells in all four colonies contained K389016 in pSB1C3.
Characterization

The OD550 nm was measured every two hours for a 10 hour period.
The characterisation experiment was carried out according to protocol ( CK1.1 ). The chosen transformant were grown overnight in LB-media and on the following day boosted and grown with the different acetosyringone concentrations: 0uM, 100uM, 200uM and 400uM. The culture without acetosyringone was used as a control. The cultures were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius until the cells reached stationary phase. A growth assay"

The red color in the final step warns us that time’s up and the product lose freshness. A key feature of the bio-timer is that make the longer timing function up to 5~8 hrs. And for the environment safety, we design a suicide system so that the E. coli would kill itself after finishing their function.
Fig. 1 The bacterial referee system works as an OR gate that can integrate temporal and environmental signals. The inputs of the modular genetic OR gate are the concentration of lactose and acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). The chemicals represent the signals from timer and counter functions . The output (RFP) of the OR gate is ON when one of the input signals is ON. Therefore, the media turn from green color to yellow color (mixed color of green and red light), yellow color to red color step by step.
We designed a modular genetic OR gate whose inputs are the lactose and acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) to integrate the signals from timer and counter functions (Figure 1). The output (RFP) of the OR gate is ON when one of the input signals is ON. Besides, a memory system that is developed by KULeuven is applied in our referee system to memory that the inducer (lactose) has been added or not. The memory system maintains media colorless until the lactose is added.

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt with(out) ssDNAp
The dAuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations and the influence of ssDNAp is determined. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution and 20 µL NaCl solutions (250, 500 and 1000 mM respectively) were added in the 96 wells plate. To test the influence of the ssDNAp concentration on d-AuNPs stabilization, different amounts of 0 to 10 µL ssDNAp 1 was added in subsequent wells. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
With a higher ssDNAp concentration, the d-AuNPs are being stabilized. The color change to purple, which indicates destabilization, occurs at a higher salt concentration.

Tokyo_Tech,2010,Team:Tokyo Tech#Project#wolf coli#System_-_-_TEXT.html," OmpR is inhibited. Since unphosphorylated OmpR doesn’t bind to OmpC promoter, there would be only basal expression level of OmpC promoter.  In this condition LacIM1 and cI are expressed at basal levels. This enables the expression of a wild-type LacI and again results in repression of the inverter. Thus again Artificial Cooperation System turns on, and two types of cell would save each other from dying while communicating with each other.
Figure 4-3-2.Wolfcoli system at crescent moon night
At daytime  (Strong light intensity) (Fig. 4-3-3)
Light drives the sensor to a state in which phosphorylation of OmpR is inhibited. There is no expression from OmpC promoter because unphosphorylated OmpR doesn’t bind to OmpC promoter. In low ratio of phosphorylated OmpR, LacIM1 and cI are expressed only at basal levels. This enables the expression of a wild-type LacI, again resulting in repression of the inverter. Thus again Artificial Cooperation System turns on, and two types of cell would save each other from dying while communicating with each other.
Figure 4-3-3.Wolfcoli system at daytime
At full moon night  (Medium light intensity) (Fig. 4-3-4)
Medium level of phosphorylated OmpR ratio results in moderate levels of cI and LacIM1. However, because the repression efficiency of cI is significantly higher than that of LacIM1, cI effectively shuts off LacI expression while the LacIM1 concentration is below the threshold required to repress the inverter. This difference between the cI and LacIM1 repression efficiencies drives the inverter to a state of turning on.  This results in turning off the Artificial Cooperation System. Thus, the two types of cell would not rescue each other in crisis situation since they can’t communicate. Due to these behaviors, we called the designed E.coli“Wolfcoli”.

The other laccase we took from Pleurotus ostreatus NRRL0366. We chose it because its protein has a good potential degrading phenolic compounds, like estrogens; its best activity is degrading 17α-ethinylestradiol, a synthetic hormone.
Why E. coli ?
Escherichia coli is a model organism, well-studied and widely used as a chassis. Its metabolism is already well known and the parameters to control it’s growing are also dated. The growing kinetics of E. coli is also a positive point, since it is fast, is also aligned to one of our purposes for the project, which is a scale-up production of laccase enzymes.
For cloning we selected the E. coli DH5-α strain, that is engineered to optimize the transformation. For the expression of our enzymes we chose E. coli BL21 cells, that are engineered to optimized and handle the expression of a protein of interest.

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.
Xiaohan HU
More detail please!
Xiaohan is a junior majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics at UCAS.
Taking apart in iGEM and working with so many outstanding teammates were some interesting attempts for her. At least she knows how to keep calm now.
She was responsible for the artistic design of the project.
She has a bunch of seemingly unrelated hobbies in her daily life, such as debating, painting and literature. What she wants to do further is to make all these hobbies be related.

Tianjin,2014,Team:Tianjin#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," of researchers. Do  experiments without wearing gloves or lab coats, pile up clutter at random in  the laboratory, or eat pineapples in the laboratory during experimental  clearances. Now ask yourself, have these phenomenon happened to you or around  you on earth before?
preventive measures 
——How to avoid the occurrence of laboratory  accidents?
Laboratory safety issues can not be ignored.  Tianjin University started the “Lab-Safety Month of Tianjin  University”under the advocation of our IGEM team since 2013. A number of activities  were held to enhance students’ safety awareness. Here, we launched the  initiative that everyone pay more attention to laboratory safety, starting from  things around us and from ourselves.
Safety Tips:
1. Always wear  appropriate personal protective equipment. Feet and legs should be covered;  sandals and open-toed shoes should not be worn in laboratories. Wear  appropriate gloves while handling infectious or toxic materials and animals. Do  not wear lab coats, gloves or other personal protective equipment outside the  laboratory. Change gloves when contaminated, and dispose of used gloves with  other contaminated laboratory waste.
2. Do not eat, drink,  smoke, handle contact lenses, apply cosmetics, or store food for human  consumption in the laboratory.
3. Wash your hands  after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the  laboratory.
4. Follow the  institutional policies regarding safe handling of sharps (i.e., needles,  scalpels, pipettes, and broken glassware). Be careful with needles and  syringes. Use only when alternative methods are not feasible. Syringes,  needles, Pasteur pipettes, etc, should be placed in rigid, leak-proof  containers (Sharps Safe) and discarded following the waste rules.
5. Take care to  minimize the creation of aerosols and/or splashes.
6.Decontaminate  all work surfaces before and after your experiments, and immediately after any  spill or splash of potentially infectious material with an appropriate  disinfectant. Clean laboratory equipment routinely, even if it is not  contaminated.
7. Decontaminate  all potentially infectious materials before disposal.
8. Report any  incidents that may result in exposure to infectious materials to appropriate  personnel (e.g., laboratory supervisor, safety officer).
9. Know where the  nearest eyewash, safety shower, and fire extinguisher are located. Know how to  use them.
10. Insist upon  good housekeeping in your laboratory.
11. Check for  insects and rodents. Keep all areas clean.

Conclusion
This study was a valuable experience for the team . It gave us valuable experience about fundemental lab techniques, teaching others, and problem solving issues.
During our collaboration with Saint Joseph, out team had to prepare the laboratory for people who were unexperienced in laboratory. Thus all reagents were pre-prepared the night before, the glassware autoclaved etc.
Also a safety lesson were given to them. During the lecture we were able to apply what we have learned from our own safety lecture. Problems encountered during the experiments had to be solved primarily by the team and that gave us an invaluable experience about problem solving skills.
The results came out as expected. We were able to see the linear relationship between florescein and concentration. However most probably due to pipetting errors during the silica microbeads protocol, the standard curve had slight waves."

Introduction

Introducton
Synthetic biology is a relatively new field just recently receiving more and more attention here in Lithuania. For example, in Vilnius University the synthetic biology courses only start in Master degree studies. For that reason, undergraduate students rarely know anything about the basics of Synthetic Biology.
This year we have started to build the Synthetic Biology community here in Lithuania by revamping Synthetic Biology Organisation by setting its direction and goals, starting a synthetic biology education cycle in university and giving popular lectures to students in Life Science Center.
However, we wanted to make the education process more engaging and innovative - as it is not always easy to grab the attention of the youngest students. That is why, for some time, we have actively searched for ways we can engage students in a more fun and attractive way.
Educational tool - Synthetic Biology Comic Book!
That is why we were extremely surprised and happy to receive a collaboration proposal from OUC-China . They have created a 28-page comic book about the principles of Synthetic Biology. The content was explaining in a fun and engaging manner with the help of colourful illustrations. It was called “Spaceship E. Coli”.
Therefore, we have accepted their collaboration proposal right away and translated their comic book into our native Lithuanian language. Also, we have adapted it to be most suitable for the young students here in Lithuania. After translating the book we have created a shareable PDF file. We have then distributed this comic book on various websites and social networks to the Lithuanian students and the general public that, we hope, after reading the comic book have developed an interest in synthetic biology.
As the online sharing was a huge success, together with OUC-China iGEM team we have decided to take our collaboration one step further and a physical version of the Lithuanian “Spaceship E.Coli” comic book. We have hoped"

My name is Rocky. I’m a student, I’m a high school student. I’m an iGEMer who fulfills people’s fantasies, their deep dark fantasies. I was studying macroscopic biology, you know, paleontology and zoology. But after seeing how significant molecular biology is, I thought I had enough, so I stepped into the bio-lab.
I was kind of a dumb boy of my life, tying myself aside my desk and creating fantasies. But now I’m doing that in the lab.
Role in team:
Doing experiment with E. coli and S. cerevisiae. More specifically, participating in plasmid construction, promoter characterization and fermentation.
Trying my best to be a social-butterfly in HP.
Planning, directing and fulfilling the ‘HP Documentary’.
Motivating my teammates.

The enzyme LacZ, bFMO and gusA can react with X-gal, tryptophan and Rose-gluc, respectively. The products of these enzymes can form insoluble precipitates and color the plates. We also used enzymes to test our system under a more complexed situation, to prove our concepts.
Figure 4. The compositions of four plasmids we constructed.
Six plasmids composed the whole system, pJFR1 (BBa_K2598049), pJFR2 (BBa_K2598050), pJFR3(BBa_K2598051), pJFR4(BBa_K2598053), pJFR5(BBa_K2598052) and pJFR6(BBa_K2598061). The ‘sensor array’ module and the core fragment was integrated into pJFR1. The ‘circuits’ and ‘resource allocator’ were integrated into pJFR2 and pJFR3. And the ‘actuators’ containing fluorescence proteins, chormoproteins and enzymes were integrated into pJFR4, pJFR5 and pJFR6, respectively. We transformed four plasmids into our E.coli and finished our artwork.(For more information, see PARTS ）.
The concept: Mixing colors in bacteria cells
Although more and more fluorescent proteins and chromoproteins are edited to generate more and more colors, the number of colors produced by organisms is still limited by the number of the kinds of proteins. Once a new color is needed, researchers have to modify the chromophores of the proteins, which takes much time and effort.
So how do we create more colors, to make our rose more colorful in a reasonable and convenient way? Here, we put forward a new concept—mixing color in bacterial cells! Unlike the mix of different bacterial cells which produce different colors as the previous iGEM teams have done[5], we used tandem expression and RGB system to control the ratios of the expression of different colors in bacterial cells, to achieve mixing color in bacterial cells, and stain our roses with more bright colors.
Primary proof of our concept: the tandem expression
To prove our concept, we firstly use the tandem expression of chromoproteins. By putting two chromoprotein RBSs and genes under one promoter, we constructed six plasmids(BBa_K2598043, BBa_K259"

FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," used by Tomizaki et al. (2012) to produce ZnO nanofibers. A 0.1 M zinc nitrate solution was mixed with the same volume of 0.2 M KOH. The produced Zn(OH)2 was sonicated and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded and the sediment was resuspended with distilled water of the same volume. Using the 0.1 M Zn(OH)2 stock solution, solutions with a concentration of 0.02 M and 0.05 M were prepared. Solutions of 0.1 M, 0.05 M and 0.02 M were added to the freshly prepared biofilms (for preparation description, see the biological part). After three days, the biofilms were separated from the solution, washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature.

Introductory courses
Since we came from a special college for teachers, we wanted our goals for the event to inspire more people to get involved in science. The head of the program emphasized that we should try to get students interested in the field of molecular biology and participating in research in college. Every summer, Beijing normal university hosts an education campaign for bachelors of all major to learn iGEM and do basic biological experiments, in order to arise their curiosity of synthetic biology and life science. The BNU-China iGEM teams always collaborate with the School of Education in the past to do teaching activities with students, so we launched a series of introductory course for new students, and invited them to visit our lab.
The courses include 4-week training of basic theory, two molecular biology experiments, and a mini-iGEM meeting. To guarantee the quality of these courses, we chose four of our best teammates and rehearsed privately for several times. Moreover, we made thorough plans and got the full rights from both college leaders and former iGEMers, each of whom assigned a team of freshers matched according to students’ speciality. The mentors monitored the study pace of each student by weekly meetings and students responded to learn the required materials. The courses were liked by most of apprentices. More importantly, we had a real bonus that we met two excellent students with both talent and enthusiasm, and they were absorbed in our iGEM team to make greater contribution.

The problem of degradation always lies in industrial production, whereas the abuse of antibiotics has lead to the emerge of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. It's the researchers' responsibility to deal with this safety issues raised by                     the interaction between the application and the human society. Our iGEM project aims at the application of self-screening advantageous mutant selection, which can provide a growth dominance to the strains with beneficial mutation.                    "

Gel results:
B7 - both screened colonies were negative (~3200bp of vector and ~3200bp of insert).
B8 - only B8-5 SEEMED to show the expected length for ligated plasmid (~3200bp of vector and ~4200bp of insert), but it also shows a single unexpected band...All the other 4 samples were negative (~3200bp of vector and ~3200bp of insert).
A14-3 - showed the expected length for ligated plasmid (2079bp of vector and ~2200bp of insert).
A16-4 - showed the expected length for ligated plasmid (2079bp of vector and ~1700bp of insert).
I714891 - showed the expected length for ligated plasmid (~2700bp of vector and ~700bp of insert).
Comments: it seems that we have the final constitutively expressed ethanol producing operon (B8 = RBS-tetR-TT-Ptet-RBS-adhB-RBS-pdc-TT in pSB1AK3). Anyway, an unexpected band is present in this part and in its ancestor (i.e. B6). So, we decided to follow three ways:
sequence B8-5 and see if it is correct;
repeat the last two assemblies of the missing version of the ethanol producing operon: B5=B1+B4 and B7=A4+B5;
try to purify the expected bands from the gel through gel extraction.
