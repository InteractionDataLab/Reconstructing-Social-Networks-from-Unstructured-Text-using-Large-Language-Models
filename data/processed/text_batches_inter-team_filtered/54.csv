Colour Generators
The Kit of Parts
The Cambridge 2009 iGEM team searched far and wide to find suitable pigments that could be used as outputs.  Though E. coli does not naturally produce any pigment, several other bacterial species secrete pigmented antibiotics. We mined bacterial genomes for pigment-producing operons, and transformed the most prominent candidates into E. coli. In particular, we have devoted our summer to 3 different pigment systems:
Carotenoids : The enzymes required for carotenoid production originally come from Pantoea ananatis, and were available in the registry.  We used them to produce orange and red.
Melanin : The tyrosinase required for melanin production originally comes from Rhizobium etli and produces brown.
Violacein :  The enzymes required for voilacein production originally come from Chromobacterium violacein. The operon can be manipulated to produce voilet, green, and blue.
As as a result of our efforts, this summer, we have submitted the following biobricks to the Registry.  We hope that in the future this this kit of parts will be expanded in the future.

Choosing Pigments
We chose to pursue these 3 pigment systems for two main reasons. Visual Diversity: Not only do these devices come from different bacterial species, but between these systems we've almost made -- as cheesey as it sounds -- all the colours of the rainbow.
Design: We were able to use a variety of different techniques to build and design these pigment systems as biobricks. The carotenoid parts were already in the Registry, and were used standard assembly protocols to build pigment producing devices. The melanin system is a single gene which we endeavoured to turn into a biob"

WHAT S GOING ON?
Termites are widely recognized as the fifth pest around the world, based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards woods and infrastructure. There are termites all over the five continents. According to the experimental results of computer simulation, average per person holds 0.5 tons of termite resources. Given that a termite weighed 1 gram, then everyone around the world should own about 500 thousand termites! This is really a staggering number and it is the fact.
Wide Geographical Distribution
World Distribution
Termite is an ancient social insect in the world for about 0.13 billion years. They are now filling nearly every corner of the globe, from tropical regions to subtropical ones, which occupies 50% of the earth s area.
Fig1: The orange part shows world distribution of termites
China Distribution
Account for the effect of warm wet air current from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, many provinces with warm climate, plentiful water and abundant vegetation own special preferences for termites.

As we see, these modules are successive. After the logic module, we added a production module, which is responsible for the production of our outputs (GFP and an Homoserine Lactone that depends on the type of cell modeled). As one of our output is a messenger molecule, it has an influence on the quorum sensing module, which detects those molecules. Therefore, we have a feedback loop. This feedback loop comes from our choice to put only two different strains in our grid.
Decomposition of our system in different modules and submodules. The inputs are AHL and PAI2 and our output is AHL and GFP going out from the Production module.

Week 3: Plasmid design started, Modeling started
Wednesday, June 11th
We started plasmid design :
First draft of plasmids. The sensor plasmid is the same in every cell. Different logic + repressors plasmids are present in cells p and q. The logic + repressors plasmid from cells p is producing the quorum sensing molecule p, and another version is present in cells q which produces QSq. Colonies of p and q cells will be arranged in an alternate way on the millifluidic chip. Here as an example we use the lux system for p cells and the rhl system for q cells.
ΦC31 and Bxb1 are integrases. LuxR an RhlR are quorum sensing repressors. A riboswitch construct is placed around quorum sensing constructs to prevent leakiness of lux and rhl promoters. Type p colonies produce AHL by expressing the enzyme LuxI. Type q colonies produce Rhl by expressing the enzyme RhlI. In fact, we don't know yet which quorum sensing systems we will use. We will have to perform cross-talk experimetns in order to choose the ones that are the most orthogonal.
We tried to print our first agar millifluidic chip : we printed it too small, and the printer had resolution problems.
We wrote all reactions and found parameters from the literature for our model.

Columbia-Cooper-NYC,2012,Team:Columbia-Cooper-NYC#Columbia notebook 1_-_-_TEXT.html," supernatant solution was pipetted out of the tube and disposed, leaving behind a white pellet of cells. The AFM solution in the cuvette prepared earlier was then pipetted into the tube and the solution was mixed within the container to ensure homogeneity in the solution. The liquid was then transferred back into the cuvette, where we made sure no large droplets were present on the sides of the cuvette and no bubbles were in solution before we placed it back in the spectrophotometer to record the OD. The solution in the cuvette and the cuvette itself were then discarded. Three trials were run for each sample of solution containing AFM (with and without bacteria). The precipitate mentioned earlier may have affected the OD readings of the solutions samples.
July 8
Liquid Media:
The solutions in the AFM flasks were a dark, cloudy yellow color. The precipitate was a brownish-yellow color. The copper piece in the acid solution had become a dull dark pinkish color. The mass of the copper pieces in all the flasks with liquid media were taken, using the same procedure from the previous day. The ODs of the solutions were also taken using the same procedure as before.
Solid Media:
The solid media sample #2 (containing bacteria), sample #4 (without bacteria), and scratched samples were removed from the incubator; the latter was removed just for picture taking and was placed back in the incubator shortly after. The gel in the petri dishes were stained ochre. The copper pieces were covered in green and surrounded by brown. The green layer and gel was washed away with water and 70% ethanol to reveal the un-etched copper pieces underneath. The copper pieces were then weighed and the masses recorded.  Note that the the thickness of the media in the petri dishes were about  0.16 cm. The ODs of the solid media samples could not be taken. We are discussing the possibility of doing controls with different amounts of bacteria in solid media. Data does not seem to make sense since the average percent loss from the sample w/o bacteria is greater than the one with bacteria.
July 9
Liquid Media:
The solutions in the AFM flasks still retain a dark and cloudy yellow color. There are powdery precipitates on the bottom of each flask. The mass of the copper pieces in all the flasks with liquid media were taken, using the same procedure from the previous days. The ODs of the solutions were also taken using the same procedure as before. Over a period of 3 days, each of the 6 AF"

Future Directions
Now that we have established a proof of concept with sfGFP, you can imagine how we can swap sfGFP with other functional domains to spin out synthetic fibers that exhibit an array of functionality! In order to verify this BioBrick as a screening platform to assay for functional peptide affinity, a wide variety of co-spinning modules must be constructed.  Namely, co-spinning modules digested and ligated with albumin-binding domain (ABD), immunoglobin G binding domain (ImGBD) and avidin binding domains (AvBD) may be of critical use in both experimental design and developing a functional application of co-spinning in a wide variety of biomedical applications.

Current landmine detection methods
Using ELECTRACE to detect landmines
Ethical considerations
Global problem: Landmines
Landmines and unexploded remnants of war represent a major problem, since several countries are heavily contaminated. In 1996, more than 15,000 people were killed or maimed by landmines[1], mostly in developing countries [2]. A more recent study, from 2012, indicates a total number of 3628 mine/ERW (explosive remnants of war) casualties. Although the number has decreased, this still represents an alarming number of over ten casualties per day. Yet, the real number of casualties is likely to be significantly higher, because in many areas, a lot of casualties go unrecorded [4].
Due to the nature of the modern conflicts, the number of civilian casualties caused by mines has heavily increased. As a comparison, during World War I, 15% of all fatalities were civilians, and this number increased to 65% in the World War II, including the Holocaust. Nowadays, more than 78% of the people that are injured in hostilities are civilians [1]. One of the main reasons for the increase in civilian casualties is the use of landmines. A substantial amount (47%) of the landmine casualties in 2012 were children [4]. Currently, all over the world there are over ten countries with very heavy contamination (>100km2), including: Croatia, Colombia, Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Thailand [3]. More than 350 models of landmines are currently available, not only to official armies, but to all fighting groups.
Landmines do not differentiate between the foot of a combatant from that of a playing child. They are “weapon of mass destruction in slow motion” that go beyond any peace agreements. Mines placed during a conflict can still kill or injure civilians decades later. Next to that, after a conflict, areas remain contaminated with explosive remnants of war (ERW). These are explosive weapons that somehow failed to detonate and are left behind. They pose dangers similar to landmines.  An example of the impact of old landmines and ERW is Vietnam. Although the Vietnam War is already over for decades, Vietnam is still suffering from the large-scale use of landmin"

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Killing_-_-_TEXT.html," the colicin to hurt the producing bacteria is very low. A bigger problem could be that many bacteriocins are short lived in certain conditions and might denature or break before they are characterized.
Inhibition test
To be able to prove that our system is working we needed to test it on the actual Y. enterocolitica. Since Y. enterocolitica is a class two bacteria we had to do it in another lab. We managed to get in contact with Livsmedelsverket (the Swedish authority of food safety) and they allowed us to test our colicin Fy in one of their labs on one of their pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica.
To examine the inhibition of colicin Fy an overnight culture of bacteriocin producing bacteria in 200ml LB with no antibiotic was prepared. As negative control, DH5-alpha was grown under the same conditions. No antibiotic was added to ensure that the antibiotics would not affect the results. The cells were then lysed and the supernatant was collected according to protocol . The supernatant was added to a final concentration of 1%(v/v) in LB with 10^4 CFU/ml Y. enterocolitica added. The culture was put to grow in 37d C with 100rpm shaking. OD measurements were taken every hour,  but due to Y. enterocolitica ability to aggregate the results were inconclusive. Instead 100microL was plated on BHI agar plates after 0h, 2h, 4h and 24h. Immediately growth difference could be spotted and after 4 hours the results were very clear, fig. 4.  More figures of the plating can be found in the appendix.
Figure 4: Tests to compare colicin Fy lysate on the right plate compared to the N/C on the left. Both plates are diluted to the same concentration and grown for the same amount of time. For more figures, see ""Read more""

On all of the following nine pictures the plate to the right is the negative control while the bacterias with colicin Fy added is to the left. The first three pictures shows 3 different dilutions, all done at time zero. They are in the order, not diluted, diluted 10 times and diluted 100 times. The three pictures after that are diluted in the order of 10, 100 and lastly 1000 times , they are all plated after 2 hours. The last 3 plates are also diluted,"

This fig. shows the expression of thermal regulators under 30 33 36 39 42 45 degree Celsius,we can see the leakage is low, unlike what we have seen on the petri dishes.
We verified that Thermal Regulators can turn from on to off. Most of the user was using turn on, but seldom people try to turn it off. We cultivated TlpA36 from high 37 degree Celsius to 30 degree Celsius, and measure it on plate reader
This fig indicated that the expression stop as soon as it is being transformed from 37 degree to 30 degree, we concluded that the remaining fluorescent was from the undegraded GFP.
Invert the signal by sRNA
We performed the thermal regulation characterization by co-transform our sensor plasmid (TlpA36-pTlpA-sRNA) and reporter plasmid(pTac-RiboJ-J61101-mNeonGreen). Then, they were incubated in 37°C and 30°C, for 20 hours. First, we performed a qualitative assay, by comparing the brightness of the broth.
The result showed no significanlty reduce in eexpression, it may be casued by the shortness of our seed region which is for inhibition
Density Regulator
-can it work
In order to demonstrate the density-regulated sensor is well controlled by the concentration of signal molecules (acyl-homoserine lactone, or AHLs) produced, we characterized the quorum sensing system (Lux) with purchased AHL molecules. Different concentrations of AHL were used to induce the transcription of sfGFP, attempting to identify the threshold concentration that turns on the transcription downstream pLux.
AHL stocks in the concentration of 10-3 M to 10-14 M was prepared by serial dilutions. Then the AHL stocks were added into M9 media culture thousand-fold in volume to obtain M9 with AHL of concentrations ranging from 10
-6
M to 10-14 M. IPTG was added into M9 to induce the expression of LuxR.
We first did a rough qualitative experiment to make sure this device is functional.
From this figure we can see the device is functional.
-quantitatively
The fluorescent intensity increased dramatically at the concentration of 10
-8
M, indicating the threshold concentration of AHL for Lux system is around 10-8 M. At least 10-7 M to 10-8 M of AHL is required to activate the expression under the regulation of pLux.

Overview
Responsible: Nadine Gerstenberg, David Wehner, Jara Obermann
Our project envisions genetically modified organisms in the scope of food production. In Germany genetic engineering especially in the realm of food production is a highly sensitive topic. The following video adequately summarizes the current situation in Germany using the example of BASF's decision to move their Plant Science headquarters from Limburgerhof, Germany, to Raleigh, North Carolina (USA) [1] .
More information on the development and on the current situation in Germany can be found in the References section.
Considering the general rejection of genetic engineering and keeping in mind that Germany has a long tradition of brewing beer under the German purity law it is even more important to inform the general public about genetic engineering, synthetic biology and our project. While the general public broadly opposes genetic engineering, the scientific community tries to emphasizes the potential benefits of the technology. In a 2008 lecture Nobel Prize-Winner Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard made clear: ""Germany has so far failed to sufficiently accept that applying genetic engineering in plant breeding offers an as yet not fully tapped potential for organic farming, improved environmental protection, the conservation of biodiversity and health. Plants that are resistant towards moths, fungal infestation, viruses and nematodes need not be sprayed. Plants that are better adapted to unfavourable growth conditions, saline soil and karst and arid regions can thus be bred and grown to turn barren land back into fertile land ”"

In our laboratory, we experienced some trouble with restriction ligation cloning. Therefore, will use a different restriction buffer: the universal buffer of JenaBioscience. Also, I will try to ligate the Tn-Linker and Linker-Tn5 separately to the dxCas9 prior to cloning into pACYCDuet-1.

Introduction to new students at TUM and LMU
The interest in synthetic biology expressed by the general public is primarily driven by the outcome. Science students however are more enthusiastic about the mechanistic details and may even gather inspiration for their own projects. We raised awareness for the variety of impressive iGEM projects by presenting at the welcoming events of the new biology, biochemistry, biotechnology and chemistry students at both our host universities. Through adding information about the mechanistic details of Phactory, we created interest for cell-free expression systems. Hopefully we inspired some students to join next year’s iGEM team or apply the ideas presented at the Giant Jamboree into their future research projects.
German Meetup
The iGEM competition promotes strong values among teams. By the time we went to Marburg for the German Meetup, we had already decided on the outline of our project and were not really sure how to include achievements of other teams in Phactory - yet!
Through professional scientific lectures we got insight in research opportunities in synthetic biology. We really started to feel the spirit of community when we engaged in poster sessions with other teams. The exchange of ideas and experience in open discussions helped the development of all projects in an early stage of the iGEM cycle.
Not only did we start collaborations, but we also made friends and celebrated each other and our achievements as a community. Adding the final touch, we enjoyed BBQ followed by an iGEM-Party.
We’ll come back to Marburg for the After-iGEM Meetup in 2019!
European Meetup
Our personal highlight of the summer was the organization of the European Meetup. Find the European Meetup page here .
Synthetic Biology III conference
To learn about new discoveries in synthetic biology and exchange ideas with leading scientists in the field, we joined the Synthetic Biology III conference in Landshut. The pleasant atmosphere allowed us to gather relevant input regarding relevance and significance for our project design. We were glad to find out that former iGEM Teams (Goettingen 2017 and Munich 2017) had been invited to present their work and discuss the scientific impact it had. This again demonstrated the impact of iGEM in the field of synthetic biology."

Problem
Hyperuricemia refers to the abnormal high level of uric acid in the blood. The most frequently affected area is the joint, which can cause acute gout arthritis, chronic gout arthritis and joint deformity. However, joint injury is only the tip of the iceberg of hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia can also damage the kidney, causing abnormal renal function, kidney stones, renal colic and other chronic kidney diseases. Hyperuricemia not only damages the joints and kidneys, but also is closely related to metabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and fatty liver."

Therefore the aim is to produce 2.5 g of the   peptide aptamer per batch. The wanted concentration is reached by measuring the concentration at the   release of the broth and adjust the elution accordingly. This determines the volume   of the elution, the result can be viewed in table 13. Elution is performed with column buffer. If this buffer is   not suited for storage, it can be changed by dialysis, though for now it is assumed appropriate. Reference: NEB-impact

The last step of the product recovery is regeneration of the column, which prepares it for the next batch. It   has been reported that the resin can be reused 4-5 times, it is assumed that 4 times is appropriate. Regeneration is   performed by washing the bed with 3 BV of stripping solution (0.3 M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) and   then leaving the bed to soak for 30 minutes. After which the column is washed with additional 7 BV of the   stripping solution, followed with 20 BV of water. Lastly 5 BV of column buffer is applied. Reference: NEB-impact

To have a better experimental design, we needed to design two other                       constructs, a positive control and a negative control. For the positive control,                       we followed the same layout except we used an already characterized signal                       peptide: DbASS, which is already found in the iGEM registry. As for the                       negative control, we did the same thing, but of course we did not attach any                       signal peptide to the fluorescent protein. Both genetic designs are shown in the                       following figures:
Figure 3. Genetic construct for the characterization of the NSP2 signal                       peptide. We find the T7 promoter controlling the expression of the iLOV protein                       which has the DsbAss secretion peptide attached to the N-terminus of the                       protein and the His tag enclosed to the C-terminus of the reporter.
Figure 4. Negative control for the experimental design. T7 promoter that                       enables the expression of the iLOV reporter with a 6 His-Tag attached to it.
Now that our constructs had arrived, the first thing we did was clone                       them inside the pSB1C3 plasmid. The details of the experimental conditions we                       followed can be observed in the Protocols section of this wiki. Afterwards, we                       proceeded to transform our E. coli BL21 strain using the chemical method.
Figure 5. Transformed E. coli BL21 strain grown on agar plate with                       chloramphenicol. Each individual square corresponds to an isolated                       transformed colony with a specific genetic construct (NSP2, NSP4, positive                       control or negative control).
Although our bacteria were able to grow in chloramphenicol, meaning                       they had in fact been transformed, we could not be sure if they only had the                       plasmid itself or actually our genetic constructs. That is why we performed                       miniprep to each colony, digested it and ran the results in an electrophoresis                       gel, which can be observed in Figure 6.
Figure 6. Digestion gel for the NSP2, NSP4, Positive control and Negative                       Control constructs. We can observe in the bottom of the gel the 4 bands                       corresponding to our 4 genetic designs and moving up in the gel we see the 4                       bands of the linearized plasmid pSB1C3. Both cases fell within the expected                       range of molecular weight according to the ladder.

XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"Group$ is divided into 8 groups as the results of the survey.
The results are shown as follows:
From the picture, we know that different age groups have different preference towards psicose and it is better for us to include the influence of the age group distribution. By weighting people of different ages, we get the corresponding market share, and then we can calculate the demand for psicose in different ages. $$PsiDe(AgeGroup,t)=PsiTo(t) \cdot \frac{\mu_{EvF}(AgeGroup)}{\sum \mu_{EvF}(AgeGroup)}$$ Where $PsiDe(t)$ is the demand for psicose in a certain age, $PsiTo(t)$ is the total psicose production. When we aim to research the market situation in a small range, the $EvF(AgeGroup)$ will not change in a short period and the total psicose production can be estimated as the demand for the sugar: $$PsiTo(t)=\alpha_{Psi}\cdot SugTo(t)$$ Where $\alpha_{Psi}$ represents the percentage of psicose to sugar and $SugTo(t)$ is the total demand for sugar.
From the questionnaire we got, we can calculate different $EvF$ in different ages:
Results and Discussion
Basing our model, we can calculate and simulate our system as follows:
From the picture below, it is evident that with time going by, the concentration of IPTG outside the cell will decrease due to the diffusion process, while the RFP expression level is increasing stably.
If we do more experiments shown below, we can find that the expression level of RFP is increasing with the increase of the concentration of IPTG, which proves that we can get a linear range of IPTG to get the RFP expression level. According to device A, B, C, D, this conclusion can also be made, which proves the validation of our kinetic model
From the result above, the SYSU model can prove their simulation has the same trend of the real experiment data, which also gave us a meaningful design performance forecast, which also validate our ODE model.
SYSU Validation Model
With the directed evolution method to produce psicose, what matters is the conversion rate and the scale of the production system. As the results shown above, if we cultivate our system for many times, the conversion rate of DTE is increasing stably with the directed evolution method.
If we do diretecd evolution for more times, we will get the same result and the increase of conversion rate with directed evolution is stable, while the"

Degradation Module
The degradation reaction of PET
PET+LC Cutinase→Ethylene Glycole +Terephtalic Acid+Cutinase
Cutinase
The amount of LC-Cutinase enzyme is due to the enzyme production rate by Escherichia coli and the degradation of LC-Cutinase. The enzyme (LC-Cutinase) production occurs constitutively (did not need any activator and produced continuously). At the t-time when LC-Cutinase reach the maximum quantity, the Escherichia coli productivity will be decreased because of Inclusion body. Inclusion body is protein which is produced by miss-folded protein. The amount of inclusion body will be increases. When the inclusion body reach the K quantity, it will be repress the LC-Cutinase production because the inclusion body become a inducer for PibPab promoter that could drive Tet Represor gene expression. Our degradation module contain Tet Operator that could be repressed by Tet Represor. Our PibPab promoter also could drive the Amil Cp gene expression that release blue chromoprotein. Based on that phenomenon, the production of LC-Cutinase was modeled using Hill Function with the repressor factor.
Inclusion Body
When the Escherichia coli start to produce many of cutinase enzyme at maximum concentration, it start become stress and begin to producing a miss-folded protein called inclusion body. As long as the producing of enzyme cutinase in this condition, the producing of inclusion body will be much. At this time the inclusion body act as the repressor that stop the production of cutinase and also will be the activator of"

TEV protease is the common name for the 27 kDa catalytic domain of the Nuclear Inclusion a (NIa) protein encoded by the tobacco etch virus (TEV). Because its sequence specificity, TEV protease is a very useful reagent for cleaving fusion proteins. It is also relatively easy to overproduce and purify large quantities of the enzyme.

Design
The project's main goal on this part is producing the inactive form of the pexiganan which have antimicrobial effects; DAMP-Pexiganan and producing TEV Protease which will activate DAMP-Pexiganan. For producing this proteins abundantly we use T7 promoter ,which has extremely strong transcription rate, while we designing our parts. We also decided to have Lac Operator site (that LacI protein can bind) between our gene sequences and T7 promoters to make protein expressions controllable. We researched for the expression vector that satisfy these requirements, and we found we could use the pet45-b expression vector provides the conditions we want. While we genes to order we added RFC10 prefix domain to the 3 'end of DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease and we also added BamHI restriction enzyme recognition sequence for clonning inside to Pet45-b vector. We added RFC10 Suffix domain to the 5’ end of the same gene sequences, same way we added XhoI restriction enzyme recognition sequence for cloning inside to Pet45-b plasmid. In line with our ultimate goal we aim producing of  these two proteins in the same bacteria. To make this happen we need to ligate these two gene sequences with two plasmids these have different types of origin(Origin incompatibility).  Therefore, we have designed Damp PEX gene sequence in this manner so that at the same time we can ligate it with pColA vector. pColA plasmit do not include promoter in itself beceuse of that we added T7 promoter to 5' end of DAMP-Pexiganan gene sequence.
As stated above, we planned clonning  ordered DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease genes in Pet45-b vector with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes. When this clonning performed; T7 promoter-Lac operator (LacO)- HisTag- DAMP-pexiganan/TEV protease construction"

Figure 3: Cas13a activity with CAHS 94205 in RNase Alert assay. Fluorescence intensities over time triggered by the RNase activity of Cas13a before and after drying with TDP CAHS 94205, crRNA and with/without the target RNA.
We asked  Munich to assist us by repeating a similar drying experiment with the same CAHS protein and their Cas13a, in order corroborate our results and help us find the cause of such an unexpected finding. As observed in Figure 1, the same unexpected trend is described when Munich’s Cas13a is dried with our CAHS 94205 , hence verifying our CAHS+Cas13a results.
Figure 4: Cas13a activity with CAHS 94205 in RNase Alert Assay by Munich. Fluorescence intensities over time triggered by RNase activity of Cas13a after drying with the TDP CAHS 94205, with and without crRNA and target RNA. Data from iGEM  Munich 2017.
Not only did their results help us discard a problem in our Cas13a or an experimental error as the issue, but also proved a similar behaviour of the TDPs in combination with our  Cas13a’s (which were actually based on the sequences of different organisms and purified according to different protocols) and therefore further substantiated the use of TDPs for the preservation of Cas13a.
Drylab Collaboration iGEM Munich
Both the iGEM TU Delft and iGEM LMU-TUM Munich teams realized that optimal crRNA is a prerequisite in utilizing Cas13a for their respective detection purposes. In addition to sensitively detecting a sequence of interest, modeling the off-target effects of a chosen crRNA is important in assessing the reliability of the system, as it provides information about the probability of a false positive output. Both teams took a different approach: we employed a kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) while iGEM LMU-TUM Munich applied an alignment algorithm. Please find the full model here .
Biophysical modeling has the advantage of providing a unified targeting framework that is able to take into account tiny (local) off-target effects that together may add to affect the reliability of the system. However, it is computationally intensive as compared to homology search and requires the development of the software"

The protein interacting with the C-terminus and through that regulating the selectivity of AtNHX1 is the Arabidopsis thaliana calmodulin-like protein 15 (AtCaM15), which is localized in the      vacuolar lumen and is transported there via cytoplasm-to vacuole-targeting pathway [17]. The small CaM proteins bind Ca2+ and are often transducing secondary messenger signals that lead to      different cellular responses [18,19]. When AtCaM15 binds to the AtNHX1 C-terminus it changes the Na+/K+ selectivity by decreasing the Na+/H+ Vmax while not significantly altering the K+/H+      exchange efficiency [20]. The binding of AtCaM15 to the C-terminus of AtNHX1 is Ca2+ and pH dependent. When the pH lowers the binding of AtCaM15 increases so at lower pH value the Na+/K+      ratio went down [20]. At physiological conditions with a high intravacuolar Ca2+ concentration and a low acidic pH this would result in a low Na+/H+ transport rate respective to the K+/H+      exchange rate [20].
The deletion of Arg-496 to Gly-518 of the C-terminus - that can form the typical positively charged amphiphilic α-helix of CaM targeting peptides - doubled the Na+/K+ selectivity ratio of the      transporter which could mean that this is the specific binding site for AtCaM15 on the C-terminus [16]. When a plant is exposed to salt stress its vacuolar pH rises [21,22] which releases      AtCaM15 from the C-terminus resulting in an increased Na+/H+ exchange activity that leads to an increased vacuolar Na+ accumulation as a salt stress response [20].
Through DNA shuffling it was possible to generate a mutated channel - called AtNHXS1 - that showed an about 1 fold increased Na+/H+ Vmax while the K+/H+ exchange activity was not significantly      altered when compared to the native form of AtNHX1 [15]. The channel is still localized to the vacuolar membrane and when expressed in a yeast strain the cell accumulates more sodium than the      native stain with AtNHX1 [15]. AtNH"

This model helps investigators probe for possible new metabolisms derived from combining different organisms with different metabolic capacities. Best Foundational Advance: BioBrick standard biological parts are DNA sequences of defined structure and function designed to be incorporated into living cells to construct new biological systems. Synthetic biologists have been building BioRooms by engineering single microbes that contain purposeful compositions of BioBricks to perform tasks such as bio-sensing, bio-degradation, bio-transformation or bio-synthesis. However, most of these BioRooms are designed to be self-containing, self-sufficient systems in stark contrast to how microbes normally exist in community in natural environments. The UBC iGEM 2012 team sets a foundational advance by engineering microbial BioRooms that are compatible with each other and can be regulated based on their interdependencies. In the future, it may be possible to mix and match BioRooms to create BioFactories with novel synergistic metabolisms. Inter-Team Collaborations

- Uncontrolled Release of modified organisms into the environment
- Spread of Antibiotic Resistance from synthetic to natural bacteria
- Bioterrorism
The public are fearful of the ability of synthetic biology to produce known/modified/new organisms designed to be harmful to humans (as demonstrated, for example, by the synthesis of viruses such as the polio virus and the pandemic Spanish Flu virus and nurtured by Hollywood dramas such as 'Outbreak').
- Creation of 'Artificial Life'
Some of the group expressed fears about scientists 'playing God', explaining their philosophical and religious concerns about the process of creation and the nature of 'living' beings. There was significant confusion as to how exactly 'life' should be defined, where it begins and ends, and what the requisite level of complexity is. Some people vaguely expressed fears that synthetic biology will 'blur' the line between the 'artificial and natural worlds', although did not elaborate on what was meant by this nor why this would be such a negative development.
- Creation of Monopolies
There is some concern that patenting could lead to creation of commercial monopolies and inhibit research. [e.g. BRCA 1 Gene monopoly causing increase in price of testing which could potentially save lives).
- Global Justice
Some of the group expressed worries about the fact that much of the development of synthetic biology and resulting intellectual property is likely to take place in and by extension principally benefit rich, developed nations. Particular examples of this concern which were raised included the possibility of farmers in poor countries becoming dependent on modified crop seeds controlled by large corporations which could extract whatever price they wished for the product, and the possibility of cheap alternatives for manufacture of chemicals such as antimalarial medicine (artemisinin) ensuring that local prodiction of natural equivalent products would no longer be sustained. Generally, this fear is expressed as a concern that technologies which are socially accepted on the premise that they will improve quality of life in less developed countries (golden rice and GM mosquitoes being cited as examples of such projects) may in actual fact benefit only rich Western companies and have no or even a detrimental impact on the lives of those the project was intended to help.
- Lack of Regulation
There is great concern that the development of fast-growing fields such as synthetic biology is 'overtaking' the regulation which is in place to regulate its application and to balance the risks and potential benefits. The possibility of biological warfare programmes is a major worry. A further concern is the possibility of 'garbage biology' (DIY home synthetic biology) may become a more popular, widespread hobby in the future - increased accessibility would make"

Safety with BioMaster
BioMaster is a biobrick database which focuses on database integration as well as promoter prediction. The data in the BioMaster comes from databases with security certifications and declarations such as Uniprot and EPD, so the data in BioMaster is also secure. Our prediction function is only meant to provide users with a prediction result for their reference. Whether to use it depends on users’ actual situation and their own judges.
Q1: What are the functions of BioMaster?
A1: BioMaster can be used to search for detailed information of biobricks such as its functions, sites, interactions and related references. It can predict if a DNA sequence is a promoter.
Q2: How BioMaster works?
A2: BioMaster is run and maintained by UESTC. Users can use it by visit our website.
Q3:Who are the users of BioMaster?
A3: Users are those who want to find information about biobricks or those who want to do some promoter prediction.
Q4: Does it have any risks in laboratory?
A4: BioMaster runs as a web page. It aims to provide more detailed and comprehensive biobrick information and accurate prediction results of promoters to synthetic biologists. We won’t use any plasmid or bacteria. No wet-lab experiments and no pollution to the environment.
Q5: Is it risky for users to use BioMaster?
A5: BioMaster runs on a computer so it does no harm to the environment and users’ health. By visiting our web page people can use BioMaster. They don’t even have to login. With no information entry, User's privacy will not be risk of disclosure.
Q6: Does BioMaster infringe on the intellectual property of others?
We specifically consulted lawyer Mr. Yong’gang Zheng on intellectual property issues. The databases referenced by BioMaster are all open source, and these databases have no related statements. So, our work is reasonable and legal. We"

Either the top or bottom strand of this sequence was synthesized and phosphorylated. This was carried out as described in our protocol file. The single stranded target was then ready for reaction with our HPV detector plasmid.
4. Double Stranded HPV Target Preparation
Both the top and bottom strands only of the 55bp target sequence were synthesized and phosphorylated. The two complimentary were then annealed together to generate a double stranded target.  This product was then reacted with the HPV detector plasmid.  This was carried out as described in our protocol file.
5. Cloning of HPV Target into a Plasmid
Overlapping forward and reverse oligonucleotides containing the HPV target and flanking HaeIII recognition sites and that had overhanging XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites were synthesized.  Double stranded DNA was generated by primer extension in a standard PCR reaction.  Following digestion with XhoI and EcoRI enzymes this target DNA was cloned into the pBluescript SKII vector that had been cut with the same enzymes.  This was done to mimic the true structure of the HPV target as it would be found in a clinical sample; as a double stranded fragment of a circular piece of DNA.  Since we could not work with actual HPV genomic DNA for safety reasons, this “target plasmid” served as a surrogate for actual HPV DNA.  pBluescript SKII was chosen as a plasmid that was not closely related to the Detector plasmid pSB1-C3.

Whilst considering the risks posed by our physical container, it occurred to us that we needed to also consider more general impact of creating a physical product such as our plug ‘n’ play kit on the environment and users. Because our system is intended for lab use, at the end of its life it will be sterilised and then discarded. Our PDMS chambers can not be recycled, and so would have to be sent to landfill. As PDMS degrades in soil, it's non-toxic and does not bioaccumulate in sediment dwelling organisms, this is an acceptable disposal method. The remaining components of our kit are ABS plastic or glass and are recyclable provided the PDMS is removed. We will supply information on how to remove the PDMS and this recycling information alongside our kit.
Safe Lab Work
As part of our laboratory induction which took place during the first week of our project we were introduced to the General Safety Procedures for working in our labs. There was a focus on microbiological safety, and, as we would be working in both class 1 and class 2 biological safety level labs, the differences for working in each. We covered biological safety cabinet use and aspectic working techniques, the use of protective clothing and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), disinfection and waste disposal.
In addition to biological safety we also covered chemical safety, including how to contain a chemical spill and the requirements for bringing new chemicals into the laboratory. Finally, we also were introduced to working safely with electrical and ultraviolet equipment.
During our work we required chemicals that had not been used in our lab before. For all of these we located the required material safety data sheets which are collected below.
Methylene Blue SDS
Ferrocene SDS
Gold Nanoparticles SDS
Rhodamine B SDS
For those chemicals which we deemed to be hazardous to health, like Methylene Blue we completed the appropriate University risk assessment form  using the information from these safety data sheets. As well as considering the following factors:
The level for a harmful dose.

Thus, we found that even if ATP had a greater perturbation, the overall level was relatively                                 high in 0-60 min compared to the previous standard deviation of 0.02. While the transformation                                 of the metabolic pathway also reflects a more stable curve of change. At this point the concentration                                 of DHAP is not significantly affected by changes in ATP concentration.
Thus, in actual production, we only need to keep the ATP concentration at a slightly higher                                 level, not only to ensure the production of the target product, but to increase the stability                                 of the system as well.
Mutation Design of ceaS2 by using AEMD
Abstract
Engineering for the desired enzyme catalytic properties plays an important role in the biosynthesis                                 of bulk chemicals and natural products. However, it is a time-consuming task to improve enzyme                                 catalysis by traditional random mutagenesis. And the utility of rational design based on                                 protein structure often was limited by the lack of protein structure for target enzymes and                                 professional backgrounds of bioinformatics.
ceaS2 enzyme is the most important enzyme in our entire acrylic acid synthesis pathway,                                 but the activity of wild type is not high. So it is exceedingly necessary to modify it on                                 the basis of the ""part"" level to improve its catalytic reactivity. We used the AEMD platform                                 to conduct the mutational design for ceaS2 enzyme in order to figure out a more accurate                                 scheme of mutation, which can also exert great beneficial impact on the later experiments.
We have totally identified 32 mutational sites, and its point mutation transformation. The                                 experimental results show that there are 11 sites, where the enzyme activity gets boosted,                                 after the transformation. Compared to wild type ceaS2 enzyme, the highest activity has increased                                 by 11 times, whose effect is obviously noticeable. This also demonstrates the ability of                                 this designing platform.
Introduction
Enzyme engineering has been extensively used to optimize biocatalysts in industrial biotechnology                                 since most of enzymes in nature prefer to organisms adaptation but not industrial production                                 (Alvizo, et al., 2014; Ma, et al., 2009; Savile, et al., 2010). Traditionally, optimized                                 enzymes were obtained by random site-directed or saturated mutagenesis such as Error Prone                                 PCR, DNA shuffling and so on (Kabumoto, et al., 2009; Qi, et al., 2009; Reetz and Carballeira,                                 "

Bicistronic Design
Improving and Regulating Protein Expression
Overview
Within the last few decades, DNA synthesis, sequencing and recombination technologies have significantly increased in sophistication and in turn practicality. However, the unpredictable variances in the behavior of standardized parts across setting changes remain an obstacle to time-efficient, rational gene network design. Vivek Mutalik and colleagues have in the past year designed bicistronic expression operating units (EOUs). Using these bicistronic designs (BCDs) Mutalik and others managed to express arbitrary genes within a twofold target window with ~93% reliability (Mutalik, 2012). The next best system at the time could only do the same with ~47% reliability (Salis, 2009). This summer, we attempted to make four existing BCD designs BioBrick compatible and modify them for assembly in an all-in-one-pot Golden Gate Cloning Reaction using the type IIs restriction enzyme BpiI.
Background
A bicistronic design works to standardize the mRNA secondary structure over the RBS-CDS junction. This in turn reduces variation in ribosome binding and expression across different RBS-CDS combinations (Mutalik, 2012). The above figure comes from the publication of Mutalik et al. listed in the references.
Golden gate cloning relies on type IIs restriction enzymes, such as BpiI, to assemble multiple fragments in one reaction. The unique feature of IIs REs which allows this is the separation of their recognition sites from their cut sites (Engler, 2009). The 2012 Freiburg iGEM team has an excellent page on Golden Gate assembly for those who wish to learn more. https://2012.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Project/Golden

Assembly of B"
Virginia,2013,Team:Virginia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," A strain of minicells from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston was received on July 18th.  This was a strain of minicells derived from the silencing of minCDE gene. These will form a good basis for comparison to our minicells.
After many failed transformations and ligations, members of the team sat down with the advisors to discuss and resolve these problems. New protocols were formed and the outlook is bright! A new restriction digest was performed with the ribosome binding site, GFP and our FtsZ. These DNA samples were isolated and ligated together according to the compound Biobrick formation plan using the new protocols. On July 21st, the team used the new transformation protocol to transform the ligated material. This time the transformation was a success and the colonies were grown up! The successful transformants were miniprepped. The team ran a confirmatory digest and gel on the DNA and it was sent off for sequencing on the 24th. An IPTG inducible promoter (BBa_R0011) was ligated onto the ribosome binding site + FtsZ construct. A terminator (BBa_B0015) was ligated onto the ribosome binding site + GFP.  This was confirmed by another digest and gel. These samples were also sequenced.
So finally, after a month of trial and error, the team has found their stride with a winning combination of good protocols and good results! The team also received a minicell strain for Yale that utilizes Ftsz instead of minCDE.
August
In August our team hit a major snag. Our isolated FtsZ has an illegal restriction site and was most likely the cause of our problems in the beginning. The gene has been ordered with a mutation in the restriction site. In the meanwhile, the team attempted to utilize site directed mutagenesis. Although Biobrick formation was at a roadblock, the team continued with purification and applications. The sucrose gradient minicell purification protocol was competed using the WM1032 strain from Yale. The Promoter+RBS construct (BBa_K215000) was received from iGEM. The AiL plasmid for our applications team was received and inoculated.
On August 13th the Ribosome Binding Site + GFP + Terminator and the Ribosome Binding Site + GFP was sent off for sequencing. The team also received our long awaited for synthesized FtsZ gene without the illegal cut site. All previous “BioBricks” completed in August were redone with the correct FtsZ and confirmed with a digest"

Rational Evasion of BLAST
Curiously, the number of recoding events does not necessarily always indicate whether a read is detected by BLAST or not. A small section of data from one SeCReT run is presented to indicate that in some cases, recoding can be especially disruptive to determining the identity of a protein product.

Building Solutions
Changes on the Horizon
We have shown that the power of the BLAST program to identify proteins arising from genetically recoded sequences is extremely limited, there are initiatives to develop new biosecurity tools. For example, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), the cousin of DARPA, has a program called Functional Genomic and Computational Assessment of Threats (Fun GCAT) which aims to catalyze the development of tools to improve DNA screening capabilites. Several of the synthesis companies that we spoke to are involved in this program. It is our hope that we see more mobilization on this front to ensure that the benefits that arise from Synthetic Biology continue to greatly outweigh the risks.

DeToxIT (Decryption and Toxin Identification Tool)

Summary
Biosecurity Analysis
We determined that current biosecurity protocols and tools (BLAST) are ineffective at identiying proteins that could arise from recoded sequences.
We also determined that the minimum degree of recoding required to evade BLAST is approximately 9 recoding events.
We also determined that 4 recoding events are sufficient to reduce the percent identity of a toxin to 80% of its closest reference sequence.
Lastly, we have built relationships with members of the IGSC and are excited to continue working to keep DNA synthesis safe.

Although we had this initial success, the mammalian cells did not sustain themselves in the cell trap for long.
We decided with the MIT team to continue this collaboration in an effort to successfully culture and sustain mammalian cells in a microfluidic chip. Our goals are to iterate over new microfluidic designs and to practice better methods of inserting the cells into the chip. We are currently still in collaboration with the MIT iGEM team.
MORE ON MIT COLLABORATION
NEU Collaboration
Our second big collaboration was with the NEU iGEM team in designing a microfluidic gradient generator for a cell culture system. The idea is as follows: the NEU team wanted to test a hypothetical genetic circuit and its performance under variable levels of environmental stress. Namely, they were interested in seeing how the expression of certain circuit outputs varied when the bacterial cells received a variable amount of nutrients from the environment.
The NEU team wanted a microfluidic device with the following function: The device would take two fluid inputs, one fluid with a concentrated nutrient solution, and the other input with water. The microfluidic device would contain ten cell traps, each cell trap would contain an individual cell culture. The function of the microfluidic chip would be to generate a gradient of nutrient solution such that the first cell trap receives the full concentration of solution, the second cell trap receives a little less solution, the third even less and so forth. The final cell trap would have no nutrient solution. Thus this chip would generate a gradient of nutrients for all the cells, and then the NEU team would be able to easily analyze the expression of their circuit under variable nutrient inputs. The design schematic was as follows:
This clearly was a much more complicated microfluidic to design, so we considered it a strong test bench for Neptune’s back-end algorithms. We attempted to generate this chip using the gradient generator primitive that was built into MINT. We iterated over several design attempts with MINT.
We ultimately found that MINT’s gradient generator primitive has a few limitations and bugs, which we have since proceeded to work out. Our collaboration with NEU unfortunately was put on hold because the NEU team informed us that they could not realize their hypothetical genetic circuit, so they had no need for our device. We have not given up though! Our goal is to update and iron out any bugs"

Different volume of KCl was added by drops into cell culture wells to reach the different final concentrations of KCl (control, 12.5mM, 50mM, 200mM, respectively) at 40s. Fluorescence intensity over time is shown as signal per pixel (the initial intensity has been subtracteed and normalized). 0 mM control, 12.5 mM, 50 mM, 200 mM.)
There was no distinct fluorescent increase at 12.5mM KCl compared with the control group. Cells under 50mM and 200mM KCl both displayed higher fluorescence. Besides, the fluorescence of cells at 200mM was higher than cell at 50mM along with oscillation. It was proved quantitatively that R-GECO could be excited by KCl-induced calcium influx.

(Fluorescence intensity over time is shown as signal per pixel (the initial intensity has been normalized). Ionomycin was added at 20s to 10μM final concentration.)
To further validate our cells, we use ionomycin as another positive control for calcium influx. Ionomycin was dropped on one side of the culture well, the direction of fluorescence gradient (shown in the movie) was consistent with the direction of ionomycin diffusion.
3. Piezo1 and TRPC5 Sensitivity Measurement
We designed two experiments to quantitatively examine the sensibility of Piezo1 and TRPC5. Microfluidics and hypoosmolarity were employed to exert shear force and tension on our transgenic CHO-K1 cells’ membrane separately.
Hypoosmolarity
Calcium influx induced by hypoosmolarity was indicated by fluorescence intensity increase of R-GECO. CHO-K1 cells with Piezo1 (Fig.4a) were much more sensitive to hypoosmolarity. The peak values of R-GECO+Piezo1 increased as osmolarity decreased. And there were distinct oscillations of fluorescence when osmolarity was below 70%. However, fluorescence of cells with R-GECO (Fig. 4b) only showed obvious increase and oscillation when the osmolarity was 60%, whose intensity was a lot less than R-GECO+Piezo1 (Fig. 4c). It was quantitatively proved that Piezo1 channel was very sensitive to osmolarity.

SAFETY
As we all know, industrial bacterial can secrete several chemicals that has considerable significance for us. However, they are also easily stolen by thieves. What’s more, the pathogenic of bacteria can’t be depressed at this time. The threat of bio-weapon cannot be ignored. Recent years, it is reported that a new form of biology is rising: “Biohackery”. Biohackery allows everyone operation the genome of bacteria in their home or garage with themselves. Without the regulatory of an International Association of Synthetic Biology, we can’t make sure that there is no threat coming from someone’s house or garden, isn’t it?
That’s our work in safety. In fact, we not only followed all the rules in order to make sure that our operation is absolutely safe, but also made some contributions to safety. What we made this year is to provide a new method preventing miss, lose or theft in biology lab.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q1: What if sequencing does not aim at your lock but the function gene? If so, you lock will lose its function.
A: On sequencing problem, it is obvious that nobody will do nothing but sequence the sample at the first time. Them sample must be nurtured and tested to be the right one, which cannot be realized because our system will prevent that happen.
Q2: If cell division inhibition system comes from engineering bacteria, will it be easy for the bacteria to evolve a method to fight against it? If it is exogenous, will it be harm to the production progress?
A: We plan to use system from bacteria themselves, there is no need to worry about evolution. In fermentation progress bacteria will not be used more than once, there will always be the origin strain in the fermentation tank, the rest will be disposed.
Q3: The difficulty of unlocking the E.co-Lock. (Which aspects of the E.co-Lock have anti-theft and anti-crack function? )
A: First, you must know the E.co-Lock genetic pathway. Second, at the beginning of culturing cells, the medium must be added a certain amount of AHL. In addition, when you add three inducers to try to unlock it, you must know the following: what the inducers are, the order of added inducers, how much each inducer you should add, and how long you should wait until you add next inducer. In a word, the complexity"

Figure 9 Presentation in the CCiC
In the CCiC, we had a presentation to share our ideas and thoughts with other teams. The presentation topics                 included how Staphylococcus aureus can affect human health, what probiotic strain is used as the host to                 run our circuit, the ideas in the design of the circuit and the problems we faced at that time. We hoped                 to get some advices from other teams to improves our work. Fortunately, TMMU has shared a similar project                 with us, thus we had same common problem in our work. A professor from TMMU came up a question on how our                 antimicrobial peptides can specifically target on S.aureus and without affecting other probiotic in the guts. A common problem on the circuit construction                 for our two teams was how to deal with cloning the agrC and agrA genes. Both of us found that the agrA gene                 had a very high tendency to be mutated during cloning. During our conversation, we suspected that protein                 AgrA might be a toxic protein for Lactococcus Lactis, thus it cannot be inherited stably. We improve our project based on the comments                 from other iGEM teams and iGEM the HQ judge’s suggestions during the conference.
Figure 10 Presentation in the CCiC
In this conference, many interesting projects attracted us a lot. We studied from some ingenious designs on how to construct                 a much more complex pathway. Circuit design in synthetic biology is requires understanding of knowledge from                 many different fields and very precise design in assembly of many different parts with various functions.                 We keeps learning and acquiring more knowledge on gene expression and metabolic coordination of cells to                 improve our premature project in the future.
Activity: Visit to Shanghai Changhai Hospital
In order to get broader knowledge and feedback, we managed to book a consultation with Shanghai Changhai Hospital, an upper                 first-class general hospital in Shanghai, China. We invited Prof. Can Xu, who is specialized in Gastroenterology,                 especially the diagnosis and treatment of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is closely related to our research. We intended to get                 a further understanding of the potential relationship between IBD and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization (as described by many                 scientific papers and reports), however, which is to be honest unsurprisingly, this case is also rare in                 this hospital so they cannot provide information too detailed and advanced. However, we did learn from the                 talk; Prof. Xu, along with her colleagues, told"

The orthogonaliztion of macromolecular machines mainly include orthogonal DNA polymerases, orthogonal RNA polymerases, orthogonal ribosomes and orthogonal mRNA translation system, Ribo-T and mirror genetic system.
3.The Design of complex Genetic Networks:
Figure 4.  Complex genetic network as a strategy for biocontainment:(A)Deadman, (B)passcode
The strategies described above are mainly targeted at single target, which means that engineered microbes can escape form the system through mutation, recombination or immunity against toxin genes. By introducing redundancy into the system, genetically engineered organisms have to mutate at multiple sites to break through the biocontainment system. At the same time, due to the existence of multiple independent biocontainment systems, The time and divisions of the cells to breakthrough the biocontainment system increased significantly, and thus the escape rate is greatly reduced. As shown in Figure 5, ‘Deadman’ and ‘passcode’[8] have been developed to combine complex gene circuits to achieve biocontainment of genetically engineered organisms.

Tianjin for Qsinghua-A
This year, we helped Tsinghua-A team in their wet-lab experiment. They want to mutate a single base in their DNA so that it will not be cut by a certain type of restriction enzyme. So we taught them how to do overlap PCR. Because we two team were not in the same city, it was hard for us to do experiment for them directly. So we taught them the principle of design and the protocol of experiment.
Primer design of overlap PCR
1.   The overlap region should be near 20bp
2.   Each primer need another ~20bp for annealing (each primer is ~40bp in total)
3.   The mutant point should be in the middle of the overlap region
Protocol of overlap PCR
1.   First PCR:
One reaction system (50ul) contains 2ul 10uM forward primer and 2ul 10uM overlap reverse primer; the other reaction system contains 2ul*10uM reverse primer and 2ul*10uM overlap forward primer.
2.   Run gel electrophoresis to test the PCR product.
3.   Gel recovery.
4.   Second PCR:
In the reaction system (50ul), there are 2ul of each product (L and R part of the target gene) from the previous step, and 2ul 10uM forward and reverse primer respectively.
5.   Gel electrophoresis and recovery
6.   Sequencing the product to test it.
Results:
Figure 1. From left to right, 1 is marker; 2 is L part of overlap; 3 is R part of overlap; 4 is another L part of overlap.

8 Conclusion
Why
We decided to organize a debate on the question ""This house would allow environmental release of genetically modified bacteria for applications in the following fields: medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, energy, bioremediation"" for the following reasons:
Only 17% of Europeans, and 12% of the french population, had heard about synthetic biology in 2010 (Eurobarometer 2010 on biotechnoly). In our human practice report, we came to the conclusion that efforts to raise awarness should be made.
One of the lessons we can learn from the GMO case study in our human practice report is that people want to have a say on new technologies.
Objectives
To raise awarness about synthetic biology in the population.
That students who previously knew nothing about synthetc biology have a passionate debate on releasing genetically modified bacteria in the wild.
To see how students who previously knew nothing about synthetc biology react to such a motion: where they will get the information, what type of arguments they will come up with, will they consider things from a different angle that we do?
To get the audience's feedback on the debate and views on the question.
To bring together scientists and non scientists to discuss releasing gentically modified bacteria in the wild.
That the debate be accessible to everyone
Procedure
We organised a debate on the following motion ""This house would allow environmental release of genetically modified bacteria for applications in the following fields:"

$N_R$, $N_A$, $N_L$ and $N_K$ represent the total number of repressors, activators, locks and keys present in the circuit. S does not reflect the quality of a circuit design. The score is intended to characterize its practical realizability. There might be millions of circuits generated automatically by computers, but we only choose the most reliable and representative results for users according to the score.
Promotion of Simulation Methods
We use the Tao Algorithm based on probability. We have optimized Tao according to some specific characteristics of biology reaction, and have used cache to avoid repeated calculating.
Cache of Simulation Results
Our bio-system is a kind of graph. The core idea of cache is to find out whether two graphs are the same (isomorphic exactly). As we may know, it is NP-Complete to make sure that two graphs are isomorphic, which means it is very hard to calculate on any computer. But our bio-system is more than just a graph: it has a flow-like direction, to which topological sorts can be applied. However, such kinds of sorts are far from figuring out whether they are isomorphic. So we tried to resolve the graph into chains. It can be proved that these chains can fully describe the graph in our cases. For the depth of our graph is tiny, the algorithm becomes effective. Then we hash the chains, make it easier and faster to sort. After the sort we hash them again to get a number which is big enough to avoid the collision. Then we convert a bio-system into a number. The same numbers imply the same bio-systems. So we will compare the numbers of bio-systems to make sure whether a cache is needed. We store the cache in a folder and limit the total cache size for safety. After all the process above, you can finally use it securely.

Lab Session:7th July
Experiment summary so far...
Yesterday, we attempted to transform cultures with BioBricks. We inserted the three BioBricks into competent E.coli cells grown in the previous lab session (via plasmids) and grew them overnight. The cells were spread on plates in both undiluted and diluted forms. The diluted solution of competent E.coli cells were spread onto three different plates - a negative control plate, a positive control plate and a plasmid plate (see table above). Today we reviewed the cultures which grew on the plates and prepared them for plasmid extraction and purification - this will form tomorrow's experiment.
Observations
Firstly, none of the E.coli cells mixed with BioBrick 1 (in the presence of competence inducers) took up the DNA - they didn't appear on the diluted or undiluted plates, which were lined with ampicillin. However the E.coli cells which had been mixed with BioBricks 2 and 3 did take up the DNA as they were present in colonies on ampicillin-covered plates. There were two colonies of bacteria which had been transformed by BioBrick 2, and eight colonies transformed by BioBrick 3. These 10 cultures became the focus of the subsequent experiments.
Preparation of Solutions
To prove that the DNA the E.coli cells had taken up really was the BioBrick added to the solution, we need to carry out the procedure of DNA electrophoresis with the aid of restriction enzymes. In order to carry out this step, we need to extract and purify the plasmids first (to be done tomorrow) via alkaline lysis - this requires three solutions, two of which were made today.
Solution 1
According to Dr. Aldridge's protocol named ""Phil’s mini method for Alkaline Lysis for Mini Prep"", we need to add 'solution 1' (along with an RNAse) to resuspended transformed E.coli cells, tomorrow. Solution 1 requires the following ingredients at the following concentrations:

Motivation
iGEM is a world-wide competition hold mainly by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technolo-gy )who calls the undergraduate students all over the world to learn and fulfill the idea on syn-thetic biology through competition and what’s more follow their dream on the academic field.  This year, to make it easier for High School teams to share in the fun of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, a high school division of this game has just been hold.
Project
In order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we decided to give a presentation to a senior school Biology Olympic Competition class; members of which have great interests in the biology and basic knowledge on genetic engineering and microbiology. And then we design a question-naire to  exam the efficiency of the presentation and survey their ideas on the synthetic biology and attitude to join the iGEM high school divisoin. We believe that understanding their mind and attitudes would be greatly useful for the development of iGEM.  During the presentation, we give them a brief introduction of the basic knowledge,research strategy , application and industrialization of synthetic biology.

File:11SJTU HP P2.jpg
Furthermore, we also introduced several interesting iGEM projects such as the bacteria which eat the alkaline (2010 TU_Delft) and the bacteria which detect the nitrogen (BCCS-Bristol). In the end of the presentation, we introduced our iGEM project this year in a plain way.  With the help of the presentation and their basic knowledge on the synthetic biology, they have a very clear idea about what iGEM is like as well as our project when we finished.

1) Motivation
2) Let's create a system that absorbs salt from a liquid using genetically modified yeast
3) Aggregation system for raising the efficiency of recollection and biosafety
4) Calculating the amount of yeast necessary to lower the concentration through mathematical modeling
1) Motivation
Protein interactions, enzymatic reactions, folding of RNA, riboswitches... nearly all of these biological reactions are greatly affected by salt concentation. Salt concentration is also important for most biological devices designed by synthetic biologists. Synthetic biologist try to develope new devices that provide solutions to our daily problems in the world. However, the situations and circumstances vary greatly among each problem, often resulting in undesired salt concentrations. If the salt concentration is insufficient in the surrounding environment for a developing device, adding salt to the culture solution may solve a problem.
But how about when salt concentrations are too high? This is a difficult problem to solve. Once devices that absorb salt from environment are developed, we can greatly support various functions of other devices, for example, sensing substances in the environment or bioremediation. Besides, if we can apply salt-absorbing device to the situation outside the laboratory, there is a possibility that it will be useful for purifying water in various scenes such as industrial wastewater and salt damage.
Although this has a great possibility, the question of how feasible is this environmental desalination using synthetic biology principles has never been explored thoroughly. Therefore, we addressed this problem this year.
2) Let's create a system that absorbs salt from a liquid using genetically modified yeast
Some salt-tolerant plants have developed systems that sequester Na+ from the cytoplasm to vacuoles in order to protect themselves from Na+ flowing in. In addition, some plants have gained Na+ tolerance system by producing compatible solutes. In the process of searching papers, we noticed that many genes involved in Na+ sequestration were also shown to function in budding yeast and give them salt tolerance. The budding yeast itself also has a mechanism for exporting Na+ out of the cell.  It is also known that budding yeasts,"

It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Metabolic Channeling – state of the art
Metabolic engineering holds promise as an alternative to synthetic chemistry for cheaply and renewably producing molecules of value. Even though the construction of novel pathways out of enzymes from different organisms proves to be a powerful strategy for synthesizing a variety of compounds, achieving commercially viable productivity remains a challenge. Engineered metabolic pathways are constructed from enzymes that are heterologous to the production host often suffer from low enzymatic activities and flux imbalances, unintended and difficult-to-characterize interactions between synthetic pathways as well as the cellular environment of the host organisms. One probable reason for this is, that they typically lack the regulatory mechanisms characteristic of natural metabolism. A potential solution to this could be to organize enzymes of a synthetic pathway on synthetic scaffolds.
The small molecules of the cellular metabolism can, in general, rapidly diffuse throughout the whole cytoplasm. Exceptions from this are the products of an enzyme active site, which are locally processed by a subsequent active site. This is known as direct channeling. Direct channeling relies on the formation of protein tunnels. Those tunnels are connecting the active sites of the reactants. They help to prevent the metabolic intermediates from diffusing away from each other. [2] .
Figure 1: The direct channeling Mechanism. The intermediate is funneled from enzyme E1 to enzyme E2 by means of a protein tunnel that connects the active sites of E1 and E2, thus preventing the intermediate from diffusing away. The intermediate is then turned into a product.

Microarray
We have proposed a microarray chip processing process here because the microarray chip is very suitable for throughput detection. In addition, we shared two optimized microfluidic chip liquid drive methods. We found that the current production process and specific parameters of the chip are rarely mentioned in literatures, which are the key points to determine whether the chip can be used, so we also share the production steps.
Overview PMMA Based Processing Platform SU-8 Based Processing Platform Results Additional Work
Overview
In the biological part, we use aptamers to complete the detection of various disease markers. Because the joint detection of disease markers is very important for the correct rate and reliability of disease diagnosis. For example, h-FABP joint detection cTnI, Mb and CK-Mb has important clinical value in early diagnosis of childrenren with HFMD myocarditis, improvement of the diagnostic rate and lessening of the misdiagnosis rate, et al. [1]
Therefore, in the hardware part, we chose the microarray chip as the detection platform to complete the flux detection of the sample after the reaction. We have proposed two different materials - PMMA based and negative photoresist SU-8 based microarray chip processing. They have their own advantages and can adapt to different testing needs. At the same time, in order to verify that they can achieve basic functions, we have made chips of different sizes and tested them with our device.
So what is a microarray chip? The essence of microarrays is the parallel analysis of biological signals, which concentrates a large amount of biological information on a small solid-phase matrix, so that some traditional biological analysis methods can minimize the consumption of reagents and try to minimize the amount of reagents in the smallest possible space. Fast speed is completed. Fluorescence-based microarray chips provide us with a portable, fast, and high-throughput assay that effectively complements the clinical diagnostic process. As shown in the figure (Fig. 1), a chip that realizes flux detection based on the aperture shape. [2]
Fig.1 Porous microwells for microparticle arrays
PMMA Based Processing Platform
The PMMA flux detection chip can achieve detection requirements for <10 samples. PMMA material, namely polymethyl methacrylate, commonly known as plexiglass, is the highest quality and price-appropriate variety of synthetic transparent materials. Its light transmittance is as high as 93%, which is friendly to fluorescence detection.
At present, we have designed three sizes of chips"

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) Algorithm
History
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population based stochastic optimization technique developed by Dr. Eberhart and Dr. Kennedy in 1995,   inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. The particle swarm concept originated as a simulation of simplified social system.   The original intent was to graphically simulate the choreography of bird of a bird block or fish school.  However, it was found that particle swarm model can be used as an optimizer.
Algorithm introduction
Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space which are associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far. (The fitness value is also stored.)   This value is called pbest. Another ""best"" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle.    This location is called lbest. when a particle takes all the population as its topological neighbors, the best value is a global best and is called gbest.
The particle swarm optimization concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO).    Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random numbers being generated for acceleration toward pbest and lbest locations.
Application
PSO has been successfully applied in many research and application areas.     It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods.
Simulated Annealing(SA) Algorithm
Simulated annealing (SA) is a generic probabilistic metaheuristic for the global optimization problem of locating a good approximation to the global optimum of a given"

Our software tool has two main goals:
Distinguish gene doping sequences from endogenous DNA.
Design a minimal set of gRNAs to most efficiently detect the high amount of variance that can be present in gene doping genes.
The tool we developed meets these goals and has the following features:
Our tool can currently tell apart more than 80% of gene doping sequences from any other DNA.*
Our tool allows us to reduce the required guide RNAs to detect gene doping from 10104 to only 12 guide RNAs.
*Due to the implementation of a machine learning algorithm the tool will develop even better abilities towards distinguishing these sequences in the future.
1. Sequence Classification Tool
1.1 Method
Database set-up
There is a wide variety of genes that are potential targets for gene doping. Our main focus is on the Erythropoietin (EPO) gene, which is one of the genes that is most likely to be used for gene doping, according to professor Hidde Haisma, gene doping expert at the University of Groningen. Our software tool can easily be extended to any other gene. Our custom database contains three groups of reference sequences: endogenous human EPO DNA, gene doping EPO DNA and DNA from endogenous sources other than EPO.
Type of DNA
The reference sequences for normal human EPO DNA are the actual human EPO sequence ( Clark et. al., 2016 ) together with 300 sequences that we simulated with 6% false reads, which has been specified as the accuracy of the MinION device in the case of a single read-through that we use in our method ( Loman et al., 2015 ).
We loaded many possible gene doping EPO DNA sequences. To start these include human EPO cDNA ( Clark et. al., 2016 ) and its codon substituted versions around the junctions. We also included animal cDNA EPO sequences from Genbank ( Clark et. al., 2016 ) as possible EPO doping based on a suggestion by Eli van der Sluis, technician at the Bionanoscience Department at Delft University of Technology.
Furthermore, we included sequences designed by our team which involve further codon mutations. We do not include all codon substituted versions, because there would be roughly 10104 of those, which is computationally impossible to generate and unnecessary. Therefore,"

We know that the differential equations can describe the numerical relationships and patterns between related promoters. Based on these studies, we can make the better plan, central or prediction in the experiments.
We consider the tubulin length is the function of time, assembling rate, disaggregation and hydrolysis rate. According to the literature, there are some relationships between these promoters.
Details of Original Differential Equation Model
a. - Model Assumption
We only consider tree main phenomenon in the solution: disaggregation, aggregation and hydrolysis.
There are three types of dimers, Taxol-dimer, GTP-dimer and GDP-dimer. Only Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer, no matter they are dissociative or already fixed on the filament, can aggregate new Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer.
Especially, the difference between Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer is that new fixed aggregation Taxol-dimer will not disaggregate and become dissociative again.
According to literature [2] , every Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer may hydrolyze into GDP-dimer, which can no longer combine new dimers and growth.
b. - Parameter specification
c. - The explanation of the process
As we discussed in the modeling theory, we only consider three main phenomena: disaggregation, aggregation and hydrolysis.
Now we consider how these filaments growth specifically. At first, initial \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are added in the solution. Then they aggregate into filaments forms, including \(G_{11}\), \(G_{21}\), \(G_{12}\), \(G_{22}\)(the meaning of these parameters are specified in table above).  \(G_{11}\) and \(G_{21}\) can become \(G_{12}\) and \(G_{22}\) if new dimers are aggregated at the endpoint. Also \(G_{11}\)and \(G_{21}\) can disaggregate into the solution and become dissociative dimers (\(T_1\) and \(T_2\) again. If all the GTP-dimers at the endpoint become the GDP-dimers or there is not enough \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) in the solution, the growing process is stop.
The flow chart of this process can be illustrated as follow:
According to the flow chart, we can get the ODE equations as follow.
$\dot{T_1}=k_1 G_{11}-r_1(G_{11}+G_{21})$

The project was discussed with the Department of Environmental Health and Safety at our university, and a plan was devised for mercury waste disposal based on their input. General biosafety guidelines found at https://www.dehs.umn.edu/bio.htm, http://www.dehs.umn.edu/bio_pracprin.htm and http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl.pdf were followed.
Safety in the Lab
3. Risks of Your Project Now To mitigate risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab: Gloves are used in any protocol that utilizes Ethidium Bromide, including gel electrophoresis. Lab coat, gloves, and full face shields are used when cutting gel fragments in proximity of ultraviolet light.  For handling mercury, a lab coat, inner and outer (long cuffed) nitrile gloves, lab goggles and face shields will be used, and used materials will be disposed of by the University of Minnesota Department of Environmental Health and Safety. There are assigned incubators, hoods, and disposal containers for hazardous materials like mercury chloride.

Gold Medal Requirements
UMN iGEM has strived to produce Gold Medal level work through the duration of our project. Here we outline our work that specifically pertains to each of the gold medal requirements. Scroll to the right to see how we met each requirement!
Requirement 1: Improving function or characterization of an existing part
To compliment the UMN iGEM 2014 bioremediation project, we chose to improve the ""phsABC"" biological system first added to the registry by the Yale 2010 team (BBa_K393001). The operon produces hydrogen sulfide to allow for the biological precipitation of heavy metals, such as copper used for the Yale team's biological circuit. We sought to both improve and characterize the part for future utilization in our filtration device. To improve ""phsABC"", we added a modified lac promoter to allow for constitutive expression rather than IPTG induction within the biological system, and thus make it more applicable in a real world environmental setting where an induction strategy would be costly and inefficient for remediation purposes. We also improved the characterization of their part by testing its application for biological precipitation of Iron and Cadmium in addition to the Yale team's Copper"
