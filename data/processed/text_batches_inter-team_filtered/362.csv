Results
At the conclusion of our project we had created three working plasmids, all of which were sent to the parts registry.
Part BBa_K2522000 is a plasmid developed using the csgA gene extracted from the genomic DNA of E. coli Nissle, and a double cellulose binding domain taken from the iGEM DNA Distribution Kit. Theoretically, the plasmid should allow an E. coli bacterium to produce curli fibers with a double cellulose binding domain attached to each CsgA subunit so that the bacterium can encase itself in cellulose. However, while sequencing was completed to confirm our plasmid matched our theoretical design, no tests have been performed to validate a working construct yet (Ability to bind to cellulose, ect.)
Part BBa_K2522001 is a working construct developed to produce Super Folder Green Fluorescent Protein in the presence of the quorum sensing molecule 3OC12. The DNA is confirmed to work as theoretically planned through both sequencing and experiment.
Figure 1 This picture shows our plasmid produces a visible fluorescence in the presence of 3OC12
Part BBa_K2522002 is a plasmid designed to produce sfGFP in the presence of the quorum sensing molecule Auto Inducer 2 (AI-2). While confirmed to match our theoretical design via sequencing, due to time constraints only one experiment was performed. The plasmid was grown up overnight along with supernatant from a E.coli Nissle 1917 sample (which in theory should contain AI-2); however, the test was inconclusive due to contamination (bacterial growth in pure LB broth used as our blank)
We also characterized our two choices for green fluorescent protein: GFPa1 and sfGFP. Below are our results indicating that sfGFP is best for our project due to the short time taken to fluoresce (~ 4 hours to a visible level) and it’s use in a diagnostic environment that our plasmid would be used for.
In conclusion we:
Characterized and submitted 3 parts to the registry
Compared and characterized two of our GFPs

Results
These are the wells:
Lane 1 = blank
Lane 2 = HindIII DNA ladder
Lane 3 = BBa_C0056 mini-prep (from colony 1) digest
Lane 4 = BBa_C0056 mini-prep (from colony 2) digest
Lane 5 = BBa_C0056 mini-prep (from colony 3) digest
Lane 6 = BBa_B1002 mini-prep (from colony 1) digest
Lane 7 = BBa_B1002 mini-prep (from colony 2) digest
Lane 8 = BBa_B1002 mini-prep (from colony 3) digest
Lane 9 = BBa_R0077 mini-prep (from colony 1) digest
Lane 10 = BBa_R0077 mini-prep (from colony 2) digest
Lane 11 = BBa_R0077 mini-prep (from colony 3) digest
Lane 12 = HindIII DNA ladder
BBa_C0056 Mini-Prep digests
It can be seen the first set of three digested DNA samples, BBa_C0056, looks very consistent in band layout. The smaller fragment lies very near the 564bp fragment of the HindIII ladder (in fact is is slightly larger) and this size corresponds to the size of the cI repressor, which is 636bp. This means that this insert is correct.
The larger fragment lies above the 2322bp fragment of the ladder and could correspond to the pSB1A2 plasmid backbone which is 2079bp according to the Parts Registry. However the pSB1A2 plasmid which carries this BioBrick also has kanamycin resistance so the extra gene could be the reason why our backbone fragment is larger.
The kanamycin resistance gene is 814bp so if we add that number to the 2027bp pSB1A2 fragment, we get a plasmid backbone of 2893bp - this corresponds to what is seen in the gel.

Cooperation with Trieste
Like us, Trieste's team this year are using the BioBrick BBa_K392008 . This part by Osaka 2010 encodes a cellulase, β-glucosidase, from the bacterium Cellulomonas fimi. It is known to work in the lab of Chris French (Edinburgh's supervisor).
Chris French sent Trieste a copy of the plasmid, however they reported some sequence errors and asked us for comments. We sequenced the gene independently and discovered that an apparent frameshift is present near the start of the BioBrick. This very same ""frameshift"" was seen in Trieste's sequencing results.
Since a part with an early frameshift cannot possibly work, but the part does work, we looked for an explanation. Some 220 bases into the part, a second ATG codon is found. This codon is in-frame and there is a plausible ribosome binding site (containing ""gaagga"") just upstream of it. We therefore believe that this second ATG is the true start codon. The RBS would explain why the part can be expressed and work.
Here is the start of the sequence, with these features highlighted:

[rest omitted]
In agreement with this hypothesis, a recently published sequence of C. fimi β-glucosidase (labelled as such by Expasy though NCBI calls it a β-galactosidase) starts at the 2nd ATG codon of K392008. This is in contrast to an older published sequence .
We passed this information on to the Trieste team, who agreed that it is a likely explanation.
In addition to this, at the request of the Trieste team we sent details of an assay that can be used to"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," the external farm environment (Chase-Topping et al., 2008). These few super shedders are important factors to pre-harvest contamination as the source of 80% of O157:H7 strains isolated from beef carcasses are from the high cattle density and rapid turnover environment of the processing plant and transport trailers, not the original feedlot (Arthur et al., 2009).
We also met with and discussed E. coli markers with Dr. Glen Armstrong, professor and head of the Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Infectious Diseases at the University of Calgary. Dr. Armstrong suggested that we implement multiple TALEs to target different markers to identify E. coli serotypes.
Primers containing the target sequences of TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ), TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ), and variations of the target sequences (with point mutations in different positions) were used to perform a PCR on RFP generator ( BBa_J04450 ); the product of the PCR would be the target sequence of the TALE and a 660base pair part of the RFP gene (Figures 1, 2 and 3). The PCR products were purified and digested with XbaI and PstI and inserted into  a vector; RFP generator was also digested with XbaI and PstI to prepare the vector.
IPTG inducible promoter with RBS ( BBa_J04500 ) was transformed with competent cells and plated on Amp and Chlor.

This gel shows [B]5M1 and [B]5M7 which are the mutated first and seventh nucleotide from the 5' end of the TALE B target sequence, respectively. Every lane except for the tenth lane of shows bands at 650bp, the target sequence band is expected at 660bp. Some unexpected amplification is seen in all the lanes. Contamination is observed in the tenth lane. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," governed by the chemotactic       sensitivity function $\chi (S)$. For our model we used a function of the       form (8).
$$ \chi(S)=\mu \cdot \frac{\kappa}{S(\vec{r},t)} \;\;\; \text{(8)} $$
The first important thing to note is that we assume                         $\chi (S)$ to be proportional to $1/S$. This is because Keller and Segel proved that                         their corresponding PDE model only yields travelling wave solutions if $\chi (S)$       contains such a singularity at some critical concentration $S_{crit}$,       and multiplying by                         $1/S$ is the simplest way to introduce a singularity at $S_{crit} = 0$. Secondly, the                         proportionality constant is composed of two factors, namely the bacterial       diffusion coefficient $\mu$ and chemotactic sensitivity constant $\kappa$.       This is done for                         two reasons. Firstly, when $\mu$ is lowered, both chemotactic and random motion is                         reduced, which emulates the state of inactivated motility due to high or low                         concentrations of AHL. Secondly, defining a separate chemotactic sensitivity                         constant allows us to examine the effect of the relative strength of chemotaxis       versus random motion on pattern formation. Conceptually, this term can be       viewed as a sort        of chemotactic force, defined with regards to a mobility coefficient $\mu$       instead of a frictional coeffient, which are the inverse of each other.

In addition to chemotaxis and diffusion, cell-cell interactions play an                         important role in pattern formation and also need to be modeled. Bacteria have                         finite size and therefore multiple bacteria cannot occupy the same space.                         Moreover, an important mechanism in our system is the aggregation of cells A due                         to the sticky adhesin protein membrane. To take these mechanisms into account we                         modeled two types of cell-cell interactions: the purely repulsive interaction of                         cell B with another cell B and with cell A, and the attractive-repulsive                         interaction of cell A with another cell A. The interaction between two cells is                         usually expressed by a potential energy curve defined over the distance between       the centers of mass of the two cells (Figure 4).

Note that the potential energy                         remains constant after a certain distance, which means that the cells stop                         interacting. Also, as two cells move closer together, they hit a wall where the                         potential energy curve abruptly"

NAU-CHINA,2018,Team:NAU-CHINA#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," results also confirm preliminarily that our upstream circuit can work normally. However, we have to admit that due to we chosed GFP as our reporter gene, it is difficult to distinguish it from cell surface-expressed GFP. Our verification experiment is not intuitive. If we need to prove the function of TEV suppressing the inhibition of TetR strongly, further optimized experiments are still needed.
Downstream circuit
The downstream pathway is the core circuit for us to realize the threshold function. According to literature [3], they have verified the inversion function of the three recombinases in prokaryotic cells and proved the threshold function of the recombinases, i.e. the recombinases do not have the inversion function at low concentration. Only when the concentration of recombinase reaches a certain threshold, can the recombinases work normally.
According to the same document, we designed our pathway in eukaryotic cells, expecting to realize threshold switching in eukaryotic cells. For this reason, we try to test the inversion function of recombinases and the threshold characteristics of the combination of three different recombinases ( Bxb1, TP901, PhiC31 ) and three promoters with different intensities ( miniCMV, EF1 - α, Ubc ) in eukaryotic cells.
We also verify the function of RDF [4] to demonstrate our 0/1 switch resettable in HEK 293T cells.
Pronuclear verification of Bxb1 recombinase plasmid given by Peking University
Before the eukaryotic verification of the recombinases, we performed prokaryotic verification of Bxb1 recombinase.
Two plasmids with different resistances and origins of replication were used for function verification of the Bxb1 recombinase. One of them is a reporter gene plasmid, which uses the constitutive promoter J23119. The recombination site is located on both sides of the promoter: one side is sfGFP, and the other is mRFP. The other plasmid is a recombinase expression plasmid using PBAD, an inducible promoter, which is induced by arabinose. When the two plasmids were co-transfected into E. coli, the reporter plasmid expressed sfGFP, a kind of green fluorescent protein; when the inducer arabinose was added, the recombinant enzyme was expressed, the promoter was inverted, and the mRFP , a kind of red fluorescent protein, was expressed.

Figure 10.A graph of the intensity of CFP fluorescence at different wavelengths ranging from 440 - 500 nm where the samples were excited at 410 nm. The samples of E. coli were transformed by the B-M + CFP BioBrick and grown overnight in different concentrations of potassium nitrate (0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM) before being lysed in order to release proteins from the cells for fluorometer analysis.
The graph above shows the flourescence measured from the expression of eCFP due to the response of the bacterial-mammalian promoter to  different concentrations of potassium nitrate.  The wavelength reading which corresponds to eCFP is between 440-500nm.  The graph clearly demonstrates that between 0mN and 15mM there is a proportional relationship between fluorescence intensity and potassium nitrate concentration. There appears to be a sharp increase in fluorescence intensity between 5mM and 10mM, and the rate at which intensity increase gradually decreases so that there is only a small increase between 15mM and 20mM.

The graph clearly demonstrates that between 0mN and 15mM there is a proportional relationship between fluorescence intensity and potassium nitrate concentration. It can be noted that at a 20mM concentration the intensity of fluorescence sharply decreases back down to the level of 5mM potassium nitate concentration. This may be due to the cell overexpressing eCFP up to the point at which the excess protein begins to form inclusion bodies which can no longer fluoresce; alternatively, this could be due the potassium nitrate concentration reaching the critical concentration at which it becomes toxic to the cell. This data differs to the readings taken"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," our project, we wanted to integrate the use of tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) which are able to maintain the functionality of other proteins upon desiccation. This fitted perfectly in our design with respect to our end-users, as our TDPs enable the transportation and storage of our detection tool at room temperature. Normally, protein function can be maintained when stored at -80 degrees celsius, something that is not always available at your local dairy farm! We also envisioned that this improved storage method will be advantageous for shipping our versatile RNA-detection tool for broader applications. For further information on our TDPs, check out our TDP design page .
Adding to the storability, we realised that our tool needed to give a readout visible to the naked eye. At a farm, there are no fancy lasers or microscopes, so we had to get creative! We started by designing a microfluidics paper chip with GMOs with a kill switch to detect resistance genes, but gained crucial feedback on this.
Even if GMO kill switches were reliable, there is no public acceptance to use GMOs in the environment. If it will be accepted in the future, it will take years from now to legislate this principle. Innovation based on this gets stuck.
Cecile van der Vlugt (Risk Assessor GMO)
This led us to come up with a new application: CINDY-Seq. This method allows for a simple yes or no answer to the question: is the pathogen causing mastitis in my cow resistant to penicillins, or even all β-lactamases depending on the design of Cas13a, in a matter of hours, without the use of GMOs in the environment. For more information on how CINDY-Seq works, please visit our coacervation design page .
Now that we completed the design of our detection tool, we needed to look at how we could make the sample preparation as simple as possible for a farmer, as farmers like to do most things themselves.
We try to do most things by ourselves to prevent high bills from the veterinarian.
Tjerkje Poppinga (dairy farmer)
In the case of mastitis, the pathogen is present in the milk of the infected cow. By hitting the books and optimising existing protocols, we came up with an easy method to prepare a fresh milk sample for the detection tool. To know more about which methods we came up with, look at our sample prep design page where we describe this extensively.

”The G7 has discussed AMR twice in a row, and it has also been discussed in their climate forum. Now, the G20 is trying to make a group with other countries for push and pull: push being the research effort, and the pull is prizes or tax breaks. The CIHR contributed more into the pull, and the JPIAMR is a group of mostly European funders which is trying to fund internationally. Committees are being put together every week for AMR, which means there’s a lot of stakes in it... Challenges in developing countries are that the health systems are not the same; here in Canada I think it’s reasonable, and we can use authorities to help. Some other places this system is broken, so resistant infections can spread further and complicate things. This is where I see some of the challenges. The technology we develop nearly impossible to make in low-income countries... The health systems [are] broken.” - Dr. Marc Ouellette, CIHR
Segueing into talks of Stewardship, the heart of this AMR pillar lay in “[giving] antibiotics to the people who need them, and the right one at the right time. It’s an art, not a science, when they look at you feeling terrible.” Having known Dr. Nick Daneman’s work surrounding the auditing of prescribers of antibiotics, Dr. Ouellette explained to us that he believed in targeting both the prescribers and the patients.
“Sometimes antibiotics save lives, remember that. It’s just like washing your hands — it’s the public and the healthcare worker. Except, this situation has dire consequences. Antibiotics are absolutely necessary, but sometimes they’re not. You’re a parent and you haven’t slept for three days, so you try to convince your GP to give your child antibiotics. But what if you knew that your child’s immune system could be harmed? It’s only recently that we found antibiotics would harm your good bacteria, your microbiome, and we had no idea the role that plays in the immune system at a young age. A young baby in the first 6 months of its life: this is where antibiotics are life-saving, but also the worst. So education for all partners would help.”
Finally, Dr. Ouellette foresaw future research in this field in Canada as being able to fill the niches in AMR research gaps. Dr. Gerry Wright’s research on using molecules to help circumvent resistance was specifically mentioned, alongside immunology and alternatives"

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the quantity or application of latex in this case will trigger such reaction, but it must be noted as a consideration nonetheless.
Interactions
The impact this technology will have on other processes is not extreme. The most significant impact that can be expected is a loss of employment. Current industry best practice requires significant labour input to hand check fruit for firmness/ripeness. A capacity to cheaply and accurately use ethyele measurements as a proxy for fruit ripeness would mean that industry would be able to significantly reduce labour requirements. A cheaper, faster and potentially more accurate method for determining the stage of ripening in fruit would also potentially mean that produce imports and exports will increase as the risk associated with produce wastage due to rotting/spoilage/over-ripening during international shipments will decrease. Increased global fruit movements could potentially increase the risks associated with cross-border biocontamination. This could be combatted by strict border quarantine routines.  Another potential disruption comes to mind when assessing the future areas of research that stem from this proposal. Once ethylene measurement has been optimized and made practical, accurate and easy, there is the potential that ethylene manipulation will be more prevalent. That is, an easy measuring system will allow for more accurate and dynamic manipulation of ethylene levels. In general, this would be expected to mean less waste across the perishable fruit and vegetable supply chains. Spoilage leads to losses globally of up to 50% of fresh produce, depending on the type of produce. An ability to cheaply and accurately measure ethylene may help producers, retailers and consumers in developed and developing countries to significantly reduce fruit and vegetable losses.
Environmental Impact
Positives
There are many positive environmental impacts of our biotechnology. From an application point of view, minimizing produce wastage results in less landfill, less garbage, and a higher return on agricultural land. Also, the stickers are 100% biodegradable, meaning that their environmental footprint it extremely low as they will break down completely. Designing the stickers to be biodegradable rather than recyclable is much more practical as consumers are much more likely to dispose of the sticker with their fruit scraps in a normal bin, rather than separating the sticker to dispose of for recycling.
Negatives
It can be argued that individual labelling of produce adds unnecessarily to the waste stream. Individually, the stickers would be small, but cumulatively the millions that would potentially be used, even if they are biodegradable, add to the environmental impact of fruit production. This can be weighed against the reduction in food waste that is expected to flow from better control of rip"

iGEM CC
The iGEM China Community
With the motivation of better communication between teams in China, USTC and SYSU initiated an online community among teams from China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We named it iGEM China Community (iGEMCC).
Our goal
Our goal is to build an online community with all the Chinese teams. We all know that the number of teams from China is very large, which take up around a quarter of all the teams this year. That means one quarter of the iGEMers are speaking Chinese and we didn’t have an online community widely used by all Chinese iGEMers. We think that if all the team can participate in the construction processes of the community, it can become a more popular platform among all the Chinese iGEMers, and more students can benefit from this platform.
Progress
We started to contact other teams at the beginning of April and got many feedback from other teams. At first, we send an invitation letter to other teams’ contacts, inviting them to build this online community together. Many teams who joint us are very kind to contact more teams for us. Only with all the teams working together, can us able to build a QQ group for discussion with many representative from around 30 teams. So far, we have a QQ group with more than 150 iGEMers in it and the number is still growing.
Zhang Zhen (from USTC) and Liu Minsheng (from HSAAHNU_Anhui), built a website ( http://igemcc.org/ ) introducing some basic information of this iGEM China Community. Zhang Zhen (from USTC) and Han Jia (from JLU), are in charge of collecting contact information. Wu Yifan (from HIT) wrote a proposal for raising donations.
It is our honor to have many former iGEMers to give us advice. Many teams also have great ideas and very activate on the QQ group.

CDS
Forward Primer for BioBrick
Procedures
1. Input the first 24nt of the CDS of the gene you would like to knockdown.
2. The sequence of forward primer is shown.
3. The sequence of reverse primer is 5-tcaagaactctgtagcaccgcc-3.
4. Perform PCR using primers given by the program. The template must be BBa_K1124112 on the plasmid backbone pSB1C3, pSB1A3, or pSB1AK3.
5. Cut the PCR product by Xba1 and Pst1, and ligate it with backbone.
6. (Alternative to Procedure 5) Cut the PCR product by Xba1 and Pst1, and the promoter part on a plasmid backbone by Spe1 and Pst1. Ligate these digests and you will get the full constructed part that expresses sRNA sufficient to knockdown the gene of your choice.
Program 2
When you perform PCR with primers designed by Program 2 using BBa_K1124123.as the template, you will get the PCR product like the diagram below.
The PCR product is the full constructed part that expresses sRNA sufficient to knockdown the gene of your choice. You never have to digest and ligate the plasmid before E. coli transformation.

1. Input the first 24nt of the CDS of the gene you would like to knockdown.
2. The sequences of forward primer and the reverse primer are shown.
3. Perform inverse PCR with using primers given by the program. The template is BBa_K1124123 . There is no restriction on the plasmid backbone. You must use DNA polymerase with no displacement activity nor 5f¨3fexonuclease activity.
4. The PCR product is a plasmid with nicks. Transform E. coli with the PCR product and the plasmid will expresses sRNA sufficient to knockdown the gene of your choice.
Application
Acceleration of Biosynthesis of L-DOPA
In order to make E. coli produce L-DOPA, we made hpaBC (encoding the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase) BioBrick parts by cloning it from E. coli BL21 strain. HpaBC catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyrosine and produces L-DOP"

The curve of downstream gene expression can be easily modified either by simply changing a transcription factor, or by altering the binding affinity between the DNA sequence and the transcription factor. The reporter, on the other hand, can be any kind of drugs for unique situations of different patients.
Being a highly modular transducer engineering platform and able to meet needs of various kinds of cancer patients, STEP will definitely be the best choice for cell therapy.

Harvard,2009,Team:Harvard#Daily_-_-_TEXT.html,"rxn 1). We could not just digest the citrine out because there is no upstream restriction site available. PCR with these primers will result in the addition of a NheI site on the end of the vector fragment near the promoter (to be ligated to the N terminus of the fusion protein), and a SexAI site on the end far from the promoter (to be ligated to the c terminus of the fusion protein) b. In order to obtain the Nfluc fragment (1-398), we will PCR out that fragment via rxn 2 for green luciferase and rxn 3 for red luciferase. The primers for these two variants of luciferase are identical; the color determining point mutations are all located in this N terminal fragment in the aa 240-250 range; they do not affect the primers. This will produce an Nfluc fragment framed by an NheI site on the N terminus and a Kpn1 site on the c terminus.  c. In order to obtain the PhyB fragment, we will PCR it out of the florida plasmids via rxn 6. This is just the N terminus of the PhyB, residues 1-621, chosen to reduce background, as in our other experiments. This will produce an PhyB fragment framed by an KpnI site on the N terminus and a SexAI site on the c terminus.  2. Post-PCR processing a. All fragments will be purified using a PCR cleanup column 3.  Restriction digests a. Vector backbone will be digested for 1 hr at 37 degrees with NheI and SexAI, Buffer 4 or 1 with BSA.  b.

iGEM Stockholm 2010
We are a group of undergraduate students studying life science with professors as mentors at Stockholm University. This is our website about our work and effort in representing our school as Team Stockholm in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition against other teams from all over the world.
iGEM is an international research competition focused on synthetic biology. Each team is given a kit containing biological parts for practical work, which takes place at each teams' university. The use of these biological parts in combination with self-designed parts, will lay the ground for building innovative and useful new biological systems and operate them in living cells.
This competition opens for students to think “out of the box” when engineering living organisms to be applied as tools for solving problems in healthcare, bioenergy, chemical and material production and bioremediation, to name a few.
The principles in the field of synthetic biology is to combine science and engineering in order to genetically design and build living cells with novel biological roles and systems, aimed at overcoming the obstacles in modern life.
Stay tuned for daily updates in the run up to the finals at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)!

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Notebook#Journal#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html," due to problems with the vector. The ligation of Pfet3-mig1 in Tadh1-pSB failed. Sadly, there is not enough time left to assemble the complete system thus the ligation was not repeated.
Again this week: transformation of Panb1-mOrange-pTUM and Psuc2-mOrange-pTUM in the repressor deficient strains. Varying the time of the heat shock helped a lot! Panb1 required a heat shock of 90min to have good results compared to the 30min in standard operating protocol. We have also tansformed luc-pTUM104 in W303 wildtype yeast, but time is running out for the characterization of Luciferase...!
Week 24
Our first try to observe mOrange-fluorescence in the Tecan-Reader worked surprisingly well. Measurement in water is much better than in medium since YPD as well as synthetic complete drop out mediu have high self-fluorescence in the range of 500-600nm. We will need to perform a LIM induction over at least 8h for characterizing Pfet-mOrange. Overnight cultures in LIM did not grow at all and within shorter times (3-4h) no results were seen. Luckily, we finally found a terminator (also a Tadh1 derivative, BBa_K801012) which was already shipped with this year's distribution kit! Unfortunately, the part was neither marked as available nor as working. Why didn't we find this part earlier?! We lost almost three weeks waiting for Tadh1! Ligations of the most important 3A-Assemblies in Tadh-pSB (Padh-mPR X.l., GAL-Mig, Pfet-Mig, Pfet-mOrange, Psuc-mOrange) worked well.
Week 23
Thie week we were still desperately looking for a working and easily available yeast terminator because we had completed all useful assemblies of promotor and coding sequence. This week we started to introduce our new parts in pSB1C3 for shipping and archivation. We are planning to send seven parts to the registry, among them our membrane progestin receptors and the iron inducible Pfet3. Also, two complete inverter systems consisting of mig1+Psuc2 and rox1+Panb1! The first transformation of our plasmids in yeast worked, so we could mount our first yeast for microscopy. We were very pleased to see a bright signal for Padh1-mOrange-pTUM. Nevertheless the promotor actvity of Psuc2 was"

I am a microbiologist at the university of Grenoble. In the past, I have combined biophysics, molecular biology and bacteriology to understand the functioning of Escherichia coli. More recently, in a systems biology approach, I have used precise measurements of gene expression to test predictions of mathematical models of the corresponding regulatory system. Synthetic biology, and thus iGEM, is the next step in understanding biological systems: if we really understand the functioning of a system, we can modify its behavior. In iGEM we move from designing a desired behavior to instantiating the network in the real organism: a formidable challenge in"

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," will build our first prototype. To make this possible we will need experts with experience in the field of solar panels. There are multiple research groups within the university that possibly could be interested in a cooperation.  We  would also prefer to  collaborate with an industrial partner. Then this partner would be our first tier and we could develop a strong relationship.
Safety & Certification
The microlens arrays will be produced with the help of genetically modified bacteria. When we want to introduce our product in applications outside the lab, it has to meet very strict and specific safety requirements. In the Netherlands, the RIVM assesses safety applications and it is important to contact them in an early stadium. If we collaborate with foreign industrial partners or if our product will eventually be used in foreign countries, it is important to meet the requirement of those countries as well.
Manufacturing
When the final prototype is built, we can start the construction of the manufacturing facilities. Prior thereto, we have to develop a manufacturing process. In this stadium we also will make, with reservation, agreements with suppliers of production equipment and suppliers of raw materials.
Customers & Partners
To make a company successful, it needs customers. We will start contacting potential customers and partners in an early phase. We strive for a first tier that is involved in the development phase.
Financing
To build the final prototype, implement the product, etc. we have to acquire an estimated budget of €1.2 million. We are planning to acquire this budget with among other things grants from the government, the university, and with loans.
Obtaining intellectual Property
To protect the invention, it has to be patented. We have developed the product in collaboration with the TU Delft. Based on the requirements of the TU Delft, this automatically means that they will partly be the owner of the intellectual property.
Milestones
One of the critical points for the startup will be the construction of a working prototype. Furthermore, the acquisition of funding to construct among other things the manufacturing facilities are very important. Finally it is of the utmost importance that we will find our first customers, the so called first tier.
Please find below the detailed Roadmap for the startup phase of our company. This phase consists of 4 years (Figure 6).
Figure 6: Roadmap for the startup phase of BioLens.
Risk Analysis
Just as every research project, every company and especially every startup has certain risks that they will encounter. It is important to be aware of these risks and to think about what can happen, how likely is it that it will happen and if it does happen,"
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," orthogonality of regulatory sequences.
Conclusion
The three proof of concept experiments presented above - mutant library activity and sequencing recording, ribosome binding site strength determination and toehold regulatory sequence cross-interaction evaluation - conclude that CAT-Seq catalytic activity sequencing workflow is a precise and high throughput method to screen millions of catalytic or regulatory molecules that allows to precisely link the measured absolute phenotypic data to the sequenced genotype."

USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#WhatDemo_-_-_TEXT.html,"-the ability to reset themselves after responding to a stimulus.. Actually, most of the scripts are cited from a newly published paper on Cell : Defining Network Topologies that Can Achieve Biochemical Adaptation . It 's quite by accident that issues discussed in this paper share some similarities with our project. To test our ABCD is powerful or not, the only thing we need to do is to search the two topologies found in this paper. By running nearly two days, we prove the solution.
Mathematical Formulation
We assume that each node (labeled as <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>C</math>) has a fixed concentration (normalized to <math>1</math>) but has two forms: active and inactive (here <math>A</math> represents the concentration of active state, and <math>1-A</math> is the concentration of the inactive state). The enzymatic regulation converts its target node between the two forms. For example, a positive regulation of node <math>B</math> by node <math>A</math> as denoted by a link
<math>A\longrightarrow B</math>
would mean that the active <math>A</math> convertsBfrom its inactive to its active form and would be modeled by the rate
<math>R(B_{inactive}\longrightarrow B_{active})=k_{AB}A(1-B)/\left[ (1-B)+K_{AB}\right] </math>,
where <math>A</math> is the normalized concentration of the active form of node <math>A</math> and <math>1-B</math> the normalized concentrations of the inactive form of node B. Likewise, <math>A-|B</math> implies that the active A catalyzes the reverse transition of node B from its active to its inactive form, with a rate
<math>R(B_{active}\longrightarrow B_{inactive})=k_{AB}^{^{\prime }}/(B+K_{AB}^{^{\prime }}).</math>
When there are multiple regulations of the same sign on a node, the effect is additive. For example, if node C is positively regulated by node A and node B,
<math> R(C_{inactive}\longrightarrow C_{active})= k_{AC}A(1-C)/\left[ (1-C)+K_{AC}\right]</math> + <math>k_{BC}B(1-C)/\left[ (1-C)+K_{BC}\right] </math> .
We assume that the interconversion between active"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe.
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
1.We use ethidium bromide to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories and it is thought to  act as mutagen because it intercalates double stranded DNA, which indicates that it can be toxic.
2.E.coli may have little effect on human health.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No.E.coli in our lab has nearly no difference with normal innocuous E.coli in nature.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No.E.coli in our lab has nearly no difference with normal innocuous E.coli in nature.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
The leakage of high -rate mutation bacteria may cause variety of problem to public and its result might be catastrophic. Unpredictable diseases caused by the bacteria we structured through mutation may lead to disastrous results,though the possibility of this extreme situation is tiny.
5.If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product,

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Project#Salicylate Inducible System_-_-_TEXT.html,"0 is added.
The Color Switch system design
The supD suppressor t-RNA
Given that the linker that separates both FwYellow and AeBlue chromoproteins is composed of serine and glycine amino-acid, we needed a t-RNA suppressor that could encode one of these amino-acids to not alter the properties of the linker. As we were looking for a t-RNA suppressor, we found that the iGEM Beijing 2009 team already worked on a translational suppression system. They worked with the supD suppressor t-RNA that encodes a serine making it an ideal candidate for our project. They placed supD under control of a salicylate inducible promoter Psal to suppress amber codon they had introduced in the T7 polymerase sequence. In turn, the T7 polymerase can express the GFP output gene. Their results show that supD does not induce bacteria lethality so such a system could be used [2].
Transcription factor sensible to salicylate
The nahR gene is involved in the degradation of the naphthalene pollutant in Pseudomonas putida. This gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that is induce by salicylate and thus bind nah or sal promoters. The BBa_K228004 Biobrick® contains the nahR gene under control of a constitutive promoter and the salicylate promoter (Psal). Thus, we plan to place supD under control of the Psal promoter.
Color switch mechanism
In the beginning, salicylate concentration will be maximal into the agar media so that supD will be expressed and so the green fusion chromoprotein: bacteria will display a green color. However, as bacteria grow into agar, less salicylate will remain available into the media. Thus, the decrease of the nahR-salicylate complex amount within bacteria will lead to supD downregulation through time. In turn, decrease of supD amount will result in less codon readthrough and so less translation of the green fusion protein and more translation of the yellow chromoprotein. As a result, bacteria will gradually change from green to yellow.
Results
To save time the fusion chromoprotein gene was ordered to Lifetechnologies® company.  It includes the suffix, the promoter, the RBS, the FwYellow’s open reading frame, the linker, the AeBlue’s open reading frame, the terminator and the prefix. As a first step, the linker did not bear the two amber codons so that we could know if the fusion chromoprotein"

OD calibration
Aim
We have calibrated the absorbance at 600nm (O.D.600) with the colony forming units. This allows us to approximate our absorbance data into a cell count number. We can now normalise fluorescence data to obtain the fluorescence produced per cell.
Experimental procedure
Cells were grown overnight in incubator at 225rpm shaking.
In the morning, the OD was measured using a multi-well plate reader.
The cell solution was then diluted to form a range of OD values.
Each OD solution was diluted down and plated on agar plates overnight.
The colonies were then counted the next morning.
We performed the experiment and further reruns with 2-3 repeats per OD value and for 2 different dilutions.
Results
Conclusions
We are now able to correlate the OD measured on the multiwell plate reader to the actual number of colony forming units.  This allows us to normalise fluorescence data.

The PCR amplicons of Gblock 1 and 2 and pACYCDuet-1 were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4 μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
The gel image shows that the pACYCDuet-1 backbone for Gblock1 and Gblock2 cloning is succesfully amplified. However, the Gblocks 1 and 2 are not correctly amplified as there is a smeer visible.

Figure 3 - Bacteria growth under phage predation. In models where the quantitative values differ, there is still qualitative information that can be extracted.
Figure 4 - A better fit for bacteria growth under phage predation. Also included are the predicted infected and uninfected populations.
Product Formation
For a given uninfected bacteria $X_u$ that can produce the product $P$, we will first expect the production rate to be first order equation: \begin{align} \frac{d[P]}{dt} = \frac{\mu_{X_u}}{Y_P}X_u \end{align} Where $Y_P$ is the yield coefficient of the product. For infected bacteria we expect the product formation rate to be negligibly small.
Extending to Co-culture
The end goal of our project is to tune product formation of two or more compounds by adding phage to a batch reactor. Our extension to co-cultures considers the situation where vanillin and cinnamaldehyde strains have both been engineered with ""CRISPR immunity"" to an environmental phage. Additionally, the vanillin producing strain has been engineered with immunity to a control phage, whereas the cinnamaldehyde is susceptible. Since both strains contain the CRISPR assembly and an engineered metabolic pathway, it is not entirely unreasonable to assume that their growth rates are similar. Let our bacterial cultures be $X$ for cinnamaldehyde and $Z$ for vanillin. Our equations become:
$ \left\{   \begin{array}{l l} &\frac{dX}{dt} = \frac{dX_i}{dt} + \frac{dX_u}{dt} \\ &\frac{dZ}{dt} = \frac{dZ_i}{dt} + \frac{dZ_u}{dt} \\ &\frac{dX_u}{dt} = \big( \mu_{X, u}e^{-\big(\frac{X}{X_c}\big)^m} - k_{d_{X,u}} \big) X_u\big(1 - e^{-\alpha t}\big) \\ &\frac{d"

I know that this list is meaningless right now to the outside reader. We are going to elaborate on this more in the wiki in other places when the tool stabilizes. The point is that we are quickly surpassing what APE can do. The long term goal is to phase out APE's usage from Anderson Lab and introduce local parts repositories there which Clotho can help manage.
Week of June 29th, 2008
The last thing I really wanted to work on regarding the basic pieces of the tool before I fade into the background and work more on interchange and part repository issues is to finish aspects of the dynamic indexing of the sequence view. This is heavily influenced by APE. This seemed to be popular so why try and reinvent the wheel. This took a day of work in Java and I think there are some aspects which I can use about how this differs for APE (i.e. the row indices are in a JTextField and not JLabels) that will offer more functionality later. In the current form it is a functional (i.e. good enough) sequence view. Our focus should not be on working much more on this but rather adding new views of the design (functional and architectural).
Second pass at Clotho's sequence view
Week of July 13th, 2008
This week consisted primarily of two testing sessions of Clotho with the UC Berkeley wet team. Both sessions were very successful and we received a lot of good feedback. The most rewarding part is that they did not find many bugs and the ones that they did find are very easy to implement/fix. Naturally there is a lot of work to do but we have a proof of concept feature for the majority of the various Clotho pieces. Our official alpha release is set for July 26th! We will see how things go. This next week will consist of chasing down bugs and cleaning up"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html,"lnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," voltage around 2.0v, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Proof of concept
Demonstrate your work
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

Equipment
50 EZ-10 Column
1.5mL microfuge tube
Procedure
Transfer PCR reaction mixture to a 1.5mL microfuge tube and add 5 volumes of Buffer B3.
Note: please ensure isopropanol has been added to Buffer B3 prior to use.
Transfer the above mixture solution to the EZ-10 column and let it stand at room temperature for 2 minutes. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 2 minutes.
Remove the flow-through in the tube. Add 750μL of Wash Solution to the column and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 2 minutes.
Repeat washing procedure in step 3. Spin at 10,000 rpm for an additional minute to remove any residual Wash Solution.
Transfer the column into a clean 1.5mL microfuge tube and add 30-50μL Elution Buffer to the center of the column. Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 2 minutes to elute the DNA.
Incubating the column with the Elution Buffer at a higher temperature (37°C to 50°C) may slightly increase the yield, especially of large (> 10,000 bp) DNA plasmids.
Prewarming the Elution Buffer at 55°C to 80°C may also slightly increase elution efficiency.
Store purified DNA at -20°C.
Leaving the lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
Wipe down your workspace.
Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.

In our experiments, we established a method that can be used to quantitatively evaluate the parts such as binding domains and binding proteins. In the official part registry, binding proteins are assembled in a group, but in their characterization, most of them are characterized by qualitative or semi-quantitative methods. There is no standardized quantitative method for characterization, thus it is also impossible to compare their functions. To solve this problem, this year we have developed a device that can quantitatively display the degree of binding strength by shear force. Subsequently, we developed kinds of standard methods to analyze the shedding rate according to each situation to achieve quantitative analysis of the binding protein. Maybe this is a breakthrough from 0 to 1.
The system we have established is divided into two parts: 1. The selection of interference and the establishment of interference intensity standard; 2. The quantification of the mixed algae-bacteria symbiotic system.
""The selection of interference and the establishment of standard"" has the following advantages:
1. If the same standard is used, the intensity of different binding proteins or binding domains can be quantitatively measured. The method is verified by experiments and shows repeatability, so the obtained data is comparable.
2. Since only the method of establishing standard system is specified, if the system does not apply to the standard we have established, the standard suitable for the system can be found by determined method, which greatly broadens the application range of the method, and theoretically our method can measure all the binding strength of binding protein or binding domain. This provides a standardized and quantitative means of detection for teams that will use related parts in the future.
3. The interference we selected has actual physical meaning. The shear force is the force of the actual water flow acting on the membrane, which is the force directly acting on the binding protein, so it is conducive to the subsequent modeling and mechanism analysis.
4. It can also be used to quantitatively assess the strength of other biofilms, such as the stability of biofilms formed by certain caries-related bacteria. Due to the complexity of our"
UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," drawback of the buffer was its enzymatic activity of 50% for PstI, so to account for this, we doubled the amount of enzyme used. We then double digested the Psb1C3 backbone and both the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Delta7) gene and the adrenodoxin-NADP+ reductase (ADR) gene, which we then ligated together to create a plasmid.
Over the weekend our final Y. lipolytica plating showed a large amount of growth, indicating that our old stock was indeed competent. Our E. coli amplification, however, showed no growth. It was found that this was because of an error in the media used. To save time, we thawed our previous glycerol stock of transformed cells and used it to inoculate a culture for outgrowth and plasmid isolation. DNA yields of this culture were lower than previous amplifications. We reasoned that this was due to the glycerol stock not having been plated on selective media before freezing. This would have resulted in some population of non-transformants existing in the stock and lowering plasmid yields. To remedy this, we plated our glycerol stock on selective media to isolate colonies and inoculated cultures with these colonies. We left these cultures to incubate over the weekend.
We began PCR experiments to amplify our riboswitch inserts in anticipation of our Gibson Assembly trials. Trials initially showed mixed results, which was perplexing since all PCR trials used the same primers and overhangs, but were confirmed as successful on 0.8% agarose gels by the end of the week. Nanodrop analysis gave the following concentrations of PCR products in the table below.
We also began out first Gibson Assembly experiments with our amplified inserts and linearized plasmid backbone. After this, we used PCR to confirm the presence of our pOPPY_GFP plasmids by using two of our Sanger sequencing primers and running the generated amplicons against a ladder on a 1.5% agarose gel. We also attempted a series of transformations of E. coli using our 5 Gibson Assembly products.
We also sent off our first samples for Sanger sequencing at the UC Berkeley DNA sequencing facility. With results coming in at the end of the week. Our reads indicated that our GFP gene was functional with no detected SNPs that would hinder our experiments.
We did our first yeast miniprep to test the effectiveness of our outlined miniprep procedures. The resulting Nanodrop curve was ragged and lacked the attributes of pl"

To make navigation as easy as possible, we've used the default iGEM pages and spent a long time thinking about the structure of the rest of our site. The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .

Co-culture
Overview :
G.xylinus and E.coli belong to the Gram-negative bacteria, and G.xylinus can secrete bacterial cellulose,which has great potential in many areas. In order to reach the diferent demand of nutrition and carbon source, we have finnished exploring the better growing together environment for both bacterials. And then, we have made G.xylinus and E.coli growing in the Co-culture media together and get BC membrane after a week inoculated.
Key Achievements
Create the Co-culture system.
Find a better inoculation ratio and carbon source.
Testing all of the parts working and get BC membrane datas.
Create a response surface modelling in the Co-culture system.
Improvement :
Optimized co-culture media can increase the yield of BC by16.7%
Optimized culture media can shorten the time for G.xylinus to produce the same amount of BC than the original one.
G.xylinus
Overview :
The biosynthesis pathway of bacterial cellulose in Gluconacetobacter xylinus is complicated including the synthesis of cellulose precursor, polymerization of glucan monomers and assembly of glucan chains.
Bacterial cellulose has great potential in many areas, including water purification, tissue scaffolds, wound dressings, etc., however, until now, all bacterial cellulose-based materials have been created using chemical or physical post-production processing, not genetic engineering,and the yield of BC's is also low. According to our finding that the yield of BC was higher than that of G.xylinus cultured individually when cultured with E.coli at pH=5.We have overcome the numerous difficulties associated with G.xylinus genetic engineering, and we mainly do the following two aspects of work :
overexpress  key gene of PGM：ptimize the metabolic pathway of Gluconacetobacter xylinus., redirecting more carbon sources into the production of bacterial cellulose
Overexpress key gene of c-di-GMP: increase the production of cellulose synthase.

We define the complexity of the tree \(\omega(f)\). Therefore we redefine our tree \(f(x)\) as  $$f_t(x) = w_{q(x)}, w \in R^T, q:R^d\rightarrow \{1,2,\cdots,T\}\\$$  \(w\) is the vector of scores on the leaves, \(q\) is a function which assigns each data point to the corresponding leaf and \(T\) is equal to the number of leaves. This allows us to formulate the complexity as: $$\Omega(f) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \sum_{j=1}^T w_j^2\\$$ Now we just need to formulate the objective function for the t-th tree: $$\begin{split}\text{obj}^{(t)} &\approx \sum_{i=1}^n [g_i w_{q(x_i)} + \frac{1}{2} h_i w_{q(x_i)}^2] + \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \sum_{j=1}^T w_j^2\\ &= \sum^T_{j=1} [(\sum_{i\in I_j} g_i) w_j + \frac{1}{2} (\sum_{i\in I_j} h_i + \lambda) w_j^2 ] + \gamma T\end{split}\\$$ Finally, but most importantly, we formulate the Gain function which optimizes one tree at a time. More precisely, it splits a leaf into two leaves and calculates the gain: $$Gain = \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{G_L^2}{H_L+\lambda}+\frac{G_R^2}{H_R+\lambda}-\frac{(G_L+G_R)^2}{H_L+H_R+\lambda}\right] - \gamma\\$$ The gain function contains the score on the new left leaf, the new right leaf, the original leaf and the regularization term on the additional leaf.

Results Part 1 - Codon Security
We first tested the Codon Security hypothesis with the GFP test plasmid. We cloned the synthesized GFP+tRNA construct into pSB1C3. We initially tried to transform it into DH5-alpha cells, but effeciency was very low. Sequencing of the growing colonies showed interesting deletions or mutations in the tRNA portion of the construct, giving some evidence supporting our hypothesis that the tRNA was able to be expressed but toxic to the cells. We then BioBricked the GFP and tRNA portions separately. The GFP with 2 stop codons but no tRNA (GFP-2S) was stably transformed into DH5-alpha and amberless cells, and as expected, neither cell-type had fluorescent colonies. The tRNA biobrick could not be cloned in DH5-alpha cells; all colonies came back with mutations in the tRNA, further supporting the idea that non-amberless cells cannot tolerate the supP tRNA. We could only biobrick the tRNA in the Amberless chassis.
We were then able to generate amberless clones that had the full sequence-verified GFP-2S+tRNA construct in pSB1C3. These were significantly fluorescent, compared to the amberless with just the GFP-2S that had no measurable fluorescence. This demonstrated that the supP tRNA was expressed and translated UAG codons into leucine to produce the complete protein product. We then took a fluorescent amberless GFP-2S+tRNA clone, miniprepped the construct, and attempted a heat-shock transformation under the exact same conditions for competent DH5-alpha and amberless cells. Although there were more successful transformants in the amberless plate, both plates had visibly fluorescing cells. In order to accurately compare GFP expression, we grew one fluorescent clone from DH5-alpha and amberless for flow cytometry analysis.
Figure 4. Flow cytometry histogram showing that Amberless cells with the GFP-2S+tRNA construct strongly express GFP, while DH5-alpha cells have a mixed population of low-expressing and non-expressing cells.
Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that GFP expression is 40X greater in amberless E. coli than in wild type E. coli given they both have the supP tRNA . The wild type cells with the GFP-2S serve as a negative control. In wild type cells that contain the GFP-2S and supP tRNA, fluorescence is observed in"

Heat block or water bath capable of 60°C
Microcentrifuge capable of at least 13,000 x g
Vortexer
Nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
100% ethanol
Optional: 5M Sodium Acetate, pH 5.2
Optional: Sterile deionized water
Before starting:
Prepare SPW Wash Buffer according to the "" Preparing Reagents"" section.
Set heating block or water bath to 60°C
Note: The yellow color of the Binding Buffer (XP2) signifies a pH of ≤ 7.5.
Perform agarose gel/ethidium bromide electrophoresis to fractionate DNA fragments. Any type or grade of agarose may be used. However, it is strongly recommended that fresh TAE buffer or TBE buffer be used as running buffer. Do not reuse running buffer as its pH will increase and reduce yields.
When adequate separation of bands has occurred, carefully excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Assuming a density of 1 g/mL, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 mL.
Add 1 volume Binding Buffer (XP2).
Incubate at 60°C for 7 minutes or until the gel has completely melted. Vortex or shake the tube every 2-3 minutes.

6th Asia Pacific iGEM Conference
Dancing in the opening ceremony
The conference was held by NCHU_Taichung from July 30th, 2018 to August 2nd, 2018. During the four-day event, more than 22 teams,             3 countries, 140 people, 3 speakers and 6 mentors got to have communication and presentation just as the iGEM             Conference used to do. It is not only a simulation event before the world conference in October, but also a great             chance for teams to build up collaborations and make friends with all the iGEMers.

Newcastle,2016,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," our work is Schedule 3, ‘Additional Provisions Relating To Work With Biological Agents’ . Additionally, because we are working with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) our work is subject to The Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2014  which is the legislation implementing the European directive on on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms . This legislation is summarised in documents by the UK Health & Safety Executive .
In essence we determined that the aim of these regulations is to:
identify the hazards and assessing the risks to health arising from the use of hazardous substances during a work activity.
decide what control measures are required to prevent or control exposure
ensure that control measures are properly implemented and maintained
monitor the exposure of users to hazardous substances if appropriate
providing information, instruction and training to users of hazardous substances to ensure safe working practices and competency
ensuring sufficient arrangements to deal with any accidents, incidents and emergencies that are reasonably foreseeable
We also familiarised ourselves with our Institution's biological risk assessment policy  and chemical risk assessment policy  to ensure we completed our risk assessments correctly when required.
Safe Design
It is often said in Synthetic Biology that the emergent behaviour of genetic systems are often not immediately obvious. Consequently, responsible design is an important part of synthetic biology, so as part of our design work we decided upon a set of criteria which we would use to assess each design for risk. We settled on the following list of criteria:
The first set of questions should be answered negatively for any of our designs to ensure that we meet our safety aims and those of iGEM.
Do any of the coding sequences for proteins in the design come from organisms listed as hazardous or are found in Risk Group 3 or 4?
Are any of the coding sequences from virulence factors, or would they mimic the behaviour of an existing virulence factor?
We then examine if the design might pose any additional risks by considering the following questions. If the response to any of these is yes, then a further assessment of the risks posed by the design needs to be performed.
Is the chassis organism from a risk group other than Class 1 (bacteria) or may it be harmful (non bacterial chassis)?
Are any of the coding sequences from risk group 2 organisms?
Would the system enable the dissemination of genetic material?
Can a mutation result in a dangerous organism?
Does our device present any novel risks?
Are any of the coding sequences used sourced from places other than the iGEM registry?
We answered these for all of our constructs and found the only construct that needed further risk"

PDA was in general the most promising medium and this was chosen as the medium used going forward. Three plates were inoculated for each strain with three-point inoculation.  Depending on strain, different light and temperature conditions were used in incubation. The conditions were chosen based on knowledge of growth from research:
S. commune (wildtype and ΔSC3): Two plates for 30°C light and one for 27°C light.
P. ostreatus: Two plates for 28°C dark and for for 25°C light.
A. oryzae: Two plates for 28°C dark and one for 30°C dark.
3/7/2018
Boxes: A. oryzae and S. commune were used for inoculation of boxes. PDA and mycelium with attached agar mixed. Inoculated medium mixed well with saw dust in boxes and incubated at 30°C dark for a week.
5/7/2018
Boxes: Pipette boxes inoculated with fungus/hay mixture from Skyttegaarden. 4 boxes inoculated, two with parafilm and 2 with the lid.  Inoculation of boxes with species of our own.
6/7/2018
Photos of fungi: Photos were taken of the fungi every day to assess the growth.  All species show growth although not all plates did. A. oryzae showed signs of sporulation.
Boxes: S. commune show growth regardless of medium concentration and volume. However, higher concentration of medium means more growth. A. oryzae boxes moved to 28°C dark. S. commune all moved to 30°C light as they seemed to thrive there.
Drylab Overview
Up until this week, we have had a normal semester. Now all members, of drylab, are able to be working full time in the iGEM project, not counting scheduled personal holidays. This week Mathies worked on Poisson HMM (Hidden Marcow model) and investigating binomial distributions with regards to simulating hyphal growth and branching probabilities. Nicolai is manufacturing/welding growth boxes for the Wetlab group. They need these to be able to make consistently shaped fungi squares for drylab compression testing. Lau and Mathias are investigating other modeling possibilities; how to grow Mycelium on different substrates, and how we, as a group, can enhance our productivity and usefulness for the other subgroups. Hannah collected a lot of data, to be used for more precise modeling parameters, and is working"

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"-replication has to take place ahead, for a empirical formula of replication number is given $$CopyNum(i) = \frac{V_m (i-1)}{K_m+i-1} - (i-1)\mu(i,S)$$ to describe the average plasmid copy number of E.coli with $i$ plasmids.
Then, treating the plasmid distribution process as totally random distribution, the allocation of n plasmids into two son E.coli can be viewed as Bernoulli experiment for n times, from which the probability of i-plasmid parent producing a j-plasmid son is $$\delta_{i,j}=2C_i^j (\frac{1}{2})^j(\frac{1}{2})^{i-j}=\frac{C_i^j}{2^{i-1}}$$. If we mark each row by their intracellular plasmid number, and each column by the plasmid number of their offspring, a distribution possibility table can be listed. However, since the table is too large and lack of readability, we display it more intuitively by using a 3-dimensional plot, in which the x-axis is the plasmid number of parent E.coli, while the y-axis is the number of plasmids possessed by one of its son, the height of each point stands for the possibility of above reproduction.
E.coli growth rate
The growth rate of each E.coli can be controlled by an upper limitation of growth rate $\mu_{max}$, influenced by the number of plasmids $i$ contained, length of target gene incorporated, the culture concentration $S$, as well as the growth promoting effect $\gamma$ brought by the growth-promoter (glucose dehydrogenase). Referring to several well-established models, we form the individual growth rate at a given culture condition as $\mu(i,S) = \mu_{max} \frac{K}{K + i^n} \frac{S}{S+Ks}\gamma(i,S)$.
Equipped with theoretical formula, the change of individual growth rate with respect to several factors can be simulated:
I.Change of E.coli’s Growth Rate v.s. Change of Plasmid Number
II.Change of E.coli’s Growth Rate v.s. Change of Culture Concentration
Growth promoting effect
Knowing the promoter’s mechanism of increasing individual growth rate, our model wish to quantitatively figure out the extent of increase in E.coli’s growth rate with the influence of  a certain amount of glucose dehydrogen"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Production of sensor-chips was done accordingly to the sensor-chip manufacturing protocol :
At 13:00 we prepared sensor chips from shake flask pre-cultures of BL21 pSB1C3-K1319008+pSB3K3-K1319014, BL21 pSB1C3-K1319008+pSB3K3-K1319013 and NEB pSB1C3-B0015.
Subsequently to 1 h incubation at 37°C, BL21 pSB1C3-K131900+pSB3K3-K1319014, BL21 pSB1C3-K1319008+pSB3K3-K1319013 and NEB pSB1C3-B0015 were induced with 0.2 µL IPTG. The induced sensor-chips were read out every 30 minutes for 360 minutes in total. K1319013 was induced earlier and thus measurements were taken for 450 min in total. Readout was conducted at  480 nm wavelength. An additional readout was conducted next day at 11:00.
At 15:30 we prepared liquid cultures for the characterization of ITPG inducible expression:
I746909 in pSB1C3
I20260 in pSB3K3
K731520 in pSB1C3
K1319008 in pSB1C3
K1319013 in pSB3K3
K1319014 in pSB3K3
B0015 in pSB1C3
K1319013 in pSB3K3 + K1319008 in pSB1C3
B0015 in pSB1C3
K1319014 in pSB3K3 + K1319008 in pSB1C3
prepared a colony PCR from K1319014-pSB1C3 clones #3, #4, #5 and#6. H20 and K1319014-pSB3K3 were used as controls.
At 22:20 we prepared 1 L LB+C plates (2.5 g NaCl, 10 g Agar, 2.5 g yeast extract and 5 g"

In light of these considerations we argue that the concern of synthetic organisms disturbing ecosystems is largely unwarranted: Organisms intended to be contained in the laboratory (the vast majority of current synthetic biology products) are already often equipped with kill switches that prevent proliferation in nature, and the containment-requirements of GMO-labs reduce the risk of escape. Whether to allow the intentional release of GMOs, should depend on an individual assessment of the potential consequences, e.g. how likely is the organism to solve the particular environmental problem, spread to other ecosystems, cause new problems, etc.
“Playing God”
Another argument that is often presented against synthetic biology is that synthetic biologists are playing God. The argument exists in various formulations depending on the religious and moral values of the person presenting the argument. Common to these arguments is that they suggest that synthetic biology is fiddling with nature in a way that humans should not do.
Since the objection put forward with this argument is not related to the consequences of synthetic biology, but rather to the action of performing synthetic biology itself, it is not meaningful to analyse it in terms of utilitarianism. Instead the argument is pertaining more to deontological ethics, which judges the ethicality of an action based on a set of rules that an ethically good action must adhere to.
Whether the “playing God” argument is assigned any weight will depend on whether the moral rule-set of a person includes a rule that forbids modifying living organisms, i.e. a religious person might find synthetic biology unacceptable because he considers living organisms God-given, while an atheist synthetic biologist might consider microorganisms as just a complex chemical system, which is acceptable to modify, just as any other chemical system.
Moral Status of Genetically Modified Organisms
This argument deals with the question of whether it is acceptable for scientists to use other living organisms as merely a tool for obtaining goals that benefit the human species. In other words it addresses the question of whether the genetically modified organism has a moral status that must be respected by the scientists working with them. Like the “playing God” argument, this argument is difficult to analyse within utilitarianism, and its validity depends on the moral values of a person, i.e. about which organisms or objects in general have a moral status that demands respect. We argue that only organisms that possess conscience should be ascribed a moral status, and since synthetic biology works almost exclusively with plants, microorganisms and cell cultures, we will not discuss it further here. The ethics of synthetic biology on living animals, while interesting, is out of scope of this discussion.
