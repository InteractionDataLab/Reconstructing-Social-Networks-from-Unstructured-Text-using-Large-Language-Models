4.1 Social influence
""The principles of all fundamental scientific research are obscure for us non-professionals."" In the preliminary investigation process of social practice, we tried to explain our projects to some amateurish people. But They found it hard to understand these obscure biological principles. Based on this situation, we designed our game and incorporated the principles of our project into the game. Now by this game, people can understand our project in a much easier and happier way, which is a great achievement for us.
4.2 Feedback
We showed the game ""Csy4 Go!"" to people of different. Having played the game, they can clearly describe the overall situation of the game. Combined ""Csy4 Go!"" and the game comic brochure, they can easily understand some principles of biology exactly. We have achieved the goal of achieving science education and allowing more people to participate in an interesting way of playing games.
4.3 Future
Now our games can only run on the windows system. In the future, we will go further and develop our game on mobile phone version, Mac version and iPad version.
5. Education for biotech companies: Narrow the gap between biotech companies and society
Given that all basic researches aim at application and benefiting for human beings , we suppose that visiting the biotechnology companies to investigate the prospect of our project is a great idea. We went to the BGI, Qingdao Youdu Biotechnology Co. LTD and Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co. LTD 3 biotech companies and 2 research institute to integrate our project with social reality. In this way, we can know about the current social needs and improve our project accordingly. At the same time, we established a long-term relationship with them.

In the Future
As the advanced architecture and plugin system designed in our Biohub 3.0. It's pretty easy to improve our existed functions and  provide new function by activating new plugins. Here are what we want to do in the future.
Improvements
It is super easy to accomplish  your report rapidly by useing our editor. But we can make it better.
We believe it is possible to share your protocols and steps with anyone freely.
It is great significant  to make it more efficient to build a new step or protocol.
Our editor takes too much memories and will be slow down when the report goes long.
The Search Engine at the moment supports searching by nature language thanks to the new nature language processing  technology. The intelligence can be improved in understanding what users want and reacting more smartly. On the other hand, we can integrate more databases which are most used by biologists.
The society  is still growing. That is why chatting and communication  could be considered as an important facility in our society.
New Features
Several Interface has been implemented to make it easy to improve Biohub in the future without refactoring core codes. New codes can be considered as a module or  plugin.
In the next generation of Biohub, We want to strengthen our society and build a society like Quora where biologists  can post their ideas, ask questions, sale their e-books, have a free chat or find partners who share interest in a certain area."

Saturday 26/7
To see if we could get a more cleat band of part A, a gradient PCR was made with Lac_R and Lac_F primers, using Tm gradient 51-70 degrees with 5 samples.
Gradient mix: 2,5 uL template, 31 uL water.
PCR program:1: 98 deg., 2 min. 2: 98 deg., 10 sec. 3: 51-70 deg., 30 sec. 4: 72 deg., 45 sec. 5: GO TO 2 rep 30. 6: 72 deg., 5 min.
Tm for the different samples, were set to be: 50,8; 52,4; 58,9; 66,3; 70,0.
The PCR showed blurry bands and no correct product/lenght.
The reason for this, was found to be due to a too high concentration of primers, which were then diluted. Then we did a touch down PCR on part A, starting at 66 degrees going 1 degree lower per cycle, for 10 cycles thus ending at 56 degrees.
Running a gel showed clear band at the correct leght.
In order for us to be able to ligate PCR1 and PCR2 into PCR3, repectively, we needed a higher concentration of PCR1 & PCR2. Therefor we ran a PCR with the program: 1: 98 deg., 2 min. 2: 98 deg., 10 sec. 3: 50 deg., 30 sec. 4: 72 deg., 20 sec. 5: GO TO 20 sec. 6: 72 deg., 5 min.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulins to supply developing nations with cheap insulin is an option, but unambitious. The production process involves running animal blood through a form of dialysis to purify the insulin out for human use. Recent developments in the breeding of chimeric animals (e.g. with a human insulin gene) could significantly reduce the chance of an allergic reaction.
ISSUES
Higher rate of allergy to animal insulins than regular human insulin.
Human insulin manufacturing with economies of scale should be cheaper to manufacture. Animal insulins only seem like a viable alternative due to the artificially high prices.
10. Black Market Insulin
BACKGROUND
We could potentially go rogue from the normal entry to market options and start producing insulin on the black market. This option would not require any approval processes for processes used to make insulin, and could be sold online through trading sites such as Ali Baba. Regulatory oversight wouldn't’t be used either.
ISSUES
Will put patients at serious risk if Good Manufacturing Practice is not met.
Legal risk for manufacturer if anyone is harmed through use of the insulin produced.
Our Solution
In light of all of these potential solutions, we have had to formulate our own decisions as to how we should
1.      Approach the issue as a whole, and
2.      How to bring our solution to fruition.
Importantly, in improving the situation of inaccessible insulin to different countries, public investment appears to be the most effective and efficient way of reducing costs to diabetics. Although this method is clearly beyond our reach and relies on governmental reform; we investigated the role of current government practices in insulin subsidisation from different demographics. The full analysis of how different government schemes (as in 6 of the potential solutions graphs) is below on the clickable world map.
Focusing more on solutions which are accessible to us, we thus prioritised an open-source business model that aligned with an overarching aim of maintaining an international collaboration and keeping our data and findings free to be used.
To see the full thought process taken to reach the conclusion we have, please visit our Integrated Human Practices Page . Various stakeholders invested great time to help guide us towards our solution:
Open Source Insulin Producing Bacteria
with simplifed purification
An overall theme from above is simple upfront costs. The best way for us to help in reducing these costs is not so much approaching it through an avenue that tries to remove those costs all together, but in a way where we provide a cheaper alternative once certain costs are made. For example, rather than going through the litigation process of reducing the costs of Good Manufacturing Practice approval processes, or by investing into creating a"

OUR PROJECT
A GENERAL INTRODUCTION OF YOUR PROJECT AND WHERE YOU ARE FOR IT:
Chemtaxis, which c an make s trains move, interests us this time. By reprogramming the strain (CL-1), which lacks the CheZ gene, we can create mathematical patterns. CheZ gene b elongs t o chemotaxis family of E.coli. Protein CheZ can dephosphorylate CheY-P, one that allows E.coli swimming smoothly. The CheZ bacteria can’t dephosphorylate CheY-P, so the strain won’t motile until CheZ is involved in. That means the motility of E.coli can be precisely control by stimulus (e.g. IPTG). We try to construct logic gene circuits to m ake E.coli recognize environmental stimulation, thus by utilizing the controlled chemotaxis which named pseudotaxis we could command bacteria to form patterns such as ellipse, hyperbola and so on.
Besides, w e try to utilize pseudotaxis to a ccomplish some experimental meaning. As far as we know, the motile ability is proportional to the amount of protein CheZ in certain range. By measuring the average chemotaxis distance, we will get a precise evaluation on the RBS efficiency that is e valuated by fluorescence strength previously.
What is more, the intrinsic motivation that drive us striving for the above project is that we want t o simulate the p rocess o f stem cell differentiation. In the organs development, stem cells differentiate while aggregate together to form heart, liver and kidney which have precise shapes. Perhaps some mathematical principles that govern the differentiation process. By simulating differentiation, we want to get a closer understanding of the differentiation process. However, E.coli c an’t sense as much s timulus as stem cell, we intend t o utilize RNA aptamers which has the potential to response to almost all stimulus to cover that shortage. Thus, we can get a more precise stimulation.
Up till now, we have accomplished a original genetic l oop, which w e are struggling to characterize.

Hawaii,2018,Team:Hawaii#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," reported in specific domains. We identified three putative cleavage sits between the Gag and Protease domains, eight between the Protease and Reverse Transcriptase domains, and four between the RNAseH and Integrase domains.
After predicting these domains, the putative mature proteins were modelled separately using I- TASSER (Zhang, 2008), PHYRE2 (Kelley et al., 2015), and HHPred (Max Planck Institute, Germany). The accuracy of the models produced were assessed using ANOLEA (Melo et al., 1997) RAMPAGE (University of Cambridge, England), and Verify3D (Luthy et al., 1992). ANOLEA performs pairwise comparisons of the energy between the heavy atoms of each amino acid in a non-local environment, RAMPAGE performs Ramachandran analysis for the stereochemistry of the amino acid side chains around peptide bonds, and Verify3D compares the 3D model against it’s 1D amino acid sequence and scores the likelihood of a residue being in its structural class.
The top five models from the putative mature proteins were used to make consensus models using MODELLER (Sali Lab, San Francisco, California). Five consensus models were produced for each predicted mature protein. These were checked with ANOLEA, RAMPAGE, and Verify3D and the top scoring models were used for further analysis. X-Ray crystallography models from the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000) of the Ty3/Gypsy or retroviral equivalents to our predicted mature proteins were downloaded and then compared to our consensus models using PyMol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC).
Results and Discussion: The comparisons between our predicted 3D models and the X-Ray crystallography data allowed us to further restrict the number of predicted putative cleavage sites based on the locations of terminal alpha helices and their associated covalent protein modifications. The CR2 Gag-Prot-RT construct encompasses the region from Gag to the 5’ tip of the reverse transcriptase domain. The construct was designed with a N-terminal and C-terminal 8-histidine tag to allow for the purification of the regions 5’ and 3’ of the cut site using nickel resin. This constructs was cloned into the pET-14b vector using a 5’ NcoI restriction site and a 3’ BamHI restriction site (GenScript).

A starter was prepared by growing the cells in LB medium + appropriate antibiotics at 37°C overnight. Then, 0.5ml of the starter was transferred into a 250ml Erlenmeyer flask  containing 50ml LB with the appropriate antibiotics.
The bacteria were grown at 37°C until 0.6 OD600nm.
The bacteria were centrifuged for 2 minutes, and the pellet re-suspended in Bioassay medium (BA). They were then transferred to a 48 well plate containing various concentrations of AHL, as seen in figure 1. It was then incubated for 3 hours in a shaker ( 37°C, 250 RPM). After 3 hours, absorbance (OD600 – for cell concentration) and fluorescence (excitation peak: 584nm, emission peak: 608nm) were measured using a plate reader. A measurement was taken every 30 minutes for 2 hours (to a total of 4 times).
Results and conclusions
It can be seen that the relative fluorescence of the strain K-12 Top 10 : Plux-mcherry (in green in fig.1) is low and constant.
Since this strain does not have the gene luxR, there is no formation of the dimer luxR-AHL, and therefore, no induction of Plux. This strain represents the basal level of transcription under the promoter Plux.
In a similar way, the strain K-12 Top 10 : Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry (in blue in fig. 1), which does contain luxR, shows low levels of relative fluorescence. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the promoter in this strain is not induced in the presence of AHL.
Since we did not sequence the plasmid inserted into this strain of bacteria, but used restriction instead to verify the presence of the insert (time was short), it may possible that a mutation occurred, that the insert was not properly inserted into the plasmid, or that the scar ligation that was conducted in order to build this construct, failed.
On the other hand, the strain K-12 Top 10: Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry-LuxI (red in fig.1), which contains an insert that was constructed in a separate batch of scar ligation, did show a steady and moderate induction by AHL.

Human Practices: Results
Social scientist
We started working on our human practice through a ‘crash course’ on SB and iGEM organized by the supervisors of the Amsterdam and Delft 2012 iGEM teams. One of our advisors, Wieke Betten , gave a lecture about the importance of ‘good’ incorporation of the societal context in the development of SB and embedding of SB in society. The key word from this presentation was valorization . The only way this can be achieved, she stated, was by early involvement of stakeholders and public in the design of a new scientific project. This lecture inspired us to outline a generic approach in human practice that could be applied not only to our present iGEM topics, the Cellular Logbook, but also to all future iGEM teams. Such a generic approach in human practice would reflect on the ethical, societal, safety and security issues concerning each specific project. Our Interactive iGEM research approach was born.
Experts in biotechnology
Presenting our project in an early stage to the experts at the UvA
In the first month of our project we organized presentations at both universities (UvA and VU) and invited scientists from the departments of Molecular Cell Biology and the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) . During these presentations we explained how we wanted to realize our project, the Cellular Logbook. We proposed our designed molecular mechanisms of the Cellular Logbook to these experts. Although most feedback confirmed the neatness of our project design, we received some relevant feedback:
Low concentrations of IPTG may (1-100 µM) not enter the cell, because of the phenomenon called ‘inducer exclusion’. In this case, glucose transport leads to phosphorylation of a compound of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), which in turn blocks the lacY transporter of IPTG. During our experiments we prevented this from happening by using higher concentrations of IPTG.
The basal activity of the envisioned LacH promotor might result in background noise because of leaky expression"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Upregulation of sporulation rate
Expression of the metal sponge (SmtA)
Decreased cadmium efflux
Upregulation of cadmium import
Importantly, Hin is differentially expressed depending on the levels of the two inducible promoters that flank the invertable segment on which it lies. This means the segment can be biased in a predictable and controllable fashion to favour one orientation or the other.
The following diagram shows our stochastic construct:
Prevention of germination
The prevention of germination is governed by another invertase switch. When the sequence faces right, a FimE protein is expressed which inverts a further promoter region. This promoter controls expression of the cwlD and sleB genes. If their promoter is in the correct orientation then the cell will be able to germinate and continue as a vegetative cell. However if their promoter has been flipped, the cell can not germinate following sporulation, and will be trapped as a metal containing spore.
Upregulation of sporulation rate
The upregulation of sporulation involves increasing KinA expression. kinA codes a kinase protein that phosphorylates the Spo0A protein to its active form. When the promoter region within our stochastic brick faces right, there will be increased KinA expression, and thus a greater sporulation rate.
Metal sponge and cadmium influx/efflux
Our stochastic switch determines whether the spores can germinate, or whether they are commited to be metal containers that cannot germinate again. We need this switch as we cannot totally interrupt the natural life cycle of the bacteria, since a proportion of cells have to go on to seed the next generation.  Expression of the metallothionein fusion protein (cotC-gfp-smtA), cadmium import channel (mntH) and the cadmium efflux channel (cadA) is also governed by the direction of the stochastic promoter. When the direction of promoter faces right, the metallothionein fusion protein's expression will be triggered, ant will soak up the cadmium. While the import channel is upregulated, the efflux system's activity will be slowed down to increase the amountof cadmium inside the cell.
Stochastic Brick
We decided to get our stochastic construct synthesised, as trying to build the construct manually would be too time consuming. The following sequencher diagram shows the components of the construct we had synthesised.
Testing construct
In order to test our construct we had to redesign using inducible promoters governing Hin invertase expression. We used the promoters pSpac and pxylA (Induced by IPT"

Project Motivation
Colon cancer is a widespread disease which is the fourth most common cancer type throughout the world. (National Cancer Institute, 2016) After, reading numerous articles about cancer types, we focused on colon cancer as it is directly related to alimentation and exercising.In colon cancer, polyp formation is observed. They are abnormal growths  in colon’s inner surface. Polyps are benign (non-cancerous) growths, but cancer can start in some types of them; like Adenomatous polyps.

In Turkey 7 in 100,000 is suffering from colon cancer and each year 3200 people die from colorectal cancer. (Tatar&Tatar, 2010) Although Turkish people’s unhealthy diet differs depending on the region they live and  socio-economic status, in general their diet are composed of more meat and less vegetables. (Hacettepe University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Nutrition and Dietetics Department, 2014)
Being obese, physical inactivity, certain types of diet, smoking, using alcohol greatly increase the risk of developing cancer (American Cancer Society, 2015). In order to prevent colon cancer, firstly you need to be aware of healthy lifestyle. On top of that, Turkish people can’t find time to exercise regularly. Also the preferred transportation way is cars, so people tend to move less. A non-fiberous diet with too much red meat plus insufficient amount of exercise can lead to cancer especially to colon cancer. Because of these alarming facts we decided to work on this topic as every contribution counts in fight against cancer.
Though treatment is available in forms of chemotherapy, surgery and targeted drug therapy they also include various side effects (MayoClinic, 2016). Our first motivation was 2015 Harvard Biodesign Team’s successfully targeted mechanism that give us an opportunity to create and form a micro-environment. Secondly, we decided to find an alternative solution consist of an endogenous substance so that there will be no side effects, best candidate was butyrate. The research about butyrate’s effects on colon cancer has been done by Dr. Sreeparna Baner"

rrnO transcriptional terminator
spaS promotor - a strong promotor inducible by upstream activation of spaRK. It can be placed in front any gene to regulate its activity.
Aim 1: clone the spaRK system from pUC57 into pJWV021 and transform into DH5 alpha competent E. coli
Aim 1
Aim 2: clone the spaRK system from pUC57 into pGFP-rrnB and transform into DH5 alpha competent E. coli
Aim 2
The 2.2kb fragment (ncl08) contains the spaRK biobrick system. When properly cloned, our biobrick will replace the rrnB promoter in front of gfp present in plasmid pGFP-rrnB. Thus, gfp will now be under control of the subtilin inducible spaS promoter. This means that when SpaR is activated by SpaK (by sensing subtilin) its positive regulatory effect on PspaS will activate gfp.
Aim 3: clone the agr (Cambridge biobrick for sensing S. aureus) system from the biobrick plasmid using EcoRI and SpeI sites into the corresponding sites of pGFP-rrnB. This will replace the PrrnB-gfp on the bacillus vector with the agr biobrick. The ligation was transformed into DH5 alpha competent E. coli
Aim 3
BBa_I746107 contains a partial agr operon, which includes agrC and A but has agrB and D deleted. This allows coding for the receptor (C/A) but not for production of the quorum peptides themselves (B/D). The inducible promoter drives expression of gfp.

How rules, training, containment and other procedures helped manage risks identified:
Each team member has completed a building safety induction and wet lab team members have completed a laboratory work induction. Each requires the successful passing of a quiz. Each lab team member has read and signed risk assessments for all of the work they will be completing and has a training record which has to be completed by a supervisor when training has been completed.
UK Regulations and their associated guidance are implemented, the University of Nottingham has defined appropriate standards for the growth, storage, disposal and transport of biological agents and genetically modified organisms within its premises. All these requirements are written down in the safety regulation forms. Our project was reviewed by the university safety committee to ensure that it follows the biosafety regulations of the laboratory we use.
All wet lab members were trained to work in group risk 2 laboratory and using the facilities. All regulations regarding waste disposal, equipment use and handling of dangerous chemicals were introduced by the safety officer. At least one supervisor was always present in the lab to ensure that the safety protocols are followed thoroughly.      In addition to standard procedures for working within a category 2 laboratory due to the nature of C. difficile no member of the team can enter the lab when they are taking antibiotics.

It uses version control tools as a backend, so it takes advantage of their strength. But it preprocesses the DNA data to optimize these tested and proven methods of version control, producing a much more efficient and secure tracking system built from the ground up to be able to scale to genome-size files. darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. It's also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems.
Biology
The basis for the workings of any organism is rooted in its proteins as provided for in its genome. Every single protein can be traced back to an open reading frame, a set of base pairs defined by a start and stop sequence that evenly divides into codons (sets of 3 base pairs). Every codon corresponds to an amino acid and through the processes of transcription and translation, proteins are manufactured in the cell.
While DNA is a relatively stable molecule, different things can occur causing a mutation in the genetic code. There are several different types of mutations which are defined by how they affect protein translation downstream, specifically insertions, deletions, and substitutions. These can either be synonymous meaning that although there is a changes to base pair, the codon still codes for the same amino acid so there is no detectable change, or nonsynonymous which may affect the makeup of the protein. Lastly, there are frameshift mutations which generate an entirely different open reading frame.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," is first reduced to chlorate, releasing one molar equivalent of oxygen gas, through the action of perchlorate reductase, a two-subunit enzyme. Chlorate is then reduced completely down to one molar equivalent of oxygen gas and one molar equivalent of chloride ions by the action of chlorite dismutase. The entire reduction process takes place in the periplasmic space due to the toxicity of the perchlorate and chlorate oxyanions [1]. The pathway results in the net production of two molar equivalents of oxygen and one molar equivalent of chloride from one mole of perchlorate.
There exist over 50 different strains of bacteria that are capable of fully reducing perchlorate to oxygen gas. These bacteria are quite often facultative anaerobes, and often utilize perchlorate as the terminal electron acceptor in metabolic processes under anaerobic conditions, due to its high reduction potential [2]. The reduction of perchlorate is typically coupled to the oxidation of organic carbon sources or alternative electron donors such as hydrogen sulfide [2]. One of the original hypotheses surrounding perchlorate reduction was that it was simply cross-reacting with nitrate reducing catalytic machinery. However, when nitrate-reducing bacterial cell extracts were challenged with perchlorate, this always led to the accumulation of toxic amounts of the chlorite oxyanion product, suggesting that there exists a distinct pathway by which specific bacteria are capable of degrading perchlorate completely. The pathway by which perchlorate is reduced utilizes two enzymes as shown above (Figure 1), perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase.
Perchlorate reductase forms a heterodimer composed of subunits PcrA and PcrB that localizes to the periplasm. Although no structural information has been obtained on this enzyme, it is thought to be a part of the type II DMSO reductase family [1]. However, the genes encoding both subunits of this enzyme have not been successfully expressed in other bacterial species, such as E.coli, and so the level of characterization of this enzyme remains limited, although limited kinetic studies have been performed [3]. Deletion of the pcrA led to perchlorate sensitivity in D. aromatica, providing a strong implication that it is necessary for perchlorate metabolism [1].
Chlorite dismutase is a single subunit enzyme that has been relatively well-characterized. It has been cloned and expressed in E.coli and extensive activity assays have been performed with it [4]. This enzyme is active in the per"

Groningen,2012,Team:Groningen#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," picture is worth a thousand words. Below you will see the spreadsheet which encapsulates all of the relationships and calculations into a user-friendly format.
But, what does it mean? Well, lets take a look at the Input section.
Temperature:
The general operating temperature of the device in degrees Celsius
OD at the Start of Log Growth:
This value is modified till the Final OD value is close to the desired value (explained below)
Initial Amount of Potassium:
Milligrams of potassium at the start
We have the intermediate values either used to calculate the rest, or to simply provide extra information:
Number of Spores:
This is a measure of the number of spores which should be contained in the sticker
Generation Time:
Doubling time in minutes
Biomass Production:
Rate of biomass production in millimolar / grams of dry weight biomass / hour
Potassium Uptake:
Rate of potassium uptake in millimolar / grams of dry weight biomass / hour
Length of Exponential Growth:
Number of hours for which the cells are happily growing exponentially
And, we have the direct values of interest:
Final OD:
This is an experimentally maximized value at which (1) there is enough biomass for the reporter to be visible,        and (2) the growth stops because of a lack of potassium not because of cell-crowding        (we must ensure volatile transport is not hindered by crowding)
Required Glucose:
Total amount of glucose required to support growth to the final OD, in grams
Minimum NH4:
Minimum total amount of nitrogen required to support growth to the final OD, in grams
So, what is missing? The endpoints of the active sensing region. When does it start? When does it end?     As stated in the slides above, this region starts when there is enough biomass for the reporter to be visible.     We know the reporter works, we have seen it. However, the relationship between reporter opacity and amount of biomass has not been quantified.
Also, if you look to the top of this page, this initiative should also adjust the initial amounts to avoid dormancy or sporulation at the final OD.     This is quite the sticky wicket. It requires extensive testing for our specific conditions. The best we can find from sporulation studies in literature is that    you can expect B. subtilis to start producing spores 5 hours after the end of the exponential growth phase.

Now, J23101 has been previously characterized by Kelly et al. 2009, whoe found that it has a value of 0.03PoPS(polymerase per second). Therefore, by multiplying 0.03PoPS with 100, we can get 3.00PoPS for the strength of pVEG. Finally, we conclude that sfp, under the control of pVEG, has a constitutive ranscription rate of 3.00PoPS per molecule of DNA construct, and this can be translated to
Translation
After the mRNAs are formed, they will then be translated into functinonal proteins consists one or more polypeptide chains. It is universally acknowledged that translation involves in three main stages which are initiation, elongation and termination in sequence. Hence the rate of translation can be affected by three main process:
The binding of the ribosome to the RBS(ribosome binding site)
Formation of initial complexes
Speed of the ribosome across the mRNA
In our model, we assume the speed of the ribosome across the mRNA to be the main factors in this process. Unfortunately, we couldn't find the parameters in B.subtilis, therefore, we decided to use the parameters in E.coli instead. According to our literature research, the translation rate in E.coli has been characterized.(Young and Bremer, 1976 and Proshkin et al. 2010.), which gives us 17.1 amino acids/second.
Degradation
The lifetime of mRNA is relatively short, but it is still a factor we need to concern in our simulation in order to be more precise. We take the average value(0.0028molecule per second) of mRNA degradation in E.coli since we couldn't find accurate parameters in B.subtilis.
Parameters in Michaelis-Menten equation
The synthesis of surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide, involves a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase complex, including acyl carrier protein (ACP) for fatty acid synthesis and peptide carrier protein (PCP) for polypeptide synthesis. The non-ribosomal peptide synthetase stays in inactive apo-synthetase form until modified by 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferases, which is Sfp in the case of Bac"

That completely changed the direction of our initial approach. He proposed the use of the customizable vectors where any researcher can insert different binding sites for preferred miRNAs in the 3' untranslated region of specific genes. It has been a blast and one of our most exciting moments in iGEM integrating his feedback and coming up with solutions to increase the modularity of our system .

While attending the 4th International Synthetic & Systems Biology, during the poster session, we met with Melania who was presenting a poster regarding the design of optimal cell-type classifiers. She was really kind and energetic during our discussions as she thoroughly informed us about the significant benefits of computational design of logic circuits with miRNA molecular switches. After our conversations, we quickly reshaped our computational modelling, developing a new classifier optimization tool that can dictate the architecture and logical expressions used in the wet lab .
Our project acted as a proof-of-principle for OSIRIS, proving that OSIRIS is a multi-faceted tool that can be employed for a wide range of synthetic biology projects developed by a research group (iGEM-related or not) in order to evaluate potential risks and benefits in multiple fields and incorporate in a systematic manner, opinions by a multidisciplinary panel of experts and stakeholders.

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Collaborative Report_-_-_TEXT.html," Ginkgo Bioworks have experienced explosive growth and are making big waves in the synthetic biology industry. Synthetic biology itself has shown potential for high applicability in various different fields. Nonetheless, the development of new technologies, as always, requires acceptance and support from society.
Society’s perspective of synthetic biology (ULaval)
Genetic engineering impacts society in many different ways, such as in health and nutrition to name a few. However, most people are unaware that their food or medicine has been produced by mean of synthetic biology. Perhaps, provided with such knowledge, they would reject such products because many people are afraid of what they do not understand. In this section, we attempt to explore and elucidate the following: Is the society knowledgeable enough about biological synthesis? How can they be better informed? How accepting is the general public towards GMOs? Who are the opponents to this technology?
Fear is closely linked to ignorance [20]. Currently, synthetic biology remains an embryonic technology. It is common to think of those novel and unfamiliar technologies as bold science fiction, given the common movie trope of man-made disasters arising from that so very arrogant scientist who tried to “play God”. One of the best known is Jurassic Park, in which scientists succeed in bringing dinosaurs back to life from amber-preserved DNA. While scientists are easily able to identify science fiction not grounded in actual science, science fiction can appear convincingly real to the uninitiated, even to the point of believing such science fiction is actually achievable in reality.
Because of sheer ignorance, synthetic biology is often stereotyped to be “bad”, and hence, “dangerous” to health and the environment despite approvals by regulators and scientists, and their benefits recognized to date, like biofuels [21] and increased yields and agricultural growth [22]. To prevent these misconceptions, the scientific community has to invest more time to popularize synthetic biology to educate and inform the public and allow them to better understand how GMOs are designed.
Public scepticism towards new technology is not unfounded. Indeed, scandals in the recent history of the scientific community have put a damper on the credibility that science is supposed to demonstrate [23]. For example, disasters in healthcare like the prescription of tobacco as an anti-stress medicine [24] and the tragedy over the prescription of thalidomide to pregnant women [25]. Other tragedies also happened in the food industry, like the mad cow disease [26]. However, while healthy scepticism is good, anti-intellectualism is developing in some parts of the world, hampering the development of science. In the US, there is"

Overview
This year , UESTC-China 2014 IGEM has been working on the problem of formaldehyde,we try to use the principle of synthetic biology to make a plant to absorb formaldehyde largely.
First,we conducted a knowledge quiz activity to popularize IGEM,and let more Chinese know the competition,and drawed their attract on synthetic biology.To crystallize the goal,we bought many liitle gifts such as delicate plants,cartoon fans for the people who joined in our activity and did a good job.
Then,we drawed up a questionnaire survey to gather the information of public awareness of synthetic biology and the population of formaldehyde,and last but no least,their perspective on the trangenetic plant which can absorb formaldehyde,if they mind this man-made thing.
Also,we do a on-the-spot research in many residential district,where the houses are furbishing,so the formaldehyde pollution is relatively critical.
Last,we analized ur research data,and come to a conclusion of our activity,and made many charts or diagrams to make people easy understand.In addition to these above,we also communicate with other IGEM teams,such as USTC-China ,HZAU-China ,etc.

we bought cartoon fans and plants as incentive
 Our team members are packing our little gifts for the activity. we bought 200 cartoon fans and 30 green plants as incentive to attract people who are passing by. If the person who answer our questions then he can own a cartoon fan, if he answer two questions then he may win a pot of plant .

If Cas9 enters the cell and cuts the resistance gene, it will not grow on that antibiotic. This would be a proof of concept for targeting antibiotic resistance with CRISPR, and also a simple test of successful OMV delivery.
One interview question asked the clinicians to identify what they considered the most worrying antibiotic-resistant infections. Their answers included hospital skin infections like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. This also informed our project design, because topical infections would be safe early applications of a bacterially-derived product to evaluate immune response to the therapy.
Having compiled a wealth of information via research and interviews, we decided to use it to produce a pamphlet which could be distributed at events or placed in waiting rooms. The pamphlet illuminates the problem of antibiotic resistance, persuasively coercing the reader to use antibiotics correctly. Furthermore, one section dissuades the consumption of meat produced from animals raised with prophylactic antibiotics, while another explains why the prescription of antibiotics to prevent infections after wisdom tooth surgery is inappropriate. Future iGEM teams and other organizations are encouraged to use this pamphlet however they see fit. It can be downloaded here .
Instructions for printing and cutting:
Print in landscape orientation on both sides of standard 8.5” x 11” paper, flipping on the short end.
Use a paper trimmer to remove the edges. Align the blade with the trim marks, which are L-shapes placed at each corner.
Fold the front panel, which contains the title, to the left, stopping at the midpoint of the newly folded paper.
Fold the citations panel inward toward the crease created in step 3.
The final product should look like this:
Working with Students
At the summer’s start, our team was largely inexperienced with public outreach. We applied for a Building with Biology kit to help us develop the skills we were lacking. Building with Biology is a program funded by the NSF whose stated purpose is “to build the capacity of the field to use public engagement with science (PES) activities to extend STEM learning about science, technology, and societal implications through public and scientist dialogue about synthetic biology.” The kit contained instructions and materials for a variety of activities. Of these, we decided to run a “See DNA” event and hold a “Should We Engineer the Mosquito?” forum.

I decided to join the iGEM-Team because I totaly like working in laboratories and thought I could help the team with my experiences in developing and running lab tests. Moreover, my current job has nothing to do with biology or genetics so I kind of missed the lab.
Due to the fact that I never visited the USA I'm thrilled about everything. I'm mostly curious about the way people are living around the globe and how it differentiates from our own day to day lifes. Of course I want to see some attractions, too, and I'm excited to meet all of the other iGEM teams.

During Amyra's ""recruiting"" presentation I figured it'd be a nice activity to join the HSHL iGEM team. Since no student of our University competed at iGEM before I thought it implicates a great opportunity to participate actively in a self-developed project. We're facing a lot of e.g. projectmanagement issues that we need to solve ourselves and in my opinion that's the best way to learn problem-solving.

In August,2014, our teammates attended the Central China iGem Consortium (CCiC), which was organized by Huazhong Agricultural University. In two days of communication, we established great cooperation with 10 other universities in China and exchanged our ideas on different projects. Moreover, we joined in the online group of iGem for further cooperation.
On August 28th, we had a meet-up with the iGemers of Beijing University of Chemical Technology. We briefed each other about the current situation of projects and mutually provided with suggestions. Especially, we offered them advice on micro-fluidic chips and in return, they pointed out the deficiency of our hardware.
Thanks to the precious communication with other teams, we acquired more ideas, guidance and energy to perfect our iGem projects.
On September 29th, iGemers from Lanzhou University came to us and had a profound communication. We exchanged our ideas about the key points in projects. We offered them some suggestions on making instrument and choosing chip materials, and in return, they helps us promote the device design. In our free discussion, we shared experience in the previous competitions and team building.
In the meantime, we held a info session on iGem for freshmen in our college, managing to make more excellent students to participate in iGem. It turned out that it was totally a great success that we achieved our goal

Conclusions
We have decided to tackle an imposing ecological problem of oil consumption. The fact is that fossil  fuel consumption has increased in the 21st century and that we depend on oil in almost all areas of  our life. But fossil fuels are a finite source of energy, so we have decided to try to find an  alternative for this in our iGEM project. Oil reserves are going to be emptied in a few decades and in  that time we have to find an acceptable biofuel for our civilization to be able to survive. We have therefore decided to try to create a system of transforming waste butanoic acid into  butanol, similar enough to oil that it acts as a biofuel without any modifications for internal  combustion engines. Butanoic acid is a side-product in bioethanol production and represents a waste  that seems to be useless. The amount of butanoic acid produced is as much as 3 g/L. To accomplish  our goal, we needed three genes. We could not have imagined  at the beginning of the project how much effort our work was going to take, but at the end we are  satisfied with our results.
We have managed to ligate the ordered three gene fragments into empty pSB1C3 vector, and then  ligate into that vector a double terminator and a promoter and RBS as well. So it was 3 cloning steps for each gene. Through this process we  have created nine new functioning BioBricks, which we have characterized, documented and  submitted to the Registry.
We were able to confirm that our genes are functional and active when promoter is added with SDS-  PAGE and Western blot to determine that the proteins were indeed our specific protein, which we  have planned with a His-tag. The proteins are expressed in the insoluble fraction of the lysate, most  likely due to the use of a strong promoter and a strong RBS. The cells were normally grown 37 °C,  but after realising the proteins are expressed in the insoluble fraction, we also tried to grow  them at lower temperatures. We tried growing them at 20 °C and 16 °C, at which point, quite  some of the"

Biofilms: Growing new biofilms
Objective: To growth new biofilms for future testing with various means
Procedure: In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL of LB media, 210 µl of RFP, and 21 µL KAN were pipetted into it and the solution was mixed. 3 mL of the solution was then pipetted into 7 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
These were then put into the incubator for 24 hours at 37˚C.
Biofilms: Bleach Concentration Gradient
Objective: From our work we are able to determine how effective different cleaners are in degrading biofilms. To test the resilience of the biofilms in another mean, we will test how well the biofilms are degraded at different concentrations of bleach
Procedure:
1.Standard solution of 0.252% bleach was made from the stock bottle for a 50 mL volume
2.The following concentrations had been made from the standard solution of bleach and water. Each concentration was diluted by two folds of the previous solution.
• 0.252% • 0.126% • 0.063% • 0.0315% • 0.01575% • 0.007875% • 0.0039375%
3.The dilutions were made for a 15 mL falcon tube using water and standard bleach solution
4.3.2 mL of one of the bleach dilutions were placed in one the Petri dishes containing biofilms from the previous day. This process was repeated for the other six dilutions.
5.The biofilms were then allowed to degrade for 15 mins.
6.The bleach solutions in each of the Petri dishes was emptied and rinsed once with Milli-Q water.
7.LB media tubes were labeled with one of the bleach solutions. 5 µL of KAN was added to each labeled tube.
8.20 µL of LB from one tube was taken out and placed on the edge of one of the Petri dishes.
9.The media was then placed back into the tube it was taken out of.
10.This process (Steps 8-9) was repeated for the remaining six tubes
11.LB media tubes were placed in the 37˚C incubator for 24 hours.

When we popularize the safety of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance, we recognized it not enough to hold activities only, so we focus more on the social media like writing reports on internet. At the beginning, we connected with the school journal. And then as the scale became lager, many famous media came to report us like Guangzhou Daily. Especially the reports about our exhibition in science center, was spread on many well known websites like Tencent, Baidu and so on.

During our project we worked in many different scientific fields to find suitable ways to incorporate non-canonical amino acids into proteins. Thus, we needed to repurpose one of the existing codons and incorporated two new bases to create new codons in E. coli and we realized both ways.
The repurposing of a codon for the incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) is possible using the rarely used amber stop codon UAG or other rarely used codons like the leucine codon CUA. To incorporate a non-canonical amino acid using these codons, an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ( tRNA/aaRS ) pair is necessary, which can charge the ncAA to the tRNA. We designed and synthetized the novel ncAA Nγ‑2‑cyanobenzothiazol‑6‑yl‑L‑asparagine ( CBT-asparagine ). This ncAA has the chemical ability of perform a highly specific covalent binding reaction, which we wanted to incorporate it into our target protein. Therefore, we created a library of aaRS with random mut"

2. Browsing on S-Din: When surfing on S-Din, we found UV detection to be a hot area. Annual projects statistics is on the right side.
3. Searching the previous project: Standing on the shoulders of giants, we wondered what ideas our predecessors could give us. We searched for ‘UV detection'. With data analysis and score, we found ETH_Zurich 2012 and marked it.
4. Intelligent recommendation: Based on the database, S-Din recommended us to use a device from Colombia 2014. After browsing its information, we decided to accept the suggestion from S-Din.
5. Editing the circuit: We deleted some extra parts of the ETH_Zurich device because we decided to use only the UV sensor. The surveillance system showed that the safety level of our circuit is low risk (Upper right corner).
6. Simulation:We ran the mathematical models in our software.  Picture.1 shows the result.

In the information era, it is almost impossible to achieve success through one’s personal e- ffort, and synthetic biology is without excepti- on. To make our software better meet the re- quirement of synthetic biologists, we collabo- rate with OCU-China, as well as BroadRun- Baltimore.
The team members in OCU-China told us their most frequently-used synthetic biolo- gy assisting software, including Primer P- remier 5, SnapGene, MEGA6, etc. Based on their feedback, we analyze the advan- tage and disadvantage of these public or commercial software to improve our user interface design. BroadRun-Baltimore is a high school team from the US, whose student leader, Maris- sa, has a lot of experience in the presenta- tion of science research."

RHIT,2018,Team:RHIT#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"°C freezer, or to cool down various things in the lab.
Materials
95% ethanol (this is what we had in stock but any percentage can be used if diluted correctly)
Pressurized CO2 container
Dewar Flask
Procedure
Diluting 95% ethanol
The basic ratio is approximately 70 mL of 95% ethanol diluted with 25 mL of water. This ratio can be multiplied for the volume necessary for the dewar, which is approximately 500-550 mL of solution. This turns out to be 350 or 420 mL of 95% ethanol mixed with 125 or 150 mL of pure water, respectively.
Carefully make dry ice or seek help from someone who can. Put it in a safe container. Not a lot of dry ice is necessary to cool down the ethanol in the dewar. Add the dry ice a LITTLE at a time, so the ethanol doesn't bubble over and make a mess. Do not handle dry ice without a glove or something to protect your skin or breathe it in. Put the lid back on the dewar to keep the solution cool and prevent evaporation.

We chose to build on to their project and got their six cloned sMMO genes Bba_K1390001 (mmoB) Bba_K1390002 (mmoC) Bba_K1390003 (mmoD) Bba_K1390004 (mmoX) Bba_K1390005 (mmoY) Bba_K1390006 (mmoZ) , which were not available (yet) via the BioBrick system. In addition will we clone the mmoG gene of the sMMO operon which is thought to encode a chaperone (MMOG) involved in folding of the other MMO proteins5,6. MMOG might also be involved in regulating the sMMO operon by binding to a regulatory protein called MMOR4,5. The Braunschweig team used a plasmid with the chaperones GroES, GroEL and TF to help fold the different MMO proteins.
Summary:
Our team wants to engineer E. coli so that it can break down methane by cloning and expressing the sMMO of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath).
We got the sMMO genes, mmoX, mmoY, mmoZ, mmoB, mmoC, and, mmoD, from iGEM 2014 team Braunschweig, Germany.
We will clone the gene mmoG from genomic M. capsulatus (Bath) DNA ourselves.
Soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO)
The sMMO operon of M. capsulatus (Bath), figure 1, has ten known protein encoding genes, summarized in Table 1. Two genes, mmoQ, and, mmoS, coding for the proteins MMOQ and MMOS can sense copper and play a role in regulating transcription of the sMMO operon3–5. A third gene, mmoR, encoding the protein 'MMOR', is a transcriptional activator of the whole sMMO operon3–5. Since we want to clone the genes that form the enzyme complex sMMO and use them to construct our own sMMO operon for expression in E. coli, the genes mmoQ, mmoS, and mmoR are not relevant and thus excluded from our project.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," capital funding would be forthcoming. Another option would be to partner with an industrial group. But it depends on how revolutionary the technology is.
Fionn asked what the government would think about it. Nicolas said the Scottish government would probably look on such a project favourably, both because of economic benefits and environmental benefits. He mentioned a company that had looked into something like a biorefinery; all that held it back was economic problems.
Graeme Reid; University of Edinburgh
Instruction of biology students at the University of Edinburgh is the responsibility of the Biology Teaching Organisation (BTO).
Graeme Reid trained as a biochemist. He is now Director of the BTO. He was interviewed in person by team members Allan Crossman and Fionn Tynan-O'Mahony.
Allan asked Graeme to tell us about his role as Director of Teaching.
Graeme said the BTO took in about 300 undergraduates a year, each starting a four-year course. There are also taught postgraduate programmes, the number of which are growing. His main work is overseeing undergraduate teaching. There are 126 courses run by the school, though a lot of these are 4th year courses [note: in 4th year, students specialise heavily, so each course has relatively few students]. The teaching staff is very diverse, teaching a lot of different areas.
Allan asked what the term ""synthetic biology"" really means.
Graeme said he'd never really understood what ""synthetic biology"" meant, but said it seemed like extreme genetic engineering. The whole idea is to make new organisms, but in reality you have to start from pre-existing organisms. Largely it involves making very major changes to genomes using genetic engineering.
Graeme mentioned the project to make the simplest possible bacterium [note: Mycoplasma laboratorium] where seemingly unnecessary genes are removed to see if it still survives; a bit like ""extreme physiology"" in olden days, when surgeons cut out organs to see if patients still survived. What can you do without?
Allan asked about the future of biotechnology. He asked whether pharmaceuticals are, and will be, the main application.
Graeme said that in the West, pharmaceuticals are the most economically significant area, but wasn't sure if this was true in the rest of the world. He mentioned food production as a significant area.
He noted that, some decades ago, there were fairly major advances in genetically modified foods, but the UK public wasn't ready to accept them, and the press overreacted to one piece of mass"

RANZYME B
Inflammation
Granzyme B & Chronic Inflammation
Purpose
Introduction
INFLAMMATION
Inflammation is the body's natural response to harmful stimuli, such as cell surface receptors, bacteria, or viruses (Nordqvist, 2015). These foreign stimuli trigger the immune response, which allow for increased blood flow to the inflamed site (MedlinePlus). The increased blood flow carries immune cells to the inflammatory site in order to kill off invaders and clean up dead cells (Wallach et al., 2013; Hochreiter-Hufford & Ravichandran, 2013). Inflammation is characterized by the Latin phrase, ""calor, dolor, rubor, and tumor,"" which means heat, pain, redness, and swelling (Ciaccia L et al. 2011).
GRANZYME B & CHRONIC INFLAMMATION (""The Secret Killer"")
While inflammation is normally a beneficial and even essential part of the immune response, chronic inflammation (also known as prolonged inflammation) is associated with a multitude of different diseases, such as diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis"

The supernatants of the cultures cultivated in MOPS media supplemented with 1 mM and 10 mM ATP were further analyzed with LC-MS. Therefore, the cultures were centrifuged, and the supernatant analyzed with LC-MS. AMP, ADP and ATP were measured, but only AMP was substantially above the detection limit in nearly all samples. AMP was quantified based on the standard curve shown in Figure 18. ADP and ATP could not be quantified. The results are shown in Figure 17.
Figure 17: : Results of the LC-MS analysis of the supernatants of the cultures cultivated in MOPS media supplemented with 1 mM and 10 mM ATP. Measured AMP concentrations were standardized to the corresponding final optical densities.
AMP could be detected in all samples except for the supernatants of the strains expressing pelB-SP-PtNTT2 and TAT-SP-PtNTT2 cultivated in MOPS media supplemented with 10 mM ATP.
Figure 18: Standard curve for AMP using 10 mM, 1 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.01 mM and 0.001 mM of AMP. The standard curve was used to quantify AMP in the supernatant of the cultivations carried out in ATP supplemented MOPS media.
The samples from the cultivation performed in MOPS media supplemented with 1 mM ATP, the highest concentration was reached by E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) with 0.387 mM, followed by E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 0.294 mM. Of the samples of the cultivation carried out in MOPS media supplemented with 10 mM, the highest AMP concentration was measured for the native transporter variant with a value of 4.201 mM. The second highest AMP concentration was measured for PtNTT2(31-575) with 3.886 mM of AMP, followed by PtNTT2(66-575) with a concentration of 2.910 mM.     These measurements verify that ATP, ADP or AMP are exported in exchange for ATP, which in case of ATP and ADP are consequently converted into AMP. Given that the measurements could only be performed once, not conclusion regarding the significance of the measured concentrations can be drawn.

     Brick2 RdhANP combined with a biosensor ( BBa_K2462007 )
     As we designed our project, we have wondered if there exists any regulatory mechanism to make the expression of RdhANP more precisely. We searched the information and find a biosensor created by team Peking-China in 2013. This biosensor can function when it runs into substances analogous to salicylic acid. And some of the substances they tested can serve as the substrates of RdhANP, like 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. We then linked this sensor( BBa_J61051 )made by 2013 Peking-China with RdhANP and the enzyme is supposed to express when it's substrates are available.
     Brick7 Combination of promoters in brick4 ( BBa_K2462004 ) with RBS（ BBa_B0030 ） to make ( BBa_K2462006 )
     We improve a previous part( BBa_B0030 ) by combining it with the promoter used in Bacillus megaterium. As the strength of RBS(BBa_B0030) has already been tested and the promoters of these two composite bricks are suitable for Bacillus megaterium, it’s quite convenient for other teams to use."

Measure Abs600 of these 1:10 diluted cultures
Dilute the cultures further to a target Abs600 of 0.02 in a final volume of 12ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube (covered with foil to block light).
Take 500 μL samples of the diluted cultures at 0 hours into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, prior to incubation. (At each time point 0 hours and 6 hours, you will take a sample from each of the 8 devices, two                           colonies                           per                           device, for a total of 16 eppendorf tubes with 500 μL samples per time point, 32 samples total). Place the samples on ice.
Incubate the remainder of the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm for 6 hours.
Take 500 μL samples of the cultures at 6 hours of incubation into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Place samples on ice.
At the end of sampling point we need to measure your samples (Abs600 and fluorescence measurement), see the below for details.
Measurement:
Pipette 100 μl of each sample into each well. From 500 μl samples in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, 4 replicate samples of colony #1 should be pipetted into wells in rows A, B, C and D. Replicate samples of colony #2 should be                       pipetted                       into wells in rows E, F, G and H. Be sure to include 8 control wells containing 100uL each of only LB+chloramphenicol on each plate in column 9.                       The setting used were the same as those used for the calibration protocols.
Layout for Abs600 and Fluorescence measurement:
At the end of the experiment, we have two plates to read. We have one plate for each time point: 0 and 6 hours. On each plate we will read both fluorescence and absorbance.
Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E.coli cultures protocol
This procedure can be used to calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit (CFU) counts, which are directly relatable to the cell concentration of the culture, i.e. viable cell counts per mL. This protocol assumes that one bacterial                       cell                       will give rise to one colony.
For the CFU protocol, we will count colonies for our two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and our two Negative Control (BBa_R0040)"

Future scenarios
“Planning is bringing the future into the present so that    you can do something about it” - Alan Lakein
What would be the potential applications of CryptoGErM in the near    and far future?
In this part of Human Practices, we explore the future scenarios of    the introduction of the CryptoGErM system to the world.
With all these fictional scenarios we give a deep insight on the    repercussions, applications and consequences that CryptoGErM would have    if introduced as a daily life system.
The scenarios are presented as fictional digital news and articles    from a futuristic and unreal city called New    Groningen in The Netherlands in the near and far    future, where the CryptoGErM system has been introduced,    followed by an explanation of the current reasons behind its    conceptualization.
We present them as digital news in a mobile device, based on the    prediction that the UN Intellectual property agency’s chief made in an    interview to La Tribune de Geneve, stating that newspapers will be    replaced by digital versions by 2040.
""In a few years, there will no longer be printed    newspapers as we know it today” “It’s an evolution. There’s no good or    bad about it. There are studies showing that they will disappear by    2040” - Francis Curry
The last existing Public Library has disappeared!
First fictional scenario
What if in the far future we start to run out of space to    accommodate the growing world population? Would we be able to find    suitable places to inhabit without damaging natural areas? What if we    use existent spaces to accommodate the growing population without the    necessity of building new human settlements protecting the green areas?    Have we thought about it?
According to the UN DESA report; “World Population Prospects: The      2015 Revision”, by 2050 the world population is expected to reach to      9.7 billion; the available living space could not be sustainable to      accommodate the rapidly-growing amount of people. Such raising in the      population, probably, will see humanity looking for more      space to make sustainable the living of new generations, without using      the green areas.
Within this fictional scenario, CryptoGErM could"

LCC experiments showed that the two mutants where able to heat up there own medium compared to the UPC + and UPC- strain. Growth kinetic experiments were done ass well. These showed that the UPC + and the two mutants growth much slower than the UPC – strain, due to uncoupling and thus no ATP production.
They made a  proposal for an ethical code of conduct for synthetic biology based on the hot yeast project.

The patients should fully know the details about the project, what benefice it might bring and the risk the patients might take. Seperated from that, nonmaleficence is the also an important thing to consider, no matter for animal expriment or clinical trail of our dialysis device. For all these kinds of experiment, we should get the permission from the authority who is responsible for this to make sure to avoid the unnesscessary suffering for animals and harm to people. We don’t want our patients to get worse after the research.
Those principles play important roles in our animal experiment design. We compare many methods to establish the mouse model, but due to our lack of pracitce in gavage, we decided not to take risk to do this, according to the nonmaleficence principle. We replace the standard yeast extraction gavage method to the adenine feed method to establish the HUA mouse model to reduce the hurt as much as possible. And she suggested us to put our permisson of the Institutional Review Board for our animal experiment on the poster to clarify it. We adopoted this idea.
Talking with General Product Designer of Sichuan Nigale Biomedical Ltd., Fei Li
Our project this year includes the design of analogous dialysis device, therefore we talked with Mr. Li Fei, who is product designer and engineering department section chief of hospital products division of Sichuan Nigale Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Nigale has extensive experience in design and production of devices related to dialysis equip, so we consulted Mr. Li Fei about the design, patent application, the later production promotion of our device.
We firstly introduced our project and the device in our project to Mr. Li Fei, and asked him for advice. He thought our idea and design is outstanding, but we should pay close attention to quality and security of our device. Because security is of critical importance, and the performance could be improved in the process of using. We posed a question that how to deal with problems could happen in the hemodialysis pipelines, such as infection, Mr. Li emphasized that the quality and the matching of products is the factor that should be consider primarily. Then we asked Mr. Li what we should take care while we were to apply for patent, He told us that the patent includes two kinds, one is patent of the method, one is patent of the device, the former is invisible while the later is tangible. We can try both parallel. Although the later can not"

Harvard,2008,Team:Harvard#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," deficient S. oneidensis
Overview: By genetically manipulating S. oneidensis, it has been found that noticeable differences of current production can be detected. We wish to control current production by introducing inducible systems in these mutant strains of S. oneidensis. These differences of current production can be detected by a computer, allowing biological systems and electrical devices to be integrated.
The basis of our project lies in the discovery that by knocking out the mtrB gene, a current production gene of S. oneidensis, noticeable differences of current production can be detected. Therefore, this allows the current production of S. oneidensis to act more than just an on/off switch.
The first step of our project was then to test this hypothesis and also to understand the current production behavior of wildtype S. oneidensis and the mutant S. oneidensis (annotated as mtrB). Therefore, we ran a test with microbial fuel cells, one strain in each cell, and allowed the current production to be measured for approximately one day. In literature, mtrB produces approximately 20 to 25 percent of the current or wildtype strains.
As shown in the graph above, the results of our experiment matched those in literature. We also observed that wildtype and mtrB strains have very different current production behavior, with wildtype producing current immediately after lactate injection, and mtrB producing current much more gradually. This difference in behavior can allow for more accurate differentiation of current production between wildtype and mtrB strains when integrated with electrical devices. We wish then build on these results and build inducible systems that will allow us to control the current production.
Lac-inducible Strains
Overview: We genetically engineered mtrB knock-out S. oneidensis MR-1 by introducing the mtrB gene on a lactose-inducible system.  Specifically, we tested engineered mtrB knock-out S. oneidensis MR-1 with high lacQPI at the p15A origin. Our results show the possibility that we successfully complemented the mtrB knock-out as high levels of current were detected in one such strain.
Our end goal was to develop inducible systems for electrical current production in S. oneidensis MR-1. In our microbial fuel cells, we were able to test a lac-inducible system where LacI repression of the current-production gene expression in mtrB knock-out S. oneidensis MR-1 would be alleviated by the addition of IPTG. That is, the addition if IPTG to such a system"
UEA-JIC_Norwich,2011,Team:UEA-JIC Norwich#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", and so in the evening (LATE into the evening) we ran  PCR protocol to try and amplify the specific gene we wanted from the plasmid (Cph8) We also continued to arrange the UK meet up, adding up numbers that were coming and trying to find speakers. We also added some finishing touches to the logo and placed it onto a business card for the team.
Monday 4th july - In the morning we ran a gel of our PCR products from Friday to test whether we had managed to amplify the specific gene we wanted. We also spent more time planning the UK iGEM get together, and decided on the protocol we would follow when transforming moss.
Tuesday 5th july - The gel from yesterday showed no DNA products from our PCR. We performed another PCR procedure using an adapted protocol and a different polymerase (phusion polymerase, as this has a proof reading ability and is therefore better suited for cloning). However, a gel from this was also unsuccessful. We returned to the drawing board and found a potential fault in the reverse primer we'd designed. Having corrected the error, we plan to order the adapted primer tomorrow. In light of specific numbers for the UK conference we began booking rooms and caterers. Having decided on a selection marker for algae transformations (arginine biosynthesis) we secured some arginine and autoclaved it ready for use tomorrow.

Arizona_State,2017,Team:Arizona State#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," system described up above to bind to the regulatory proteins to attach to the receptor binding site in the inducible promoter to initiate transcription of the GFP. By mini-prepping various sender systems from ASU's 2016 iGEM team senders, and then sequencing, we can determine whether or not mCherry is a good indicator of AHL synthase production
Battle of the AHLs
Using past research and experimental data from many sources, including the experiments performed in the paper written by Spencer and Hasty, 2016, we have chosen to study the issue of “crosstalk” in hopes of solving the issue so that more complex circuits can be built down the road. Crosstalk occurs when cells that receive AHL signals are also able to receive AHLs from different QS systems. When QS pathways operate without communication between unwanted cells, the pathways are orthogonal and potentially viable options for bioengineering new synthetic circuits. Reducing crosstalk will allow us to increase the complexity of the circuits in the cells allowing them to carry out more complex tasks while working independently of each other (Purnick et al, 2009).
On this side quest, multiple sender AHLs are preparing for battle against the three evil receivers: LuxR, LasR and TraR. With the available data on how single senders interact with a receiver, this quest aims to fight the evil receivers with TWO senders at a time and gather the results. This battle royale should give some new results on how the receivers act when attacked from two sides with different concentrations of AHLs. Understanding the enemy will give the upper hand to synthetic biology by adding new combinations of senders to the known registries of synthetic circuits. In the great battle, the winning combinations will express either a higher or lower GFP than a single sender would alone. This data, along with any new orthogonal pathways found in the process, will make the attack on the receivers all worthwhile. This is because adding new data on how to manipulate circuits beyond the ‘all or nothing’ responses of single sender tests will provide a higher level of control regarding gene expression. This level of control is important when a circuit needs to be made to express at a specific level versus just expressing the gene.
This experiment explores BL21 E. coli bacteria that has been transformed with our sender plasmids, in the modular sender vector (MSV). MSV is used as a vehicle to artificially carry foreign genetic material into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed. The sequence that includes the antibiotic resistance marker and the replication origin is held within the backbone of the plasmid. The image below"

Stock of Sodium cholate (in sterile water) was diluted with minimal media to make up to a concentration of 10µg/ml. The control contains no Sodium cholate. 6µl of normalized sample was added to 194µl of either Sodium Cholate minimal media or Sodium cholate free minimal media (control).

The device was then further designed to lyse the cells upon entering the intestine thus to release the synthetic colicins produced within the cell during the time spent in the stomach. This was also a design to prevent the release of live GMO into the environment. The cloning of pSB1C3 -chiWX was in progress during the wiki freeze.

Bacteriocins
Introduction
Bacteriocins are proteins secreted by bacteria to kill other similar species of bacteria in order to gain a competitive advantage within a niche. They have 3 common domains; a receptor binding domain, which binds to specific receptors on the surface of the target cell; a translocation domain, responsible for getting the bacteriocin into the target cell; and a cytotoxic domain, responsible for target cell damage. The cytotoxic domain can take many"

#3 - Chemoreceptor Library
Prologue
The objective of the “Legendary TAR librarians” was the generation of a mutant library of the chemoreceptor Tar (Taxis to Aspartate and Repellants). Tar is one of five membrane-bound chemoreceptors E. coli uses for chemotaxis [1]. The receptor is well characterized and an X-ray structure is available (see PDB file ). Residues of the Tar ligand-binding domain that interact with L-aspartate were identified from the pdb-file. Here, we aimed to identify novel receptors by applying directed evolution to Tar chemoreceptors. To enable E. coli to perceive novel substances five amino acid residues in the ligand binding site"

BLUE LIGHT REPRESSIBLE SYSTEM
Figure 7. Downsides of using chemical inducers in bioproduction, and corresponding advantages of using light.
Watch the animation to find out more!
Where induction of gene expression is necessary, chemical inducers are staples owing to their capability to trigger high expression levels [16]. However, the drawbacks are numerous: potential cellular toxicity, non-reversible induction, delayed diffusion, and high costs [18] [19]. All these problems are exacerbated in large-scale biomanufacturing (Figure 7).
Enter optogenetics. The allure of being able to manipulate cellular behaviours using light is causing optogenetics to make waves in the field of synthetic biology. Light-based induction offers many advantages: non-toxicity, reversibility, precise spatiotemporal control, tunability, and availability [20] [21] (Figure 7). Hence, optogenetics offers a compelling alternative to traditional chemical induction, particularly in biomanufacturing, a view that has been                    corroborated by several experts in the field.
We adopted the EL222 blue light system, thus renouncing the use of chemical inducers. Originating from the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594, EL222 is a photosensitive DNA binding protein, with a N-terminal light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding domain. Irradiation by blue light of wavelength 450nm exposes the hitherto sequestered HTH, facilitating dimerization and subsequent DNA binding [22].
In Coup Dy'état, the repressible system was employed to facilitate dynamic gene regulation (see: Cell-Machine Interface ). With energy conservation in mind, blue light is shone during the shorter growth phase, and switched off during the lengthier production phase to derepress the expression of enzymes. This is achieved by placing the DNA binding site of EL222 between the -35 and -10 hexamers of the consensus promoter in E. coli, creating the blue light repressible promoter PBLrep [22]. As a result, EL222 acts as a repressor, blocking the binding of RNA polymerase and repress gene expression in the presence of blue light. In the dark, RNA polymerase can now bind, and gene expression takes place (Figure 8).
