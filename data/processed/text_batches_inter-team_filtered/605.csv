Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Project#PC Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"-luc and C-luc [11], we varied the spacer length from 5 bp to 107 bp (Figure 6) to find how it affects the performance of our PC reporter system. Results showed that the PC reporter system works with a preference for spacer length of about 21 bp and 33 bp, presenting a period of 10-11 bp; this is consistent with the length of DNA double helix in one period (10.4 bp) [12].
Figure 6. The effect of spacer length variation on the performance of PC reporter system. Spacer is defined as the sequence between the sgRNA pairs. The spacer length varies from 5 bp to 107 bp. Note that the effect of spacer length exhibits a period of 10-11bp, which is consistent with the structure of DNA double helix.
Taking all the above together, the final design of our PC reporter system was determined: both fragments of split luciferase fused to N-terminus of dCas9, PAM-out sgRNA orientation, and spacer length of 21 bp. Next we set out to validate whether PC reporter can read out the sequence-specific information using crude PCR product instead of well-purified DNA samples.
Applying PC reporter to crude NAD product
We first carried out specificity test using PC reporter system to distinguish the target plasmid (BBa_K909009) from different kinds of non-specific controls (Figure 7a,b,c). The results showed that the luminescence intensity using the positive target is significantly higher than that of non-specific controls (Figure 7d).

(b) Control with only one site recognized by ""half pair"". (c) Negative control with no site to be recognized. (d) Experimental data. Error bars denote s.d.; n=3.
Also, we need to test the sensitivity of PC reporter system. As shown in Figure 8, PC reporter can still work at the concentration of ~0.1nM target for both plasmid (Figure 8a) and crude PCR product (Figure 8b).

When he got to know that we wanted to fight IBD, he pointed out to us that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), which is an important factor of his ongoing research, is a molecule that has the ability to promote regeneration of cells in the inflammatory regions. Prof. Lu introduced us detailed mechanisms of this growth factor and emphasized that in different human tissues, EGF will have different effects. Therefore, as a growth-promoting factor, EGF may bring about the risk of over-proliferation and even cancer. He reminded us that we have to pay great attention to safety issues.
In the end, Prof. Lu encouraged us to be ambitious and have a try. It turns out that this interview became the foundation of our project!
In our project, we chose intestinal bowel disease as our object of study. To have a better understanding of IBD and obtain the first view of the current situation of patients, we contacted two doctors and set up an interview with them.
One is Ge Wensong, who comes from Shanghai Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The other is Zhang Shengyu, who is from Beijing Xiehe Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine,Tsinghua University.
Here is the summary of the interview script. (Q= question, A= answear)
Q: Human diseases include not only intestinal diseases, but also many other diseases which threaten human health seriously. So what’s the reason that made you choose to do the research in the field of intestinal diseases?
A1: Diseases involved in gastroenterology are complicated. One of the most prominent disease is intestinal diseases. There are so many different types of intestinal diseases and a major part of them consists of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal tumors. Studies of intestinal disease are the core research of intestinal diseases nowadays. Personally, I’m very interested in the field of intestinal tumor.
A2: There are three reasons:
Upon the development of social economy and the change of life styles, disease spectrum of digestive system also has been changing. For example, the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease is closely related to the the process of industrialization in Europe and America. And I antipate that intestinal diseases will be one of the most common diseases of digestive system in the 21st century in our country. And the obvious increase of the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease in our country in recent years proves this opinion.
During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients. For example,"

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". Setting up the interested research field: After logging in, we set up our interest. Because we were curious about UV detection, we chose DETECTION.
2. Browsing on S-Din: When surfing on S-Din, we found UV detection to be a hot area. Annual projects statistics is on the right side.
3. Searching the previous project: Standing on the shoulders of giants, we wondered what ideas our predecessors could give us. We searched for ‘UV detection'. With data analysis and score, we found ETH_Zurich 2012 and marked it.
4. Intelligent recommendation: Based on the database, S-Din recommended us to use a device from Colombia 2014. After browsing its information, we decided to accept the suggestion from S-Din.
5. Editing the circuit: We deleted some extra parts of the ETH_Zurich device because we decided to use only the UV sensor. The surveillance system showed that the safety level of our circuit is low risk (Upper right corner).
6. Simulation:We ran the mathematical models in our software.  Picture.1 shows the result.

Anyway, we now know that our lacZ sequence is correct and it will be put under the control of the desired promoter during the following weeks. Unfortunately, because of the spurious expression of lacZ, we won't be able to perform a blue/white colony screening after the ligations that involve lacZ gene. For this reason, we are not sure that the blue colony picked on June 18th from A5bis plate is correctly ligated! We decided to purify it and to sequence it anyway.

Michigan,2016,Team:Michigan#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," tube. This is also a measurement of weight, so you need to do a little math based on the concentration of the vector DNA to figure out how many uL this translates to.
5) Add nuclease free water to the tube so that the total volume is 19uL. This amount will vary based on the volumes of DNA you added.
6) Add 1uL of T4 DNA Ligase.
7) Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down a few time.
8) Incubate at 16C overnight OR 10 minutes at room temperature.
9) Put in 65C hot water bath for 10 minutes.
10) Chill on ice, then either transform into cells or store at -20C.
PCR
PCR allows for the rapid copying of a very small amount of DNA. It is also useful because it can only amplify specific regions you want it to, letting you isolate segments of DNA that you care about. Use the New England Biolabs website to calculate the program that is optimal for your particular PCR and primers.
KEEP ALL REAGENTS AND THE REACTION ITSELF ON ICE THROUGHOUT THIS PROCEDURE! Also, take extra care to avoid any contamination. PCRs are notoriously finicky and even a tiny bit of DNA contamination will get amplified and can ruin the reaction. It is far better to use an extra pipet tip here and there than to repeat a PCR reaction because you didn’t.
1) Determine the number of PCR reactions you will be performing, then add 2.
2) Multiply all the following amounts by this new number to create the “master mix” for the PCR. In a microcentrifuge tube add  25uL Q5 2X high fidelity master mix (NEB), 0.625uL 40uM forward primer, 0.625uL 40uM reverse primer, 23.75uL Nuclease Free Water.
3) Mix the master mix by vortexing for a few seconds.
4) In small PCR tubes, on ice, add 2uL of the template DNA from each sample.
5) Add 48uL of the master mix to each PCR tube. CHANGE TIPS FOR EACH TUBE.
6) Load the PCR tubes onto the heat cycler.
7) Heat cycle through the heating program recommended for your primer  and sample by the NEB website.

Conduct plating under the filter hood. Add antibiotic to molten agar whilst in bottle, such that the antibiotic (Chl or Amp) is diluted by 1000 times. Then gently mix. Pour just enough agar to cover the surface of the petri dishes. Plates should take ~30mins to set.
Then add volume of E. coli according to protocol, using beads to spread across petri dish.

Restriciton digest of SB1C3, pBAD33, and pBAD/HisB completely, using the 1.2 protocol and consulting the master table for the correct buffer and restiction enzymes.
Resultant Gel
100mL 1% agarose made up, small plate loaded and remainder left in bottle on shelf.
Total volume per tube is 35uL. Each tube’s contents split into two wells (17.5µL per well), and gel was run on 80V p.d. for 45 minutes.
* Gel can help tell if any digestion occurred at all - if no digestion occurred plasmid would still remain circular, and circular plasmid would encounter more resistance migrating through the gel matrix than linear plasmid of the same size and hence appear to be bigger than expected when compared against the ladder.

ITU_MOBGAM_Turkey,2013,Team:ITU MOBGAM Turkey#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," on these reasons, our kill switch system consists of two parts.
How does it work?
The first part is just to keep alive in the presence of glucose. MazE would be produced by the sense of glucose and a weak constitutive promoter (BBa_J23102) is used for MazF production. Thus, MazF would be found in equilibrium with MazE. In the absence of glucose, amount of MazF would be more than MazE so cell would go to death.
Toxin-Antitoxin Module: MazE-MazF
Figure 1: The multiple levels of autoregulation of the MazF–MazE toxin–antitoxin system.
a | MazE and MazF are synthesized from the same promoter. MazE forms a complex with MazF under normal growth conditions. b | Under stress conditions, MazE is subjected to cleavage by an ATP-dependent protease. As released MazF cleaves its own mRNA, the expression of MazF is autoregulated. MazF activity leads to the arrest of bacterial cell growth and to eventual cell death. It has been shown that a few mRNAs are resistant to MazF in E. Coli.
The second part is to prevent the overproduction of cells. A promoter that sense auto inducible 2 molecules is used to control MazF production. If cells reproduce more, AI-2 is produced by cells and this promoter would sense AI-2, so MazF production would be increased. (Engelberg-Kulka, Hazan et al. 2005) Hence, MazE and MazF equilibrium would be broken and cell would go to death.

Main Goal
Natural cycles have always fascinated mankind, probably due to the mysterious mechanisms involved in them and the power they exert in our everyday life. Since the dawn of synthetic biology, engineering oscillatory systems has been a recurrent topic, being Ellowitz's repressilator a classical example. Nevertheless, to date no iGEM team has accomplished the implementation of a robust oscillatory system. That will be our challenge for this year's iGEM project.
To reach our goal we designed a synthethic circuit that links to the endogenous circadian rhythm of Synechocystis PCC6803. As a proof of concept we are going to engineer the first light-rechargeable biological lamp: Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells that emit light only by night while recovering and producing the substrates during the day. We strongly believe this will serve as an enabling tool to any project requiring time control over a biological behaviour independently of the user's input.
Furthermore, the characterization of this chassis is a fundamental step to explore new systems with minimal inputs to replace E. coli, for example, in the biotechnological industry in order to achieve greener processes.

These results should act as a preview of what we expect our final biobrick containing E. coli species to produce as well as allowing us to establish LD2 as a positive control for this experiment.
AmdA amplified from the genomic prep of R. Erythropolis shows bands just greater than 1500 base pairs in lanes 2,4-6,9, and 12-13. Lane 14 was a negative control. The expected size of AmdA is 1566 base pairs.
The two labelled lanes show amplification at 3000 base pairs from a confirmation colony PCR using the biobrick primers. The expected size of the Ant operon with the biobrick bookends is about 3100 base pairs.
Strong amplification at just above 3000 base pairs from the CarAd PCR using mutagenic primers. Since PSB1C3 is 2070 base pairs and CarAd is 989 base pairs the amplification should run at about 3059 base pairs. 3 different amounts of template DNA were tested in lanes 2-7 as indicated and a positive control showed weaker amplification in lanes 8-9 at about 4000 base pairs.

Desulfurization
Following on from the progress in the previous week of the mutagenesis, dszB(PstI mutated)-Y63F and dszA(PstI1 mutated)-PstI3 mutagenesis were performed. The gel below shows the digest confirmation.
Another approach was tried to do mutagenesis with a quicker pace. In this approach, after the PCR mutagenesis, the PCR products were purified. Afterwards they were incubated with T4 PNK and ligase. After heat inactivating ligase and T4 PNK, the products were DpnI digested. Subsequently another round of DNA purification was performed. However, the results were unsatisfactory after the digest confirmation.  Sequencing results came back. dszA (PstI1 and PstI3 mutated) and dszB(PstI and Y63F mutated) were good. However dszC (PstI1 and PstI2 mutated) had an insertion next to the PstI1 cut site. Mutagenesis was repeated on the dszC(PstI2 mutated). dszB(PstI and Y63F mutated)-NotI and dszA"

Using multiple switches that regulate the production of reporter proteins with distinct emission peaks, with numerous wells in tandem, hundreds of cancers and other diseases could be screened for simultaneously, all using a single blood sample.
We interviewed several doctors to gain further insight into how our design could be optimized for clincial use. These feature on our integrated human practices page .
Other methods of quantifying miRNAs
To further consider the applications of our project, we also looked at current methods of quantifying miRNAs in qPCR and microarrays. We saw that both had their limitations, and a novel method was required if miRNAs were to be used clinically as a biomarker for cancer.
qPCR
qPCR is an accurate and sensitive method of quantifying miRNAs. To provide a common sequence feature for amplification of miRNAs, a polyadenylation step is required. This adds an oligonucleotide tail to the end of the miRNA to which the primer binds to. After this, a reverse transcription transcription step is carried out to produce cDNA. Standard qPCR can then be used. [15]
This multi-step process is labour-intensive and as such, it is not suitable for scaling and would therefore be unsuitable for mass screening. Additionally, the enzymes and reagents are costly when attempting to quantify numerous different miRNAs.
Microarrays
It can be challenging to develop probes and hybridization conditions that work well to detect numerous miRNAs at once. Consequently, microarrays typically have issues with cross-hybridization [16] leading to false positives. Furthermore, results are inconsistent even from the same platform. [17]
We also spoke to Dan Pregibon, an expert who developed a new way of detecting miRNAs. He was intrigued by our idea to use toehold switches to sense these miRNAs. He said that our method could be used in less developed countries and to provide point of care information, in a way his would not. However, he explained that while his sensor has undergone significant testing, it is not ready for clinical use until miRNAs have been more robustly characterized. The same would apply to our sensor, however, research into miRNA diagnostics is very promising. It is likely to only be a matter of time until miRNAs have been sufficiently characterized to be used in clinical diagnosis.
Applications to other disease
There many other diseases where screening has the potential"

Part Extraction Standards
All information about the parts that are essential in experimental     setup of iGEM projects has been utilized. The information for the parts     available provided with all three 384 well plates in Spring 2010 distribution     have been standardized. Our standardization criteria have been discussed     in detail under Database Standardization. ER diagram has been generated     which simply describes the organization of the data. Around 70% of the     parts information has been fetched by the custom parsing code from XML     and Excel files provided by iGEM. Rest of the data had to be collected     and organized manually as the organization of these data cannot be standardized     to generate an algorithm. This step was one of the most time consuming     steps in our project. For each construct and Biobrick the information     collected was; Activity, Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor     for promoters and Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor information     valid for synthesized molecules (mostly proteins and RNA fragments etc.)

We decided to look at the same level of exposure (50 ppb) but for increasing intervals of time (ranging from the initial 10 days and increasing to 25, 50 and 100 days of exposure. The results of these simulations are shown below
Here we can see that even though the increase in lead in the bones is linear with time, the concentration of lead in the blood appears to begin reaching a saturation point. To explore this trend, we ran 10 simulations, increasing the duration of exposure by 10 days each time. The results of this simulation are shown below.
To get a better look at just the blood concentrations, below is a zoomed-in portion of the same graph just focussing on blood-lead levels for the first 200 days. You should note that as the duration of exposure increases, so does the variation in blood lead level, meaning that the severity for the same level of contamination will be more of a range than one distinct value.
To examine the effect of severity of exposure over the same period of time, we ran simulations of a 100 day exposure to different levels of contamination range including 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppb.
Again a similar relationship is observed. Blood-lead levels do reach different levels of saturation but now we see that the rate at which lead is absorbed by the bones increases with contamination severity.
This model provides a quantified approach relating the level and duration of lead exposure with the concentration of lead in the blood. Whether it is in estimating the severity of the events in Flint, Michigan or in detecting the threshold of exposure without noticeable side effects, this model could be the first step in better realizing how our bodies take up, store and slowly get rid of lead.

Stochastic model giving insight on parameters
Tuesday, October 4th
We modeled the XOR module with a stochastic model, as the sites are discrete and not continuous and thus binding events might be sensitive to stochasticity. In this process, we figured out that the concentration of GFP was rapidly increasing due to fast flipping rates. It is very unlikely in biological systems. Thus, this model helped us debug an estimated paramter

Both inputs are present. There is an immediate GFP response, followed by degradation.

This meeting was a turning point of our iGEM adventure. We reviewed all the experiments that had been done so far. Most of them concerns quorum sensing and its non-orthogonality. We summed up the results in a three-layer graphs.
The dry lab part presented for the first time a whole-cell model. With the parameters estimated, the model actually implemented an XOR gate. However, leakiness of promoters and crosstalk seemed to be affecting the robustness of our design.
As all our experiments were done in our plasmids, we have to standardize them into the Biobrick format. This year, the deadline corresponds to the delivery in Boston of the biobricks. Thus, it is becoming slowly urgent...

Thus, the maximum selectivity, being reduced to the activity of a single fiber, is required for the measurement interfaces. Unfortunately, this search for selectivity will lead to a search for proximity between the electrode and the fibers, at the detriment of the nerve’s physical integrity. Indeed, the risk of infection or trauma to the body increases with the invasiveness of the electrodes. Electrodes can therefore be classified according to criteria such as selectivity and invasiveness. The ideal electrode is one that has the highest selectivity while remaining the least invasive possible. To make a choice, a compromise must be made between the selectivity and the degree of invasiveness of the electrode. The """

Other new technologies, such as lithography or photoengraving, were also protected under this new act, further emphasizing how these laws adapted over time to meet new societal and technological changes. [11]
While significant, the industrial and technological advancements responsible for the adaptation of IP law listed above pale in comparison to the changes in law brought about by the development of computers.  Even so, synthetic biology will probably make even more substantial changes to society than computers ever did. For this reason, we will next study how computers and software impacted IP laws, from which we can hopefully make some conclusions on how IP laws will change to reflect new synthetic biology technologies.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," showed great interest in our device and even offered to implement it in the parks of Bolbro, should the product become a reality.
We had a discussion with Mrs. Mortensen about the creation of a prototype based on the wishes of Bolbro’s local citizens. Following this conversation, she provided us with a pitch that aimed to help us develop this prototype.
“Hauge’s square is a spot in Bolbro, which we aim to make a central place in Bolbro; a place that invites the citizen to meet and dwell. Your solution should be able to contribute to help citizens recharge their phones, e.g. a solution could be implanting the PowerLeaf into a interactive furniture, but where the demand an aesthetic pleasing design still remains.” - Translated from Danish
“A part of the vision of this project is the concept of making a pop-up park with differently designed multi-furniture, preferably in wood and organic design, which are removable to the various areas where we are going to develop in the district. It is furniture that should be able to be used to relax in and at the same time also motivates children to move. There is also a need for charging devices and it therefore demands that your solution is an integrated, but still mobile solution, as the park will move physically over time. Finally, the playground is to be developed especially for the young audience, which is a major consumer of power for phones. The playground must be a place where youngsters hang out after school, while maintaining its status as a green space. - Translated from Danish”
The making of the furniture as a prototype called for a revisit of our safety concerns. We now knew that children would be climbing and playing on the furniture, making it crucial that the material of the PowerLeaf will not break. This is a concern we discussed with Flemming Christiansen, which you can read all about next.
Finding the Proper Material
Criteria to the Prototype
The system itself will consist of two different compartments, an outer and an inner chamber. The first will be facing the sun, while the other will be facing the building or furniture. Since one culture of the bacteria depends on solar energy to produce its product, the outer compartment must allow for sunlight to pass. It should here be noted that the prototype is purely hypothetical, as the membrane, between the two compartments, should exclusively be permeable to cellulose. For that reason, we wanted to find a material, that fulfilled our established criteria, so that we could illustrate the technology.   The device itself will be made entirely from plastic, a material that is thought to be undesirable due to the difficulties in its disposal."

We were interested in identifying novel c-di-AMP regulatory elements that control gene expression in Bacillus subtilis. In collaboration with the iGEM Groningen Team, we performed global target analysis.
Our goal was to look for genes, whose expression level is affected by the level of c-di-AMP. Therefore we compared the transcriptomes of the wild-type B. subtilis strain and a mutant strain, which produces a lot of c-di-AMP (Fig. 1).
By doing so, we are able to (i) find other pathways that respond to c-di-AMP and therefore can be used to construct a reporter system, and (ii) we can shed light on the signaling network of c-di-AMP in B. subtilis.
Fig.1: c-di-AMP concentrations determined via liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry method by our collaboration partner from the Hannover Medical School. In blue the c-di-AMP amount in low phosphate medium is shown, in red the c-di-AMP amount in high phosphate medium. We compared the wildtype and a hyperactive strain (1344) of Bacillus.
The microarray analysis in Groningen gave us a first glimpse on all the genes, which are affected by the c-di-AMP level. We were especially interested in ydaO. From a poster of another workgroup we knew that ydaO is connected to an upstream c-di-AMP sensing riboswitch. This means that in the presence of c-di-AMP the riboswitch will assemble and prohibit the expression of ydaO. Without c-di-AMP the riboswitch cannot be established and ydaO will be expressed."

Why Mars?
When asked of the prospect of human colonization on Mars, Stephen Hawking stated that, “It will completely change the future of the human race and maybe determine whether we have any future at all.” (Hawking, Stephen). While most would state that the billions of dollars put into space exploration should be best used to end world hunger and poverty - a never ending problem that we must resolve as members of a society - it is also important to think in a long-term mindset. We must consider what can happen to the human population hundreds to thousands of years from now. The only home that we as humans have ever known is Earth. However, as our population increases at an exponential rate (Haub, Carl), and surviving as a species on a tiny blue planet in the vacuum of space is no longer a guarantee, it is vital to beging thinking of alternatives; the possibilities of colonization within the cosmos.
A classic example would be the extinction of the dinosaurs. Roaming the Earth 65 million years prior to us, they remain as nothing but fossilized remnants. There are no longer traces of said dinosaurs walking the planet; what if this occurs to the human species? This is similar to the risk of monoculturing crops, where producing only one species is dangerous; what if a pathogen wipes out the entire population (Greentumble)? If the human species is only limited to Earth, what will happen if our Earth was not here? What if one colossal asteroid, or perhaps a natural disaster, wiped out the entire human existence? Whatever it may be, one thing is for sure: placing humans on more than one planet will allow for our existence to exist for thousands, if not millions, of years from now.
How Did We Get Here?
With the rapid rate of technological advancements over the past few decades, the idea of space colonization has been brought closer and closer, increasingly becoming a more tangible goal. Mars, our interstellar neighbor, is a planet with the same heat-range as that of Earth. It has become the prime target for human expansion in the cosmos. However, before we can even think to achieve this vision, there are a number of considerations that must be accounted for."

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," the challenge now is for Tri-chromatic control. Our lab project aims to produce a full colour ‘coliroid’ to demonstrate tri-chromatic control of bacteria. The modified E.coli are designed to carry three independent light sensitive pathways that each control the production of a specific pigment protein.
A reliable computer model is essential for accurate implementation of tri-chromatic control. In the case of the theoretical bio-camera it is required to achieve an even balance of colours and optimum development time. In other applications it is essential to have accurate temporal control over the expression of light regulated genes.
The model is based around KaSim, a stochastic simulator that reads Kappa, a rule based language. Stochastic simulation has the advantage over deterministic simulation because it replicates the random nature of brownian motion in cells more accurately. Rule based languages are particularly useful for biochemical signalling as the physical reactions are readily converted into rules. Matlab is used to process the signal from the incident light to the KaSim simulation. The outputs of the simulation is used in MATLAB to calculate the change in absorbtion spectrum over time.
Modelling Software
The modelling was primarily conducted using two platforms; MATLAB® and KaSiM. Together they provide the necessary tools to create an accurate model of our system.
They have been used succesfully by previous iGEM teams, notably the Edinburgh 2010 and 2011 teams, both of which one Best Model at the European Jamboree. This was the primary reason we chose the Kappa language to write our model in.
KaSiM is a stochastic simulator that executes files written in Kappa . Kappa is a rule based modelling language for protein interaction networks. To download KaSiM or the manual please visit the KaSiM page.
KaSiM
KaSiM is a stochastic simulator of rule based models written in the Kappa language. It is open source program that uses a variation of the Gillespie's algorithm to generate statistically correct trajectories. We advise you take the time to read the introduction to KaSiM in the KaSiM manual .
Kappa
Kappa is a high level rule-based language designed to describe protein interaction networks. Rule-based languages describe a system by a governing set of rules. There is no change in the configuration of the system without the execution of a rule.  There are five fundamental parts to the kappa language; agents, tokens, rules, rates and observables. A quick introduction to these concepts is given below. For more detailed information we suggest visiting the Kappa website or for full examples RuleBase which offers a repository of complete rule based models. We can also recommend the 201"

2.We formed an alliance with the Beijing Teenager Science & Technology Club (BTSTC) in order to make our human practice project a long-term plan. We also managed to propagate for the lecture we intended to present to high school students. Click Here
3.In mid-July, we gave a series of lectures, ""Life as Machines --- Rational Design for Artificial Biological Systems"", to Beijing high school students. We introduced to them the idea of synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, and motivated many of them to participate in the iGEM high school division in the future. Click Here
4.We wrote and disturbed a questionnaire to these students after the lecture, and by analyzing this data, we obtained crucial information regarding their opinions and intentions, and even obstacles in their way. This made the next step clear for us.Click Here
5.Guided by the questionnaire, we wrote a report to apply for funding for iGEM-HS in Beijing, and began to guide three students from the SHSBNU towards their future participation in the iGEM competition. Click Here
6.In order to extend our HP project ""Sowing Tomorrow's Synthetic Biologists"", we decided to propage Synthetic Biology and iGEM to HS students in other parts of China. In fact, we went to Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, to try to organize a lecture with the company of Team ZJU-China. Click Here
Introspection
In addition to propagating the knowledge of Synthetic Biology and iGEM to students, we thought it was necessary to aware them of the dangerous problem Synthetic Biology would lead to, such as biosafety issues of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and biosecurity issues about bio-arms, since this burgeoning field are absorbing more and more researchers in and spawning more and more products out. That is why we managed to evoke government, teachers, and students' cognition of related ethic issues regarding Synthetic Biology during the whole ""Sowing Tomorrow's Synthetic Biologists"" projects. And most importantly, that is why during our actual guidance for the three high school students, we managed to motivate them, our future synthetic biologists, to contemplate the problems by themselves. As opposed to the propagation of iGEM contest and SB knowledge, the propagation of bio-ethic issues are much harder. We still have a lot to do in the future.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Raising the interest of artists to be involved in science, to inspire and spark discussions in biotechnology.
Just because iGEM is over it does not mean that we will stop encouraging people to be part of the discussion. Stockholm’s innovation atmosphere is growing and we believe that multidisciplinarity is the way of going forward. For example, Stockholm Makerspace Biolab is the first step to give the public society the possibility to learn and understand how to modifying DNA. An initiative we want to build upon. In the future we will keep on the tradition of Stockholms iGEM Teams to host Workshops at the community lab. These workshops are very important for our team, as three members of this years iGEM Stockholm Team entered iGEM via Stockholm’s Makerspace, where they joined workshops organized by iGEM Stockholm 2016.
We want to encourage the public to learn, understand and be able to take part in the discussions, to shape our future the best possible way, together.
EDUCATIONAL SEMINARS
In the spirit of democratic biology, we wanted to include university students and academic professionals under our targeted groups. Therefore, we decided to hold two educational seminars about synthetic biology and iGEM at our main universities, Karolinska Institutet and KTH The Royal Institute of Technology, with more than 40 participants in each one of them.
Louise introducing iGEM at KTH
Larsen talking about Synthetic Biology at Karolinska Institutet.
We dedicated half of the seminars to the audience, opening up an opportunity for discussion and questions. Our goal was to not only raise awareness about iGEM and synthetic biology but also to initiate a debate while avoiding forcing our opinion on them. After the events, we had the chance to mingle with the attendants and received great feedback from them. Surprisingly many are not familiar with synthetic biology and we believe that education and discussion is the way to open up the right path in this sector.
YOUTUBE CHANNEL
Social Media is today's way of sharing information, creations and social life.  We wanted to be able to target all groups of people and complementary to our events, we wanted to make science available online through our youtube channel.
Science with Sonia
We hosted a show called Science with Sonia, where Sonia, in our team, invited guests relevant to our project and iGEM to teach and discuss mucus, synthetic biology, iGEM and probiotics.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small                                 molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
OprF represents one of the largest pore sizes on bacterial outer membranes, allowing                                 diffusion of polysaccharides in a range of 2000 to 3000 Da. The overexpression of OprF                                 in E. coli will drastically improve the antibiotic absorption capability, like                                 antibiotic condensation occured in E. coli.
Viroporin: SCVE from SARS Virus Viroporins are similar to porins in that                                 they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occurs                                 between hydrophobic, transmembrane and alpha-helical domains of the proteins.
SCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76                                 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria. SCVE is permeable for many                                 small molecules, which is originately designed for apoptosis of cells triggered by                                 virus. Implementation of SCVE in ROSE may potentially improve the permatilibty of small                                 molecules including antibiotics.
Inhibition of Efflux System using CRISPR Efflux system is a kind of                                 mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic                                 substances, microbiotics.
According to previous research, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic                                 resistance, or multidrug resistance(MDR). For example, in E. coli, AcrAB efflux                                 system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower                                 their intracelluar toxicty.

Modeling
Functions are determined by structures. It is helpful for us to grasp the protein structure, and we could know the function of proteins better. So, we use supercomputer to predict the protein structure, since it is much less expensive, faster, and able to a large scale generate protein structures than classical methods.
Protein Structure Models
Due to the fact that the real structure of Lanosterol Synthase is known, so we began from protein data bank in Europe. We firstly obtained Canonical number: P48449(pdb|1w6k|), and then the amino acid sequence of Lanosterol were found in Uniprot, shown as following:

Goals
Since firstly taking part in iGEM in 2007, Peking iGEM has the tradition of communicating with other teams in China. This activity strengthens Peking iGEM Team’s understanding of synthetic biology as well as this competition, deepens the friendship with other teams, widens the views towards the advanced fields of modern biology.
During this summer, Peking iGEM 2014 kept this tradition for the following purposes:
a. Communicating experiments and modeling with other teams.
b. Investigating how synthetic biology as well as iGEM Competition spread in China.
c. Spreading the knowledge of algal bloom and promoting our project.
Team Visits
In late August, Peking iGEM 2014 visited several universities in China and participated in the First Central China iGEMers’ Meet Up (Fig. 1). And some universities went to us with their ideas and questions. During this trip, we visited SJTU, ZJU-China, and USTC. To these teams, we introduced our project “Ranger amongst Enemies”, especially the modeling part.
Figure 1. WANG Chenggong was explaining our project in the Central China iGEM Meet Up
Zhejiang University
On August 19th, we arrived at ZJU-China (Zhejiang University) and discussed the biosafety problem and the possibilities of cooperation (Fig. 2).
Figure 2. Group photo with iGEMers from ZJU-China
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Next day, our team leaved for SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in Shanghai. During this visit, the undergraduates and instructors from Bio-X Center, just like our iGEM Club, introduced their project and iGEM Club. We made the consensus that it is probably better treating biology subject as a whole rather than dividing it into many isolated topics. In return, a member from SJTU also joined our group discussion afterwards (Fig. 3).

Hello, my name is Kieran McCormack. I am currently finished my second year of Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, which allows for a nice contrast between the normal science world and the more defined synthetic biology world. I enjoy doing new activities and have found great joy from being an adviser on the team; whether that be through new friendships, communications or spread of knowledge. I have enjoyed learning about myself throughout this year, and hopefully I can continue to do so into the future.

Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple"
Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html,", or are they leading us toward “user-friendly synthetic biology”? Rephrased: Today synthetic biology is structuring itself, would it choose to share its complex mechanisms, or would it choose simplicity of use? Ideally synthetic biology should be accessible without becoming simplistic. But Simondon explains, that like artistic, scientific or philosophical cultures, the technical culture is exigent: it needs to be learned, it demands efforts. Thus, synthetic biology can not aim to be “user-friendly” without loosing parts of its scientific and technical subtlety. A good analogy could be found in the example of computer science: today computers are really easy to use, but only because the technical process (code and data processing) disappeared behind images serving as translator for the user. On one hand it enables everybody to use computers (and other computing devices), on the other hand, how many people can say they understand how their computer works? “What I cannot create I do not understand.” Richard Feynman. And so, one consequence is overconsumption of computers: Simondon analysed that ignorance leads to incapacity of reciprocally adapting its machine and its use, and leading then to a false obsolescence, and thus to overconsumption.
Today synthetic biology is still in a scientific phase that fits with the technical culture requirements. What would be a “user-friendly” synthetic biology? The technical evolution of the tools (for example of the PCR thermo-cyclers) does not make synthetic biology “user-friendly”: it is just like coding in a more powerful computer, the tool is better, the technique is the same. But if a machine could create engineered living machines at will from a simple interface, that would be a real revolution. And in this case the user could do things that he can not possibly understand. Here lies the main problem: Simondon already thought it was bad not to understand technique properly in the 50's, so what consequences would have a “user-friendly” synthetic biology? Beyond the intrinsic dangers of large-scale synthetic biology (dispersion, contamination, bio-accident, bio-terrorism, etc.), a major ethical problem is raised: could we allow to genetically manipulate living beings with such ease, even if this beings are no more than bacteria? Until now, genetical manipulation has been subordinated to scientific knowledge and purpose, and limited by many legal dispositions. The industrial project that defined the technical development of synthetic biology (standardization and automation), and the DIY-Bio (Do It Yourself Biology) initiatives, partakes both of this “user-friendly” dynamic, even unwillingly. We should be vigilant about this:"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"

K206001 is a variant pBAD promoter with a modified AraI1 site that has been shown to be less responsive at low concentrations of arabinose and to exhibit a lower maximum expression than the wild type (BBa_I13453), as measured by coupling to a fluorescent reporter.  What you can do with it: At a given level of arabinose input, BBa_K206001 will provide a lower level of PoPS output than its family members, allowing analog device responses. See our wikifor a project that makes use of this property.  Compatibility:  Chassis: Best used in the E. coli strain BW27783, which has been modified to permit homogeneous pBAD promoter expression by substituting the chromosomal arabinose-dependent promoter of AraE (arabinose transporter protein) with a constitutive promoter .

Filtration
Our Sporobeads can be used to purify water from heavy metal ions, toxins and plastic by expressing proteins on their surface that specifically bind such targets.
One example of such a binding protein could be CPX-Sporobeads. CPX is a peptide developed by the 2007 MIT iGEM team , which is extremely hydrophobic, and thus capable of binding microparticles of polystyrene from water. The excessive use of disposable plastic and the lack of universal recycling programs has led to the pollution of the world's oceans . In the ocean, large pieces of plastic litter are ground by sea currents and degraded by UV radiation into microscopic pieces, so called ""plastic plankton,"" which is consumed by fish, filter feeders, and other marine organisms. Such plastic uptake can lead to poisoning, sterility and death.
Theoretical Filtersystem with Sporobeads
In huge filter systems, CPX-Sporobeads, which cannot germinate ( [1] GerminationSTOP), could be put into place to filter microscopic plastic particles out of the water. Such specific filtration would be superior to blanket filtration systems, which also remove living phytoplankton important to ocean ecosystems. To prevent the beads from being released into the sea and to ensure that the plastic is removed from the water, the Sporobeads could be attached to membranes in these filter systems. In this case, the Sporobeads would need to not only display CPX but also a membrane binding or spore binding protein on their surface.

$f(x) = 3 \times x $“Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects the work.” (Peter Carr, Director of Judging) is the comment which gives a clear definition of all Human Practices activities. Therefore, we tried to answer two questions: how can synthetic biology affect the world? And in which way can the world affect Iron Guardian? To answer the former one, we chose to collaborate with different teams and thought the issues we are working on vary from team to team, we all wish and try to utilize what we learn to solve practical problems and make the world a better one. What’s more, we integrated the social influence into our project to answer the latter question. With communication, economic benefit and responsibility as our important focus, we interviewed professors and employees in related industry, and showcased the great economic benefit of our project. By distributing questionnaire and analyzing the data acquired, we managed to explain and improve our project according to the public concerns and suggestions. The new concept of “3+ net” raised by ECUST will also help all teams to create, to reflect, and to improve.

Education: To spread the main ideas of synthetic biology and stimulate young people’s interest is a significant task for Iron Guardian. Therefore, we participated in the Science Camp in ECUST and presented our project briefly. Also, the lectures and activities we organized also worked as a platform for students to know more about us.
Collaborations: This year, we collaborated with many teams and got a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. On one hand, we worked"

Can Bacteriorganic Rubber make a difference?
""With the right funding and well-educated work, our ideas seem reasonably realistic."" - iGEM SDU 2013
For our system to be implemented for industrial production of rubber, all points described under “next step to bring it further” need to be addressed. Our project points in the direction of bacterial rubber production, paving the way for future projects and research. Along the way, we characterized genes, which have potential to be used with radically different outcomes. Dxs may be used if an increase in vitamin B1 is desired, and our LacI system, controlling transcription of a gene of interest, can be applied to almost any gene expression system. Both constructs have been added to the Parts Registry. With the right funding and well-educated work, our ideas seem reasonable realistic.
Upon completion, Bacteriorganic Rubber could make a difference: Rubber production would be faster and better for the environment. Faster because the tank of bacteria can be harvested in one go, instead of one tree at a time and the 7 years of the maturation of the tree is bypassed; Better for the environment as deforestation becomes unnecessary, and"

Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," name is Shayne Gracious and I am entering my third year at Dalhousie completing my undergraduate degree in chemistry with a minor in mathematics. I was first exposed to the concept of genetic engineering in my first year of undergraduate studies through the Dalhousie Integrated Science Program. Since then the topic has continuously peaked my interest particularly through recent progressive studies in CRISPR. As a chemist my main interests lies around the applications of synthetic biology in the field of chemistry, such as the use of enzymes to overcome challenging metabolic pathways or introducing new reaction mechanisms to produce complex molecules. I am excited to be part of the iGEM team this year!
Mostafa Hagar
Chemistry and Neuroscience
My name is Mostafa Hagar and I'm finishing up fourth year at Dalhousie University, double majoring in chemistry and neuroscience. A really good friend of mine (Paul) participated in iGEM last year and recommended I look into it. I first got interested in synthetic biology after reading a few chemistry papers where organic chemists used enzymes to synthesize their targets. I think it's really cool that we can use enzymes to do the same transformations that chemists go through a lot of effort to achieve, and I'm really excited to get more exposure to that kind of biology and understand how people work with these enzymes.

My name is Nicholas Boudreau. As of this coming fall I will be a second year microbiology student at Dalhousie university. I am studying to become a researcher in the field of viral gene-therapy. As one of the most novice members of this team, my primary role is to help other team members where needed as well as use my proficiency in JavaScript to design some aspects of the website. I will be contributing heavily to the Shubenacadie Microbiome Map. I also used my proficiency in JavaScript to help create the team’s webpage.

My name is Maxine Kirshenbaum and I’m in my final year of undergrad at Dalhousie university, majoring in chemistry and minoring in biology. Genetic engineering is a controversial topic and iGEM provided the perfect opportunity to learn more about it. My scant biology background helped feed my interest, as did the actual iGEM project itself. While I did not get to play with porcupines, just their poop, the unique learning opportunity and amazing team made for a great experience.

KIT-Kyoto,2010,Team:KIT-Kyoto#Project#Abstract_-_-_TEXT.html,", genomes, proteins, enzymes, etc., this new form of artistic expression has as medium living matter, and the studios of the artists are biological laboratories, while high end technologies of genetic engineering, tissue culture and many others are their new painting brushes.
BioArt is considered by most artists to be strictly limited to “living forms,” although there is some debate as to the stages at which matter can be considered to be alive or living. Creating living beings and practicing in the life sciences brings about ethical, social and aesthetic inquiry.
Here, we aim at a completely new style of BioArt.  In hitherto BioArt, the appreciator enjoys a work in the conventional way, that is he/she appreciates an artist’s resulting piece looking or touching it. The new style of BioArt we propose here is the enjoyment of making art itself. With the “E.coli Pen” that we propose here the appreciator himself becomes part of the artistic work he is drawing enjoying the fascination of making the work and the work itself.
Already existing BioArt:wikipedia
However, an already existing bio art does not meet the key word “Make the science and technology more accessible”, because that the preexisting bio art needs special equipment and the deep knowledge of biotechnology etc. We therefore decided to work on the development of a new art tool by which people could enjoy the bio art easily.
Here we can propose a novel art tool, “E.coli Pen” which draws paintings with innumerable colors as inks of the pen that are produced by a single E. coli bacteria. ""E.coli Pen"" would further develop the field of the bio art as a new art tool. Furthermore it is useful as an educational tool, since people can enjoy drawings with the heavenly color with happiness and at the same time they can study the molecular mechanism how the colors are made by genetic engineering.
We summarize how to make ""E.coli Pen"" in the following section.
1. How to make an innumerable color in E. coli bacteria
1-1. Use of light's three primary colors
Principle of light’s three primary colors (red, green, and blue) can be applied to create an innumerable color. The fluorescent protein can be used as a color source. Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) can be used for Red, Green  Fluorescent Protein (GFP) can be used for Green, and Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) can be used for Blue. The color fluorescence is emitted when ultraviolet rays is irradiated. These fluorescent proteins are widely used in the field"
Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Project#Carotenoids_-_-_TEXT.html," first transformed these two strains with pPCB15 for orange beta-carotene production ( Week 3 ). pPCB15 was also transformed into TOP10 to see if it would work in a strain with normal FPP flux. pPCB15 has chloramphenicol-resistance selection marker so the transformed bacteria were grow on media with chloramphenicol.
On agar plates, pPCB15 produced yellow pigments in all three strains, with increasing intensity in the order: TOP10 < original MG1655 < MG1655 PT5-dxs PT5-idi PT5-ispB PTe-ispDF (photo below). The results indicated that it is feasible to introduce carotene synthesising pathway in E.coli, and that even in strains with normal FPP flux (i.e. TOP10), the yellow pigment production is still relatively fast (overnight incubation) and easily visualised. However, as mentioned above, since the effects in MG1655 and its derivative are much stronger and easier to assess, we used them as a tool to prove our concepts and test our Biobricks.
Top row from the left: pPCB15 in MG1655-PT5 (""Roche""), pPCB15 in TOP 10, pPCB15 in MG1655 (""Parent""). Bottom row from the left: K152005 in TOP10, R0011 in TOP10 (negative control).
Construct composite Biobrick CrtEBI
We wish to produce the first coloured compound in the pathway, lycopene (red), which can then be converted into other colours by subsequent enzymatic reaction.
In order to “pause” at lycopene, we need enzymes CrtE, CrtB and CrtI only. Currently in the registry there is no available Biobrick containing CrtEBI, so we decide to construct our own.
After transforming E. coli with K118014 (rbs+CrtE), K118006 (rbs+CrtB) and K118005 (rbs+CrtI), we construct composite biobrick by ligating the three genes together.
Plan mapping of CrtEBI:
Test colour changes by CrtY
Characterisation of Biobricks and colour output
Carotene: We wish to not only visually identify yellowish/orange pigment formation, but also quantify the amount of beta-carotene produced. To this end, we performed carotene extraction with acetone using protocol described in literature and took absorbance measurement using Omega Microplate Readers (BMG-Labtech).

As a consequence, the project is motivating because it offers students a sense of autonomy, meaning that they have a high                             level of control of what they are doing, they iGEM offers a great sense of agency. Because of                             societal relevance and because of participation in a jamboree in Boston, this kind of project                             boosts a sense of competence. The students feel useful; they realize that education is not just                             to please the teacher with a good grade. And finally, because of an authentic experience and                             because of a team- based activity, students have a great sense of relatedness, related to each                             other, their supervisors and related to the discipline they have been studying for so long (d,f).
The beauty of iGEM is that it offers unique occasions for educational institutions to communicate their pedagogical activities.                             As for scientific discoveries, universities must communicate about education, not just publishing                             lists of course subjects to attract students. They must make education visible, tangible and                             they must make it important.
Lastly, many studies have shown that iGEM-type of experiences connects students tightly with the educational institute and                             this connection creates long lasting positive sentiments (b,c). Not only do positive sentiments                             or, better, the lack of stress from frustration, stimulate the plasticity of our brain (e), which                             makes the students more creative and productive, these sentiments also positively affect the                             educational institution concerned. Besides an institutional salary, engaging and masterly-oriented                             students are a key (motivational) reward for teachers who take their mission seriously.

Milestones:
 
Objective: Disrupt silencing to activate a gene.
Remodel chromatin so that heterochromatin can be uncoiled and opened into euchromatin so they can be activated and freely available.
 
We’re turning on the already silenced genes to produce the desired response (shift the activated genes towards silencing) by opening heterochromatin and acetylating them to become euchromatin and open.
 
Rationale - In some cases, we will want differentiation to lead to gene expression (instead of gene silencing).
 
Milestone: Create multiple fusions of DNA binding domains and activations domains.
 
More specifically…
We are creating our anti-silencing circuits using various DNA Binding Domains and activation domains. (As shown below)
 
 
DNA Binding Domains
Activation domains |
LexA PEG 202 (Full Length) NLS
LexA 1-261 (DBD-short length)   NLS
LexA 1-261 mCherry NLS
Sas2

+
+
Esa1
+
+
+
VP64
 
 
 
mCherry
+
 
+
(+ - indicates what I’ve finally got)
 
The function of each is such:
1. We’re using various LexA domains to compete for the LexA binding site. This won’t necessarily open heterochromatin, but it will prevent DNA from becoming heterochromatin because it will block and HDAC from binding to the LexA binding site and therefore inhibit the DNA from becoming silenced.
2. We’re using HATs such as Sas2 and Esa1 because they will cause an oozing model where we end up acetylating the heterochromatin and “open” it into euchromatin.
3. We’re using VP64 - as a reader to attract HATs (writers) to they will acetylate for us and open the heterochromatin for us indirectly.
4. We’re using mCherry just as a reporter of expression level so we can run a FACs on it.

Despite the fact that we obtained colonies from transformed ligation reactions, we tried to approach this result cautiously. Some checked on the Ampicillin and Kanamycin negative control plates to verify the ability of these antibiotic infused LB plates in selectively prohibit bacterial growth (the plates are all good). Some planned to conduct ligation with the addition of CIP into the backbone to check the possibility of false positive (it was still ongoing at the time). I did a quick verification attempt with gel electrophoresis to both determine the availability of DNA and check the fragment size. I used the samples from the mini prep with the highest concentration and ran it against the backbone plasmid. This means that if I were to check on R2000_E0240, I would run the sample against R2000 because this promoter was used as the backbone/vector with the E0240 used as the insert. But only the R2000_E0240 part produced a visible on the gel so that I only prepared frozen stock for this one.
In the meantime, I was quite concerned that the small DNA concentration in the gel extraction samples may mean nothing but false positive. So I ran gel electrophoresis using several samples and each well was filled with 10 uL of the samples. The resulting gel picture had extremely faint bands, so my effort to increase their visibility also caused the DNA ladder to be overexposed. But this did not concern me because I only wanted to verify the existence of DNA, not the size. Only DNA would appear as glowing bands because they could be bounded with the SIBR dye. The most important thing here is that we can now be assured that the DNA was not lost in gel extraction.

The transformed plates from last week did not contain the usual colonies. Instead, each plate had a thin layer of bacteria lawn* (*= uncountable colonies, making it appears film-like) and it smells far stronger, albeit similar, to the usual E. coli culture.

The Efficiency of Engineered NRPS is Improved When Optimal Domain Borders Are Applied
Multiple web-tools exist which offer the prediction of NRPS module and domain boundaries. One of the most common used prediction tools is Pfam which we used as a starting point to determine the best method for defining domain boundaries. Pfam predicted large linker structures between the end of the A- and the beginning of the T-domain (compare Fig. 5 , T-boundaries from ""B"" to ""2""). Using these domain boundaries for the native T-domains did only yield one functional native T-domain ( Fig. 5 , plu2642).  We tried to improve this yield by defining new T-domain boundaries based on the predictions of Pfam and multiple sequence alignments (MSA) with the respective homology libraries at the predicted linker regions. Boundaries were set closer to the preceeding A-domain, at regions were less sequence conservation was observed. Fig. 6 shows the indigoidine production after insertion of native T-domains with revised boundaries. T-domain boundary combinations A1, A2 and C1 yielded functional T-domains. As the indigoidine production and cell growth was best for the T-domains created with boundary combination A2, this boundary design was used for all subsequent cloning strategies.
Figure 6: Determination of required domain borders for T-domain exchange a) Definition of different domain border combinations for T-domain exchanges The figure shows a sequence alignment of the indC and bpsA amino acid sequences. The alignment was created using clustalO (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) with standard parameters. The lines marked A, B and C reflect the borders we used between the A-  and the T-domain, whereas those marked, 1, 2, 3 and 4 reflect the borders between the T- and  the TE-domain. In total we tried all twelve combinations of a domain border {A, B, C} and a  domain border {1, 2, 3, 4}, replacing the sequence inbetween with the respective part of bpsA. b) E. coli TOP10 co-transformed with modified versions of indC and the PPTase sfp The co-tranformation of the modified indC-(bpsA-T) plasmids described above with a second  plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp shows that only three domain border combinations can be  used for exchanging the indC T-domain with"

1. The more diligent members, the stronger the whole group
    More Farmers is much better than more beggars. Farmers can produce food for the whole country, while beggars are too lazy to do anything.
    In ecosystems, there exists a kind of character called cheaters, which is similar to our beggars here. If there are too many cheaters in a population, the population grows slower and becomes weaker.
    In human history, we can see that if the people who have power have wisdom and are diligent, the country will be prosperous. If the people who have power are lazy, the development of the country will be slow.
2. Positioning is important
    When there are no warriors on either side, the importance of a good geographical position is noticeable. In this case, if you initialize your bacteria in the middle, then you will find there is more space for your bacteria’s growth.
    In human society, plains are good for agriculture while mountainous regions or plateausare not. If a country owns more plains, it is easier to support more people.
3. Be prepared for danger in times of safety
    When there are no warriors, we came into a flourishing era, or maybe we can call this era a heyday. We can see that even in heyday, the competition still exist, so our E.coli here still have to make their best to compete.
    In human history, a ruler still needs wisdom to rule his kingdom well or manage to lead his kingdom exceeds the other in his heyday. The proverb that ‘Be prepared for danger in times of safety’ is a famous sentence in ancient China for the rulers not to lower their guards.
II The Importance of Military Force

Strategies for managing the military force is important
    Intelligent players need to think up smart ideas of initialization to help their warriors living at the edge of their bacteria population and not far away from the enemies. Where the warriors are placed in the middle of the farmers or far away from the enemies, it would be hard for them to fight the enemies. Only in this way can warriors fight againstenemies efficiently.

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof#test_-_-_TEXT.html," kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased contradicting with the expected results.                                 Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. The circuits are shown in the Fig.9.                                 So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the (序号) with no arabinose added.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the CI-pR circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram of the relationship of the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with kill gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

Developing a protocol for the farmer
We aimed to make all our steps as easy as possible, as the end user (a farmer) does not have access to specialized lab facilities and equipment. It is very important that the end-user is provided with all the necessary materials and protocols. To make our kit accessible and user-friendly, we decided to buy all the materials in the local shopping centre instead of buying it from brands specialized in lab facilities. Products in stores are already developed to be user-friendly and usable by everyone. Based on the materials provided in the kit we worked out a protocol, in easy accessible language and steps. To validate our work we visited Paul at his farm, where he tried out whether or not he could handle the provided materials in our protocol.

From our work we gained two insights we were able to implement in the protocol: (1) we need to reduce the number of pipetting steps in the protocol for the farmer and (2) in order to let RPA and in vitro transcription work we need to regulate temperature for 3 hours. To reduce the amount of pipetting, we envision in our protocol to provide all the enzymes, primers and NTPs dried in a tube.

Project Assessment
Consulting to the professors
   We consulted to teacher Jie Zhang in Biosafety Committee, Sun Yat-sen University  about the biosafety problems and
regulations in our college, country and our software.
   Teacher Jie Zhang told us that in our college, Sun Yat-sen University, also in our country, a series of strict regulations
on biosafety have been issued and operated for many years.
   However, nearly all of these regulations are concerned about the biosafety problems in experiment, and few regulation
or guidance relating to software operation has not been formulated. Thus, suggested by teacher Jie Zhang, we should ensure
that the users of our software can avoid any biosafety problems.
Risk Self Assessment
   To eliminate the potential safety problems, we restricted the data in our software from three aspects: chemicals,
parts and chassis species. To reach the targets, we made a ban list originally depending on the Catalogues of Hazardous
Chemicals, and a warning system to remind the user if their products were harmful. We wrote a small program to re-
trieve the label data of promoters and RBSs in iGEM Registry, not using those with red flags. We also found a list of
Risk Group 3 and 4 organisms, and we abnegated them in our software. For more details see our Safety .
   Then we tested our software if the system worked well, and if there were other missing problems.
   We tested where the chassis species belonged, and found that all species are in Risk Group 1 and 2.
   We tested the system if it would stop the operation and warn when we input some chemicals with potential safety
problems.
Public Engagement
Garden party for introduction of synbio to the public.
   We, together with SYSU-CHINA, held a parade in the campus to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Our
audiences were all enthusiastic, including not only students from life sciences and many other majors, but teachers of
different backgrounds. Also, some residents and tourists showed an enormous interest in our garden party. This time,
we divided our parade into 2 parts. First, you could splice a fundamental Circuit Project in the “Splice a Circuit” part.
What you need to do is to put the genetic parts in the right orders to complete a circuit. By using the electronic bricks
to symbolize the different parts in synbio, we managed to introduce the four fundamental parts to the public by visual-
ized approaches. If a circuit is completed"
Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the current status of each subproject is described further below . To have a quick insight of what is happening in our lab take a look at our Labjournal .
Overview of the projectidea of iGEM team Bielefeld 2011.
S-layer
S-layers (crystalline bacterial surface layer) are crystal-like layers consisting of multiple protein monomers and can be found in various (archae-)bacteria. They constitute the outermost part of the cell wall. Especially their ability for self-assembly into distinct geometries is of scientific interest. At phase boundaries, in solutions and on a variety of surfaces they form different lattice structures. The geometry and arrangement is determined by the C-terminal self assembly-domain, which is specific for each S-layer protein. The most common lattice geometries are oblique, square and hexagonal. By modifying the characteristics of the S-layer through combination with functional groups and protein domains as well as their defined position and orientation to each other (determined by the S-layer geometry) it is possible to realize various practical applications ( Sleytr et al., 2007 ). The usability and industrial potential of such well-defined nano-lattice structures is far-reaching from ultrafiltration membranes to the development of immobilized biosensors.
Especially for the production of cell-free biosensors, functional fusion proteins are of great importance. Kainz et al. (2010) fused fluorescent proteins with an S-layer glycoprotein from Geobacillus stearothermophilus . They demonstrated that the properties of the fusion protein were similar to the native fluorescent protein. The intensity of the fluorescence, the lifetime and the adsorption spectra showed comparable behavior at different pH-values. Enzymes fused to immobilized S-layers showed a significantly longer durability ( Schäffer et al., 2007 ).
The iGEM-Team Bielefeld aims at the assembly, production and immobilization of S-layer fusion proteins for the detection of BPA by a coupled enzymatic reaction. S-layers from four different organisms are employed. The provision of various S-layers with different geometries offers the possibility for the scientific community to create functional nanobiotechnological surfaces with simple and standardized methods, so to say do it yourself nanobiotechnology . First, different fusion proteins with fluorescent proteins and a luciferase are created. The functionality and efficiency of the immobilization to various materials such as silicon dioxide or cellulose is then characterized by measuring the fluorescence and luminescence, respectively.

Sanni Voutilainen, Ph.D., Aalto University
During the last month before the Giant Jamboree, Sanni helped us with some clonings that we couldn’t get to work and as we were already busy with school courses. She also helped us with any urgent issues we had, such as figuring out how to send out our BioBricks.
Georg Schmidt, Ph.D., Aalto University
Georg with his expertise in electroporations, ligations and PCRs, has given us many tips on what sort of things need to be taken into consideration in the lab and how to improve the success rate in our cloning etc. We had many debugging sessions with him when our protocols didn’t work.

Sponsors
We want to thank our sponsors for all the support they've given us. In the beginning there was no guarantee that we'd get any support at all. Even if we expected that we might get some support, the amount of people offering their help far exceeded our expectations.
From the following list you can find all our partners, what/who they are and what they did for/with us. A big thank you to all!
Aalto University
""Aalto University is a new multidisciplinary university, where science and art meet technology and business."" ( http://www.aalto.fi/en/ )
Aalto University helped us in multiple ways. They offered us great mentors and a work environment where you could ask anything from the experienced lab people around you. They gave us space in the lab to work in, they supported us us financially, they ordered us reagents when we needed them. Synthesizing our gene switch wasn't a problem either. It feels like we couldn't have done this, or at least this would have been a severely harder project, without Aalto.

Illinois-Tools,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Notebook#Week4_-_-_TEXT.html," enzyme can perform can necessarily occur in Ecoli. Therefore, I discovered I must find another way that will be organism specific throughout the whole process of going from organism to reaction.  My new flow was now from organism, to gene, to ko number (orthology?? not fully uderstood), to pathway, to reactions that occur in pathway.  I got all the way through to reactions for Ecoli, but I realized I had another problem.  Yes, I had a list of reactions for Ecoli, but I did not know which gene was associated with what reaction. That I realized is very important to know; what genes are associated with what reactions.  This will be very useful for our program.  To my dismay, I could not think of a way to get reactions by gene and vice versa through the KEGG API alone.  Therefore, I used the KEGG FTP to obtain a list of reactions, that I hope to get enzymes for, and then the genes for all of those enzymes.  This I will work with next week.  On a side note, I thought of some fun features that we could have as a part of our program.  One idea I had was converting genes that qualify from the KEGG database into biobricks by basically adding the DNA needed to fulfill the state of being a 'biobrick'. Another idea I had was to optimize all of the genes that are to be outputted by our program for the host organism that is chosen by user through codon optimization.  Each organism has varying levels of charged tRNAs.  The idea would be to alter the codons so that the percentage of each codon reflects the percentage of the charged tRNAs.  Right now, these ideas are still being considered, they might be fun to do once our program is finished.
Palak This week the changed the direction of our project slightly. We decided that we would add an option that allowed the user to choose a shortest path depending on a chosen factor such as lowest energy usage or least number of cofactors. This allowed us to create graphs of the reactions with weights. We would then find the path of least weight for the given factor. This eliminated the need to find all paths, which we found wasn't feasible. Due to this the need for flux analysis functions was not crucial right away. I put this part of the project on hold and started working on another aspect, creating databases. We found that it would speed up our program if we had our own database of reactions and their properties. I explored different possibilities to create this database. We work with"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

We have a long history of cooperation with NAU-CHINA iGEM team,                     and we have continued to strengthen the cooperative relationship between the two teams this year in modeling part.                     In the absence of the modeling background for our members at the prophase,                     they deepened the modeling concept of our members and provided a completed model of the blood-brain barrier,                     with our members offering a construction idea. This favor largely sped up our leaning progress on building biological models.                     So, here we express our great gratitude for their helping us!

We really appreciated their generous and giant help which added a lot of characterizations on our biopart testing.                             They invited our team members to their campus to conduct exosome quantification.                             They also provided us with expensive extraction kit materials and access to advanced equipment without any scruple to us.                             With their help, we obtained a lot of crucial data about exosome production Booster device and targeting.

SIAT-SCIE
We developed a partnership with a high school team, SIAT-SCIE, during the Eurasian Meetup in Shenzhen, China.                             During the meeting, we introduced our projects to each other,                             exchanged ideas concerning the projects and shared our experience in participating in iGEM.                             Additionally, we also forwarded suggestions to improve their project by developing a specific protein-packaging system.

While magnesium ions are essential for protein synthesis, at high concentrations they can cause inhibition of ribosome translocation and hence inhibit protein synthesis (Borg & Ehrenberg, 2015).
Previous research has shown that the concentration of some components of the supplement solution are crucial for efficient protein synthesis, and that for each batch of extract produced the optimal concentration may need to be found (Yang, et al., 2012). Studies which have explored this have only focused on, at most, a few components at a time (Garamella, et al., 2016; Kelwick, et al., 2016), which means that important interactions between the components may have been missed.
Multifactorial Design of Experiments
Traditionally, biologists tend to use One Factor At a Time (OFAT) approaches to determine the effect and importance of factors on a system. This method can sometimes be a poor choice. By only determining the effect that a single factor has on a system at a time, important interactions can be missed. For example, removing only factor A may have no effect, and removing only factor B may also have no effect, but removing both may cause an adverse effect. Therefore, it is important to take a multifactorial approach when investigating the importance of conditions or components of a system, or when trying to optimise a system. An issue with this approach is that a large number of experiments may be required to fully investigate all factors. By using statistical methods, a Design of Experiments (DoE) can be determined which has the minimum number of experiments required to explore questions such as the importance of factors in a system. This approach also allows for robustness testing or determining batch-batch variation (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). As mentioned previously, CFPS systems can be plagued with issues rising from variation, so this approach offers a method to investigate the causes. There are several different types of DoE designs. One of these is the screening design (SD), which is used to create experimental designs to determine the factors with the highest effect on a system. Another design is the surface response design (SRD), which makes experimental designs to collect data for generating models which can predict optimal settings for many factors (SAS Institute Inc., 2016). Software tools, such as JMP (SAS Institute Inc., 2016), have been developed to create these experimental designs.
Implementation
Cell free extract preparation procedures were based on methods reported in literature previously (Kwon & Jewett,"
Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Practices#Industry_-_-_TEXT.html," EPSRC, MRC and ERA-NET, as well as many industry-based initiatives being set up to build synthetic biology infrastructure [15]. Although certain bans on GMO crops have been imposed in the UK, no such bans are currently being enforced or considered for probiotics [16]. Similarly, the US have various initiatives to encourage biotechnology growth including organizations and research centers such as DARPA’s Living Foundries ATCG program, NSF ERC and Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) program. Another program, the Small Business Innovative Research and the Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) programs, looked for proposals with realistic synthetic biology applications [17]. In 2014, a report “Industrialization of Biology: A Roadmap to Accelerate Advanced Manufacturing of Chemicals” identified key points to further advance synthetic biology research in the US [15]. Similarly, the US has some bans on GM crops, but nothing for probiotics (although the case of genetically modified probiotics has not yet been explored in practice).
When it comes to implementing fermentation to produce our probiotics, the feedback we received from industry was generally positive, although it foresaw problems with its implementation in an industrial process. If we used our process as a standard way of fermenting L-DOPA, it could not compete with the chemical synthesis methods already in place; however, as a probiotic the outlook is clearly more positive. As fermentation is efficient, generally needs no purification and does not deal with high temperatures or pressures, the energy and waste treatment costs are attractive. The product is also better, with a better target for delivery and therefore better overall pharmacological performance and a strong advantage in the potential to patent the technology.
However, the overheads are comparatively expensive for fermentation; this is aggravated by a drop off in production as a result of spontaneous mutants, for which some sort of selective pressure solution would have to be developed. Despite this, the raw material is much cheaper, as well as being sustainable, giving an economic advantage via future proofing as well as protecting against the potential government legislature restricting waste output and energy consumption found in competing processes. Industrialists interviewed were also worried about the loss of profit in producing a probiotic solution that was self-sustainable, suggesting a less stable strain which would require repeat dosing.
With 50% of children born today expected to live to 100 [18], the late onset disease of Parkinson’s becomes an ever more prevalent problem, and despite economic and commercial factors working against us, we hope that our greener, more sustainable, patient-friendly alternative would find a new niche in the Parkinson’s treatment market"

We cloned our genes into PSB1C3 vector successfully, then moved on cloning it into the expression vector pET45-b. For cloning into this plasmid, we removed our genes from PSB1C3-HNS, PSB1C3-HNS-T108I, PSB1C3-PotB59/PomA plasmids with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with the same enzymes. We transformed ligated products into BL21 bacteria strain that we know it has T7 RNA polymerase.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be 360 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands are expected to be at 744 bp line for HNS and HNS-T108I, 2045 bp line for PotB59/PomA.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes for cut-check.

WESTERN BLOTTING
After cloning the genes into pET45-b successfully, we did Western Blot experiment through N-terminal located His Tag in proteins, so we managed to show the production of required proteins.(As we didn’t have any S-tag antibodies for Western blotting, the bands shown for PotB59/PomA indicate only the presence of PotB59 protein.)

SOFT AGAR PLUG ASSAY
After showing that we produced required proteins successfully, in order to learn if they are functional, we did a motility assay called ‘plug assay’. We inoculated bacteria in different concentrations into the soft agars and incubated them at 37°C.  After this, we measured their colony diameters at 24. and 48. hours. The results are shown below.
