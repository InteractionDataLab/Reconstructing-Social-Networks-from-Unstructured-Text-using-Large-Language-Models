Results
Here you can describe the results of your project and your future plans.
What should this page contain?
Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
Future plans for the project.
Considerations for replicating the experiments.
You should also describe what your results mean:
Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.
Show data, but remember all measurement and characterization data must be on part pages in the Registry.
Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.
Project Achievements
You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.
A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.

The Organisms We Worked With
Escherichia coli (Main chassis organism) Strains used: NEB5alpha High efficiency DH5alpha derivative strain K12. T7 express BL21 derivative, strain B.
Ganoderma lucidum
Arthrospira platensis
Anabaena variabilis
Mucor circinelloides
Bacillus subtilis
These are all common widespread species without serious health effects. They are all generally regarded as safe (GRAS), Biosafety Level 1, and are found commonly in the natural environment.
What risks could arise from our experiments?
A possible risk is the release of fungal spores into the lab. However, none of the strains of fungi we worked with are known to produce spores hazardous to human health, and we have tailored the growth conditions so that the growing fungi should remain in the non spore-forming mycelial stage. Even so, we wrapped or sealed all growing mycelium into separate containers, and sequestered all of said containers into one environmental growth chamber to limit the possibility of spore release. Any fungal samples we suspected would send out contaminating spores if opened were worked on under a sterilized laminar flow hood. After adequate mycelial growth has occurred, we also baked the mycelium to dry and inactivate it and prevent further growth while keeping it out of wet or damp conditions that could restart growth.
What risk might our project pose outside of the lab?
More than likely, little to no risk. The strains we are working with are regarded as safe and are will not have any toxic or virulent modifications. No modifications will be made beyond the overexpression of adhesive proteins, which should not affect the environment, our colleagues, the community at large, or us even if they escape the lab. Also overexpressed protein production would stop or drop to near negligible levels after the cells run out of the induction molecules arabinose or IPTG, the latter of which is not very common in nature.  For housing applications, it is important that our my"

It bothers me that whenever people see: ""GMO"" they immediately pass it off as something bad or unnatural. There are many reasons why GMOs are used in agriculture-there are too many mouths to feed on this planet - and if it were a choice between starvation and GMO food on the table, which would you choose? If people are so concerned about GMOs being used in farming, then they should encourage small farms and the next generation to pick up farming. It is hands down the most important job in the world-I wish people could understand that.""

""Humans have always used animals to do experiments. Like rats, mice, and monkeys...so I wouldn't say that it is a problem. I mean you have to use it with conscience. For me it is fine if you can follow the ethical rules.""
""I agree with using animals to studies because I think it is important to improve the area - the scientific area - and I think that if you follow the ethical rules to use the animals then everything is fine and we can keep on using animals for science.""
""Yeah. You have to care about the animals because they are helping you-you are not just using them, they are not your property so you have to treat them well. You have to respect another life.""
If you could make any animal do something with biological engineering, what would you do?
""Well I personally would like to fly so if there is a way to make humans fly, like frogs have that -- to breath under water... I would really like that.""

""I think there is definitely a limitation for where we're going, but for something like this where it improves pollution, I don't see how it is going past that limitation yet.""
What limitation are you talking about?
""Um, I guess in terms of ethics, something that directly effects some type of life, like if it is harming a certain organism, but in this case I just feel like it is benefiting society in general.""
Do you think that line is hard to define? If it is harming the organism, but benefiting society a lot is that still okay?
""Definitely because people have different ideas of what life is in general so there are definitely different perspectives of what is right or wrong so I guess it's important to communicate and try to find a good compromise.""

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  I think it was a very productive day.  Jenhan helped with the primer designer while Michelle, Mikey, and I designed the surface version of trumpet which will be hooked up to my back end.  We also discussed making a sexier Simulation Tool for visualizing a sequence of invertase inputs on a user-defined construct.  I think this would allow other people interested in this problem to develop other algorithms.  I also think it would help us explain the invertase problem more clearly at our final presentation.  Mikey mentioned that this might be easy to implement in javascript.  If we do that, then we could simply add it to the final version of Trumpet so that the tool can allow people to design both plasmids and algorithms.
Going forward, I want to spend one more day fixing up the Trumpet GUI and implementing most of the little things I have mentioned (and many more!).  Then I will either work on the javascript representation, or I'll get to work on the algorithms again! :)
7/21/11
Since there are lots of little features I would like to add to the current version of Trumpet, I have compiled the following list of tasks.  Today I will work on these tasks and hopefully move away from the GUI design very soon.
1. Implement format filter on parts/invertases.  Include dialog boxes that tell the user what is happening when they switch formats.
2. Fix up the construct summary in the results tabs.
3. Be able to close results tabs!
4. Fix up the tree visualization.  Add different colored nodes.
5. Fix two tree bugs.  The first is some background infinite loop, the second is the key rings problem.
6.  Renumber invertases for the tailored design construct.
7.  Inform the user that there are not enough invertases available if the design requires that many.  Also, create a dialog box tells the user to assign different invertases for each required invertase.
8. Create a status bar to let the user know when and what is happening during load times.
7/29/11
I finally got Pancake working.  Now I am trying to work out any last minute bugs and also allow the user to define a new design from a generated design by right clicking a node.
8/11/11
This will be my last entry since I am leaving for Duke soon.  I have finished writing up a help html embedded in Trumpet.  I have also implemented the right-click method for cutting a tree at a node, and making that subtree it's own design.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#interview#chan_-_-_TEXT.html," beta cells by decreasing the amount of free fatty acid and ultimately alleviating diabetes. She, however, acknowledged that in the long run, our project itself might not be enough to completely cure diabetes. This is because diabetes is a very complex disease that comes in different forms and is therefore very hard to cure. Professor Chan said that diabetes is a “vicious cycle” and to break this cycle different approaches such as healthy diet and insulin injection are also required. She mentioned that our project could be approached as an option to break the cycle.
We have also investigated the side effects that our project might cause. Prof. Chan specifically mentioned ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis occurs when high concentrations of ketone bodies are formed due to the increase of fatty acid oxidation. We have explained that our inducible promoter is activated at high levels of fatty acids but shuts down before too many fatty acids are oxidized to produce fatty acid deficiency and other side effects such as ketoacidosis. Prof. Chan also worried about the increase of oxidative species caused by the increase of fatty acid oxidation. She said that because fatty acid oxidation requires oxygen, increase of fatty acid oxidation might limit the availability of oxygen for other cells and cause incomplete respiration to ultimately produce reactive oxidative species. She mentioned that to reduce this kind of possible side effect, patients that make use of our product should do aerobic exercise to ensure enough oxygen is provided to the body.
In addition, we discussed the regulations on developing new treatments in medical fields. This allowed us to know more about the biosafety precautions taken in the field. It is known that technologists need to pass 4 phases of clinical research in order to bring their products to market. However, technologists are also responsible to revise and present their ideas to the public so that more people can understand the nature of the ongoing research work.
Conclusion
The interview with Professor Chan allowed us to recognize the limitations of our product in a medical context. The interview also gave us a holistic view on diabetes and brought to our attention obstacles we may need to overcome if we want to bring our work forward in applicability.

Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process.
We measured channel capacity of the part BBa K1061013. We quantify the properties of TRE promotor.
The link is:
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1061013
Our Improvement
Purpose
Channel capacity evaluates correlation between input and output signals. For instance, if channel capacity is larger than 1 bit, the part can decern between high and low inputs, and vice versa. By assessing this novel quantity, we through light on how much information can a inducible promotor pass on. The measuring and calcualtion methods can be applied to more promotors in the future.
Results
Using EBFP2 as reporter, we measure channel capacity of a simple circuit driven by TRE to be 0.5259, with standard deviation of 0.0058.
Methods
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].

In medical applications and plant protection, CDAs are used for designing antifungal and antibacterial biofilms  [2] .
NodB - Sinorhizobium meliloti
Introduction
The CDA NodB is isolated from the organism Sinorhizobium meliloti (strain 1021)  [6] , which belongs to the family of gram-negative proteobacteria  [5] . Rhizobium sp. often form a root endosymbiosis with legumes in nature. Through this, nitrogen assimilation in legumes is provided. For cell signalling the microbial partners and plants exchange diffusible molecules, the so-called nodulation factors (Nod factors)  [7] . Belonging to these Nod factors are NodC, NodB and NodA.
For further information to NodC visit the following link to the  Chitin Synthase .
The nodB gene is 653 base pairs long and translates into a hydrolase with a molecular weight of approximately 24.4 kDa  [2] .
The enzyme works optimally in surroundings with a pH of 9 and temperatures reaching 37 °C  [2] . It solely deacetylates the first position of the non-reducing end in a chitin oligomer  [2] . Due to regioselectivity  [7] , monomers are not deacetylated by NodB, therefore chains of dimers up to hexamers are converted to mono-deacetylated chitosan oligomers  [7] .
If NodB is incubated for a long time with the substrate and high enzyme concentrations, the possibility of double-deacetylated oligomers arises. However, the emerging amount is insignificant  [2] .

Mechanism
As explained before, CDAs occur in many different organisms and produce chitosan out of chitin to outwit plant defense systems. NodB deacetylates the first N-acetyl-D-glucosamine unit (GlcNAc) of the non-reducing end  [2] . Deacetylation describes hydrolysis of"

Check siRNA
Beside the selection of siRNAs, we also implemented a functionality to check siRNAs derived by other methods. For a given target sequence and a corresponding siRNA it is checked whether the siRNA might bind to its target and how well it fulfills the described criteria. Furthermore, its silencing efficiency is calculated.
Command line application
The command line application can be obtained directly here or downloaded from our GitHub repository. To run the command line application, Python 2.7 needs to be installed.
Figure 4: Help message on how to use the command line application.
Used without input, a help message is displayed listing the mandatory and optional input parameters (Figure 4). For more information a README is available in our repository.  All resulting siRNAs are saved in one FASTA file. This simplifies the integration into different workflows. For example, it is possible to test the siRNAs on off-target bindings site using BLAST. An exemplary call of the application as well as the results returned can be seen in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Exemplary call and results of the command line application using a GFP gene sequence as input.
Graphical Interface usage
Like the command line application, the graphical interface version can either be downloaded directly here , or via our GitHub repository. In the graphical interface, the modules are accessible via tabs (Figure 6). The last tab contains usage and copyright information.

Additional Work
Microfluidic technology, also known as Lab on a chip , requires only a small amount of sample and reagents and automates the reaction compared to traditional laboratories. In recent years, more and more iGEM teams have chosen to use microfluidic chips to make portable low-cost hardware[3].
However, the size, weight and cost of these instruments are often limited by liquid drive modules. The common liquid driving methods for microfluidic chips are peristaltic pump, air pump and vacuum pump. These pumps need to be connected to large external devices, making the instrument too bulky and unsuitable for promotion. In order to optimize the liquid driving method of the microfluidic chip, at the beginning of the project setting, we proposed two solutions through brainstorming, namely electromagnetic driving based on electromagnet and driving method of integrated peristaltic pump. We have completed the preliminary design and parameter exploration of the chip under the two schemes, hoping to bring some help to the team that might use the microfluidic chip.
Fig.7 Two o optimized liquid drive methods.(a)Electromagnetic drive;(b)Integrated peristaltic pump.
Electromagnetic drive
3.1 Driving principle:
The electromagnet is placed on the top of each chamber on the chip. When the electromagnet is energized, the magnetic film layer under the chamber is electromagnetically attracted upward. The liquid in the chip can be driven by controlling the three-phase peristalsis of the magnetic film layer. [4]
3.2 Structural design:

She is able to extend a hand to those less fortunate as well as learn more herself in the process. When she feels depressed, she likes to lock herself in her room with a pint of chocolate ice-cream.
Bob Chen
Bob is this year's team's webmaster. This wiki is actually his first endeavor in teaching himself how to code a website. He had always been into cutting edge technology and loves the fact that he is able to work on biology in ways that would have been considered in the not-too-distant past. He thinks iGEM is one of the best opportunities around get undergraduate research done in a relatively young field with incredible potential. As a freshman studying Molecular and Cellular Biology he hopes one day to contribute to the scientific progress of humanity through research. Besides having interests in the sciences, he enjoys experiencing all things Sci-Fi, the cultures of East Asia, the sounds of jazz, and the excitement of e-sports. Also Reddit. A lot of Reddit.
Anthony Chau
Anthony is a junior in Biochemistry. This is his first year in iGEM. He decided to join iGEM because he felt that synthetic biology possessed a potential that has an unprecedented power in influencing the future of biology. He wanted to apply his knowledge and imagination into building innovative biological circuits that could have novel functions and applications. The idea of working with a team of undergraduates to probe the vast potential of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating as well. In addition, he found the iGEM logo curiously attractive. Anthony is an avid squash player. He also enjoys watching movies that make him smile, laugh, or cry. Lastly, he finds it immensely difficult to decide between a freshly prepared piece of sweet hamachi sushi or a delicately seared piece of medium-rare, rib-eye steak.
Asha Kirchhoff
Asha is a freshman in Bioengineering and this year’s iGEM secretary. Her interest in genetic engineering and awesome science led her to the iGEM team, and she’s thrilled to be working with some of the most intelligent and passionate people she has ever met! Being a part of iGEM is also exciting because she views the future of synthetic biology to be full of novel applications in personalized medicine, humanitarian aid, biotechnology and beyond. Outside of iGEM, Asha volunteers with the Society of Women Engineers, watches Dr. Who and the Big Bang Theory with friends, dances around her dorm room, and maintains her nerd street cred through terrible jokes.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on"

We have improved three promoters from the iGEM registry by adding a consensus ribosomal binding site (RBS) from the thiolase gene of Clostridium acetobutylicum to each, which functions in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We then performed a robust characterisation through a GFP assay using a spectrophotometer in conjunction with calibration curves generated during the iGEM Interlab study, and expressed their strengths in standardised units of fluorescence.
Original promoters from iGEM registry:
BBa_J23119
BBa_J23114
BBa_J23106
Original promoters with RBS (Ribosomal binding site):
BBa_K2715119
BBa_K2715114
BBa_K2715106
Additionally we have added four new promoters to the iGEM registry with the same ribosomal binding site from the thiolase gene of C. acetobutylicum. The four promoters are from C. acetobutylicum (Pcac_thl) [Bba_K2715010], Clostridium sporogenes (PCsp_fdx) [Bba_K2715011] and two from Clostridium difficile (PCdi_TcdA) [Bba_K2715012] and (PCdi_TcdB) [Bba_K2715013].
We characterized all seven promoters in both E.coli and C. difficile. C. difficile is a Gram-positive anaerobic organism with significant differences to the E. coli chassis for which existing characterisation was performed. The existing registry promoters BBa_J23114, BBa_J23106, and BBa_J23119 were characterised for expression strength using a GusA assay in C. difficile. The four novel registry parts"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  It has been decided that a new gBlock will be ordered.  After some consultation, it has been decided that the gBlock will be designed with an additional handle for primer annealing.  Regarding the protein expression, the lysis be done and protein concentration will be measured today.
Procedures:
Designing the construct:   The gBlock to be ordered is titled “PCquad Optimized for iGEM 3.0.”  Using a random sequence generator, http://faculty.ucr.edu/~mmaduro/random.htm the handles were designed to be 30 bp.   An initial primer was designed and checked using IDT Oligoanalyzer for secondary structure, and non-specific binding within the construct.  The sequence was optimized by changing some bases.  The highest deltaG was -9kcal/mol for non-specific binding between the forward primer and the reverse complement of the cage. The Reverse primer was designed in a similar method.  The highest deltaG was -8kcal/mol for non-specific binding between the reverse primer and the forward sequence of the cage.
Picking the insertion mutant: Mutant number 10 was chosen due to the site’s potential accessibility by thrombin protease.
Cell lysis:
The 0.093g cell pellet was lysed in 1mL of lysis buffer. Lysis buffer composition: 50mM phosphate pH 8 300mM NaCl 10mM imidazole 1 protease inhibitor tablet/10mL 100ug/mL 2uL DNase/mL
The lysis buffer was added to the cell pellet, and a pipette was used to resuspend the pellet.  The tube was vortexed for 20 seconds in 5 second intervals, and then iced for 5 minutes.  This was repeated three times.  The solution was then spun down for 10min at max speed, and the supernatant was removed.
Observations:  Upon adding lysis buffer,"

Yesterday, we went to MIT to gain experience with the laboratory environment in which the users of our programs would be working. Particularly, my current project targets scientists working in chemistry at the atomic level. The project is intended to allow for 3-dimensional rendering of molecular systems. The molecular structure of a compound is intensely linked to the behavior of that compound and the properties of that compound, and so by studying these latter two fields as would a scientist, I believe I was able to gain insight into how our product might be used by a scientist in a wet-laboratory environment.
For example, one of our experiments involved a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme found within a particular cell. We were given four lines of the cell, each with a different modification to the gene coding for the production of this enzyme. Given as the particular portion of an enzyme which catalyzes a reaction is usually small, it would potentially be possible to model such an active site with our modeling software. So, it was useful for us to see what it would be like to be a scientist working in this environment.
I have had some previous laboratory experience through research in a few other laboratories, so this was a bit of a review day for me. However, I've always enjoyed my work in research, and so feel I was able to take hold of the situation and finish our labs quickly and accurately. The only work with which I had trouble was the circuit modeling, because I had never worked with circuit boards like the one present in this lab, and the instructions were not so clear. My partner had taken a class on this, however, and so was able to use her knowledge to help us finish the lab. My inability to work on this project initially, however, did get"

Human  Practice
Overview
In the 1980s and 1990s, tetracycline as a cheap antibiotic became very popular and caused many problems, such as tetracycline teeth. Long-term use of tetracycline drugs has caused irreversible dental enamel damage. What's more, due to the abuse of tetracycline in animal husbandry, the concentration of tetracycline and its isomers in water has been increased rapidly, which is seriously affecting the healthy survival of human beings and ecological sustainable development. Therefore, this year's Human Practice focuses on the public's understanding and the use of tetracycline, and through our human practices to be able to publicize the relevant biological knowledge as far as possible, while increasing attention to the             use of tetracycline and other antibiotics. Second, through human practice, we can improve our project to a certain extent.
Silver Human Practice
Our team believes that good human practice and public participation are the two most important factors that motivate us to continue the experiment, And not just the iGEM requirements. From the very beginning, we were determined to make our project mean something and we hope it will have an impact that extends beyond the scope of the iGEM competition,even the range of people who study biology. Before and during the design of our project, we have consulted our stakeholders in order to identify, investigate and address several Human Practice issues to the best of our abilities. Our stakeholders come from various walks of life and include academia, industrial and regulatory bodies and the general public. We have visited several large-scale events,such as the 4th Synthetic Biology Young Scholar Forum and the Nine-School Association conducted interviews with experts from the biologic field and the staff most directly applicable to our project in future life, and visited north the largest antibiotic production base in China------North China pharmaceutical co. LTD, to determine the actual use degree and significance of the project. The"

Therefore,                                              we can model the scale of E. coli carbon utilization system working                                              for 1 % of industrial CO2 emission.

DESCRIPTION
We knew that detecting the proinsulin would be the biggest challange yet, as all previous detections was based on chromoproteins and fluorescence, while this was a protein without any intrinsic detectable signal. We had several considerations for detecting the proinsulin production including rtPCR and ELISA, altough ended up chosing SDS page and Western blotting, as these methods provide excellent sensitivity while some of the experiences running the SDS page experiments could be transfered to the western blotting experiments. The results of these experiments are show in Figure 7 and 8.

The construct the cells were transformed with and the dilution factor of the crude protein extract can be seen above the bands. The weight of the proteins can be seen on the ladders.

×
DESCRIPTION
Unfortunately, non of these results gave conclusive evidence for the presence of proinsulin in our samples. The lack of proinsulin on the SDS could be caused by the concentration of proinsulin being lower than the detection limit. The lack of signal in the western blotting results could be caused by our antibody not recognising the proinsulin produced due to incomplete folding, or sub-optimal treatment of the membrane. Of course there is also the possibility that our strain is not producing proinsulin, although due to the positive results using hrGFP we are confident that our expression system works. Other effects such as mRNA folding or rapid protein degradation may also be factors leading to us not being able to detect proinsulin in the samples. Future efforts could include a fusion of the proinsulin, a reporter (such as GFP) or a purification tag (such as a His-tag) aiding the detection of proinsulin.

HZAU-China,2018,Team:HZAU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," and 70% cells die because of the promoter disclosure, but the difference of the proportions of infected cells is so big that the experimental results cannot reflect the real situation. We can reduce the difference by letting the infection proportions of the two kinds of cells both close to 100%.
We solved this problem by predicting the proportion of cells infected with bacteria over time.
Based on these, we designed an App with MatLab ( https://github.com/cccoolll/Pyroptosis.git )                    . In this App, different parameters obtained from measurement experiments can be input to predict the optimal infection time.                     Therefore, this App can provide guidance to the design of our experiments.

We took the water samples very carefully while on the boat. The whole team was taking care of something, gathering the bottles, putting nitric acid, gloves, measuring pH and actual temperature. The sample gathering was done based on the Mexican norm NOM-230-SSA1-2002, Salud ambiental. Agua para uso y consumo humano, requisitos sanitarios que se deben cumplir en los sistemas de abastecimiento públicos y privados durante el manejo del agua. Procedimientos sanitarios para el muestreo.

Second day, July the 25th
We traveled to two locations that day, the town of Pomposo Castellanos and Villa de Acala. Luis Enrique Escobar Cruz, the person in charge of Protection and Restoration of Selva el Ocote Natural Reserve, came with us to the sample gathering at Pomposo Castellanos. Then, we drove for 7 hours to get to Villa de Acala accompanied by Martin Hernandez Martinez. Thanks to them, we had an appropriate approach to the zone and the people.
The samples were taken from the surface of the water body and treated afterwards with nitric acid and kept on ice during the whole trip. The pH was measured and it was 7, appropriate and safe according to the norm.

We spoke with Luis Enrique on our way to Villa de Acala. He has been working for at least 10 years with Ambio Cooperative on the water sample gathering area of Grijalva River. He told us about the well-done agricultural practices they do in Pomposo Castellanos, however, his team has found unsafe discharges of urban waste, corpses and plastic on some locations of the river.

Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching is that dividing the information into pieces and transmitting different pieces through different lines. Both of the two methods have merits and demerits. Then we thought that why we could not combine both of them and then we designed our experiments that transmitting all information through two certain lines respectively in order to reduce the noises and uncertainty. And the experiments confirmed our views in some degree.
So you can see that we had a very successful human practice and we applied what we got from human practice into our experiments successfully. It helped with our project greatly and met the requirement of gold medal undoubtedly."

Overall project
Synthetic biology is the creation of new functions using existing biological systems. In order to assist synthetic biologists, the 2009 Illinois tools team is trying to create a web-based open source program that outputs a theoretical pathway to synthesize a desired chemical product given an input and an output compound. The ideal network will have known reactions taken from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)database, which consists of well-studied organisms. The capabilities of our program will be exemplified by establishing a network for the synthesis of a biofuel and a pharmaceutical from various input compounds, as well as the elimination of a toxin.
Our program is modular and has 4 major components. The first aspect is obtaining reactions from the KEGG database via KEGG API and creating our own database. The second is using all the reactions from our database to create a network. The third is writing the script to assign the appropriate weight to each edge and determining the path of least weight. The fourth is using the resulting pathway to obtain additional information such as a stoichiometric matrix, enzymes that catalyze a specific reaction, and the genes associated with those enzymes. The final step would be to take a feasible pathway and proceed to the lab to test it.

Project Details
Database
As mentioned above we used information from the KEGG database to make our metabolic pathway tool. In order to organize the information and be able to retrieve it as desired, we created our own My SQL database with the necessary components for our network. The Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes has his own application programming interface (API) that  can be used to allow other software, such as our own, to interact with it.
Initially we thought that we would create our network using the API functions each time a request was submitted so that we would have the most up-to-date information. Upon testing that out we determined that it would take way too long for each query. This is due to the time it takes to access the database through the API as well as the limited function calls that are available via the API. To fix this problem, we created out own database that has all the information we need it. By doing this, we decreased runtime exponentially. We explored several options and began with sqlite3.  This was"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," of manufacturing this apparatus.
While the concept of increasing the efficiency of the solar cell is the same, the production method is completely different. Furthermore, for our product a microlens array is used, instead of separate microlenses.
There are also many microlens array production methods patented. However, these are all chemical production methods. There is no patent that describes environmentally friendly produced microlens arrays, produced by genetically modified E. coli. This makes the BioLens MLA a novel and non-obvious product that is in our opinion fully patentable.
The patent application
We have developed a unique method to produce microlenses or in particularly microlens arrays. There are several patenting strategies, possible patentable subject matter is further explained below:
The E. coli strain that is genetically engineered to produce membrane fused silicatein. This protein can be used to make polysilicate out of monosilicic acid.
The production method for the microlens with E. coli strain that is genetically engineered to produce membrane fused silicatein.
The production method for the specific microlens arrays with the help of the E. coli strain that is genetically engineered to produce membrane fused silicatein.
The second option has our preference at the moment. Patenting of genetic strains appears to be difficult in practice. For example, modifications of the strain or the use of an insert from different organisms makes it sometimes already possible to get around the patent. Partly, this can be prevented by only patenting a part of the E. coli strain. For example only patent the round cells with covered with silicatine. This will make it more difficult to change it and get around the patent. However, the iGEM registry can also complicate the patenting process. This is an open source database with all the strains. When we patent our microlens, instead of solely the microlens array, we can protect our intellectual property more easily. The reason to patent the microlens instead of the microlens array is because this gives us the possibility to use the patent for the production of different applications in the future.
We will patent our product with the help of the IP department of the Valorisation Centre.
Patent ownership
It is important to determine the ownership of intellectual property generated at the TU Delft. The product development is a result of the collaboration between a team of students and employers from the TU Delft. Intellectual property, generated by employees of TU Delft are generally property of TU Delft. The intellectual property generated by students can be, depending on the circumstances, owned"

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) in the IAA production pathway. The Salkowski assay is a simple, fast and inexpensive method of determining the production of IAA over a specific period of time. The methods utilised in our experiments were adapted from the 2011 Imperial College London team. HPLC experiments enabled us to gather detailed data about the relative abundance of the reactants and products over time.
Plants
To examine the functionality of our scaffolded system, the biosynthesis of the auxin indole-3-aecetic acid (IAA) was tested. A protocol was developed to investigate the effect of varying concentrations of commercially available IAA on the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana. The results of the plant growth assays demonstrated that the addition of IAA increased lateral root sprouting whilst inhibiting primary root elongation. We have thus created a protocol which can be used in the future to compare the effect of commercial IAA on plant growth with IAA biosynthesised with our Assemblase scaffolding system."

ALPHA was created in August 21, 2009. It consists of three robot arms. Each arm consist of two arm segments as shown in the picture. One arm segment is referred as the control arm and is connected to the motor which controls entirely the joint. The other arm segment, referred as a linkage is loosely attached and moves in a sphere. The end of this attaches to the platform which holds the four pipette tips.

Technically, this is not a LegoRoboBrick. We call this a LegoEnviroBrick. In layman terms, this is just the chassis of the robot.
BETA provides the environment where the robot can move and  conduct its task. It consists of a telescoping frame and a big lego plate under the stand. The telescoping frame is used for holding ALPHAs and PHIs, and the lego plate is where the 96-well plates and petri dishes are placed.
V1.0 uses two separate petri dishes. The first dish contains ethanol and is used for cleaning the pipette tip. The second dish contains water to clean the pipette tip before transferring DNA, enzymes, etc. between wells in the 96-well plate.

Tornillos y genes
Tornillos y Genes (Screws and Genes) is the first blog about Synthetic Biology written in Spanish. This way, we want to spread the last advances in this discipline to the Spanish speaking people, a huge community formed by 500 million people (ref: List of languages by number of native speakers ).  Since its start in March, our blog has received more than 13.000 visitors:  they could read about topics like the Main Registry of Parts , the Repressilator , standardization , DNA origami and different themes from microbiology and genetics to informatics . Moreover, we tag the different articles with a symbol indicating the (engineering or biological or both) difficulty (from one to three): our aim is to create a blog that everyone can find interesting, so we write some complex articles to experienced people and easy articles that anyone can read.
We plan to maintain this blog beyond the iGEM contest and to carry on with our labor of spreading the knowledge in synthetic biology. If you want to collaborate with this project, do not hesitate to contact us!

Applications
Silk is a naturally strong and flexible material, and so it is a unique fiber that can be used in applications that require the normally contradicting qualities of tremendous strength and low weight. It could be woven into thick cables for heavy industrial use or into fabrics for ballistic protection.    Silk not only has amazing properties in its strength and elasticity, it is a highly versatile material that can exist in many different forms. For example, its ability to exist as a hydrogel combined with its natural biocompatibility and controlled rate of biodegradation make it a good material for use as an in vivo tissue scaffold. Silk scaffolds could also exist as mesh woven from fibers and used for skin grafts and bandages.
Projects
Customizing Silk
Modifying the genetic structure of silk can create a diverse new range of biomaterials.
With spider silk as our basis, we started to experiment with the genetic structure of silk. We rearranged portions of the repetitive DNA code to see how it affected the strength, elasticity, and spinning capabilities using Golden Gate Cloning and Iterative Capped Assembly. Click this text to learn about this portion of our project in-depth.
Functionalizing Fibers
By attaching various proteins, we can create silk with specific applications.
Glowing silk is an idea that appeals both to the scientific and artistic worlds. It is a proof of concept for the scientists, demonstrating how we are able to functionalize silk fibers, and an interesting new material to work with for the artists. This method can be applied to different kinds of proteins with different functions as well, but every idea has to start small. To see how we attached GFP to our silk constructs, click this text.
Processing Silk
Engineering our silk is only half the work, creating a tangible product is the rest.
After some stumbles in the beginning of summer when our makeshift rotary jet spinner failed to work, we decided to look into different methods of spinning synthetic fibers. We tested extrusion with a syringe pump, which gave us very thin, fragile fibers. Click this text to jump into the action and watch fibers take shape from solution.

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," is a protein that is good at binding arsenic. We hypothesised that targeting fMT into a microcompartment would enable bacteria to sequester even more toxic arsenic than ever before. BBa_K562018 thus produces a fusion between Pdu40 and fMT, which also carries a C-terminal HA epitope tag, and should be targeted into the sphereactor.
2. Application - bacterial lemonade
A) BBa_K562015 . This is a further modified version of BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and the limonene synthase from BBa_I742111 (Edinburgh, 2007) - EXPERIENCE . We improved the part by adding a PduD40 microcompartment targeting tag and a C-terminal HA epitope tag for easier characterisation of the protein product.
B) BBa_K562016 . This is a modified version of BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and the D-xylose isomerase from Escherichia coli K-12. We added a PduD40 microcompartment targeting tag and a C-terminal HA epitope tag for easier characterisation of the protein product.
C) BBa_K562017 . This is a modified version of BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and the aspartate ammonialyase from BBa_C0083 (Polkadorks, IAP, 2004) - EXPERIENCE . We improved the part by adding a PduD40 microcompartment targeting tag and a C-terminal HA epitope tag for easier characterisation of the protein product.
This overall aim of this project was to increase reaction effiencies and concentrate lemonade ingredients into the microcompartments to allow purification of tiny balls of flavour using the Histags on the sphereactor.
Our Favourite Parts
1. The synthetic bacterial microcompartment - The sphereactor: BBa_K562009
Capsid protein like structure which in bacteria  such as Salmonella functions as a metabolic organelle. Bacterial microcompartment consist of a few thousand shell proteins which contain two or more enzymes which enhances or sequesters of specific metabolic pathway, normally involving toxic or volatile intermediates. The seven genes encoding the BMC Pdu AB, TU, N and JK were ligated into firstly pT7.5 and then into the biobrick plasmid pSB1C3. BMC protein expression was measured using western blotting, staining and also by radioactive labeling. BMC’s were also visualized"

However, as witnessed before, the blue light promotor K238013, which was part of the plasmid prior to ligation, is missing. We are still awaiting the data from another sequencing from the same construct, but from another ligation.
Planning for next week: We need to prepare new electrocompetent DH5alpha cells. EVERYONE, who has free time to spare, please come to the lab and help. We might also be able to get new BL21 (DE3) cells from Prof. Buchner. If anyone wants to get them, contact Lars Mitschke at the Lehrstuhl of Prof. Buchner and talk to him about the request, which Alex asked about. BL21 (DE3) contain a T7polymerase, which can be induced by IPTG. This would be great use in order to test our reporter plasmid, i case the ligation worked (which we should know on Monday).

Cloning
inoculation the following were inoculated: T7 Promotor with lacZ 2x K322127 in DH5alpha
Retransformation of reporter plasmid clone 5
the reporter plasmid clone 5  (118ng/µl) was diluted to 50 pg/µl and to 20 ng/µl
1 µl of each dilution was transformed into DH5alpha
Transformation of RBS
0,42 µl of RBS (47,5 ng/µl) were transformed into DH5alpha
Results
26-08-2011
transformations
were only successful for R2, T7 Promotor with lacZ, reporter plasmid colony 5
testing of K322127
only very small colonies on the plate with no coloring plate that was illuminated with turn-off light and light from the incubator dried out. no black colonies could be detected. Incubation of plate with TUM pattern was continued. Plate was irradated with a light bulb.
sequencing of reporter plasmid colony 5
Bases in squared brackets are optional and belonging to another sequence. Due tu overlapping base shifts exact assignment of bases is difficult
Sequencing reveals mixed clones. Correct Sequence with T7 promotor - RBS – lacZ is probably present beneath construct with T7 promotor lacking. Preparation of RBS-LacZ vector was contaminated with uncut or religated vector."

There was no apparent preference for home-kits versus hospital tests, but a strong preference for tests to be covered by the government through the National Health Insurance. Some hospital administrators even suggested that the government should raise taxes on alcohol in order to fund these tests. On the other hand, government officials argued that the government should not be held responsible for providing testing services because drinking is a personal choice.
We also asked participants their opinions on ALDH2 deficiency and suggestions for ways to distribute our product in the future. (Whole team activity)
ALCOHOLISM
Will people drink more?
One of the main ethical concerns we had about our project was that reducing the health effects of ALDH2 deficiency may encourage people to drink more or lead to alcoholism. We brought the issue up in both the survey and our Bioethics Roundtable. The majority (close to 82%) of survey participants stated that they would not drink more even if ALDH2 deficiency could be treated. This was reassuring, as our focus was on eliminating the cancer risks associated with ALDH2 deficiency rather than promoting the consumption of alcohol.
.
POLICY REGULATIONS
Governmental Change Needed
NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE (NHI)
Current Practices
Taiwan has the largest ALDH2*1 deficient population in the world.  Despite this, nothing is being done at the governmental level to combat this issue. We tried to find out more about this lack of action. From our calls to local hospitals, we learned that ALDH2 deficiency tests are not readily available, yet, a variety of smoking-related tests are commonly provided for free by Taiwan’s Ministry of Health and Welfare under “Smoking Cessation” programs. We were also surprised to find that citizens (30 and above) who chew betel nut or smoke have access to free oral cancer screenings every 2 years.
We reached out to Dr. Cheng-hua Lee, the Deputy Director General of the National Health Insurance Administration (NHI) to ask some questions relating to ALDH2 health issues. We first asked why Taiwan’s health insurance covers smoking-related issues but not alcohol related issues. Dr. Lee believes there is not a clear relationship between alcohol and increased cancer risks. He says that unlike smoking and betel nut chewing, which have direct cause-and-effect relationships with certain cancers, the combination of drinking and ALDH2 deficiency have yet to demonstrate a direct relationship with cancers (head and neck/oral). Dr. Lee also said that current statistics show that drunk driving is the largest alcohol-induced problem, and not the deficiency. He went on to say that the deficiency might"

Results
At the beginning of the experiment, it was found that the yield of BC was higher than that of G.xylinus cultured individually when cultured with E.coli at pH=5 ，so we first construct the PPGM-PGM-331 plasmid and verify its effect on BC yield after overexpression.
The results show that the overexpression of PGM has no significant effect on the increase of BC yield.
We acquire genes of PAsr from K12 genome of E.coli via PCR
We acquire genes of PGM and c-di-GMP from genome of G.xylinus.(With and without PGM)
Construction of vector PPGM-PGM-pSEVA331. Transformation of plasmids into E.coli.
Verification of homologous recombination via colony PCR
Co-culture of E.coli and G.xylinus
Second, we found a strong promoter -J23119, linked it with the PGM, at the same time                                 linked it with c-di-GMP which is a signal molecule could improve the yield of cellulose                                 synthase.
The results show that the yield of BC was not significantly increased, but the yield is increased compared to PPGM-PGM-331 plasmid, specially  J23119-c-di-GMP.
We acquire gene sequence J23119 and complete its linking with PGM and c-di-GMP
We insert gene segments into plasmid pSEVA331 and transform it into chemically-competent E.coli.

Co-culture of E.coli and G.xylinus
Third, due to G.xylinus is co-cultured with E.coli in the environment of pH=5 as we                                 designed, we also try to linked PGM with the acid-controlled promoter PAsr, and linked                                 c-di-GMP with PAsr. We explore and compare the effects of overexpressing PGM and                                 c-di-GMP on the yield of BC in the environment of co-culture and pH=5. At the same                                 time,the effect of it and pH-responsive promoter PAsr on BC production will be                                 compared.
The results showed that the yield of BC was further improved than that of the second step, especially when PAsr was connected with c-di-GMP, and the yield of BC was significantly improved under mixed culture.

In addition, since these drugs work on a single pathway in the cancer cells, many tumors develop a resistance to the treatment. Our system is based on DNA     strands rather than on proteins and therefore, our therapy act as a micro drug factory that is able to synthesize inside the cell a few killing proteins     that intervene with multiple pathways, increasing our efficiency in eliminating cancer cells.
4.   Marketing/Sales Strategy
Patient access to oncology medicines varies widely by country and closer scrutiny is being placed on value by payers and patients who may face a growing share of treatment costs.
•  The availability of new medicines varies widely across the major developed countries with patients in Japan, Spain and South Korea having access in 2014 to less than half of the new cancer drugs launched globally in the prior five years.
• In pharmerging markets, availability of newer targeted therapies remains low though increasing.
•  Even when available, lack of reimbursement for drugs, particularly in countries employing formal cost effectiveness methodologies based upon cost per quality life year gained, constrains access for patients.
•  Assessment of value for oncology products is becoming more complex as fewer new drugs have single indications and by 2020 it is expected most will have three or more indications.
•  Divergence in clinical value by indication complicates assessments of appropriate pricing by payers since in many cases the majority of a drug’s clinical value may be in areas with small patient populations while most of its use is for indications with relatively less value.
•  Overall therapy treatment costs per month have increased 39% over the past ten years in inflation- adjusted terms, similar to the 42% increase in overall response rates and 45% increase in months that patients are on therapy, which also contribute to higher overall spending levels associated with improved survival rates.
•  In the U.S., patient out of pocket costs associated with IV cancer drugs have risen steeply as consolidation of smaller group practices into larger hospital systems has triggered higher outpatient facility costs shared with patients.
•  Patient concerns about the financial burden of living with cancer is a frequent topic of discussion on social media sites which are increasingly used as a source of information and for sharing experiences.
•  Pricing a new cancer drug involves trading off a complex set of variables. The potential for multiple uses, with differing clinical"

Enzymology
CL: This week we received the FFA assay kit and tested two BTE/PDC transformed cultures (+ 4 negative sigma70 controls); pellets and supernatants both were tested.  Results were positive for two of the cultures (BTE9 and BTE10) and results suggested that fatty acids were present in the supernatant as opposed to the cell itself.  We decided to do a time course growth on one of the identified cultures (BTE9)in order to further analyze production of fatty acids through out the culture growth cycle.
Media
We received a new incubator to allow for greater numbers of 250 mL flasks.  This will also let us keep one incubator at 30° C.
Because we have been getting poor results for growth of all of our E. coli strains in BG-11 media, we ordered fresh BG-11 stock from Sigma Aldrich and made a new stock solution of 1.0 M glucose.  10-ß plates were restreaked on new LB plates.  We also made a 10% w/v tryptone stock for overcoming auxotrophies in the E. coli strains.
A growth curve was performed to determine if 1% w/v tryptone was enough to induce sufficient growth in either 10-ß or Iq cells.  Results showed that the addition of 1% tryptone to BG-11 allowed for growth nearly comparable to that of LB, in the case of both strains.

Estimating Model Parameters from Experimental Measurements
Two parameters relating to the Monod equation, the maximum specific growth rate μ, and the saturation constant Ks are estimated graphically. These graphical methods are based on our readings of the literature [1, 3]. First, the cell growth described in equation 16, the Monod equation, is linearized similar to a linearization of the Michaelis-Menten equation.
\[\dfrac {1}{\mu} = \frac {K_s}{\mu_m}.\frac{1}{S}+\frac{1}{\mu_m}  \]
Where
\[  \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{X}{\frac{dX}{dt}} \]
This takes the form of a double-reciprocal Line-Weaver Burk plot of 1/μ vs 1/S. From the slope and intercept of this plot, model parameters μ and Ks are estimated. The graph below shows the estimated parameters derived from the experimental data for the genetically modified yeast and wild type yeast in a glucose substrate (YPD yeast media).
Figure 1 Double-reciprocal Line-Weaver Burk plot for Cell Growth
To check our work, we also used a simpler method, a plot of the log ratios of cell concentrations against time. This method applies to the exponential phase of growth and is useful for getting an estimate of μ from the slope of the graph, according to Equation 8. The log plots are shown below. The figure also captures a summary Table of model parameters.
Figure 2 Log plot of exponential cell growth to estimate the maximum specific cell growth rates for the genetically modified and wild type yeast in a glucose substrate, and the genetically modified yeast in starch substrate.
The Table summarizes the model parameters from the two graphical methods. The growth yield Yx/s  is obtained from the experimental measurements; calculated as the ratio of the differences between cell densities and glucose concentration for two time points, at time zero and the time point corresponding to the end of exponential growth
MATLAB for Parameter Estimation and Model Simulation
Since the graphical analysis shown above allowed only some of the model parameters to be estimated, we went to MATLAB to accomplish estimating all the parameters. The problem of parameter estimation is a nonlinear optimization problem. It is an iterative process where one starts with an initial estimate of the parameters, runs the forward problem of solving the set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) with these parameters, and then compare the output of the"

The first aim of our modeling is to estimate the production rate (κm) of AHL in marine cells. The synthesis of AHLs by 'marine' bacteria involves the transcription of certain genes when the secondary structure of RNA thermometers was melted and then output Lux I promotes AHL production by catalyzing the reaction of the two AHL precursor molecules, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and hexanoyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein).
The reaction can be summarized as,
Where S, C6, A and M are SAM, hexanoyl-ACP, 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and the waste product, respectively.
In marine construct, output of Lux I occurs at a constant rate L0 as indicated in Figure 1 and decays at a rate of λL. Noted that λL was not the natural decay rate, the degradation of LuxI was accelerated by introducing LVA tail in marine cells.

Helical Outpost
Helical Outpost is a military hydroponics outreach based in Louisiana which trains military veterans into hydroponics farmers in 6 weeks. We talked Kohlie Frantzen, who told us that they invest substantial time into creating standardized farming training using ideas from oil drilling sites. They also have invented a greenhouse that can be easily deployed in all climates and work as the village’s or town’s hub. They operate with the big theme of local sourced food. We hoped to learn which components of hydroponic farming are crucial to a successful setup and what techniques they found worthy of monitoring and standardizing. Helical Outpost's biggest concern is ensuring that the electrical components of their green houses do not fail and waste a full cycle of crops. They informed us that a way to see live data from hydroponic tanks would be extremely valuable. We hence ensured our user interface clearly displayed real-time analytics in an easy to understand format.
JUNE 15, 2017
Amhydro
We talked to Joe Swartz, VP of Commercial Sales and Technical Support at AmHydro, one of the largest hydroponic equipment distributors in the US. We hoped AmHydro could evaluate how marketable of a product OxyPonics is and whether or not OxyPonics would gain traction in the hydroponic community. Joe gave us insight on both the farming and technical aspects of hydroponics. We discovered that customers decide to upgrade their systems usually when there is a large return value, even with high initial costs. Currently, Amhydro is working on a way to effectively and easily keep track of data from crops using software. This would make growers' lives easier, since they need expensive documentation and certifications in order to produce food.Our software therefore provides longer term records of hydroponic conditions over time, in addition to real-time analytics.
Outreach Innovation
Overview
In our outreach, we aimed to improve our own methods and skills for communicating complex topics like synthetic biology effectively. However, we did not stop with our mission to “ learn to teach ”. We gained insight about the potential hydroponics has to meet the produce demands of large cities. According to research done by Columbia University’s Urban Design Lab, urban agriculture in cities not only address questions of food security, but also encourages social development, public health, and environmental education [1]. Urban agriculture is an underutilized public resource, and therefore promoting community focus farming may sow the seeds for community self"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," The workshop was really impressing and energized for thinking. Furthermore they organized a collaboration speed dating where all teams could discuss about possible ways to help each other. iGEM Dresden put so much effort in this Meetup and it has been fantastic. It was the beginning of so many friendships and collaborations between iGEM teams. Finally we drove home with tons of new knowledge and energy.
Camping with Team Aachen
On the 10th of June we went camping with our dear friends from iGEM team Aachen to fuse our iGEM spirits. For that we rented a little camping spot in the beautiful Heimbach located in the low mountain range Eifel in North-Rhine-Westphalia. As soon as we had  prepared our tents we went for a nice hike and took an ice-cold bath in the fresh Eifel-water.
As a nice surprise, we found a rent-a-boat shop and of course took the chance to start a boat trip. We were pretty shocked when we encountered a sea-bear, but luckily our expert and savior Manuel Lentzen drew an anti-sea-bear circle around us, so it just went away. As we returned to our camp spot we played some social games and shared our plans and thoughts about iGEM. As the last activity we went for a night-hike; it was a lot of fun. Because it was a clear night, we decided to forget about our tents and slept under the stars!
The next morning we had a tasty breakfast just before we went home; thank you iGEM team Aachen for this amazing camping trip! :)
iGEM – not an ordinary competition
iGEM is a synthetic biology competition which enables students to realize their own lab project together as a team. One year full of work, facing problems, not enough sleep and losing the view for everything besides iGEM. As this sounds like something nobody would do voluntarily there must be „something“ special about iGEM! After all this time we think we have finally solved this mystery and found the crucial „something“!
The first time we got a hint what this something might be was at the German Meetup in Dresden. Meeting other teams who are in the same situation and share the same interests was quite amazing! New friendships have been built pretty quickly and the whole atmosphere was filled with so much fresh energy, creativity and scientific curiosity! After meeting all these awesome people we were pretty excited to see them again at the European Meetup in Delft. Furthermore we met a whole lot of other teams and had a tremendous time.

Our story
Most of all, iGEM has been a great character defining experience. To us, it is the story of an idea that started to form in the mind of a few team members, years ago, and who finally came to fruition. This is their story…
There are two sides to this story, one in Biology School, the other in Bioengineering School both at UCLouvain.
On the biology side, there were Antoine and François, two Second year baccalaureate biology students. One day, as they were working on an assignment on synthetic biology for their biochemistry class, they stumble upon iGEM’s website. It was love at first sight and from that day on, they could never really shake off the idea to be part of such a competition. UCLouvain had never participated but they were convinced that by the time they would reach their Master degree, they would surely have.
On the other hand, Kilian found out about iGEM in September 2015 while watching a documentary called “Fabriquer le vivant” , literally “Making Life” ( video available on Youtube ). Excited, he had to talk about iGEM to his classmates! Professor P. Morsomme, giving a class on Biochemical Analysis as this great discussion took place, intrigued by the uncharacteristic fervor of the students, had to jump in. This was not the first time, he had heard about such competition and he referred Kilian to Antoine. Together, they managed to gather around them enough people to start calling themselves: “The first UCLouvain iGEM Team”.
Hopeful but not vain, they knew it was going to take a lot more convincing to get UCLouvain Professors and the University on board. Members of the team set out on a quest and went door to door looking for the required academical support. Finally, Professor P. Soumillion and Pr. B. Hallet answered the call. They decided to take the lead and give a home to the team in the Biochimestry, Biophysics and Genetics of Microorganism Unit at the Life Science Institute.
Many brainstorming sessions took place in order to discuss objectives and to decide how we should"

Human practices
Instead of reaching out to the general population, we decided for our Human Practices to introduce the iGEM community to microfluidics. We took advantage of our university's expertise in this area to integrate it in our project, and hope that our work will inspire others to adopt the technology. Our work towards this is presented in the Project section, under the header Microfluidics .

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Human Practices
UESTC-Software members got the spirits of iGEM and completed the competition. We try our best to connect
our work with more people, more targeted groups, to integrate their ideas, inspirations to draw a clear and realistic blueprint.
Silver
Our software has good influence on science progress, we want to expand the influence to society through human practices, which centered on public engagement, public perception and education. We have built a bridge between our lab and the public. Having bi-directional effects on our team and the public is what our human practices really want.
Gold
Human Practices is necessary for the birth of a project; also, what we did should be given back to human practices. With such idea, we have investigated the human practices into the design and execution of our project, Bio101 and Bio2048.
Integrated Practices
We are competing for the Best Integrated Human Practice. We collected feedback from public on the idea of DNA information storage which are vital input to our final design of Bio101. For the edutainment video game, Bio2048, was modified according to the feedback from education aspect. It received 5-star evaluation on the Tencent’s app store.
Engagement
We are competing for the Best Education and Public Engagement. The past summer, we developed an edutainment game Bio2048, and organized 3 large public engagement activities. In addition, we gave almost 200 street interviews and opened a Sina’s micro-blog with 1034 followers, which were the source of the statistics of our survey results.

Stanford-Brown-RISD Best Parts Collection
Chitin is ubiquitous in nature in organisms ranging from fungi to insects - in fact, it’s the second most abundant biopolymer on earth. Methods to take advantage of this fact using synthetic biology are limited - we established a part collection using chitin binding domains as a novel platform to functionalize chitin-containing surfaces, with almost unlimited potential for modifying regions of organisms. We demonstrated the utility through designing novel biological cross-linking glues, fluorescent dyes, and filtration tools. We then used Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, strength testing, and various other quantitative methods to conclusively prove the mechanism of action and the ability of this collection to be used for novel applications. We’ve also filed a patent disclosure and are moving forward with further refinement or our framework. The part numbers range from BBa_K2868011 to BBa_K2868028, but not all parts in that range are included in the collection. Our collection forms an important pipeline for future teams and the global scientific community for a wide array of applications ranging from water purification to bioglue production.
