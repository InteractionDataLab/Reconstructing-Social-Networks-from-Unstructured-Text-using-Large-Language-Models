We finished the lecture part of the presentation to continue on a group activity that we named Mini iGEM. The class was divided into small teams of three or four and they were asked to design their own iGEM project.
The classes participated with enthusiasm to the Mini IGEM and the discussions. We received many crazy and ingenious project idea. Notably, a team suggested a project called Octopotato. They planned to use the genes responsible for the regeneration of octopus’s arms on vegetables like potatoes. This would theatrically solve worlds hunger.
Even if their projects were far from being perfect we loved to see their wild imagination come into play for synthetic biology.
In the end, we were really happy of the outcome of this High-school day. We succeeded in presenting a complex field of study to students while engaging this group of students to iGEM with their Mini IGEM project.

INTERVIEW WITH YOLANDA SCHAERLI
Introduction
In September, we had the honor of sitting down with Dr.  Yolanda Schaerli,                      currently employed at University of Zurich, who will soon start her own                      group at the University of Lausanne. During the first part of the interview                     we explore her academic path, and the current direction of her research.                      The echoes of her past in protein engineering are still audible in her                      recent publications, but it is safe to say that her research characterizing                      the behavior intersecting genetic circuits and the effect of regulatory                      phenomena on phenotypes are firmly rooted in the realm of synthetic biology.                     After discussing her current research, we delve into the ethical dilemmas                      facing synthetic biologists. Ranging to suspicion from the public to preventing                      bioterrorism, we tried to give you a sneak peek into this complex world                      where philosophy meets pragmatism.
Summary
igem.today represents a veritable stream of information, which has the                      potential to constantly bring new and refreshing perspectives from the                      iGEM world to the general public, as well as other members of our community.                      We felt, however, that this aspect of igem.today could be complemented with                      the perspective of experts in the field, so we set out to find such an expert                      and investigate ongoing professional research and the interplay between                      synthetic biology and ethics.

Fish tag Component
This is a model of the fish tag component of fishPHARM.  As shown, the thick end of fishBIT is a hollow tube.  This is the same end that hooks into the fish when each fish is tagged, making it an ideal drug delivery pathway for flavocide.
fishBIT
This is a model of the full drylab component, called the fishBIT, complete with a transparent silicone-based tube on the back to contain flavocide peptide treatment and allow the user to easily gauge how much flavocide is left in the fishBIT system.
flavocide in fishBIT
Finally, we present a model of the entire fishPHARM system, in which flavocide has been loaded into the fishBIT and is ready to help a fish fight off coldwater disease.  The flavocide has two major components: 1) Our EcnB peptide, shown in green, suspended in 2) a biodegradable polymer gel.  EcnB is incredibly toxic to the causative agent of BCWD, F. psychrophilum, yet completely harmless to the human body since it is actually found in the human gut genome.
*The models of each component were made utilizing both Solidworks and Autodesk Maya.
Models were shaded, lit, animated, and rendered using Autodesk Maya.

We had trouble to proceed with the ligation of the three inserts to linearized pBR322 and pSB1C3. We discussed with Takara Bio about our ligation issues, the GC percentage on our overlaps was too high to allow for a good ligation.  Due to the lack of time, we were not able to redesign the overlaps for this construction.
Summary
Achievements:
Successfully cloned a biobrick coding for RIP secretion in pBR322 and in pSB1C3, creating a new part Bba_K2616001 .
Successfully sequenced Bba_K2616001 in pSB1C3 and sent to iGEM registry.
Successfully cultivated S. aureus biofilms in 96-well plates with different supernatants. Although there was a high variability in our results, and we used several protocols to overcome it, in one case, we were able to observe a reduction in biofilm formation in the presence of our RIP.
Next steps:
Clone the sensor device with inducible RIP production upon S. aureus detection.
Improve the characterization of RIP effect on biofilm formation with a more standardized assay.

KILL SWITCH
BBa_K2616002
The sequence designed codes for two different proteins: CcdB toxin and CcdA antitoxine. The antitoxin production is under an constitutive promoter (PLac) and the toxin production under a thermosensitive one (PcspA).
We gene synthesized the genetic construct of our kill-switch commercially. Once we received the sequence, called Seq9, in a commercial plasmid, we transformed competent bacteria E. coli DH5α. After bacterial culture and plasmid DNA extraction, we digested our DNA with restriction enzymes, extracted the inserts from the gel, and ligated it into linearized pSB1C3 for iGEM submission and expression in BL21(DE3).
We proved that our vector contained the insert by DNA electrophoresis (Figure 19).

Outlook
Since we are the first team of our university to participate in the iGEM competition, lot of effort has still to be invested to create a favourable environment and a close, far-reaching network for the iGEM initiative to grow and to expand at Wuerzburg. We will further intensify our relations to different faculties and institutes to conduct interdisciplinary research.
We have already published an article in an internal journal at our university, called “Einblick”. The next step to push our project forward and to gain local support is presenting our results to the public at our home town by newspaper articles and a discussion Forum. Our “Cake and Science” cake sale in the university hospital is our first step to reach out to the inhabitants of our city. Furthermore, we will present our research to biomedical students from all over Germany at the 13th Biomedical Students` Symposium in November.
Education
Cake and science
Wondering about how we could bring our project in mind of people from our city who we wouldn’t meet at the university, we came up with a rather unusual idea: Why not have a piece of cake with people while introducing them to our project?  We organized two cake sales at the facilities of the university hospital in Wuerzburg. We were able to present our project to the public and we also gained some revenue selling the cakes.
People were attracted by our poster we had brought with us. Not only doctors were curious, but also the staff, visitors and the patients were asking questions about our work. Enlightening conversations about the development of diagnostic tests while eating a lovely piece of self-made cake created a less common, more extraordinary atmosphere, which was pleasant for our visitors and for ourselves. For the insatiable curious people, we provided handouts for further reading.
Lab intern pipetting test
The iGEM intern pipetting workshop was designed to provide first semester students an introduction to standard pipetting techniques. Also, the more experienced students were given an excellent opportunity to pass on their knowledge to younger students.
Taking part in the lab intern pipetting test also trained the participants in precise pipetting, which was a big advantage for the students of the wet lab team when they started their work in the lab later.

You need to teach them to not contaminate the test.” Upon learning of these various problems, we began integrating it into our project.'),     p('Taking this into consideration, challenged ourselves to design a detection protocol that would utilize the least parts and would be able to withhold the most severe conditions. This would accommodate for the lack of resources that was discussed earlier with Dr. Leautaud. In order to integrate her advice into our lab work, we designed protocols utilizing lyophilized cellular reagents and decided to use LAMP for amplification purposes. The lyophilized reagents are stable as they do not need to be frozen, and LAMP amplification would only need a constant water bath, not a thermocycler like with PCR. Not only would this take the hospital’s capabilities into consideration, but it would offer our kit a competitive edge in the market as advised by Ms. Dawson. She recommended that in creating our kit to take into consideration the comfort level of the patient, but also to ensure that the kit is unique. The reason being, it would increase the chances for the kit to be sponsored by organizations, allowing the kit to be used by a larger clientele.'),     p('Previously, Dr. Leautaud stated that “The test needs to be under 3 or 4 hours for the mother to stay in the hospital. In order to integrate this into our project, we designed a protocol that would fit this limit. The final protocol we decided upon would take about 3 hours to complete, allowing the mother to receive the results before her exit from the hospital. This would allow the hospital to provide additional information and would aid in the treatment of the infant.'),     p('In terms of sterility, we created an educational training protocol to include with the kit which would help equalize any differences in training. In order to do so successfully, we reached out to a safety officer for advice (Dr. Singh) and consulted with an NGO official (Ms. Dawson) who offered information regarding HIV kits. Dr. Singh recommended that “ The best you can do there would be best practice or universal precautions, the idea being that you would treat all samples as potentially pathogenic or infectious, but there would likely not be an opportunity to set up a BSC or any type of clean workspace.  You would want proper PPE which at a minimum would be clothes that cover skin (long sleeve etc.) gloves, eye protection, and a lab coat. All the waste should"

Week of June 18th: Paper Prototyping the MoClo Planner Design
Monday, 6/18: Today Kara and I interviewed Professor Sequeira. It was a very informative interview.  Professor Sequeira gave us a lot of tips on how to visualize a troubleshooting tree, and how her team graphs progress when they are doing a long-term research project.  Also, she gave us a lot of suggestions on features to add for the ELN, or should I say, the PLOTBox.  The next thing we need to do is transcribe the interview, and focus on designing the MoClo planner.
Tuesday, 6/19- Wednesday, 6/20: I spend almost all day reading the MoClo paper and trying to understand how to visualize fusion sites and restriction sites for the MoClo planner- this thing is much more complicated than I thought... Orit also asked us to look up additional information, such as related research, to design the MoClo planner.
Here's a panel from the MoClo planner designer that we storyboarded.
Thursday, 6/21: The team paper-prototyped the MoClo planner using Balsamiq, and we started to storyboard it.  There will be a primer designer incorporated into the design, as well as access to fact sheets and related research.  It'll be similar to gnome surfer, but instead of extended desktops, the levels are vertical ""shutters"".  On the left is a picture of what the first panel would look like.
Friday, 6/22: I transcribed the interview with Professor Sequeira, which took a very long time, with annotations.  Next week, the goal is to make a video for the MoClo planner after we've refined the details, and then send the video to Traci for evaluation before we dive in and start implementing our design.
Week of June 25th: FInalizing the MoClo Planner Design & Introduction to Eugene
Monday, 6/25: Continuing interview transcriptions; between the two interviews so far, there are a lot of material covered.  Nahum, Kara, and I started making a refined version of the MoClo planner for the video, and talked more in details about the transitions.  There is a huge difference between what we designed for the Balsamiq prototype, and what is designed as the paper prototype for the video."

Background
Last year, our team came up with a lot of ideas through brainstorming, but when we were about to link our projects to our daily lives, we met the following problems:
1. For our team, we don’t know what the public really need
We have come up with a lot of ideas in every field, such as bio-battery, waste oil detection, transformation of Metarhizium to kill cockroaches, sewage treatment and so on. But we can't quite determine whether these projects are acceptable to the public, and whether they are actually what they really need. We need to collect information about the public's views on these ideas and to understand the actual needs of the public, and then make a choice.
2. For the teams among iGEM, we can’t get the current feedback
Among the many participating teams, we also need more feedback from peers and professionals in the topic selection and experimentation. When we have an alternative project, we can't quickly find out if other teams are doing similar work and go through a feasibility study of the project. In the course of our experiments, we can't get timely feedback and suggestions about improvement, which is easy to be limited to our own ideas, causing unnecessary waste of time and energy.
3. For the public in China, most people hava a misunderstanding resistion of Synthetic biology and genetic engineering
In China, most people have misconceptions about synthetic biology and genetic modification. Most people think that synthetic biology is harmful and refuse to accept genetically modified products, especially food products. However, there is currently no platform for normal publicity and exposure to synthetic biology in the country. The public has little understanding of synthetic biology, and they naturally contradict this"

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,". As a result, we are able to provide iGEM participants and researchers with an overview of how this decision applies to Australia, while considering Australian patent law in relation to genes.
In 2014, this issue was appealed to the High court, challenging the Myriad decision in Australian courts. The D’Arcy case argued that since genes are naturally occurring substances, that it should not be possible to grant a patent over a gene sequence that someone can discover to have special significance. From this, we have recognized the importance to identify and review the current Australian patent law and intellectual property.
Full Report: The Australian approach to intellectual property; Myriad on Appeal in Australia.
October 2014
The Macquarie team urges the Australian Government to extend the exemption to patent human genes for commercial use as this would make medical care affordable and accessible for all Australians. Communication about legal issues such as patenting is an important key point, as researchers need to understand the legal boundaries upon which they operate in, especially in issues such as the positions of law and the identification of concerning areas."

It is an awesome challenge which will hopefully help me to cultivate myself.
Enoch Ng
Biological Sciences/Business
I am entering my fourth year of studies at the University of Alberta, and am looking forward to the challenge that iGEM provides.  In the future I hope to travel across the world and meet people ranging from Meshaal to Obama and remain a glorified generalist.
Emera Nguyen
BSc. Biological Sciences/Economics
I am a BSc student entering my fourth year in a Biological Sciences major and Economics minor.  This year will be my second year on an iGEM team, and my first year representing the U of A team.  In my downtime, things I enjoy include spending quality time with friends and family and traveling to lesser-known parts of the world.  One year's experience later, the iGEM competition still impresses me with the unique opportunities it provides for student growth.  This research competition is one of the highlights of my undergraduate experience.
Mitch Paquette
BSc. Honors Molecular Genetics
I have transfered into the honors program in Molecular Genetics from a BSc General program in Physical Sciences.  After my degree is completed I plan to apply to graduate studies in Molecular Biology, after which I hope to work in research or academia.  What excites me most about iGEM is the opportunity to gain research experience in such a new field.
Amber Paul
BSc. Specialization Immunology and Infection
I plan to find the cure for cancer.  Seriously.  Will be attending graduate school to earn a PhD following my undergraduate degree.  I would like to live somewhere warm that allows me to do research, preferably Maui.  iGEM is a developmental forefront to Synthetic Biology, something that I love to be part of.  Its challenging and fun.  To be able to determine the minimal genes for a simple prokaryote, we provide a scaffold to future research on larger, more complex cells such as cancerous tissues, simple eukaryotes, etc.

Gibson Assembly for 8 remaining chromoproteins
●
After our Gibson we nano dropped and saw extremely high concentrations which is to be expected. We then transformed our 8 Gibson products into chemically competent E. Coli and plated them onto LB+chlor plates at a 1:4 dilution. We covered them and placed them at room temperature to grow up over the weekend. If our PCR and Gibson were successful we should see colorful colonies on Monday.
Monday, 9/12
●
The plates did not grow colonies over the weekend so they were placed into the incubator to see if this would help growth
●
4 plates began to grow colonies after sitting in the incubator. The four plates were SP, BB, LO, and SO. These plates all used the same meffRed for the Gibson so maybe this is why these worked and the others did not. We will still re do the Gibson and transformation in case the growth is contamination and not actually growth
●
Because our plates did not grow colonies we redid the PCR of meffRed back bone, His-tag and chromoproteins
●
We then ran a PCR clean up of all our PCR products
●
We ordered primers for the 4 chromoproteins that expressed color (TP, PP, CP, VP) in order to Gibson in the CBD to our chromoprotein-His-tag. The CBD will be Gibsoned in between the chromoprotein and His-tag
●
Once we ran the PCR clean up of our PCRs we created this chart for our Gibson assemblies and used NEBuilder Hifi DNA Assembly Master Mix to run 8 Gibson assemblies

Earlier studies had indicated that CecropinXJ shares a similar structure with ABP-CM4, which has the ability to form specific amphipathic α-helices which allows targeting of nonpolar lipid cell membranes. Upon membrane targeting, the helices form ion-permeable channels, subsequently resulting in cell depolarization, irreversible cytolysis and cell death [15-17].

Discussion
In predicting a functional promoter sequence, we followed one of the basic principles of synthetic biology: Studying nature quantitatively and applying the knowledge thus gained to the de novo creation of biological entities. Four points require further discussion:
What is the scientific significance of the analysis created by HEARTBEAT?
How can the HEARTBEAT database be improved?
What does the outcome of our in vivo test tell us?
Can promoter design become fully automated?

The 2015 UCLA iGEM Interlab/Measurements Study Notebook
Introduction
The 2015 UCLA iGEM Team is proud to participate in the Second International InterLab Measurement Study in synthetic biology.  As members of the synthetic biology community, we are committed to providing robust data for development of novel characterization methods in the rapidly growing biological design fields of synthetic biology.
The purpose of the 2015 InterLab study is to ""measure and characterize fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices"" expressing GFPmut3b (SwissProt: P42212) from active iGEM teams participating around the world.  By collecting fluorescence data from multiple teams in absolute units, variability in measurement and consistency of data collected from instrumentation following a uniform procedure can be determined within a high degree of accuracy.
This notebook will record all protocols, daily experiments, basic parameters and images, as well as the raw data used to prepare the Interlab Worksheet, Protocol, and Wiki page for submission at the 2015 Giant Jamboree.
Experimental Design
Three separate genetic ""devices"" were constructed using IDT gBlocks Gene Fragments synthesis, in addition to positive control BBa_I20270 (Constitutive Family Promoter J23151 inserted upstream of the promoter MeasKit) and negative control BBa_R0040 (pTetR - empty control plasmid). All gBlocks were designed on Benching to simulate the sequence of the BioBricks standard assembly product, for uniformity in measurement with teams that opted for RFC10 standard assembly.  All devices were subcloned in the standard pSB1C3 (chloramphenicol resistance marker) backbone and transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli . As such, E. coli BL21(DE3) laboratory strains were used as the chassis for fluorescent measurement.  Details as to"

Our BioBricks BBa_K1316012 and BBa_K1316017 encode the mtrCAB genes under control of a weakened T7 promoter with the lac operator (T7 lacO). In addtion, BBa_K1316017 carries a histidine (HIS) tag at the 5' end of the coding sequence which makes it easier to purify MtrB during characterization experiments. The end constructs are visualized in figure 1 and 2.

Figure 2: BBa_K1316017. Schematic overview of our BioBrick encoding the mtrCAB genes and HIS tag under control of a T7 lacO promoter.
Cloning Scheme
Making a BioBrick of the mtrCAB operon is quite challenging. First of all, the coding sequence of mtrCAB contains several illegal restrictions sites. Secondly, we need to have the operon under the regulation of a weakened T7 lacO promoter[1]. To get rid of the illegal restriction sites as well as implementing the T7 lacO promoter in our BioBricks BBa_K1316012 and BBa_K1316017 , we ended up having 5 pieces of DNA to be ligated into pSB1C3. To work efficiently, we used the Golden Gate Assembly to clone these BioBricks  (see figure 3).

The BioBricks BBa_K1316012 and BBa_K1316017 encode a weakened T7 lacO promoter (red rectangle) and the coding sequences of mtrC, mtrA and mtrB, indicated with grey arrows. The beam beneath the arrows visualizes the regions and relative sizes of the 5 DNA pieces that were ligated into pSB1C3.
The Golden Gate primers were designed in a way that restriction with the BsaI enzyme resulted in a EcoRI overhang at the 3' end of the DNA and a SpeI overhang at the 5' of the DNA. In this way we were able to clone the DNA fragment into pSB1C3 by using EcoRI and SpeI. To construct the mtrCAB-HIS, the reverse primer of the last DNA part was designed in a way that a HIS tag was introduced at the C-terminus of the MtrB protein."

Sponsoring
Finding sponsors for our project was a challenge that kept us busy during the whole year. Tobias did a great job in supporting us to get in touch with companies and local foundations. Illiana, Maga, Annabel, Rick, David, Chantal, Fabian, Batu, Anna and Susanna took this further by creating a sponsoring brochure, meeting company salespersons and applying for financial support. Annabel, Nicole and Rick never got tired of writing applications for academic sponsoring. They presented our project to faculties and student councils, and established cooperations with research institutions constantly increasing the outreach of our project.
We would like to thank Prof. Sauer, Prof. Hanke, Prof. Vogel, Prof. Gessler, Prof. Frosch and “Universitaetsbund Wuerzburg” for supporting us in every aspect of fundraising at our university.
Human Practice
Our main focus of our human practice program was set on education to make iGEM a well-known issue at our university and to create a fundament for following iGEM teams at JMU Wuerzburg in the future. Networking is a crucial part for this attempt because the most important thing for a newly funded team is to introduce your existence to as many people as possible.
Nicole, Annabel and Rick got in touch with the deans of the faculties of biology, medicine, chemistry and biomedicine to spread the news of our newly founded iGEM team and asked them for support. Nicole and Annabel also managed to create collaborations with research institutes at our university whose directors helped making other university members aware of iGEM.
Eli supported us with a news item in our university’s newspaper “Einblick” so that not only natural science faculties at our university were informed about iGEM and we could reach out to everybody.
In addition to spreading the news of our new iGEM team at our university we reached out to tell the citizens of our city about our work when Chantal organized two cake sales at the hospital.
Taking part in German and European meetups Nicole, Rick, Annabel, David, Maga, Johannes, Maria and Eli could present our project to other iGEM teams and get to know fellow iGEMers. Our official mentoring cooperation with Munich was introduced there.
Tobi, Maga, Chiara, Illiana and Chantal produced our introduction video.
Our iGEM lecture series was organized by Johannes, David and Alexandra.

Design:
When we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan. We discovered that many products had already phased out triclosan; some labels even read “Triclosan Free.”  Although triclosan had been removed from products, many of them had simply replaced it with a different antim"
Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," enzyme called sialidase, under its regulation. Thus, when an abnormal osmotic pressure is detected by the bacteria, the gene expression of the mucus degrading enzyme would subsequently be triggered.
Once the enzyme is expressed and secreted, sialidase will cut the sialic acid in the branches of the thick mucus. Altering the mucus composition would make the mucus thinner and restore the mucociliary clearance.
The mucus degrading enzyme
We have mainly focused on two enzymes. Firstly sialidase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes glycosidic linkages of terminal sialic acid residues in glycoproteins. These sialic acids have been suggested to inhibit mucin degradation. Using a genetically engineered bacteria to remove these protective terminal groups will improve interaction and degradation of the mucins. Secondly, endo-β-galactosidase, is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the bonds next to galactose saccharides in the polysaccharide chains of mucins. It has been proven to release saccharide chains from glycans expressed in the gastric mucous cell-type mucin.22
In the mucin constructs, saccharides interact with water and form a mucosal layer. The large mucin constructs give the mucosal layer its visco-elastic properties. By using the aforementioned enzymes, these polysaccharides will be removed from the protein backbone, resulting in the mucus losing some of its gelatinous attributes.
There are two main differences between using an enzymatic approach instead of using mucolytics. The first one is the specificity. Enzymes are highly specific in comparison to other chemicals and will only interact with the mucin as well as often have a reaction time that is several times faster.The second difference is that the bacterial approach provides an autonomous system. This system will regulate the expression and secretion of the drug/enzyme accordingly to the disease state. More specifically, it is not until the bacteria can sense the elevated osmotic pressure that it will subsequently initiate the expression of the enzyme(s). The conventional therapy of mucolytic simply attempts to provide a one-time bolus to restore the mucus state, limiting its effects to being temporary.23
The way our system is constructed, the amount of enzyme expressed and secreted in the lungs will be associated and proportionate towards the osmotic pressure, making our treatment a personalized medicine. In contrast, a patient using mucolytic will have to try to decide on his/her own what dosage is needed for that particular time.24

This project has the potential to be expanded to detect many different pathogens. We have chosen vibrio cholerae as an initial proof of concept as it has a specific autoinducer (CAI-1), reducing the chance of interference in the pathway.

Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at"

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Policy&Practices#Survey_-_-_TEXT.html," National Day Golden Week holiday, we conduct the survey around Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center through two main ways: Distributing on the street and Filling out online.
Through the efforts, we acquire 153 effective questionnaires.
These are some essential information of the interviewee.
From the pie chart, the percentage of male and female is so closed that we might get information more accurately.
Comparing with the three pie charts above, it is obviously that the majority of our responders are students who held a bachelor degree. This is followed by the high school degree. Only a minority held a master degree or a PhD (both 5% nearly).
It seems that the majority of responders have a higher education background, which makes it more easily to finish our questionnaire as they might have a learnt about ABR from the courses.
The most responders are the young and the middle-aged. They are more frequently use antibiotic and will pay attention to the drug's mechanism of action.
Before questions, we give a common basic knowledge on Antibacterial Resistance (ABR) & Synthetic Biology.
Later, interviewees are asked to choose the behavior when they contact the antibiotics.
Questions are divided into three classes, including how well you know about ABR, the way you use antibiotics and how many do you know to decrease ABR.
These are the data analysis from the questionnaires.
Question 1, Do you know something about antibacterial resistance?
A. Yes, I know. (85.99%)
B. No, I have not heard anything about it. (14.01%)
Question 2, Do you know the relationship between antibiotic misuse and antibacterial resistance?
A. Yes. I know how the antibiotic misuse makes ABR. (64.97%)
B. Yes. However I do not know the mechanism. (23.57%)
C. No. I do not know anything about it while I am interest to learn more. (8.28%)
D. No. I do not know anything about it and I think it is not necessary to do that. (3.18%)
From the two questions mentioned above, the public have a general knowledge of ABR, and more than 95% know or want to know the relationship between antibiotic misuse and ABR.
From the data in the past years of China, the phenomenon of antibiotic misuse is so serious. One of the primary causes is that people do not realize what will occur if they use antibiotic wrongly. As the time went by, the public awareness is improved. This makes people reduce the use of antibiotic consciously when it is unnecessary.

Where do we waste energy?
A brief study on energy, a day with highschools students and an interview with an energy expert.
Where's our energy going?
About 80% of the world population has access to electricity.  This number will increase, as more area become developed and urbanized. Different countries have different energy needs due to their economy and development and therefore the consumption of energy varies significantly. For example, in Europe and in the US one of the main area of energy consumption is domestic (houses and office spaces), while in Asia the industry is the major area of energy use. However, in all the three continents domestic energy consumption range from 30% to 40% of the total energy use.
Distribution of Energy consumption in Asia, Europe, and USA Data are elaborated from [1] [2] [3]
The amount of energy used changes significantly from country to country. For example, in the US the typical house consumes 2 fold more energy than the typical house in Japan and 4 times more than an Italian house. However, if we look individually at the domestic consumption for each of these countries, it becomes evident that in all the three cases we can make a difference in the national energy consumption/waste if we try to reduce domestic household energy needs. Taking a closer look at the domestic consumption, it becomes evident that heating and cooling systems are where energy is mostly used domestically.

Household electricity distribution in a typical home The data visualized in this figure are representative of a typical urban home (source). Energy needed for Heating and Cooling (space + water) represents 72% of the total consume. Data from [5] .
The first step? Make a difference!
We can try to make a difference by reducing the waste of domestic energy. In an ideal world we should reach a situation where the heating and cooling energy gets close to zero, and the only energy needs of a"

The main victims of those injuries are people from low and middle-income countries, with economic conditions that do not allow access to legalized quality products [7], and yet there has not been any relevant investment, neither from governments nor from the private sector, on developing tools to help solving the problem of intoxication by methanol [8][9].
A methanol detector would also be very useful to a second group of noncommercial drink producers: people from countries either developed or in development that take part in organized online communities, sharing methods of beverage production [10]. Unlike the previous case, their production is small-scale and solely for own consumption, and despite having access to specialized knowledge, often the producer's methods are quite rudimentary, lacking basic safety precautions [11][12][13]. A cheap and user-friendly methanol detector could improve the quality of the production of those home distilleries, reducing the risk of intoxication by methanol.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#human practice_-_-_TEXT.html,".(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is"

Where \(Q\) is the volume flow rate of water through the mass exchanger. By combining these 2 relationships we arrive at
\[d\Delta c=-\dfrac{dJ}{Q}=\dfrac{-K_{m}\left(\Delta c\right)dA}{Q}\]                             \[d\Delta c=\dfrac{-K_{m}\left(\Delta c\right)dA}{Q}\]
In this expression \(\Delta c=c_b-c_f\) at a distance \(x\) from the start of the mass exchanger. Rearranging and integrating leads to
\[\ln\left(\dfrac{\Delta c_{i}}{\Delta c_{o}}\right)=\dfrac{K_{m}}{Q}A\]
Where \(\Delta c_{i}\) and \(\Delta c_{o}\) are the concentration differences at the inlet and outlet of the mass exchanger respectively. Thus \(\Delta c_{i} = c_B - c_{fi}\) and \(\Delta c_{o} = c_B - c_{fo}\).
The total mass flow, \(J\), can also be expressed as \(J=Q\left(c_{fo}-c_{fi}\right)\). Substituting this into the previous expression gives us
\[\ln\left(\dfrac{\Delta c_{i}}{\Delta c_{o}}\right)=\dfrac{K_{m}A\left(c_{fo}-c_{fi}\right)}{J}\]
Which can be rearranged into the form
\[J=K_{m}A\dfrac{\left(c_{fo}-c_{fi}\right)}{\ln\left(\dfrac{c_{B}-c_{fi}}{c_{B}-c_{fo}}\right)}\]
Comparing this to the form of the mass equivalent of Newton's law of cooling, \(J = K_mA\Delta c\), we see that we have derived an effective average concentration difference across the entire mass exchanger. This is known as the log mean concentration difference. We used this result to determine an estimate for the total exchange area required for our system, here .
Stochastic Diffusion
We explored a stochastic diffusion model in our project. We used it to find the time taken for our enzymes to diffuse from the outer radius of the catheter into its centre. This information does not inform much about the design of the project, but the modelling is interesting and may be useful for future iGEM teams.

SDS-PAGE Verification of Fractions
Verify purity and presence of protein at correct MW on SDS.
If pure, proceed to BCA pooling.
If impure, proceed to BCA pooling only with the most purified fractions.
BCA pooling
Pool the most pure fractions together in a 50 mL conical to concentrate the amount of proteins in solution possible for the Co-Spinning Procedure.
Use the Protein Concentrators purchased to centrifuge and concentrate the solutions completely.
Imidazole removal via dialysis of pooled fractions
Imidazole interferes at the 280nm necessary for excitation during the BCA colorimetric assay, protocol used here [1]
Save 4 mL of the pooled fraction for dialysis using dialysis cassettes following the Teule (Nature 2009) protocol here [2] .
The following is the protocol (using tubing -- will be adjusted for use in cassettes):
Take a piece of prepared dialysis tubing and wash it under running deionized water. Clip one end of the tubing to make a bag. Transfer 4 ml of the eluted fractions into the dialysis bag (fractions 4–7 from Steps 51 and 52) and close the bag with another clip. Place the closed bag in a large beaker filled with deionized water (4 liters) over a stirring plate to dialyze the samples at room temperature. Change the dialysis buffer (water) at least 10 times, at 2 h intervals over a period of 24 h. The dialysis is important to remove the components of the elution buffer. For freeze-drying58, dialyze the sample extensively against 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate.

Collaboration 3: iGEM McMaster
This year iGEM Guelph had the pleasure of attending the Ontario iGEM Annual Meet Up (oGEM) which was hosted by McMaster University. Multiple teams across Ontario gathered together to discuss our project and team experience. We were joined by iGEM teams from the Universities of Toronto, Queens, Waterloo, Brock, Ottawa, and Western Ontario. This year we were also joined by representatives of SynBio Canada and we all engaged in topics of the challenges faced by researchers in the field of Synthetic Biology and why there is an opposition to its universal implementation as a viable tool to help solve global problems. Our team’s own Jehoshua Sharma brought up one of the main talking points about a huge challenge of synthetic biology: We don’t have an accessible definition of synthetic biology, and so it’s hard for the public to realistically understand what it is if every scientist has their own personal definition and not a consistent answer for the general public.
The experience to engage with the other teams, by virtue of sharing values and critiques of each other’s projects has inspired Guelph iGEM to be the hosts of oGEM 2019.

Hopefully they can help me with learning some coding skills over the course of my time here at Wellesley. I can already tell this will be a great summer with the enthusiasm and positive energy that I felt in the lab today.
Today the upward bound kids came to help us test run our prototype. Upward Bound is a summer program that 9-12 grade students take part in on Wellesley's campus. It was interesting to see how they interacted with our prototype. I saw the full range of what someone felt coming up to the multitaction. Some were hesitant to touch it at first while others were excited to run up and start playing. This also helped is with the design process of our prototype. Without this user test, we would not have found some flaws that occurred within our program. For example, a few of the users suggested after interacting with the program that it might be more helpful if there were some more written instructions for them to read as they went along creating their bacteria. Another huge part that they helped us with was allowing us to see how different users worked with the tangibles that we provided them with. Some were not sure what at all to do with them, while others got it right away and were able to get the relation that we tried to convey through the common images on the screen. From that observation, it allowed us to know to add a statement in the instructions for the user on the screen about the tangible element. Currently, our tangibles are still cardboard cutouts. However, shortly we will be laser cutting acrylic to make new tangibles for the final product which is very exciting. But, that also means that things are starting to wrap up for the summer which means that we are so close to what will be the final version of our program.
Today was my last day here in the HCI lab for the summer. Looking back, I realize just how much I learned. Besides gaining some coding languages and skills, I learned a lot about the human component of programming. I learned that you need to think about how someone would try to interact with your program with no knowledge of what to do. As I finish this summer my main goal is to keep learning more coding languages. Also, I am looking forward to rejoining the team in September for the competition. I am excited and thankful to be able to experience this unique opportunity. This summer, the HCI lab and the iGEM team helped to give me a look into what is possible in the computer sciences and what I could do going into the future. I now"

TU Darmstadt - Exploring the German Community Lab Scene
At the 12th of June, the iGEM Team Darmstadt came to visit us. Quite soon it became apparent that they seem to be in tune with us. As a consequence, collaborations on several levels arised. Some weeks ago, we had offered them to use the first version of our lab organization software tubefront . The feedback that we got from team Darmstadt helped us to understand how we could improve our software.
Beyond only presenting and discussing ours as well as their project, the members of the iGEM Team Darmstadt stayed the night within the scope of their Labsurfing journey. For the second day, we invited them to have a deeper discussion about the growing Community Lab scene in Germany. Together, we had a first evaluation of the general pros and cons of community labs.  The elaborated protocol of our discussion is shown here . Since both teams were very interested in the respective development, we agreed to stay in contact throughout the year and to have a final joint conclusion .

Visiting the iGEM Team Bielefeld
On the 5th of June, we visited the iGEM Team Bielefeld. While having coffee and cake, each team presented their project followed by a little discussion and receiving feedback. We were fortunate to get valuable ideas concerning using our pumps in microfluidics. As a consequence, we adjusted the design of our devices and customized the control program software to support this field of application.
Some weeks later, we could return the favor:  Team Bielefeld was searching for different sources of water to test their genetically engineered machine. Therefore, we took two samples, one from a pont in a parc of our city and an additional sample from the famous warm sulfurous terrestrial spring, which was already the favourite place of Charlemagne the founder of Aachen.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Specificity_-_-_TEXT.html," scattering results (Figure 3) give information about the size distribution of the particles that are present in the solution.
Figure 3. The size distribution of particles in solution of BBMV's obtained from T. molitor and Varroa destructor calculated with data obtained by dynamic light scattering.
Looking at both transmission electron microscopy results and dynamic light scattering results, the T. molitor samples have a large population of vesicles that vary their size around 200 nm. Looking at the V. destructor samples, the population around this size is smaller. To learn more about the proteins in these samples, click here .
Fluorophore Leaking Experiments
The hypothesis is that due to addition of a detergent, the phospholipid bilayer will rearrange. This process will subsequently give the fluorophores the chance to escape their enclosed space and disperse in the solution. The dispersion of the fluorophores into the solution would then cause an increase in fluorescence as described previously.
To determine whether these BBMV's were capable of releasing fluorophores and whether this release could be measured, the following was done: to BBMV's containing carboxyfluorescein, 1 volume percent of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) was added to disturb their stability. Meanwhile the fluorescence was measured over time.
Looking at Figure 4, after addition of SDS (detergent), an increase in fluorescence is indeed visible. However, the same increase in fluorescence can be observed over time with vesicles that are in an environment without SDS. Two possible explanations for this phenomenon are that BBMV's are already porous or are not stable under the circumstances during measurement. Both processes would result in an increase in fluorescence over time. In order to compare induced fluorophore leaking from standard fluorophore leaking, the speed of the carboxyfluorescein leaking should be calculated and compared.
Figure 4. (a) The fluorescence of a solution with BBMV's incorporated with fluorophores and a solution with free fluorophores was measured over time. After 330 seconds, detergent was added. (b) The fluorescence of a two solutions with BBMV's incorporated with fluorophores was measured over time. To one sample detergent was added. Both graphs were made from data obtained from BBMV's from T. molitor. For both graphs a similar effect was visible with V. destructor BBMV's.
Obtaining Kinetic Values

On Wednesday last week we did the restriction enzyme digest using XbaI on the pPlat plasmid and the GFP with both forward and reverse primers containing XbaI (a non-directional cloning). There was some pipetting error that  diluted the solution. We ran it on a low-melt gel and cut out the bands.
Today we ligated the plasmid(pPlat) and the GFP, and transformed into DH5alpha. Addison showed us how to plate the bacteria and we set it to incubate overnight at 37 degrees overnight. Tomorrow we'll put it in the fridge  and continue work on Wednesday.

To avoid the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, any plasmids containing them should be degraded as completely as possible.The efficacy of denaturation alone in reducing plasmid transformation has been shown to vary greatly depending on the composition of the solution. This finding puts into the question the established routine of treating plasmid-contaminated waste by autoclaving alone [10] [11] .
Commonly used sterilizing agents generally have little to no effect on DNA but a variety of commercial DNA contamination solutions are available and household (hypochlorite-based) bleach has also been shown to be quite effective [12] . For surfaces and instruments, UV irradiation is another established method [13] . However, the basis of avoiding plasmid contaminations remains good laboratory practise - minimising spills and working in a well contained environment.
Minimise spills and work clean
Surfaces and instruments: Hypochlorite bleach, commercial DNA-decontamination solutions, UV-irradiation
Waste: Autoclaving in controlled conditions
Antibiotics
Antibiotics themselves should be handled with care and te containment strategies as outlined above are applicable as well. Whereas autoclaving or disposal in chemical waste are preferable for antibiotic solutions, smaller spills can be sufficiently well cleaned-up with a commercial bleach solution [14] [15] .
Antibiotics differ widely in their character and in any potential harmful effects (details are usually provided by the retailer) but to contain them as well as help limit toxic effects, it is advisable to handle powdered antibiotics exclusively in chemical hoods [16] .
Familiarise yourself with each antibiotic you are working with and and the risks associated with it
In many cases: autoclaving for bigger volumes, bleach for smaller spills
Avoid
Antibiotics can be used as selection markers and it stands to reason that the ones you pick for your experiment should not be commonly used treating infections. This way, any emerging resistance helped by the use of antibiotics will not further reduce the treatment options for infected patients in clinics. However, antibiotics used in experiments within the biotech field are sometimes still used to treat infections, more or less frequently depending on where in the world you live. Careful handling of antibiotic-transformed bacteria and optimizing safety in labs are crucial to not further drive resistance, since one of the major driving forces of resistance is the usage of the antibiotic [17] . Four antibiotics are used in the iGEM competition: Chloramphenicol, kanamycin, ampicillin and tetracycline.

Protein expression of MG1655 with bdh2 in 3-hydroxybutyrate in LB.P3HB was tested at 4 concentrations for protein expression assay - 40 ug/L, 80 ug/L, 400 ug/L and 800 ug/L. P3HB might have reduced Bdh2 expression at concentration higher than 40 ug/L, as indicated in a t-test comparing the fluorescence/OD600 values (p<0.05). Bdh2 expression was induced by 1 mM arabinose. Fluorescence sensitivity was set at 50. Data points show final time point after 7h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 7h. Error bars are SEM, n=3.

Conclusions: Elevated lactic acid results in a pronounced lag phase. At 37°C ethylene glycol does not have a significant effect on MG1655 growth. 3HB and acetoacetate are not toxic until their molarity is or exceeds 237 mM and 287 mM respectively. At the tested concentrations, neither PLA nor P(3HB) had a significant effect on growth.

After building the chassis strain, we began to design experiments to verify whether it could achieve our desired results.
For the Detecting chasis:
Since our chassis strain is E. coli and does not contain tetracycline resistance, we need to verify whether the gene tet(A), tet(R), tet(O) we introduced enables E. coli to survive in water samples containing tetracycline and achieve detection purposes.             Firstly, we need to test the tetracycline tolerance of the constructive detection chasis, here is the resluts in the fig.1
fig.1 The tetracycline tolerance of detecting parts comparing with the orginal E.coli
From the data, we can clearly see that, the constructive detection chasis obtain a tetracycline tolerance from 0-100μg/μL, and then, detecting chasis can be growth normally in the culture medium with tetracycline.
Meanwhile, we have a collaboration with the NKU-China that we sent our detecting chasis to ask for measuring minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), and we can also get the tetracycline tolerance of this chasis which similar with our test results.
fig.2 The MIC of the detecting parts
After determining that our chassis can survive tetracycline, we need to further test its performance and get the following data:
fig.3 The ratio of FL value and ABS value of the detection chasis under different tc concentrations
In order to further improve the accuracy of detection, we have exchanged the gene tet(A) and gene gfp. we verified those constructive chasis with the same              experiment designs, and then we found that it can detect more lower concentration at 0.00005μg/ml.

Summary
Ligation is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology. In molecular cloning ligation is the process by which external DNA is inserted into a vector DNA, often a plasmid, using the enzyme DNA ligase. The newly formed DNA, or recombinant DNA, can then be analyzed or transformed.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform ligation. T4 DNA Ligase Buffer, vector DNA, insert DNA, water, and T4 DNA Ligase are metered on the chip and are then mixed together. The solution then undergoes incubation, after which the recombinant DNA solution can pipetted out from the chip and used in further molecular cloning procedures

Motivation
This year the work of iGEM Team Tübingen on the T-ECO project was all about the conversion of blood types to provide an improved blood supply for patients in emergency and to thereby save lives.
The human blood can be classified into several groups based on the presence of certain antigenic  structures on the surface of red blood cells. In total 33 blood-group systems have been identified [1] ,  while the ABO system is the most important system in human-blood transfusion.
Figure 1: ABO blood type system. Oligosaccharide structures on red blood cells act as antigens. Based on the oligosaccharide of group O, group A contains an additional N acetyl-galactosamine  and group B has an additional Galactose attached to it. Red blood cells from group AB carry both  types of oligosaccharides [2].
While the plasma of group A contains antibodies against antigens of group B and the other way round, the plasma of group O contains both antibodies. In the case of group AB no antibodies against  an A or B antigen are present. This properties directly explain the compatibility of blood groups in the  case of a blood transfusion, as shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Compatibility of ABO blood groups for blood transfusion.

3rd Idea – Bio Memory by Arun and Goksel
Has somebody already a similar idea to this one?
How much information can you store with a simple on/off signal in spores?
How are you going to store the bacteria in serial fashion?
This idea is very simple – where is the novelty?
Could you do something with concentrations of protein within a cell?
Can you integrate some of the first idea with this one, especially the sporulation signal idea?
The main issue is sequence! How do we get sequential order in bacteria?
Could we use the biosensor application featured here for detection purposes in the heavy metal idea?
These questions were posed by the presenters:
Can we have biostability inside spores without any DNA rearrangements?
Can we store colour-giving properties inside the outer layer of the spores?
Is it possible to control DNA rearrangement?
Vote Result
Not everybody has voted yet
However today’s meeting has showed that the first and third ideas can be amalgamated – everyone present was in favour of this suggestion. The idea – maybe use Bacillus subtilis to detect heavy metals in soil and then give a signal for them!
Wiki Tutorial/Presentation
Yet to arrange meeting with Morgan sometime next week however James has already done a short tutorial online which gets people familiar with the internal wiki. MediaWiki tutorial to come…
NEW Action Points For Next Meeting
Review the questions and challenges put forward for each idea
Do additional reading/research into ideas but more of an emphasis on the first and third ideas
Finalise an idea and write a paragraph on the idea to be posted in the main wiki
Reschedule wiki tutorial with Morgan.

Professional Visiting
1. Visiting the Profession:
We visited Professor Mrs. Xiu-mei Chen of Taiwan University of Science and Technology in June this year, and asked her about the technology of detecting the concentration of bacteria on the chip. Then we learned that the chip developed by Professor Chen Xiumei could detect the concentration of many bacteria as well as the one we wanted to detect Streptococcus mutans, S. mutans. Therefore, we asked Professor Chen Xiu Mei about the technology and gained lots of meaningful advices to improve Caridex.
2. Inviting Professions:
In order to make our product more fitting to the market, we invited the CEO of the Renew Biocare Corporation Mr. Ully to discuss the current development of the device. During the discussion, we got a chance to know the similar products on the market. We absorbed the relevant advantages of those products and managed to apply them onto our product to improve the whole project.
Furthermore, this company is one of the leading dental materials companies in the world, so we also asked them to help us check whether our product is safe and forward-looking.
Additionally, we invited to the National Yunlin University of Science and Technology teacher Mr. Zhong-guang Chen to teach us how to establish a product business model design, to help us in the subsequent commercialization of the product.
3. Visiting Dentists
We visited multiple dentists in order to understand the actual needs of the patient and their actual oral condition. Furthermore, dentist had a better understanding about what users really concerned about, especially the safety of our product. Those information helped us to get closer to meet the demands of the public.
Survey
1. Oral Condition Survey:
In order to understand the oral status of the community in Taiwan, whether they have right concept of oral health care, and their thoughts on our product, we conducted an online survey. The survey results are as below:
Total sample number is 678 people.
Summary
From the graphs above, we can see that although the average level of concern for oral health is high, and more than half of the people go to dentist regularly, still, more than 80% of people have oral diseases. Much more worse than those that don’t go to the dentist regularly. So we think that preventive oral treatment is necessary in Taiwan and Carindex is here to solve the problem.
2. GMP Concern:
Genetic engineered product has always been an issue of concern to the public. In order to understand how many people are"

 Best therapeutic project
Our approach aims at being simple, targeted and precise, but at the same time it can have a global impact and touch also the poorest countries. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is the the future of medicine as it is highly customizable and efficient. We focused our project on one particular problem although our proof of concept can be extended to basically any pathogenic bacteria able to accept the plasmid we engineered!
At first, our project was designed to neutralize bacteria that multiply in stagnant water. We have conceived this work for a first test on Salmonella. We could then consider targeting other pathogenic bacteria the same way like V. cholerae and multi-resistant nosocomial bacteria. Apart from this situation, we could make a prototype to render inactive the nosocomial bacteria that become resistant in the hospital environment. Similarly, we could create a protective film for the prostheses before their implantation.
Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest problems in today’s medical world. With our technique, we offer a potential new treatment against these multiresistant pathogens. This idea represents a new hope… by provoking a war between bacteria… or, if you prefer, a BactWars.
Our therapeutic project is not static, it is dynamic and it opens up the way for new improvements, ideas, applications. We created a therapeutic tool, now it is time to use it the best way possible! It is a new idea, but it is made of bacterial tools that we already use. It is very specific but it can have a global impact and touch a large number of people, especially in the poorest areas and it can be effective in a short time.
It would be the ideal solution in Cholera Outbreaks which are normally sudden and very widespread! The low cost of our solution would make it interesting for those areas, and could be a great alternative to chlorine tablets currently used for water purification. Even though their cost is low, they are often used the wrong way and their effects don’t last enough time.
Our main goal was to fight Antibiotic Resistance, but the plasmidic CRISPR"

Another PCR Screen was set up for R0010 + B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015, and these were the correct band sizes. Ran third round of SDM. Varied amounts of template, 50ng/ul and 20ng/ul. Also ran another segment SDM PCR on Y127A and T96A mutants, 50ng/ul. Conducted a PCR screen on parts J23101+B0034+KAN+B0015 and J23101+B0034+Full Cutinase. Added DPN1 to third SDM and ran screening gel. Third SDM products transformed.
Friday August 31th
We met with our advisers today and learned that we should strategically approach the SDM. Rather than do the previous sequential protocol that we were following, we should run multiple primers with the template plasmid DNA in the same reaction. Even though this is riskier, it would save a lot of time if it worked. In addition to the multiple sets of primers, we are devising a plan to SOE together the different segments. We will PCR out the fragments using the SDM primers. Then the SDM primers will be able to complement each other on different strands and complete the whole strand, incorporating the mutations in. We also made competent cells for DH5α, and we will test exactly how competent they are in the days ahead.

This seminar happens on fridays and has as audience the graduate students and professors from the department. It was a very good experience because we practiced a formal presentation, we had to answer several questions about our project and experimental design. After the presentation we received valuable tips from UFMG researchers, which helped us to adjust our proposals concerning the chosen biomarkers and the experimental approaches for achieving our aim.
UFMG&Escolas Project
In order to introduce children to synthetic biology universe (literally… virtually travelling to Mars!) of present and future applications, we have created and applied a didactic (and, please… fun!) game for middle school students. This opportunity and public arose from a preceding, very prestigious project (called “UFMG & Escolas”, literally UFMG & Schools; http://www.icb.ufmg.br/biq/ ufmg-escolas/) from the Biological Sciences Institute (ICB) of our university, whose intention is presenting compulsory school students to scientific life. Along a week, students participate in many activities related to what academic community produces. They also have the opportunity of developing and presenting a proposal of an empiric project that they have to idealize and execute.
According to our planning, a short presentation tought students about the concept of synthetic biology, the biological structures, and the iGEM competition. Once students had this basic information, they were oriented to separate themselves into seven groups, dispersed along the room where there were monitors from iGEM_UFMG team. Each group received a card deck and chose an initially secret mission to explore by engineering a genetically modified organism (GMO).
On a first moment, the card game (BRICKARD) was played among the group mates: each student should individually try joining the set of cards that he/she judged propitious to form the GMO able to solve the problem presented in the group mission.
At this time, they only knew details about their own mission, while there were cards related to the other missions, whose utility they ignored. Whether no one could show a complete and congruent set approved by all group mates at the end of 5 minutes, the group together should elect one. On a second phase, independently from how they achieve the set, the whole group should present its mission and chosen solution to everyone, justifying why their set of cards could be used to construct a GMO in order to complete the mission.

Abstract
CAR-T therapy is one of the most promising treatment for cancer, with multiple ongoing clinical trials worldwide and 2 therapies        approved by the FDA. However, without proper control after administration of CAR-T cells, severe adverse effects may bring fatal        risks to the patients, especially during the clinical trial stages. While suicide switches serve as common methods for controlling        adverse effects, they completely halt the expensive treatment, and repeating the treatment process could be a burden for the        patients, both physically and financially. To provide a safer yet affordable CAR-T therapy, we developed a reversible safe switch        controlled by small molecules called CAR BRAKE. By expressing U24 protein of the human herpesvirus 6A under the control of tet-ON        promoter, we can downregulate CAR molecules on the cell surface through endosomal recycling inhibition. We demonstrated in Jurkat        cells that U24 can downregulate surface T cell receptors, which can be subsequently restored by removal of doxycycline. Modest effect        of U24 on surface level of CARs was seen in Jurkat cells. In addition, we determined the optimal concentration for induction,        expression time course and degradation half-life of U24 in HEK293T cells. No cytotoxicity was observed in cells transfected with U24.        Collectively, our results indicates our design could potentially be used as a universal add-on for all CAR-Ts and TCR-Ts to ensure        safety.
Background
CAR-T Therapy
CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) therapy is one of the most promising treatment for cancer, with multiple ongoing clinical        trials worldwide and 2 therapies already approved by the FDA(June et al., 2018) .
The therapy engineers endogenous T cells from the patients with synthetic receptors for tumor antigens, enabling them to target tumor        cells. The synthetic receptor, or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), consists of an extracellular antibody-derived single chain        variable fragment (scFv) domain that can bind specific antigen with high affinity, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular        signaling domain. The 1st generation CAR molecules only include a CD3zeta signaling domain, the minimal domain"
UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html,"Mars is the next big colonisation step. We've been to the Moon, and there are plans for the Moon in the future, however Mars is the place we have our sights set on as our next habitat. I know what you're thinking. Why? Why would anyone leave the wonderful comfort of our own planet, with internet, good food, family and friends? For the adventure of course!""
If we look at Maslows hierachy of needs (Khanacademy, 2013), this is in argument that only speaks to the people that is in the absolute top of the pyramid. However not all members of our species are this priviliged, so it cannot be the next step for our species, it can only be the next step for the elite. It might seem slightly paradoxical to see the human species as a whole using a ""we"" that implicitly includes everyone, while at the same time not seeing (or at least taking into consideration) that a very big part of this ""we"" actually hasn't come anywhere near this development step. However this might be one of the arguments that is very effective, not for convincing people who are not already interested in the topic, but for justification between people who are already in the top of the hierarchy of needs.
3. The third argument is answering the claim ""We should not colonize Mars"" with the ground ""It cannot be justified economically"", and therefore the warrant ""We want to be able to economically justify what we do"". The argument can e.g. be found in the article ""All the reasons humans shouldn't colonize Mars, according to experts"" by Brad Jones on the site Futurism. Jones states ""One of the biggest obstacles standing in the path of a human colony on Mars is the price tag. Getting to Mars will be prohibitively expensive , and figuring out a method of paying for the project isn't so easy."" This argument is focused on economy and takes a rather practical approach. It  However it doesn't take into consideration who's paying and what their motivation might be, and that is an unknown factor. In case the majority of human beings simultaneously decided to donate decent amounts of money voluntarily, it might help a lot, but that will only happen if there is another great motivation. Therefore this argument is mostly an acknowledgement of the fact that there has to be another major motivation for going to Mars than money and that we might be more motivated to spend our money on other things at this point.
4. The fourth argument is answering the claim ""We should not colonize Mars"" with the ground ""we have problems on earth that"

Explain your project in 1 minute
As this year the main goal of the IONIS iGEM team was to popularize Synthetic Biology, we have challenged other iGEM teams and asked them to create a one minute video introducing their project in the simplest way.       As well, during the French meeting in July, we came with our camera and recorded the other French teams.       Those videos were challenging for all teams, indeed, introducing its own project in only one minute is short.

Sharer:
What is synthetic biology? What is biobrick? How to assemble biobricks and make them a device or a system?
-From the point of Lego, sharer tells basic understanding of synthetic biology. Then, with the help of our Basic Poly Cards, sharer can easily explain what are biobricks and how to make biobricks to become a device or a system.
Game time: Snowball
-In the process of introduction of the basic cards repeatedly, participants could remember biobricks easier and thus develop a deeper understanding of synthetic biology.
-Take N cards (N=group members).
Each one takes one card as your new name. Introduce your name and function to others in the group.
The first member, I'm promoter, I'm here to start the circle to function.
The second member, I'm terminator next to the promoter.
The third member, I'm xx next to the terminator next to the promoter.
Our Story
-Introduction of iGEM and share iGEM story and daily laboratory story.
These years, synthetic biology tried to make a better world.
-With the help of Project Poly Cards, share classic iGEM projects in the past few years. In the process of share, participants can develop a deeper understanding about how synthetic biology develop into an application and how they bring positive changes to different areas of the world.
2015, ZJU-CHINA has brought you with TERMITE TERMINATOR.
-Introduce our project in a simple way, making every audience understand what problem do we what to solve, how could we solve the problem and how to apply them into the world is our mission and goal as always.
Show your crazy idea!
-In this link, we tried to provoke member's fantasy and ideas about future changes synthetic biology might be brought to the world. Through group's discussion and cooperation, they brainstorm, discuss, choose final idea, perfect the idea and decide the presentation plan.
From nature, for nature.
-In this link, we shared recent safety issues and our thought about syn-bio safety (as poster shows below), from nature, for nature. And then, inspired participants to think deeply and exchange ideas with each other.

June 27: Learning so much
Today, I decided to get down to the basics and learned pretty much the whole CS110 course in a day. It wasn’t too bad because I’ve picked up a lot of things already from my trial-and-error method of coding (but that has been taking me a very long time so I’ve decided to come down to it and go back and review the basics so that I wouldn’t miss anything important). So I picked up some more stuff, like margin vs padding. and some random details. It was definitely helpful. And I’m hoping that my last bit of implementation can come soon. like now. but it’s not there yet. ohwell.
June 28: Textfile -> JavaScript
This morning, I’ve been trying to make javascript read into an external html file (because that was what I decided our backend is going to combine with our front end), but I had the hardest time.
(I’ve gone through using ActiveXObject, but I didn’t want to lower my/ client’s security. And I’ve gone through fso/ fopen/ fclose, but it was to no avail. Then, I read websites that said that it’s impossible (which at my current state, it’s actually quite discouraging, b/c what I wanted to do must be something that can be done. I know it can. ugh).
I thought that I could finish it by our progress meeting with orit, but of course, time came by as quickly and as it goes, and there I am, with only a website backbone. Well. At least the website look nice, so I can show off that, but still, I didn’t get what I wanted to done.
So after fiddling our this problem already for a couple of days, I decided to just go/ take a break, let my mind think of something.
But miraculously, after lunch, I somehow stumbled upon a website with the code that I haven’t seen. So, my strategy for now has always been trial-and-error, which is somewhat time costly, cuase though I can understand the code, I"

Cell-Free Expression
Why Do We Use Cell-Free Expression?
Cell-free expression offers a possibility to overcome several challenges of conventional protein expression and has many advantages, in particular for our project. 1)
Cell-based protein expression is a well-established method to obtain large amounts of a target protein. It enables high yield expression and purification of the protein in quantities sufficient for various in vitro applications 2) . Nevertheless, it is a tedious task to generate all the genetically modified organisms if many different proteins need to be expressed. Additionally, purification cannot be performed with a generalized protocol, and usually requires separate optimization for each protein 1) .
In contrast, cell-free expression saves a lot of time and money. It avoids the generation of genetically modified organisms for every protein. At the purification step, cell-free expression avoids the need for cell lysis and therefore circumvents this harsh procedure, thus preserving the integrity of the protein 3) .  In cell-based expression, too strong induction often results in aggregation of protein, rendering it non-functional. This risk is minimized by using cell-free expression, since the expressed protein is diluted in a far larger volume than the intracellular space and inclusion bodies do not form 4) .
For translating DNA templates into protein microarrays in a microfluidic setup, cell-free expression is the method of choice. This system is capable of expressing many different sequences at once. Additionally, the microfluidic setup provides the opportunity to constantly supplement the expression. Replacing depleted components, like dNTPs, amino acids or energy sources like creatine phosphate, allows higher protein yields 5) .

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua#OutReach-Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," Tsinghua Team (right photo).
It’s difficult to start a project with bright ideas, yet it’s even more difficult to start an iGEM team from nowhere. Unlike students in our university which has a team each year, students enthusiastic about synthetic biology and iGEM from Beijing Institute of Technology are participating in the competition for the first time this year. It was an honor to collaborate with them and share the experiences in iGEM.
We talked about the background knowledge about iGEM as well as synthetic biology. Being in the School of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University which had participated in iGEM for over four years, we shared our experiences of participating in the competition as well as our thinking about iGEM.
The team leader last year and the advisor this year, Zhao Yu, answered the questions raised by BIT students.
At the end of the meeting, the two teams promised to establish a long term collaboration.
Communication with BIT-CHINA Team
Figure 3. Discuss our project with students and instructors from BIT-CHINA Team.
In April 2013, another team established later in BIT visited our school. Team members and teachers in charge from both universities had a meeting about iGEM. We shared our experimental designs and discussed a lot about them. Suggestions from the students and the professors inspired both teams greatly, especially knowing that this second team from BIT was designing a project which had some connections with what Tsinghua team had done last year. Their high compliments also made us more confident about our project.
Collaboration of with other teams
BIT team is not the only iGEM team we’ve collaborated. As a tradition, we are always glad to collaborate with other teams from Tsinghua University. Coming from different departments of the university including Department of Chemistry Chemical Engineering, Department of Automation, and School of Life Sciences, all Tsinghua iGEMers learned a lot from other teams and shared many precious experiences in their own special fields.
Publicizing iGEM and synthetic biology
Our team has also held many lectures , introducing iGEM as well as  synthetic biology for the students in Tsinghua from different departments in Tinsghua. Via the introduction, we encouraged the students attending our lectures to join our 2013 team for iGEM 2013. Over 50 applicants handed in their application materials with expression of strong interests in synthetic biology. One of them even planned to choose synthetic biology as his perspective Ph.D research field.

Team introduction
This is our first time to attend iGEM competition~ We're SJTUers and we love it!
Team Logo
Team story
It is for the first time that Shanghai Jiaotong University(SJTU) participated in the iGEM competition held by MIT. At first, only a few students heard about such a competition. However, the news was spread so quickly among students that a team representing our university was formed in no time.
Many members took part in our team to work together at the first period.
In the early period, we have nothing but the passion of the team members, no instructions, laboratory or experimental funding. It was a tough time for us. We browsed the website of iGEM in order to learn more about the competition while writing letters to professors and executives for support. One day, in our excitement, we found a letter from the Academician He from the BioX-Center. He showed great interest in the competition and asked for more detailed information of it. He was so busy at that time that we had a talk with him in his car, since he rushed to an important meeting after that. We described the international competition to him in great detail. So interested was he that he agreed to extend support to us and contact the principal and secretary of our school to gain funding support from school. Thus, the SJTU Bio-X iGEM team was successfully established.
Bio-X Center provided us a lab to work in.
After the team establishment, we have absorbed students from all kinds of department throughout the school, bioscience, math, electrical engineering and so on. We began to brainstorm our project while learning more knowledge about the biosynthesizing field. We came up with a lot of interesting ideas, such"
SYSU-Software,2015,Team:SYSU-Software#Scientific_-_-_TEXT.html,". The bi-directional dialogue between us and wet-lab teams reminded us of what kind of software is really needed.
“Communication should never be limited to meetups; for synthetic biology community there should be an open platform for collaboration and co-development. “
That is where the idea of “open platform for synbio community” comes from. For iGEM, it should be a platform to promote communication and more importantly, collaborations between the teams. And it also helps in the reuse and redesign of the previous works, and in preventing “re-inventing the wheels”.
2. Transparency and Reproducibility in iGEM
Motivation
Transparency and Reproducibility are at the heart of scientific practices. iGEM is a competition standing at the front of synthetic biology, so transparency and reproducibility of the work done by iGEM teams are particularly important. However, information of all these wonderful works done by previous iGEM teams are scattered around in the wikis.
Practices
A survey on information completeness in previous iGEM wikis
Liang Tang, Xiao Feng
Before picking a project, in early May we did a survey of how information of projects was stored and represented in the Wiki of previous teams. We aimed at finding out how well their designs were documented in the Wiki.
Numbers of biological parts used by previous teams in genetic design with or without BBa number documented in their wiki.
These included:
1. Whether they used the standard parts in Registry when they were constructing their circuits?
2. If so, whether they documented the information of all the parts they used (the bottom line is, whether they well-documented the parts they used in their constructs.)
We can see that in the wiki of previous teams, there is not enough information for others to reconstruct their circuits. Only about 3/4 of the promoters that previous teams used were well-documented in the wiki. As for protein coding sequences that previous teams were using in their projects, only about 70% of the CDSs were well-documented in their wiki.
It is obvious that in the wiki, information about designs and constructs done by previous iGEM teams is by no means enough. Without enough information about the parts they used as well as the experimental protocols they obeyed, reproducibility in iGEM is hardly ensured.
