Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Latex_-_-_TEXT.html," MVA pathway into E. coli would further enhance IPP and DMAPP output, we opted for optimizing the MEP/DOXP pathway to minimize the step count from converting a substrate into IPP.[16, 17] Additionally, since G3P and pyruvate are products of glycolysis, providing a glucose supplement to E. coli would allow for G3P and pyruvate use by the MEP/DOXP pathway without increasing cell stress.[18]
Figure 2: Plasmid map of DXS synthase vector.  DXS synthase gene is linked to a T7 Elowitz IPTG inducible constitutive promoter that will allow for high expression of DXS.
To optimize the MEP/DOXP pathway, we overexpressed reaction rate limiting enzymes in the pathway, namely DXP synthase (DXS).  Although we could have overexpressed all of the enzymes in the MEP/DOXP pathway, from prior research DXS was determined to be the rate limiting step in the metabolic pathway.[13] To control for DXS expression, we codon optimized and reintroduced the DXS enzyme into E. coli under an IPTG inducible constitutive promoter (DXS plasmid), allowing for regulated production of DXS (Figure 2).  A supplement of IPTG would then activate high level expression of DXS, which in turn would override the pathway bottleneck at the beginning of the MEP/DOXP pathway.  In accelerating the process limiting chemical conversion of G3P and pyruvate to 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP or DOXP), we can subsequently receive a greater output of IPP and DMAPP downstream.
In order to design our optimized DXS synthase, we obtained the sequence for the DXS gene from EcoGene (EG13612).  To allow for future protein purification and characterization, we also attached a FLAG, tetracysteine, and hexahistidine tag to the DXS gene.  A double terminator, (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012) was also used to prevent RNA polymerase leak through.[19] Because the construct was too large to synthesize as one part, we fragmented the gene into two parts and used Gibson Assembly to insert them into linearized pSB1A3.  This resulted in a plasmid with the full DXS Synthase gene and ampicillin resistance, which was then transformed into T7 express cells.

3. Wash your hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory.
4. Follow the institutional policies regarding safe handling of sharps (i.e., needles, scalpels, pipettes, and broken glassware). Be careful with needles and syringes. Use only when alternative methods are not feasible. Syringes, needles, Pasteur pipettes, etc, should be placed in rigid, leak-proof containers (Sharps Safe) and discarded following the waste rules.
5. Take care to minimize the creation of aerosols and/or splashes.
6.Decontaminate all work surfaces before and after your experiments, and immediately after any spill or splash of potentially infectious material with an appropriate disinfectant. Clean laboratory equipment routinely, even if it is not contaminated.
7. Decontaminate all potentially infectious materials before disposal.
8. Report any incidents that may result in exposure to infectious materials to appropriate personnel (e.g., laboratory supervisor, safety officer).
9. Know where the nearest eyewash, safety shower, and fire extinguisher are located. Know how to use them.
10. Insist upon good housekeeping in your laboratory.
11. Check for insects and rodents. Keep all areas clean.
12. Secure all gas cylinders.
13. Use a biological safety cabinet for handling infectious materials or materials requiring protection from contamination and a fume hood for toxic materials; mixed hazards need to be evaluated case by case.
Use fume hoods
14. Fume hoods should be used for laboratory activities that could result in chemical explosions or fires, for experiments involving toxic, hazardous or carcinogenic compounds, and use of strong acids and bases. 9Biological safety cabinets should not be used for this kind of work. Fume hoods are workstations, not storage cabinets. Vented storage areas may be located under the fume hood work area. However, these are not for storage of flammables.
15. Respect chemicals and radionuclides. Know their hazards and follow appropriate safety precautions. Chemical and radioactive waste must not be poured down the drain.
16. All equipment must be documented to be free of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination before repair work is done or before moving equipment for storage or elsewhere.
17. Never mouth pipette anything. Use mechanical pipetting devices only!

”Did you know that bacteria are found everywhere. Relatively few are bad for your health  and can cause diseases – most are thought to be harmless and some even necessary for  your body’s function. Bacteria are considered microorganisms and can’t be seen with the  human eye. The human body consists of approximately 10 times as many bacterial cells as  human cells – many of these are found lining the gastrointestinal tract. The surface of the  human body, like the intestines, mouth and skin, is thus covered inside and out with millions  of microorganisms, known as our normal body flora, which in fact helps to protect us from  infectious microorganisms.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project#T7 promoter variants#t7prom_-_-_TEXT.html,"er T7 Promoter Variants
The randomer variants were made by ordering random mutants at the following positions with respect to the consensus logo for the T7 promoter:
-7-12
+1+3, -1-3
-10
These were produced both for the T7 and the T7-lac promoter.
Characterization of Designed Variants
For each family, we tested the randomers and the designed variants separately. To characterize the promoter strengths, we used RFP as the reporter gene and used a platereader to test for fluorescence during and after induction with IPTG.
The six designed T7 promoter variants are named as a function of their predicted promoter efficiency, relative to the wildtype. For example, T7 14 has a predicted efficiency of 14% compared to the consensus T7 promoter, whereas T7 111 is predicted to be 111% more efficient than the wildtype. In the chart above, each of the designed promoter variants for both the T7 with and without the lac operator are arranged in increasing predicted efficiency. Contrary to our expectation, some variants that were designed to have a lesser efficiency than the wildtype (e.g. T7 54) seem to have a much higher strength (as measured by fluorescence at saturation, normalized by the optical density). The data for this graph was produced in triplicate, so the error bar represents the standard error across those three measurements.
Characterization of Randomer Variants
We used the same platereader protocol to test the efficiency and induction ratios of the randomers using RFP fluorescence. Twelve colonies per variant were tested. The results indicate that the T7 -10 randomers, both the non-lac and lac varieties, have the highest fluorescence saturation levels (normalized by OD). The other randomer types seem to have negligible strength.
On the whole, the T7-lac promoters with random mutations at position -10 have higher fluorescence expressions than their T7 non-lac counterparts.

Conclusion
La vectorisation rencontre un certain nombre de problèmes comme la stabilité, la toxicité, le ciblage, la résistance ou furtivité au système immunitaire, le passage de la membrane, et l’industrialisation.
Le Double Vector System ( DVS ) offre une clé à ces problématiques majeures.
Le DVS est composé d’un premier vecteur tissulaire, de type bactérien, capable d’atteindre un tissu et d’un second vecteur , de type phagique, capable d’atteindre une cellule cible. Une fois sa cible atteinte, il libère un plasmide thérapeutique qui a une action contre la maladie.
Le premier vecteur : Mycobacterium avium, se dirige vers le tissu d’intérêt pour lequel il a une grande affinité.  Il résiste au système immunitaire grâce à sa paroi cellulaire et a une faible toxicité pour son hôte. Une fois dans le tissu cible, il crée le second vecteur , le vecteur cellulaire.
Le vecteur cellulaire cible le type cellulaire d’intérêt, ce qui augmente la spécifité du DVS . Le vecteur cellulaire s’internalise dans les cellules cibles grâce à des protéines virales exposées à sa capside. Ces protéines lui apporte la capacité de passer la membrane des cellules eucaryotes. Le vecteur cellulaire est capable d’encapsider le plasmide thérapeutique et de le délivrer suite à son internalisation.

After being induced by green light, PcpcG2 promoter activates the expression of a special tRNA (supD), which is used to identify amber mutation. In the wild-type E.coli, amber mutation will inhibit the translation of T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, when AHL and green light exist together, T7 RNA polymerase will be expressed, and then T7 promoter will be activated to express the downstream gene.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," it stable enough in cell resolution to be able to reliably control protein levels to switch between genes? This issue needs to be taken seriously and it requires further analysis. Unfortunately, the single cell experiments require equipment that we did not have access to.
The lambda phage integrates its DNA to the E. coli genome upon infection. The lambda repressor works robustly in the E. coli genome, but is it able to function properly in the plasmid? We know from experience that individual parts of the lambda repressor have been used successfully in synthetic plasmids in E. coli (this can be verified by searching these parts in the BioBrick foundation's registry of standard biological parts). For example DNA looping is complex enough mechanism to be affected by the plasmid context. Supercoiled plasmids may not have enough flexibility in order to enable such DNA looping. Even if it was possible, it might require very precise placement of OR sites with respect to each other.
Our experiments were based on the assumption that GFP-LVA would have similar dynamics as the CI-LVA would. However, this should be evaluated in future experiments. CI-LVA half-life needs to be determined by using common protein concentration measurement methods. To monitor the effect of CI in the lambda repressor context we could fuse CI with GFP-LVA and associate PRM or PR promoter with a complementary reporter, such as lacZ. This would enable us to observe the effect of CI concentration. Another possibility is to use similar setting as Dodd et al. (2001) and produce CI from a separate plasmid using lac promoter induced by IPTG. This enables us to monitor the effect of high CI concentration and evaluate, whether DNA looping takes place or not.
As discussed multiple times in the results section, we need to identify how much proliferation accounts for the rise in fluorescence in our measurements. We should include OD600 measurements to our future experiments and have proper controls to evaluate, to what extent the fluorescence differences are caused by blue light intensity and what is effect of cell proliferation on these measurements. Moreover, carrying out the experiments with 5 minute measurement interval in a room with 37 Celsius degrees would allow us to examine better the dynamics without affecting the growing conditions.
The experiments done for the blue light response element are very similar to those required for testing the entire three channel gene switch system. We would use LED rig to control the blue light intensity and would measure the effect of three different reporter systems. If feasible, these reporters could be three different fluorescent proteins whose excitation spectrum overlaps as little as possible. Alternatively, a LacZ reporter system could be used. The response"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

A better approach would be to assume that the shape of the concentration is more or less correct and then integrate the concentration over the entire surface and multiply it with the thickness of the layer. This would give an idea what the entire colony of E. coli had produced in a 10 hour period (PT), which could in turn be divided by the time and the amount of cells to find a production rate of lysostaphin per second, per hour. This was done in equation 17-24.
Integration by parts gives us:
Results
The parameters from the experiment were fed into equation 18. Also was MATLAB used to visualize the behaviour of the concentration along the radius, for all four samples. This is visualized in figure x. It can be seen how for r < a the concentration follows a r2 behaviour, while for a < r < R the concentration follows an ln(1/r) profile.
Figure 3: The concentration of all four samples, based on the parameters listed in table 1.
For all the samples the number of cells, total lysostaphin production and lysostaphin production per single cell were also obtained and can be found in table 3.

The mean production rate of lysostaphin for a single E. coli in our experiment was found to be 2.30E-15 mg cell-1 s-1. Determination though the first method, where steady state and purely diffusion was required would estimate the production rate to be 1.76E-15 mg cell-1 s-1, which is slightly lower that the first measurement.
Discussion
Determination of the number of cells for a given colony has been proven to be difficult. Measuring the optical density of a suspension might give a good indication for the initial cell concentration, but after applying the E. coli on the agar LB plate the E."

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.

It integrates into the amyE locus of Bacillus subtilis and carries a chloramphenicol resistance as well as an ampicillin resistance for E. coli. In between the two recombination sites, there is the constitutively expressed Cm resistance and the multiple cloning site which contains RFP to simplify the insertion of your BioBrick.
The plasmid is then transformed into B. subtilis and checked via the resistance for ""integration at all"" and via a starch test for ""integration into the right locus"". Correct integration results in loss of halo due to disruption of the amylase gene.
We tested this vector with various inserts, for example the final construct of our Sporobeads with GFP. The starch test demonstrated that the plasmid inserted correctly in the amyE locus and fluorescence microscopy revealed the functionality of the construct.
pSBBs4S
pSBBs4S is also an empty vector with only the multiple cloning site and the spectinomycin resistance gene in between the homologous regions. This vector integrates into the thrC locus of B. subtilis.
We tested the integration of this plasmid with the threonine test and a construct from the Suicideswitch as an insert.
pSBBs2E
pSBBs2E is our third empty vector, aiming to provide a set of three empty vectors with three different integration loci and three different compatible resistance casseettes for full flexibility in their combination.
This vector is still a work in progress, but currently only the multiple cloning site is missing. Of course, it is not tested yet.
pSBBs1C-lacZ
pSBBs1C-lacZ is a reporter vector, which contains the multiple cloning site upstream of a functional reporter device, consisting of ribosome binding site, β-galactosidase gene lacZ and terminator. Also, a chloramphenicol resistance is in between the two flanking homolgy regions. Upon chloramphenicol selection, this vector integrates into the amyE locus, which can be verified by the starch test.
This vector was used for several promoter evaluations .
pSBBs3C-luxABCDE
pSBBs3C-luxABCDE is our second reporter vector. It contains the multiple cloning site upstream of a functional reporter device, consisting of the lux-operon and a downstream terminator. Upon chloramphenicol selection, this vector integrates, this vector integrates into the sacA locus of B. subtilis by double homologous recombination.

Overview
We define social entrepreneurship as the manifestation of world-changing innovation. The iGEM competition encourages fabrication from theory to physical conception. Continuing this trend, we plan to introduce our device as a marketable tool for industry use. We have coined the name “Leu-Lock” as the name of our mutant synthetase. We aim to produce Leu-Lock on a marketable scale and provide scientists with affordable, robust biological containment.
Product Development
Early Stage
We have two possible avenues to pursue for continuing our preliminary research. UVa’s nanoSTAR institute promotes
collaborative research efforts through partnerships with academic and national research institutions. Virginia iGEM
teams from 2013 and 2015 have been uptaken by this institute for continuing project development. One option is
application to the nanoSTAR institute.
The second possibility is a partnership with Charlottesville Open Bio Labs. Shaun Moshasha is the founder
and a Virginia iGEM alumnus. Open Bio Labs is a public lab that provides workspaces for independent projects, specifically
in synthetic biology. As it is within the confines of UVa’s campus and provides partial project funding, our first choice is to
work within the nanoSTAR institute. However, Open Bio Labs provides a feasible second option.
Scaling Up
In our early production stages, we will acquire a small number of local clients to incorporate our device into their biosafety practices. We will use this period of condensed production to asses our device in vivo. We will optimize production cost, efficiency rates of cellular transformation, and assess customer feedback to optimize distribution methods. We will continue to acquire clients, which in turn will yield greater quantities of industrial application data for assessment. We will network with potential clients through the expert consultants we enlisted during the summer, UVa alumni with ties to the biotechnology industry, advertisements through social media, and scientific newsletters.
Intellectual Property
The University of Virginia offers student legal services at very low cost; most of the base cost is covered by tuition fees. We will consult with intellectual property lawyers to write a provisional patent. We will finalize and submit our patent while concurrently conducting our preliminary lab research. In this way, our patent and preliminary research will finalize at nearly the same time, expediting"

PCR more Kan-ZFB-His3-Ura3
Two 50 µL reactions
Doubled the protocol used on the 16th and used HisUraKan_F and ZFBwpHisUra_R primers
PCR produced very low concentration of Kan-ZFG-His3-Ura3 because melting temperature of primer was too high, so primers stuck to annealing DNA and did not dissociate
In image below the low concentration of desired product can be seen, along with the high concentration of unused primers
PCR of kan-ZFB-wp-his3-ura3
Ran gel of initial overlap PCR product (undiluted, starting without primers) from June 16th, using whole sample
Performed gel extraction in order to have more Kan-ZFB-His3-Ura3 product for the transformation tomorrow: 8.5ng/µL, 260/280=2.03
Determined success of the selection construct transformation
Checked the plates all day,and finally came to the conclusion that the transformation did not work
Discovered that lambda red has a promoter induced by arabinose, not temperature (though the strain is still temperature sensitive). That is why it didn't work--we'll get arabinose and hopefully have a successful recombination.

The graphs were plotted for the control        constructs, pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 (-) and pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 ( BBa_J23101 ) in the absence of arabinose. FSC versus GFP graphs for pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 ( BBa_I0500 ) in 0, 0.2 and 1.0% arabinose concentration were plotted.         Each set of graphs were obtained for three different cell strains, DH10B, DH5α and BW25113.
The distribution can also give us some idea of PBAD promoter leakage in different cells strain. If the data points are on or near the boundary between Q3 and Q4,  we know that the promoter is leaky. The results indicate that the promoter is relatively more leaky in DH10B compared to other cell strains.
The percentages of cells in each Q3 and Q4 are highlighted in Figure 2. After addition of arabinose, we clearly see more percentage in Q4. Around 80% of the cells for DH10B  and BW25113 are in Q4. Relatively lower percentage of cells in Q4 is observed for DH5α. Only around 60 to 70% of cells were in Q4 after arabinose induction. The shift in the  distribution from Q3 to Q4 also corresponded to the increase of RPU across different arabinose concentration. At 0% arabinose concentration, for all three strain, higher percentage  of cells are in Q3 and therefore the RPU is low. After arabinose induction, more cells are in Q4 and RPU is high. The percentage of cells in Q4 levels off for arabinose concentration  that we have tested. The trend was observed for RPU measurement.
We can also conclude that even after maximum period of"
ShanghaiTech,2018,Team:ShanghaiTech#Project NFBL_-_-_TEXT.html," AHL, the pLux promoter will not be activated, which means the system keeps off without input signal. When the concentration of AHLs changes, the Lux module start to work, activate the part B. Due to the nice input-output linearization of Lux, the input signal waveform will be well introduced to our system, without being changed.
Experimental design
Experiments were carriedout to determine which quorum sensing system should be chosen. We designed different plasmids whom have different Quorum resporter devices and add Aequoria victoria green fluorescent protein at the downstream of Quorum transcriptional promoters to detect the performance of different quorum sensing concentrations.
Fig.3 ""pCon(J23100) + RBS(BBa_B0034) + QuorumR + TER(BBa_B0015) + pQuorum + RBS(BBa_B0034) + GFP + TER(BBa_B0015)""
DH5-α cells whom contains plasmid of constructed resporter devices were cultured to Abs600 0.60 and then transferred to 96-well microplates where they were induced with appropriate AHL concentrations. By measuring the fluorescence output from each of the constructed devices by inducing cell cultures with various concentrations of AHL molecules. The induced cell cultures were grown in the microplates at 37°C and the fluorescence signal were monitored over time by using a microplate reader.
We needed to characterize the response of the construct to different concentrations of AHL so that we could use the data in our model to predict how the system could function. The activation ranges were compared between the quorum sensing systems in order to determine their robustness, sensitivity, stability and if it is suitable to be used in our Negative Feedback Loop.
Results
Through experiments, concentration ranges of AHLs required for activation in each quorum sensing system were calculated to be 100nM-10uM for Rhl and 100pM-10nM for Lux, Tra, Rpa. Rhl were found to differ by a 1,000-fold sensitive difference than other quorum sensing systems, which meas Lux, Tra, Rpa has higher sensitivity.
Fig.4  LuxR-AHL Fluorescence 485-535 absorbance related to time.
Fig.5  RpaR-AHL Fluorescence 485-535 absorbance related to time.
Compared between different quorum sensing systems, the Lux quorum sensing systems has lower background leak, higher orthogonality and robustness and better expression stability. Therefore, we choose Lux quorum sensing systems as the input signal controller for module A.

Grad Advisor Meeting on further developed Keratinase Project
We presented the primers we designed to our advisers, who suggested we double check them for self dimerization and 3’ overlaps with:
http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/applications/oligoanalyzer/
http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3/
We discovered that our forward primer forms a self-dimer and must be redesigned.
We also need lysozyme to digest the peptidoglycan of B. subtilis in order to miniprep it.
We decided to use the iGEM plasmid pSB1K3.m1 for our E. coli transformations.
To screen for keratinase activity, instead of using the feather assay, which takes up to a month for visible results to appear, we decided to use the azokeratin assay as the secondary screening method.

Meeting with Purdue iGEM team
Get Excited for the UChicago X Purdue collaboration! Our first meeting with the Purdue team went well:
The Purdue team will send us a form to provide feedback on their igem biobrick characterization and protocol forms on Monday.
The biobrick forms are in PDF format.
Their biobrick characterization contains info like biobrick sequence, plasmid and microorganism in which it’s inserted, ect.
The protocol form is a checklist of the protocols carried out to characterize the biobrick. It doesn’t contain much info.
Nora asked them to add a section stating the purpose for using a specific protocol, as in, what specifically about the biobrick are they trying to characterize.

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 M). To determinate whether the presence of other microorganisms in the natural water environments could have an influence on the survival of our strains, we chose to also examine samples of  filtered freshwater or seawater.  .
Strains
We next needed to choose the E. coli strain that will be used to contaminate the chosen environments. We first thought about using a strain of Escherichia coli carrying a plasmid expressing a fluorescent protein. This strain would have allowed us to evaluate easily the number of living E. coli bacteria in our samples. However, using such strain had also several drawbacks.
First of all, we must be able to differentiate our fluorescent E. coli from other auto-fluorescent microorganisms or molecules in our samples. Even if we compare our samples to negative controls, our experiment might not be very precise.
As no selective pressure would be applied to keep the plasmid, some bacteria may lose it during the experiment.
To address these problems, we chose to use three E. coli strains, each with a different antibiotic resistance gene integrated in its genome. These three strains are mutants from the Escherichia coli strain MG1655:
PhB1320 = MG1655 clpP::Cm – resistant to Chloramphenicol (Cm)
PhB1693 = MG1655 Z1(lacR tetR SpR) (Spectino)
PhB1696 = MG1655 zad220::Tn10 – resistant to Tetracyclin (Tetra)
We used three different strains as inserting a resistance gene in the genome of a strain may impact the fitness of this strain in the environment. Repeating the experiment with three different strains will allow us to compare the behavior of the three strains in a given environment and identify a possible influence of the gene inserted on the strain survival.
Medium
To count our E. coli strains, we chose to use the Mac-Conkey medium. This medium is very selective for Gram negative enteric bacilli, so Escherichia coli. It contains bile salt and crystal violet dye to inhibit Gram positive strains, and neutral red dye which turns pink all colonies able to fermentate the carbon source (for the first test it was lactose, and after sorbitol).
Thus, by adding the appropriate antibiotic to this medium, we thought we would be able to only select our strains, although we needed to check this hypothesis.
Preliminary Study
Our experiment relies on the hypothesis that we will be able to detect selectively our E. coli strain when plating a sample taken from our tested environments on Mac"
DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," approach beneficial, adding to the necessity of the spectrophotometer.
The App
The SV Detector app is developed to work with the spectrophotometer and is capable of analysing pictures of the samples. The app captures the spectrophotometer’s output that is then analysed in order to give the operator feedback on the type of snake that the victim has been envenomed by, if envenomed.
A more detailed description of the app can be read in the software section .
Incubation Chamber
The incubation chamber is created for the incubation of the serum and/or plasma with the biotin beads. The eluate from the incubation chamber is transferred to the cuvette of the spectrophotometer. The chamber is designed to work with standard medical equipment through luer locks. The incubation chamber has two inner rings for two filters in order to keep the biotin beads in place.
The chamber has two male luer locks so that it can be attached to a syringe on both sides. The workflow would be:
1. Attaching a syringe with the centrifuged blood to the larger end of the chamber.
2. Attaching another syringe on the lower end.
This would create a vacuum and thus one would be able to pull the sample into the incubation chamber by pulling the plunger on the second syringe. We decided to design the chamber with a vacuum based system as it is safer since there is no risk of the chamber coming apart and exposing the operator to the fluids inside. Once the liquid is in the second syringe it can be easily put into a standard cuvette for testing.
Figure 4: A 3D-model of the incubation chamber. The centre chamber is for incubation and the grooves are for the filters.
Figure 5: The 3D-printed incubation chamber.
Handheld Centrifuge
Our handheld 3D printed centrifuge is based on the paperfuge created by Manu Prakash
Our centrifuge is created to fit 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes and secures the tubes to the print. After centrifugation with our 3D printed centrifuge, the resulting plasma is added to the incubation chamber.
Our hope is that the miniature manpowered centrifuge allows for use in tough and inaccessible environments. The centrifuge can handle Eppendorf tubes, thus making it intuitive to operate. The disc’s design eliminates sharp edges and secures the tubes thus ensuring the operator’s safety.

A core concept of iGEM is the collaboration within an interdisciplinary student team. Accordingly, students of different age, gender and field of study came together to found our team in Aachen, in order to realize our project with joint forces and enthusiasm for the overall goal. Working closely together, we therefore not only have the chance to learn from each other, but also to excel ourselves. Using our collective creativity and common responsibility, we will create something special in order to make our contribution to synthetic biology.

To isolate bacteriophage lambda, we did top agar H202 plaque assays with TT9901 and TT9907 grown from frozen stock.  Tomorrow we will flood the plates with LB and separate the bacteriophage. KK,KP,CH
9/20/13
The electroporation transformation of pIG96 (iGEM backbone with YdiV/GFP insert) into mutant E.Coli lacking SdiA (the membrane receptor that detects cholera's AHL) yielded many colonies, four of which we streaked onto a plate for to sequence verify the plasmid.
We found the frozen strain of E.Coli K12, which we streaked today.  Tomorrow we'll electroporate pIG96 into it.
The Children's Book has been distributed to all team members.  All team members are to find three or four families with little children to whom they can administer the pre and post test.
We purified bacteriophage lambda from top agar plaque assay plates by flooding them with LB, the plates sit for 1 hour, then sucking the liquid up and using a chloroform lysis procedure to kill all remaining cells, and separation by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 8000 rpm.  Spot tests will confirm tomorrow whether or not we actually isolated the bacteriophage.
Clarice re-transformed pIG91+SdiA ligation into DH5alpha.  Four the fourth time haha.  From yesterday's transformation we saw two white colonies, which we think indicates a successful ligation of the insert into the vector, but as a safeguard, Clarice redid the transformation today. KK,KP,CH
9/23/13
Over the weekend we transformed plasmid pIG96 into E.Coli K12 via electroporation, and plated single colonies.  Also, we electroporated plasmid pIG87 (with CRO insert) into TT25281.  We want the latter strain to infect it with bacteriophage lambda, and then see if overexpression of CRO (which is behind the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter) will direct bacteriophage lambda into its lytic cycle.  On the subject of bacteriophage lambda, we observed that our bacteriophage purification procedure failed again. Spot tests looking for plaques from lambda did not yield any plaques.

Choosing proteins
Integrated Human Practice
On this page you can read about how we reached out to experts within the field of space medicine in order to learn more about the main health problems during space exploration.
Our findings has greatly impacted the purpose of our project, as it has:
Helped us understand which problems we can solve and how
Helped us conclude on a list of proteins that would be ideal for space related health issues
Helped us to evaluate the limits of our protein production system with regard to target proteins
In parallel with developing our project we have been speaking with several experts within the field of health and space medicine. Given that protein therapeutics for astronauts isn't a very established field yet we have been very dependent on the input we have gotten from experts. The experience from the experts has been very important for choosing proteins for production with our system both from a medical and pharmaceutical point of view. The experts have been the very core of developing our project and making our product useful outside the laboratory which clearly show that we have integrated their thoughts and opinion into the purpose of our project.
Based on our research and discussion with experts we propose to use our system for production of IGF-1, PTH, GH, G-CSF and camelid antibody during long lasting space missions. First of all this decision is based on our interviews and discussions with experts. Based on their opinions we have further considered how easy the different proteins would be to produce with our system taking into consideration posttranslational modifications (PTM), protein size and the literature.  We have therefore analyzed potential target proteins from several perspectives, especially considering 1) is this protein interesting from a medical point of view? 2) Is this proteins feasible to produce with our system? (for more information see the analysis below). It has been very important for the development of our project that we have been able to speak with experts in space medicine and protein production such as Virginia Wot"

This section shows how deep the tunnel lies below the Newcastle University campus as it runs along Claremont Road - where there is an existing entrance. Having a food source this close to the University could provide students with fresh food all year round. It could also be a pioneering project that the famous Agricultural School could manage. [5]
The plan shows the design of a facility which we envision being present underneath the urban hubs identified in the Victoria Tunnel Map ( see Map ). By being present only at desired points along the tunnel it would reduce the cost of starting up such a scheme. This facility would allow for the safe access / maintenance / farming of the tunnels and was designed in compliance with the guide to growing in contained environments - to ensure responsible innovation standards, see our safety page .
This axonometric diagram demonstrates how the tunnel may operate. You can see farm workers tending to the hydroponic stacks. The stacks themselves may be moved around on a track system to reduce the energy intensiveness of the harvesting process. (much like the tracks the old coal wagons used to move along).
This visualisation gives some context to how an artificial growing environment may look in the Victoria Tunnel.

Introduction
In 2011 the iGEM Uppsala team managed to create an amilCP biobrick ( BBa_K592009 ), a great addition to the iGEM repository of chromoproteins. When the part, which originates from a coral named Acropora millepora, gets expressed it produces a strong natural blue color that is very much visible to the naked eye [1].
In 2017, the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) iGEM Team decided to improve the part hoping for stronger expression resulting from codon optimization. By performing codon optimization they hypothesized that the seemingly unstable amilCP from 2011 would become more stable resulting in less white cultures on the plate, hence higher protein yield. The output part after optimization can be found in the registry as BBa_K2253002 [2].
Figure 2 shows one single successful transformed colony of the UT Austin codon-optimized amilCP. In addition we can never know for sure if Austin Texas 2017 iGEM Team's optimization actually is better than the original part since a direct comparison in a picture is missing on both the wiki and the part registry.
Figure 1. The image above shows various streak colonies from the original blue chromoprotein, BBa_K592009 . Both phenotypically blue and clear colonies grew, supporting the hypothesis that the chromoprotein gene is unstable during cell growth, i.e. there is strong selection for cells carrying the resistance plasmid with a mutation that prevents expression of the chromoprotein due to its fitness cost.

Results
We produced software which implemented the algorithms described in our novel approach on specially cleaned input files and ran them through a typical version control system. We performed experimentation on transformations between iterations 3-6 of our wetware team's yeast plasmids. As a control, we compared darwin's output running through the git version control system to simple processing with git (vanilla_git). We expected darwin to run faster and show fewer changed lines in the diff output than vanilla_git.
Speed of file processing in darwin vs. vanilla_git
Line changes in darwin vs. vanilla_git
As expected, darwin's preprocessing produced a significantly faster diff, with an average speed of 5.763 seconds per file, as opposed to 10.640 seconds for the vanilla_git. However, against our assumptions, that performance did not seem to rely upon the reduction of changed lines reported by git, since darwin actually produced more changed lines. More research is required to find the correlation between the number of changed lines reported by git and the number of lines actually changed in the file.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," by university. At UC Davis, we went through IRBnet. I made an account, and completed HRB 211 through an interactive page, and had administrative approval signed by my supervising professor and the department chair (HRB 226). I compiled the exact survey content (including verbal script and written texts), as well as a 503 Protocol were put together to present all of my materials. The complete package also had to be signed by my faculty sponsor and me.
My process required that I was CITI trained for Social & Behavioral Research. It also required that everyone else who would directly interact with participants receive this training, which the entire iGEM team completed. My certificate looked like this:
And the certifications were these:
This was what was required by UC Davis though, and this specific program is not mandated by the federal statue, though some education is.
Many schools use IRBnet to manage interactions between researchers and the IRB. Our IRBnet account currently looks like this:
Not all schools have the same system. To help UC Santa Cruz navigate their schools’, we provided this instruction:
“Santa Cruz has different IRB policies, please talk to your office-- on the website there is an exemption form that you can fill out. You should ask if there is other paperwork that you need to do-- at Davis we have several other forms.
https://irb.ucsc.edu/
https://irb.ucsc.edu/customer/portal/articles/1801393-how-to-complete-citi-training-for-human-subjects-research?b_id=2829 (VERY IMPORTANT) everyone who conducts surveys must take this. The entire UC Davis team completed this training—it takes about 90 minutes and requires an 80% correctness score to pass.
Choosing a PI-- this can be a student at UC Santa Cruz who has a faculty sponsor.”
Generally, the best way to find out how your institution’s IRB works is to go to the office of research website. From there they will often have resources to help you navigate the administrative world of the IRB in order to conduct your social science research under proper supervision.
How Else Can My Team Prepare a More Usable Survey?
As we have hinted at before, there are some procedures that can bias a survey.
One major cause of survey bias is volunteer bias. This is, to some degree, unavoidable. People who don’t want to take your survey absolutely have the right to not to. So the people you interview may have some underlying goals which make them more likely to spend, for instance, fifteen minutes talking to you about genetic engineering. This can be a polarizing effect—"

Dr. Gosset readily agreed, sending us samples of his VH33tyrR strain lacking an AroGfbr containing plasmid pRW300, which he could not distribute due to patent regulations. He sent us a secondary sample of W3110 E. coli containing his pMmelAtyrCpheACM plasmid, which included genes for the tyrC protein and mutMelA tyrosinase necessary for melanin production. We extracted the plasmid from the secondary cell sample with a Miniprep kit, but ran into vast difficulties transfecting his VH33tyrR cells with his plasmid and our engineered AroGfbr and AroFfbr plasmids. After numerous attempts at chemical transformations and electroporation ( see our lab notebook ), we settled on transfecting T7 Express E. coli from New England Bioworks with our AroGfbr and AroFfbr plasmids, along with our plasmid containing MutMelA ( BBa_K2027012 , see below).
Binding Agent
Overview
Coating a balloon with a protective agent requires strict homogeneity to be useful. Kirill Safin, the team lead of Stanford Space Initiative’s Ballooning project, provided insight into the adverse effects of uneven coatings on balloons. Irregular coatings can shorten balloon lifespans compared to uncoated balloons by creating inconsistencies in a membranes tensile properties and allowing the material to stretch more in one location than another. In balloons with flexible membranes, changes in ambient pressure and temperature lead to fluctuations in volume that stretch the balloons’ membranes. This can cause an inelastic coating to become uneven, exposing weak spots susceptible to tearing. Instead of designing a melanin coating for our biomembranes, we looked into alternate routes to incorporate melanin directly into our materials.
Melanin Binding Peptides
Melanoma cells share the characteristic of increased melanin production. Accordingly, many treatments have highlighted melanin as an ideal target molecule for radionuclide therapy. By utilizing melanin binding peptides linked to radioactive subunits, melanoma cells can be localized and delivered doses of radiation to eradicate harmful malignant cells. Researchers pursuing this approach to melanoma treatment have made use of phage display libraries to identify multiple small peptides capable of binding melanin. We sought to create a binding domain that would retain large quantities of melanin by engineering a repetitive gene construct containing many"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook )."

iGEM Heidelberg Mission 2010: miBricks
The great potential of gene therapy is currently limited by two major challenges:  tissue specific gene delivery and regulation of gene expression, either dependent on cell-specific properties or intentionally independent of the cellular context. We followed two synergistic tracks to address these problems.
One, we have developed a novel method for miRNA based gene expression tuning in mammalian cells, allowing the fine-tuning of gene expression based on synthetic miRNAs, as well as the cell specific on- and off-targeting based on endogenous miRNAs. We show that this method is functional in vivo and in vitro and prove the high potential of all three miRNA-based regulation approaches.
Two, we have developed a standardized and fast approach towards the creation of AAV-based gene delivery vectors. We have achieved exceptionally selective tissue-specific targeting in vitro and in vivo with hepatocyte specific delivery vectors.
We are happy to provide the synthetic biology community with two high impact innovations which will fuel the improvement of tissue specific gene therapy approaches and other medical applications of synthetic biology.

The iGEM idea
iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines Competition) is an international competition in synthetic biology, hosted by the MIT in Boston. The aim of this competition is to answer a basic question once posted by the director of iGEM, Randy Rettberg, as follows: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology just too complicated to be engineered in this"

After running the gel, the concentrations of CpI 1, CpI 2 and CpI 3 were much lower compared to the chromoprotein genes (see gel picture). Amplification of CpI 3 failed. The problem was an alteration to the primers necessary for amplification. Re-ran PCR for CpI 3. Modification: Appropriate primers (P13 & P22) and the extension phase of PCR has been reduced from 2 min to 15 sec since N7 is only ~300bp long. The DNA was then purified using the QIAGEN QiaQuick Gel Purification Kit. The DNA was eluted in 50 ul of EB buffer. Due to the large elution volume and the lower yield of the backbone DNA, the concentrations (measured using Nanodrop) were lower than the suggested 10ng/ul threshold for Gibson.

I．Cre recombinase
Cre recombinase is a 38-kDa monomeric protein encoded by bacteriophage P1. Cre binds cooperatively to loxP sites ( which remains to be elucidated later ), with one Cre monomer contacting each of two 13-bp recombinase binding elements arranged as inverted repeats around a central strand-exchange region (Fig. 1) . Cre promotes the synapsis of loxP-containing DNA substrates and catalyzes recombination between the sites, as shown in Fig. 2.
II. LoxP site
Lox P (locus of X-over P1) is the recognition site of Cre recombinase on the Bacteriophage P1 consisting of 34 bp. There exists an asymmetric 8 bp sequence in between with two sets of palindromic, 13 bp sequences flanking it. The detailed structure is given below.
The asymmetric 8bp sequence between the two palindromes is the only factor that contributes to the orientation of LoxP site. The system works in 3 ways in the presence of Cre recombinase.  Two LoxP sites with the same orientation leads to the deletion of the sequences between these two sites, while an opposite orientation leads to an inversion of the sequences between them. Two separate DNA sequences with one LoxP site respectively will integrate in the aid of Cre recombinase. The detailed mechanism will be demonstrated below.
A Schematic drawing of the Cre–loxP site-specific recombination pathway, based on the strand-swapping model (Nunes-Düby et al., 1995) and on Cre–loxP structural models (Guo et al., 1997;). Conserved tyrosine residues from two of the four recombinases in a synaptic tetramer cleave the DNA backbones of the recombining segments to form transient 3'-phosphotyrosine linkages. The released 5'-hydroxyl ends of the cleaved DNA undergo intermolecular nucleophilic attack of the partner phosphotyrosine linkages to complete the exchange of one pair of strands and form a Holliday intermediate. A second round of cleavages and strand exchanges using the remaining two recombinase subunits and the complementary DNA strands gives recombinant products.

It was assumed that an insulin unit reduces 30 mg/dL which was indicated as a safe assumption by our medical section
Once we were sure the model had a behaviour similar to what we expected when developing the corresponding equations, the comparison between both kinds of equations was required to ensure that there was a relation in the key points that established how our model interacted with itself, as it is a continuous model that varies according to the conditions at the preceding moment. We also had to ensure that our modeling results were not a mere result of an appropriate selection of initial values, as the main function of insulin decrease the glucose values, we evaluated different scenarios with a glucose level over the
Figure 6: Theoretical simulation of Glucose-insulin dynamics with an optimum glucose value Xm of 154 mg/dL. Glucose and insulin are integrated in a single table in order to demonstrate how the regulation system works, it is noticeable that both share similar turning points and reach an equilibrium at similar times. In order to test our glucose sensor, we measured our reporter gene’s expression by measuring its absorbency. Our reporter gene (OmpR controlled mRFP) behaves in different conditions of glucose concentration. According to experimental results, under a glucose concentration of 154 mg/dL we have the highest peak of expression of our reporter gene. By taking into consideration these results, the simulation considers the highest peak of expression of our reporter to be also the highest peak of expression of insulin gene. The simulation shows that under a glucose concentration of 154 mg/dL, insulin reaches its highest peak and then starts to decrease while glucose levels also decrease.
recommended levels, showing the effect of glucose. In order to consider levels under this line, it would be needed to integrate the feeding pulses to reestablish the correct balance on the system.
In the whole, our simulation could be considered as a system that evaluates many important factors on the insulin/glucose regulation, with certain predictive capacity and a well balanced equilibrium that could be reached at a relatively short amount of time.
Conclusion
The whole integration of this model explains the dynamics that regard insulin and glucose in the organism, which could be generalized to a system that regulates the insulin production synthetically like the system that we developed.

The initial concentrations of several species, such as dCas9 and guide RNA, which are fairly difficult to ""guess"" and nowhere to be found in literatures, can be better estimated by running simplified models only regarding the equilibrium of the relevant molecules. Here, we present an example run by SimBiology App on MATLAB. The diagram of the model is shown below.

Running the model with relevant parameters set on SimBiology can provide us with diagrams showing the result of simulation. The result of the simulation provides us with initial concentrations of the relevant molecules which are probably more believable.

3.1 Effect of AHL concentration
According to our expectations, the Test System is inducible upon the addition of external AHL. With proper concentrations of AHL, the cells would undergo a series of changes regardin gene expression. The most obvious change is the increase of GFP concentration in the cell, for us. The “safety catch” component also ensures that the system has minimal leakage, meaning that minor fluctuations in the system when no AHL is added, or very trace amount of AHL should not activate the system. To test whether the Test System does possess these features, we will run a series of simulations of our model.
The parameter values used in the model are stated in previous parts. As for the intial states, the concentrations of CRISPRi related molecules are set according to the SimBiology simulation results. Concentrations of most molecules that are not supposed to be synthesized without AHL are set to 0. External AHL concentrations are tuned to"

Conclusions
Our goal is to use modelling to inform design decisions in a model-based design approach.  The following points are relevant to the application of these invertible promoter switches:
Our single-switch model indicates that a Bxb1-style switch has a threshold of RDF expression above which no flipping can occur, regardless of Int expression, while a PhiC31-style switch can be flipped at any RDF expression level as long as Int expression is high enough.
o The PhiC31-style switch is thus more flexible in different situations that may require performance at different ranges of Int and RDF expression levels.
o The Bxb1-style switch has the advantage that switching can generally be controlled by varying one parameter, RDF expression, past a specific threshold.
Our two-switch model shows that switch-like behavior of a switch present in multiple copies is improved if it is controlled by a second switch; the two-switch system corresponds to a narrower range of parameter values that permit partial switching.

Retransmitting a Modified DNA Message
DESIGN
In intercellular communication systems, it may be useful for receiver cells to be able to retransmit a message, especially if they are able to modify the message.
We sought to combine control over transmission and modification of a DNA message to allow receiver cells to modify an original DNA message (Mori) to produce a modified DNA message (Mmod) and then retransmit it.
In the scheme we developed (Figure 1), three populations of E. coli are co-cultured (Figure 1):
The sender population transmits the original DNA message, Mori.
Mori includes an invertible promoter switch. When flipped, it leads to production of M13 gene VIII and T7 RNA"

Enzymatic degradation
The aim of this part of the Decyclifier system is to degrade the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, into less toxic compounds using the degrading enzymes laccase and dioxygenase. We also want to include an on and off switch to the degradation pathway so that we do not stress the cells when the enzymes are not needed. The switch is connected to a fluorescent reporter gene which will indicate when PAHs are present and hence when the construct is active.
Introduction
Biosensor
Overexpressing enzymes is very expensive for cells when it comes to energy, as well as resources. Therefore, regulated expression is often preferred. A previous iGEM team, Peking 2013, inspired us to use the NahR construct ( BBa_J61051 ), a system consisting of two promoters and a protein coding sequence. One of the promoters, the Pr promoter regulates the upstream sequence of the construct, which also contains the coding sequence for the NahR protein. This protein functions as a repressor at the other promoter in this construct, the Psal promoter. Contrary to the Pr promoter, the Psal promoter regulates transcription of genes downstream of the construct. However, this repression can be lifted. When salicylate binds to the NahR protein, the conformational change it undergoes makes transcription of the sequence upstream the Psal promoter possible. ( iGEM Peking. 2013. Aromatic scouts. )
Reporter system
One of the main parts of our whole system is the visual response of PAH degradation. When these compounds are being degraded by the expressed laccase and dioxygenase we want to have an indication that our system is working; one that could easily be detected. Candidates for reporter genes were both genes expressing fluorescent proteins and chromoproteins. The choice fell on fluorescent reporter genes, since measurement and quantification of the expression would be easier and less time-consuming.
Fluorometer
We faced the need to characterize a promoter system inhibited by the NahR protein, which is  induced by salicylate. We decided to test the expression of the NahR"

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

Surviving colonies demonstrated development of purple phenotype, sometimes requiring several days (figure 16), while going through an interesting metamorphosis of color changes. Based on the evaluated controls, it is very likely that a purple phenotype was due to the presence of the original RFP-containing template plasmid used for creating the linear donor DNA sequence. The RFP cassette was kept on the plasmid to observe this deviant purple color to identify growing false positives. These colonies survived in the presence of kanamycin and chloramphenicol, because this template plasmid is propagated and harbors intact and functional chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance expression cassettes.
Figure 16. Effect of incubation time on chromogenic in vivo assays. These LB+Cam+Kan+X-gal+IPTG plates demonstrate growth of BL21DE3+pACYCdxCas9Tn5gRNA strains that are electroporated with donor DNA. (A) 1 day after electroporation with linear ME flanked kanamycin resistance cassette, blue colony formation was observed, whereas (B) a week later red phenotype has developed strongly. (C) 1 day after transformation with ME flanked kanamycin resistance cassette in a plasmid, blue colony formation was observed, whereas (D) a week later purple phenotype has developed strongly.
Evaluation of colonies by several genomic PCRs have demonstrated that integration did not take place near the desired target site. The negative control used for these genomic PCRs was purified isolated gDNA of the BL21DE3 parent strain. Even transformation of donor DNA into a competent strain harboring only Tn5 did not result in colonies, suggesting a problem related to the transposase effector function of the fusion construct.
The experimental results demonstrate that the used kanamycin cassette is functional, judging from the control results. The RFP remains unchanged and functional too, allowing for identification of false positives. Furthermore, we have shown that strain BL21DE3 contains a functional lacZ copy, based on chromogenic conversion of X-gal.
Although we have shown that MEs are present and intact on the donor DNA sequence, we were not able to show that the MEs were recognized and that the donor DNA was integrated.  We would have expected either targeted or non-targeted integration, but neither occured."

iGEM Goes Green
“It’s not easy being green”

The Collaboration
As part of a Human Practices collaboration project the iGEM team of TU Dresden invited us to participate in iGEM Goes Green. The main idea of the collaboration is to calculate and consider the emission of CO2 related to iGEM.
We are grateful for the opportunity to be a part in a collaboration which focuses on the green aspects of GMO, as it corresponds with a main focus of our project.
Our Carbon Footprint
Much like the coastline paradox presented by Mandelbrot, our total carbon footprint is hard to measure since we cannot take the following into account: Every single kilometer we have driven, the exact size of our trees and so forth.
The estimated carbon footprint of a flight from Copenhagen, Denmark, to Boston, Massachusetts, USA and back again is 3.430 kg/person Flight emission calculator . With a team of 14 individuals, this culminates in a total of 48.020 kg or roughly 48 tonnes of carbon dioxide for our team - just from flying intercontinental. Added to this is the carbon footprint of the Danish trains at 30 g/km/person DSB environmental report .  With the same 14 individuals and 175 km to Copenhagen from Odense this yields a total of 147 kg. We have been on a total of three trips, one to Langeland, Denmark, two to Copenhagen, Denmark, and one to Delft, Holland. We have travelled to these destinations in two Volkswagen Transporter vans. The carbon footprint of these is 188 kg/km/car Volkswagen automobile details .   With a total of 2320 km travelled our trips yield a total of 844.5 kg of CO2.
Thus our total carbon footprint of travelling is roughly 49 tonnes of CO2.
Regarding our wiki, we have received help from our sponsors CO2 Neutral Website in calculating the carbon footprint. They estimated roughly 10,000 views during the next year, but sponsored carbon elimination equivalent to 120,000 views. All in all the sponsorship from CO2 Neutral Website has made our wiki net CO2 negative.
We received a spreadsheet from TU-Dresden to estimate our carbon footprint from our lab Go Green Guide . The carbon footprint calculated from our lab is estimated at a total of 1 tonne of CO2.
Thus our total carbon footprint is roughly 50 tonnes CO2

Amplification of luxR by PCR using oiG0005 and oiG0006 resulted in the fragment fiG0005 (0.8 kb). The backbone of the vector piG0040 (lasR in pSEVA 181) was amplified by PCR using oiG0007 and oiG0008. This fragment, fiG0011 (3.2 kb), and fiG0005 were assembled using Gibbson assembly. Thus we formally replaced lasR by luxR to construct the luxR regulator plasmid piG0041. Competent cells were transformed with piG0041 and selected on ampicillin-LB-plates. Colony PCR using the primers oiG0035 and oiG0036 was conducted to check the size of the inserted fragment (expected bands at 1.1 and 1.2 kb). The sequence was verified by Microsynth using the same primers.

The backbone of the vector piG0040 (lasR in pSEVA 181) was amplified by PCR using oiG0011 and oiG0012. This fragment, fiG0012 (3.2 kb), and fiG0006 were assembled using Gibbson assembly. Thus we formally replaced lasR by rhlR to construct the rhlR regulator plasmid piG0042. Competent cells were transformed with piG0042 and selected on ampicillin-LB-plates. Colony PCR using the primers oiG0035 and oiG0036 was conducted to check the size of the inserted fragment (expected bands at 1.1 and 1.2 kb). The sequence was verified by Microsynth using the same primers.

Glasgow,2011,Team:Glasgow#Control of Dispersal#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of images shown here provide unconsistent results: - any RFP under control of OmpC is supposed to be transcriptionally silent or very weakly expressed.  The RFP fluorescence could be due to an RFP on the backbone of the GlrN vector, but we’re unable to check that on the registry. - the OmpF-RFP containing culture contained also a wrong EDIN1+2 ligation thus the red fluorescence was expressed in a constitutive manner. We are anyway unable to show that the fluorescence was due to a correctly assembled construct.
Positive results for Bluf-sYFP
Figure 5
Figure 5: Digest of Bluf-sYFP with EcoRI-PstI(uncut sample followed by double digest). 1Kb ladder on the right handside.
The Bluf-sYFP grown in light (5th picture from the top in Table 3) shows higher YFP expression levels than the same culture grown in darkness (6th from the top). The gel electrophoriesis on the left handside shows the right band pattern for Bluf-sYFP after digestion with EcoRI-PstI, proving that this behaviour was due to the presence of a correct construct.   Unlike Bluf-sYFP the results for OmpF-sYFP grown in light and dark are inverted, and both samples contain a non-functional red light receptor. The increase in fluorescence can be simply due to an higher density of cells in the  sample grown in dark or by an advanced stage of growth (the culture wasn't on a shaker for several hours and lumps of cells are visible).
The OmpC samples glow of a faint red regardless of the absence on any RFP in the construct. again, we can speculate about the presence of such an RFP on the backbone of the GlrN vector.
Discussion
The experiment worked as expected only for the Bluf-sYFP construct, and unfortunately we didn’t manage to produce a Bluf-RFP construct to confirm our results.
The OmpF and OmpC promoters didn’t behave as expected for a number of reasons:
- the cells didn’t contain all the machinery required to detect light. GlrN also required the presence of the phycocyanobilin chromophore to work so we’re not surprised that OmpC wasn’t responsive to light.
- the phycocyanobilin pathway present in cells containing OmpF-reporter construct lacked the cph8 receptor.
- All the ligations of OmpC /reporter construct didn’t produce a positive result. The"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept1Fr_-_-_TEXT.html," comme Mycobacterium avium ont développé des stratégies de résistance hautement spécifiques pour déjouer le système immunitaire .
Ainsi M.avium, microorganisme intracellulaire facultatif, possède la capacité d’infecter certaines cellules du système immunitaire que sont les macrophages ou les cellules dendritiques, responsables de la phagocytose.
L’infection engendrant la mort de ces phagocytes, on observe chez l’hôte une diminution de son immunité non spécifique, ce qui permet à M.avium de persister chez son hôte.
Afin de lutter contre les macrophages, M.avium inhibe la maturation des phagolysosomes, initialement responsable de la lyse des bactéries. Le paradigme de ce mécanisme n’est pas encore déterminé, mais l’hypothèse principale implique l’un des glycolipides de la paroi, le lipoarabinomannan.
Pour lutter contre les cellules dendritiques, M.avium dérègle les signaux de transduction cellulaire en libérant certaines enzymes régulant le taux de messagers secondaires.
En effet, M.avium possède, dans son génome, 12 gènes contenant des domaines d’adenylate cyclases de classes III, dont la plus importante est Rv0386. Celle-ci facilite la formation d’AMPc dans les macrophages. L’AMPc est un messager secondaire qui mène à la synthèse de cytokines pro-inflammatoires TNF-a
Or, on sait qu’à forte concentration, le TNF-a bloque la maturation des cellules dendritiques et donc le déclenchement de la réponse immunitaire.
M.avium ne « craignant rien » face au système immunitaire son élimination est faible. Elle a alors la capacité de persister dans l’organisme et donc plus de chance d’atteindre sa cible et de s’y implanter.

Very interesting presentation. Really impressed about the openness of @TUDelft_iGEM in presenting a model for testing #genedoping . Definitely a turning point to something new on this topic... @wada_ama
— Nicola Busca (@Bogpolis) August 31, 2018
Figure 4. Twitter comments on our seminar and expert discussion in Stirling, showing the impact and some new questions that arose.
Case 1: Intergenerational Responsibility
Many vectors could be used for transfecting people with gene doping. Some of them might be able to (accidentally) infect peoples’ germ line cells, thereby affecting their offspring. And there is the concept of designer babies where parents can decide on their children’s characteristics? In some countries this is more under debate than in others.
Questions:
With whom resides the responsibility if this child becomes an athlete and how could we solve this problem?
During illegal doping, vectors might also be released into the environment, affecting other organisms. How big would this problem be and how could we map and control it?
How can we learn from other examples of intergenerational responsibility?
How can we control gene doping throughout society in a world where bioethical views differ over cultures?
Case 2: Where do we take it?
Suppose, at some point gene doping detection works about as well as the detection of the doping methods that are more conventional now. Gene therapy however, has come to be extremely safe. The border between medical and performance enhancing treatments is fading away and it has become extremely cheap and accessible to everyone.
Questions:
Do we still want to combat gene doping in this case?
The objective of sports as was set out by Ancient Greek tradition was the creation of the perfect human. With a case like this, are we bypassing this objective or enabling it?
Would human characteristics converge or rather diverge, making sports either totally uniform or extremely scattered over niches?
Before this time, how would athlete behavior be in comparison with more conventional doping?
How do and would athletes deal with undesired side effects?
What do these findings imply for possible current measures?
Outcomes and Implications
During the discussion we identified a list of points that differ for gene doping compared to other kinds of doping. This list is given in figure 5. The overall conclusion is that more attention should be paid to educating athletes on the risks above just regulating. Many athletes are not educated well about gene"

Results
From the chart, we can see that cells were hardly induced in the control group, and with the concentration of inducer growing, the intensity of GFP increased by groups. The most efficient concentration of inducer was around 10-5M, and higher concentration may lead to the  expression of GFP decreasing. Additionally, to most groups, the intensity of GFP reached its maxium after 4 hours.

Safe Project Design
Our project was designed intrinsically without using pathogenic chassis (for humans, animals or plants), but using antibiotics. To avoid the apparition of antibiotic resistance, several precautions must be applied during their whole uses. We notice we use at least two antibiotics together permitting to limit the resistance apparition risk.
Safe Lab Work
Our lab is classified L2 as risk class, low risk. That means there are some organisms which are pathogenic for human but the propagation is unlikely and a therapy or a phophylaxis exists to treat the pathogen-disease. However, we don’t use these organisms for iGEM manipulation. Nonetheless, we apply the Good Laboratory Practices as if we were working with this kind of organisms to avoid their propagation in the nature because it’s GMO.
The use of the antibiotics implies to manipulate them wearing a mask to filter the breathed air when they are in powder and to treat the waste containing it as chemical wastes after sterilization.
Every team member follows a special biosafety formation before starting to work in the lab.

  As what we have shown above, the development of mobile platform is only decades, and on which the development of scientific software is also at the very beginning, but no doubt the rapidly developing of them has already fulfill us with wonder. All sorts of software are at people’s fingertips, and an exponential growth has already been in sight. We believe that in the near future, the research of synthesis biology will usher in an era of mobile.

J23101.E0240 has the same insert as I20260, but has pSB1C3 as a backbone. J23115.E0240 only differs from J23101.E0240 in the use of another promoter, namely J23115 .

Genetic devices tested
Composition of I20260, J23101.E0240 (left) and J23115.E040 (right)
Over a time span of 18 hours the optical density and fluorescence of cultures containing these BioBricks were measured every 2 hours using the spectrophotometer and plate reader, respectively.
Expected Results
Fluorescence was expected to develop in cultures containing I20260, J23101.E0240 and J23115.E0240, as all include the GFP coding sequence. However, the signal was expected to be stronger in J23101.E0240 than in I20260 since pS1C3 is a high copy plasmid while pSB3K3 is a low to mid copy plasmid. Because of this, a higher fluorescence was expected of J23101.E0240 compared to I20260 even though they share the same insert. J23115.E0240, too, was supposed to produce a fluorescent signal, but J23115 (the mutated version K823012 was used) is a lot weaker promoter than J23101. Therefore, a lot lower - if any - fluorescence is expected with this BioBrick.

Diagram illustrating the different plasmid and promoter properties
Plasmid pSB1C3 has a higher copy number than pSB3K3, and J23101 is a stronger promoter than J23115.
B0015 was used as our negative control as the insert only contains a terminator and no expression cassette for GFPmut3b, and so no fluorescence was expected.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter3_-_-_TEXT.html," crucial for a successful team work. Something funny, interview of a member, a advisor or an alumni, or a selfintroduction of a member (just something casual and fun to write for you): Last week, our team visited Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, sharing some perspectives of our project and discussing the direction of further application. After providing them with our preliminary plan, we ask professors there about our weakness and difficulties, concentrating on the potential applications of our project. In addition to the detection of the concentration of certain micromolecules or macro-molecules, we may also measure the expression level of different promoters by using our platforms.
OUR PROJECT
Biosensors are becoming more and more indispensable tools in life science, medicine, chemistry and biotechnology, which are greatly enhanced by synthetic biology. Yet in the bio-sensing procedure, the limitations of signal output methods restrict the usage and practicality of biosensors. Wildly used reporters such as chromophore and fluorescent protein which requires laboratorial equipments to measure often result in the loss of accuracy and immediacy.
Thus our project is focus on the bio-signal transformation to diversify output methods of biosensor. In account of the high maturity of silicon analysis, it will be a great advantage to transduce biological sense into electric signal.
Following this idea, we design a transducer which can convert the change of gene expression level that stimulated by inducer directly into the electric signal via inductive synthesis (or destroy) of nanowire between the electrodes. Curli fiber, a well characterized amyloid fiber which forms -sheet-rich amyloid fibers, seems to be an ideal foundation of our nanowire structure. CsgA, the modified morphon protein of curli fiber with the ability to bind nano gold particles, will play the role as the conductor.
Once we synthesize conductive curli fiber, there are two approach to carry out the target sensing, by inductively synthesizing the conductive fiber between the electrodes to turn on a switch for connecting a open circuit, or inductively expressing the gene coding the curli-degrading enzyme to destruct the presynthesized nanowire. The change of the electric current shall represent the concentration of inducer.
