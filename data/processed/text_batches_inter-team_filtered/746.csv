Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html,"agents in reactions. This provides a very valid use case for the automation of modular variants in our project. When creating the programs both for the system to operate from and to simulate the system, an agent-based approach to modelling was used. An agent-based system is one in which each entity in the system is considered its own unique “agent”, where each agent of the same type holds the same properties but each with their own values. An agent-based system assesses the effects on the system as a whole by observing each individual agent and monitoring their own actions and their interactions with other agents (Macal and North, 2010). In a synthetic biology context, agent based models have been used to model the discrete elements of different systems and are able to capture even some of the most minor differences between agents inside the system. (Gorochowski, 2016).
Simulator Software
The goal of this section of the project is to create a piece of scalable real-time software capable of simulating the full functionality of our EWOD microfluidic device. It should additionally be able to schedule its own microfluidic operation sets to simulate. This program will then allow for a controller on the hardware device to enact the given schedule, whereby a set of operations can be carried out on the chip. These operations can be customised according to the individual capabilities of the version of hardware being used. This therefore has extended capabilities configurable to the breadth of operations of the device being simulated, including more complex operations in the field of digital microfluidics such as mixing and extensibility for zones capable of manipulating temperature. The software provides a separate but fundamentally similar interface alongside that which the chip will be running, creating a simulator able to mimic the effects of running a process on the chip. This serves as an inexpensive and rapid means of testing a real EWOD system. In order to serve a real purpose, the simulation software must not simply function correctly but also provide a simple, fast means of displaying, logging and outputting the information it processes. As such the software must not only be correct, verified, and validated, but also intuitive both to extend and use the full range of the base functionality. This introduces a key component of human-computer interaction to the task whereby the software must be able to cater to the precise needs of the user. It must also be possible to tailor it accordingly.
Agent-Based Modelling
The use of an agent-based system for this task is advantageous in a number of key areas. Agent-based systems excel in giving a very clear idea of how the properties of an individual are affecting the greater system, especially when individuals are heterogeneous"

Additionally, an increase in the theoretical understanding behind electroporation’s principles has expanded its applications tremendously, including for cancer therapies through electrochemotherapy and electrically-induced tumor apoptosis, transdermal drug delivery, vaccine delivery, etc [19-22]. This versatility in terms of functionality and applicability for the electroporator indicates its importance in biotechnology and medical fields, and with the inhibitory factors mentioned above limiting its incorporation into labs, schools, and even in field biology, the need for a low-cost portable electroporator has risen greatly.
In contrast with the existing bulky and complex electroporators available commercially, the ElectroPen stems from a basic design incorporating readily available components, including a conventional household stove lighter. It is actuated using a toggle which pushes down the hammer action controlling the force generation on the piezoelectric crystal. The user exerted force allows for the hammer action to proceed through several phases (described below), allowing for discharge of the high-voltage pulse. The casing additionally allows for the attachment of copper wires to those already existing on the crystal, and heat-sensitive insulation is coated on the copper wire to prevent the user from experiencing any electrical shock. The ElectroPen thereby requires no access to electricity, can be fabricated in approximately 15 minutes, is portable, and costs only 23 cents to build (Cost per unit per 10,000 units excluding production costs).
Although standard electroporation cuvettes provided by companies have been shown to function optimally in electroporation, these cuvettes were found to not operate with the same conditions with the ElectroPen. Additionally, these standard cuvettes are relatively expensive and difficult to produce without industrial equipment. Recognizing the perceived limitations of this cuvette, we developed a custom cuvette that can be built using a wide range of materials (glass slides, wood, etc.). The design of these cuvettes models its industrial equivalents, wherein two metal plates functioning as electrodes create an arc gap in a case. In our fabricated cuvettes, two large pieces of a specific material are covered with aluminum foil and sealed to a base, with a gap created in between each piece to serve as the arc gap for electroporation. The simplicity of the overall ElectroPen and cuvette model demonstrates the application of simple tools found everywhere across the world for a unique purpose at a fraction of the cost, hence acting as a major catalyst in the development of new similar tools which don’t have the same constraints as their commercial versions.
Since the conception of electroporation, numerous systems and machines have been developed to carry out successful and efficient elect"

Plotted probabilities represent the raw cleavage site “C-score”, the signal peptide “S-score” and the combined cleavage site “Y-score”. C) ClustalW multiple sequence alignment of the BM40, EGFR and Igκ signal peptide construct, depicting a gap for the EGFR signal peptide construct compared to the newly designed ones and thus indicating a shorter length of the 5'-UTR . For Igκ and BM40 signal peptide constructs, a T7 promoter spacer as well as a Kozak sequence increase the distance between TATA box and protein-coding region.
Elements for stability and detection
Apart from the functional parts that mediate the (strept)avidin-biotin interaction, other elements in the receptor were designed to make sure it is optimally translocated to the membrane, as stable as possible, and easily detectable.
EGFR transmembrane domain
For anchoring in the membrane, a type I membrane protein with defined localization of N- and C-terminus out- and inside of the cell was used. The N-terminal transmembrane α-helix of human EGFR (UniProt P00533, amino acids 622-653) was herefore chosen (see below the topology prediction of EGFR via the TMHMM 2.0 server for the prediction of transmembrane helices [8] ). A stop-transfer sequence consisting of charged amino acids - being characteristic for type I membrane proteins - was added at the C-terminus, and the sequence was furthermore flanked by a (GGGGC)2-linker at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. The addition of a stop-transfer sequence as in the naturally occurring EGFR sequence, as well as the addition of flexible linkers, makes our EGFR-TMD an improvement over the BioBrick BBa_K157002 , which does not possess either of these elements.

The 3 possible errors we could find were 1) 5.3 stock might be dying, 2) The overnights had their lids screwed on tight so that might have killed off some of the bacteria, and 3) It's possible that when we started overnights in different test tubes, the concentrations of bacteria could have been different. We will correct these 3 practices in our next experiments.

Now that we knew that we had our transformed colonies and that the                       ligation had been performed successfully, we were able to move forward and                       proceed with the induction, synthesis and purification of our proteins.
As we know, iLOV is a fluorescent protein and since a signal secretion                       peptide was attached to it, it would have been easy just to place samples of the                       supernatants inside a fluorescence reading equipment to evaluate whether the                       protein was being properly released to the media. However, we could not take                       ahold of a fluorescence reader because of the lack of resources. Still, we were                       able to isolate our protein due to the histidine tag that was placed at the C-                       terminus of the iLOV protein in each of our 4 constructs. First, we filtered the                       supernatant using a 10 kDa Amicon membrane to concentrate our protein and                       then using a His purification kit provided by Promega®, we were able to purify                       our desired protein. To verify this, we ran our sample through a                       polyacrylamide gel. In Figure 7, we can observe the results of this SDS-PAGE                       assay. We can note the bands fall where they were expected to be between the                       10 and 15 kDa of molecular weight. Since there was not a signal peptide                       attached to the negative control, iLOV was not secreted to the media, which is                       why we could not see it in the SDS-PAGE of the supernatant.
Figure 7. Polyacrylamide gel of the SDS-Page we performed to the concentrated                       and purified supernatant containing the fluorescent protein: iLOV, secreted by                       our transformed microorganisms.
Even though the histidine purification kit was very specific, we still had                       coelutions in our polyacrylamide gel and we could not be a hundred percent                       sure that the bands we saw only corresponded to the iLOV protein. At last, to                       finish with the characterization we executed a Western Blot assay using that                       very same SDS-Page gel. The antibody we used was specific for the 6-His tags                       we had incorporated into our recombinant proteins. This can be better                       visualized by taking a look at Figure 8.

Description
Mars has become the new goal in the international space race of this century. Unlike earlier space races, the goal is no longer to simply get there but has expanded into also staying there. This goal can further be seen as the pilot project for settlements in other parts of space and is a key step for humanity to become a multi-planetary species. Decades of research and technological advances are beginning to show that extraterrestrial colonization may soon be possible, and interest from private companies like SpaceX is fueling this new space race.
One of the major pressing questions, when it comes to colonizing of Mars, is the matter of obtaining building materials to build the initial colony. Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to this problem: Either bring the materials from Earth or use the resources already on Mars. This first option requires escaping the gravitational pull of Earth, which is not a cheap feat (1). The astronomical costs affiliated with the first option gives voice to solutions focusing on the use of local resources on Mars. Our project tries to explore the second option of using the raw materials available to bring the mission of colonizing Mars closer to reality. Our suggestion is to use mycotecture (fungal-based building material) to construct the structure, as the fungus can be grown on Mars. The fungus can be engineered here on Earth and transported as spores in the spacecraft, thereby mostly removing the cost of transportation. For economical purposes, we have planned for the final substrate on Mars to be cyanobacteria as they produce O2 from carbon dioxide and can function as a carbon source.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#microtubule_-_-_TEXT.html,"ly as GTP hydrolysis accelerates. Faster GTP hydrolysis shifts the equilibrium state towards depolymerization. Here the terminal average length was omitted because the data obtained is too noisy when the terminal number is too small.
Finally, to give a more direct intuition of the microtubule growth dynamics, we chose one microtubule filament and plotted its length during the simulation period in the graph below.
Figure 3 The length of one microtubule filament in a simulation.
$k_{ptp}=k_{pdp}=8.9{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{stp}=44s^{-1}$, $k_{sdp}=899s^{-1}$, $k_n=5{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $C_m=20{\mu}M$.
The curve in Figure 3 is similar to those obtained by Bayley et al. (1991) using Lateral Cap model and is consistent with existing experimental observations. The microtubule shifts from polymerization and depolymerization stochastically, which reflects the dynamical instability of microtubules.
This series of preliminary simulations gave us a basic understanding of the dynamics in microtubule polymerization. As explained above, each result is in accordance with the current knowledge of microtubule growth, and thus proves the validity of our model.
Key Simulation Using the Complete Model
Now that we are have a deeper understanding of our model, we can do more complex simulations with the complete model to address the key questions brought forward at the beginning, namely the effect of the initial concentration of tubulin dimers $C_m$ and the GTP hydrolysis rate constant $k_h$ (through which some microtubule-stabilizing agents take effect) on microtubule polymerization dynamics.
Here the assumptions we added in the simplified model no longer exist, and the differentiation between the tubulin dimers in the solution and those on the yeast surface is introduced. In a word, the model is made to reflect actual experimental conditions as closely as possible.
We first looked at how the initial concentration of tubulin dimers $C_m$ affect microtubule growth. The absolute value of $C_m$ is not important in this context, since different concentrations of yeasts will yield completely different outcomes with the same $C_m$.

In order to remove restriction site, we chose overlap extension PCR method and designed four primer set.
Lux gene fragment was amplified and four PCR products were connected.
First, we tried to construct arabinose inducible lux gene biobrick.
Evaluation
We first investigate the best culturing condition.
Transformed E coli. TOP10 was precultured into LB medium and incubated at 37℃. After incubating for 12 hour, precultured solution was inoculated into 100 mL LB medium. When OD660 of the culture became 0.6, arabinose(0.25% f.c.) was added to induce and expressed the lux proteins at different temperature(20 ℃ and 30 ℃). After induction, the 500 μL of culture was harvested at certain time and measured light intensity and OD by plate reader.
Fig. Investigation of culturing condition
Result and discussion
Here, we show the result. It is suggested that at lower temperature(20 ℃), lux operon from P. phosphoreum kishitanii can emit brighter light  than at 30 ℃.
However, since we first measured the intensity of the light at 3 hours after induction, there is still possibility that the E. coli cultured at 30 ℃ emitted brighter light within 3 hours.   To check the change of light intensity within 3 hours from induction, we operated another experiment. In this time, we measured the intensity every 30 minutes until 3 hours.
The figure below shows the result of second experiment. As we supposed, the intensity of the light emitted by E. coli cultured at 30 ℃ came to its peak within 3 hours. Yet, the peak intensity was much lower than that of 20 ℃. Then we concluded that 20 ℃ is better to express this lux operon.

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," link between production rates and dynamic range. Thanks to it, we now have a clearer way to achieve a higher dynamic range.
Explanation of large background noise
In the beginning, our wet experiment shows a relatively large output of our system in spite of low concentration of the exogenous ligand, which is not quite as expected. This phenomenon reduces the dynamic range of the system, resulting in a decrease in the sensitivity of the system to the concentration of exogenous ligands.     Through the formula we obtained from the modeling of differential equations (Equation 18 and 19 in Section 1.2.2 of our entire model report ), α and β are both positively correlated with the system output. This explains why the excessively high chain generation rate enhances the background noise. So we can simultaneously achieve greater dynamic range and smaller background noise by reducing the two production rates at the same time, as long as the factor (α-a0ζ)/β is always small.
Protease cleavage ability
Introduction
Due to random collision or exogenous ligand, a PC chain and a TC chain will be combined. There are two situations after that. In the first case, after a period of time T the protease cleaves the transcription factor, then the two chains are separated. In the second case, there are not enough time for the protease to cleave the transcription factor before the two chains are separated. Obviously T is a random variable, and the more likely the cleavage occurs, the smaller its mathematical expectation E(T) is.    Whether the cleavage is prone to occur is mainly determined by the catalytic efficiency of the protease, and is also affected by other factors such as the length of the intracellular segment of the PC chain and the TC chain. For the sake of convenience, we say that protease cleavage ability is stronger if the cutting is more likely to occur.    In order to research the relationship between dynamic range and protease cleavage ability via this stochastic process, we need to consider two typical cases: the concentration of exogenous ligand is nearly 0 or large enough so that the system output is saturated.     Let us focus on how a TC chain behaves in the two situations. At first, it moves freely on the membrane (State 1, the free sate). After a period of time it is combined with the PC chain (State 2, the bound state) due to random collision (in the first case) or an exogenous ligand (in the second case), and then it is either cleaved by protease (State 3, the inactive state)"

Dealing with Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) requires an awareness of safety issues. This especially applies to the field of synthetic biology with increasing ease of access to information, lab equipment, and gene technologies. First of all, the safety of public health and the environment must be addressed, but secondly the safety of the researchers must indisputably be considered, too. This applies mainly to the biological agents and products in the lab, but also to the chemical agents and anything else that can pose a potential risk to either group.
In Denmark, a national decree on work involving GMOs (”Bekendtgørelse om godkendelse af produktion med genetisk modificerede mikroorganismer”) addresses the issues of biosafety and provides guidelines for the design of the lab and the handling of the microorganisms. The Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB), and hence our team, follows this decree. With regards to class 1 labs, the Danish decree resembles the “Laboratory biosafety manual” from the World Health organization to a wide extent.

We also learned how to handle nonhazardous organisms not exceeding level 2 (safety requirements BHSL 1/2, no manipulation of NSB 3 and 4 pathogens). GMOs were confined into the lab, and strict waste disposal protocols as established by Institut Pasteur. For the immunology part, mosquitoes used for experiments were not sampled from the environment, but from the Insectarium facility of Institut Pasteur, rated-as pathogen free, and we only handle a part of the viral protein which is not pathogenic. We complied with the safety requirements in the laboratories (evidence) - Security: We restricted access to our lab by Id badges.  We further, in the application part of our project, used symbols to determine the targeted pathogen by the patches to guarantee anonymity by experimenters. Institut Pasteur abides to strict security protocols at the National level for arboviruses, and is a reference center for the World Health Organization (WHO).                - Sustainability: our patch is biodegradable, no expensive, ergonomic, which only needs a small amount material (mg), thus produces a minimum amount of waste. The trap is washable and reusable by following standard decontamination procedures established by the center for rapid intervention at Pasteur (CIBU) - Social justice: Our trap and patch are easy to use, and is aimed at not being expensive, by having no motorized parts, requiring batteries or electricity. We thought about two kinds of application scenarios: for developed and developing countries in terms of infrastructure and cost. We also thought about education of young people coming from areas with different income. Thus we explained our the Mos(kit)o device, and educated about mosquitoes to both Parisian children (Collège Germaine de Staël, Mosquito chase game, Paris 15 arrondissement), and suburbs (“Jouer à Débattre”:Debate game on synthetic biology in Bobigny, Seine-St-Denis) - Intellectual property rights: account of state of the art, no infrigement of IP laws

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," is given by: $$L(\theta) = \sum_i (y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2\\$$ The regularization term controls the complexity of the model, which helps us to avoid overfitting. Since gradient boosted trees are working with tree ensembles, the prediction scores of each individual tree are summed up for a final score. Hence, we define our model as follows: $$\hat{y}_i = \sum_{k=1}^K f_k(x_i), f_k \in \mathcal{F}\\$$ where \(K\) is the number of trees, \(f\) is a function in the functional space \(\mathcal{F}\), and \(\mathcal{F}\) is the set of all possible CARTs. The objective function to be optimized is given by: $$\text{obj} = \sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, \hat{y}_i^{(t)}) + \sum_{i=1}^t\Omega(f_i)\\$$ Now we can learn the functions \(f_i\) containing the structure of the tree and the leaf scores. We're using an additive structure which fixes what has already been learned and adds one tree at a time: $$\begin{split}\hat{y}_i^{(0)} &= 0\\ \hat{y}_i^{(1)} &= f_1(x_i) = \hat{y}_i^{(0)} + f_1(x_i)\\ \hat{y}_i^{(2)} &= f_1(x_i) + f_2(x_i)= \hat{y}_i^{(1)} + f_2(x_i)\\ &\dots\\ \hat{y}_i^{(t)} &= \sum_{k=1}^t f_k(x_i)= \hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(x_i)\end{split}\\$$ Now we simply add one tree which optimizes our objective. If we use the mean squared error as our loss function, the objective follows: $$\begin{split}\text{obj}^{(t)} & = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(x_i)))^2 + \sum_{i=1}^t\Omega(f_i) \\ & = \sum_{i=1}^n [2(\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} - y_i)f_t"

Bacterial infections:
Bacteria inhabit all exposed surfaces of our bodies and yet they rarely make us ill. Only pathogenic bacteria can cause infections and only when they are present in sufficient numbers to overcome our immune system's defences. This threshold will be unique to each pathogen in each environment it encounters, and may be influenced by the bacteria's ability to communicate and the strength of the host individual's immune function among other things.
The producing bacteria we designed can inhibit the growth of target bacteria; by slowing down its growth rate, we can make them less harmful to the human body.
Mathematical modelling can help us explain this concept.
Our producing bacteria produces a siRNA that targets a gene in the pathogen, this could be a gene that codes a nutrient uptake protein that would slow down growth when targeted. We have to consider two modifications to the logistic growth to model this effect: the growth rate is affected or the carrying capacity is altered. However, both modifications consider the same type of repression, as described here:
the growth rate is affected, or
the carrying capacity is altered
However, both modifications consider the same type of repression, as described here:
where R is a measure of  the abundance of  siRNA.
We have defined a value at which the level of bacteria can generate an infection. As the immune system has to generate a response in a given time, the goal of our system is to keep the bacteria below that threshold during a fixed period of time. This critical time marks the period in which the immune system is sifficiently prepared to fight the infection.
As expected, two different behaviours are observed. If only growth rate is repressed  by the presence of siRNA, bacteria will grow slowly but reach their maximum level eventually. However, if the inhibition is strong enough, the bacteria will be below the threshold before the critical time, avoiding the infection. The second case case in which the pathogen’s carrying capacity is repressed by siRNA is more reliable, as it can maintain the bacteria below the threshold for a long time.
It is expected this model can help us to understand how our system can"
Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Lab#Libraries_-_-_TEXT.html," to apply a different reverse primer for J23115 due to a mutation. These fragments can then be digested with EcoRI and SpeI.
For our backbone
we used BBa_J23102 as a template. The amplification was done in the way that the forward primer binds to the prefix while the reverse primer binds on the RBS, introducing a lacI binding site as well as a Xbal restriction site as an overhang.
That way the LacI binding site, that derived from BBa_R0010, was added upstream of the RBS. By cutting the fragement with EcoRI and XbaI the backbone can be merged with any promoters, keeping the introduced LacI binding site. Additionally, any other accordingly cut promoter can be cloned into the original J61002 (without LacI binding site) if the backbone is cut with SpeI instead of XbaI. We followed a simple ligation protocol to obtain the final construct.

Characterization
We performed the characterization of our verified constructs in DH5alpha with LB+Amp in 96-well microtiter plate, in which we cultivated and carried out hourly measurements of OD600 and fluorescence ( BBa_E1010 is excitated at 584 nm wavelength and the emission is at 607 nm).
Both factors were quantified in order to observe a possible correlation between the growth rate and the product formation.
Aiming for ultimate reproducibility, we inoculated every wellplate via cryo-replicator from a -80 °C well plate. Each sample was measured in independent triplicates. The efficiency of induction was examined by measuring two identical well plates, but only inducing one plate with IPTG.
The tested original promoters are J23100, J23101, J23102, J23103, J23104, J23105, J23106, J23110, J23113, J23115, J23116, J23117, J23118, J23119.
The tested new promoters with lacI binding site are K1575100, K1575101, K1575102, K1575103, K1575104, K1575105, K1575106, K1575110, K1575113, K1575115, K1575116, K1575117, K1575118 & K1575119.

My first High School iGEM experience was actually when I was in grade 12 and participated on the Lethbridge High School iGEM team in 2012. I then went on to be an advisor to the high school team in 2013 when I started my undergraduate program. I am excited to be back instructing HS iGEM again! My favourite part about iGEM is designing genetic constructs because these molecular biology systems are so elegant. I shall pursue my MD after my MSc, and hopefully maintain an emphasis on biomedical research and engineering.

Product Development: PD completed data parsing and created basic graphs. We also worked on updating parts of the model that required adjusting.
P & P: On July 24th, P&P returned to GIAC and made aluminum boats with the kids to learn about engineering principles, buoyancy, and physics. Plasmid kits were designed, cut, and painted for testing for UT-Austin
Business: Members are still reaching out to potential sponsors.
July 29th to August 4th
Wet Lab: We ligated previously digested High Pass 1a and High Pass 1b into pSB1C3 (to create High Pass 2a) as well as High Pass 1a and High Pass 1c into pSB1C3 (to create high Pass 2b). We performed PCR reactions for some parts we were running low on and then digested and ligated mf-Lon, sigmaF, and PhrpL, High Pass 1a, High Pass 1b, High Pass 1c, Low Pass 1b, and Low Pass 1c individually into pSB1C3 vectors. We heat inactivated and transformed our ligations into NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli. Since we had been having trouble with transformations, we used SOC instead of LB for our outgrowth steps, with a positive outcome - colonies grew on all plates. We used isolated colonies to inoculate 5 mL liquid cultures which we miniprepped after overnight incubations. We also performed colony PCR reactions on assembled pSB1C3 vectors with High Pass 2a and and mf-lon inserts. We will continue with colony PCRs and run gels for them next week.
Product Development: PD began developing proofs and identifying characters of model via direct analysis and also worked on updating the graphics of the graphical model.

The precipitated protein was then resuspended in 10 ml of Tris buffer A and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column. The crude protein extract was subsequently loaded onto a Heparin column equilibrated with Tris buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM DTT). Following elution with a NaCl gradient, the protein fractions were collected and (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 1.2 M. The protein was then loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose High Performance hydrophobic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Tris buffer C (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4,5mM DTT). The protein was eluted with a decreasing salt gradient, coming off at 0.5–0.3 M (NH4)2SO4, and the protein-containing fractions were concentrated to 2 ml. As a final purification step, the protein was loaded onto a High Load Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Tris buffer D (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT). The ZntR fractions were concentrated to ;1–2 ml and showed a single band on overloaded SDS-PAGE gels. Protein was stored at 280 °C in Tris buffer D with 5% glycerol. The molecular mass of ZntR (calculated: 16179.3 Da with first Met) was found by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) (PerSpective Biosystems Voyager-DE) to be 16178.1 Da using a sinapinic acid matrix with myoglobin as the calibration standard.

Both layers overlapped.
Final device: the BioPad
For our final device, the idea was to have a large sized microfluidic chip where the cells can grow in chambers, each chambers will act as a ‘pixel’.
The design is pretty simple, consisting of only a flow layer.
The FilterColi
One of the experiments that we did at the end of the summer was to expose the cells to different solutions by flowing it in and diffuse it in the chambers. However we saw that it wasn’t very effective and so we designed a new chip were the solution is flowed through the cell and so the cells are directly in contact with the solution.
The FilterColi was the answer to our problem. By adding filters in the chambers and another flow channel below the chambers, we would be able to flow solution through the cells.
Control layer design & Flow layer design.
Both layers overlapped.
The CleanColi
As we did the safety issues for Microfluidics, we brainstormed to make an “on chip waste treatment”. The idea was to implement mechanisms in the chip, which will treat the cells that were to exit the array of chambers.
The process we created is the following :
Step 1. The cells leave the array of chambers and are flowed in a serpentine circuit with lysis buffer to mix the cells and the lysis.
Step 2. The waste is then flowed in another serpentine circuit with bleach.
Step 3. The waste is retained in a last big chamber where they are confronted to smaller and smaller filters to keep the debris in the chamber and only liquid will be flowed out of the chip.
Step 4. The cells enter a big chamber located above a microheater inducing a local temperature of 95°C.

For this reason we decided to use the hydrophobic compatibility index (HCI) established by ( Biro 2006 ), along with the charge compatibility index (CCI) described in the same paper for consistency. Both indices give a maximal index of 20 for favourable interactions and a minimal index of 1 for unfavourable interactions. To convert these indices into energies, we subtracted 10 from the indices and multiplied by -1 to assign negative energies (-10 - 0) to favourable and positive energies (0 - 10) to unfavourable interactions. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions have been found to have a slightly higher free energy contributions than hydrophobic interactions, 1.4 kcal/mol ( Berg 2002 ) versus 0.6 kcal/mol for small (36 residues) and 1.6 kcal/mol for large (341 residues) proteins ( Pace et al. 2011 ). Since TDPs have ~210-230 residues, we estimated a hydrophobic interaction energy to be 0.9 kcal/mol. Thus, we came up with the following equations for hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction energies scaled to their free energy contributions.
$$ E_{HCl} = -\left( 10 - \left| [HM(A) - HM(B)]\frac{19}{10.6}\right| \right)\frac{0.9}{1.4} \tag{2} $$ $$ E_{CCL} = - \left(1- [PI(A) - 7][PI(B)-7]\frac{19}{33.8} \right) \tag{3}$$
Model Conditions
In the simulation, Cas13a stays fixed at the center. However, a range of movements is possible for the TDPs surrounding it as illustrated in the figures below . Both movements of single units, at the end or the middle of a chain, and movements of multiple units including, snake movements, rotations of chain ends, and translations are possible.

USTC-Software,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," multiple-inputs-single-output and given functions in Boolean value. By discipline borrowed from electrical engineering and the analysis of connecting logic gates, our software is able to provide several more complex and novel circuit designs.
Meanwhile, circuit¡¯s practical realizability is very vital in order to avoid unnecessary cost and effort in wet-lab. We implement stochastic time evolution modelling to profoundly predict the behavior of circuits. The elaborated S-score, robustness and sensitivity analysis are used in evaluating and screening the circuits.
Through a well-rounded consideration of present difficulties in circuit design, we are motivated to develop such a highly integrated software that can automatically design circuits with both complexity and reliable behavior.
Features
1.Logic: From a truth table to abstract logic circuits
Function:
In BioBLESS, a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and then ¡°Create¡±. The corresponding designed logic circuits with different predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a designed logic circuit, which in most cases is supposed to be a complicated multi-input circuit. Besides the function above, gates list will provide many Boolean gates, and users can drag them freely to our canvas to design logic circuits.
Details:
One ultimate goal of synthetic biology is to design novel circuits with the aid of computers.
Concepts and algorithms from electrical engineering can be exploited to establish a framework for computational automatic design of gene Boolean gates and devices. Gene digital circuits can be automatically designed in an electronic fashion. Although the mechanisms underlying biological process differ in many aspects from those in electrical engineering, the framework determining the relationship between the inputs and outputs are universal only if Boolean gates constitutes the basic building blocks.
Therefore with the introduction of electrical engineering, if biologists need to design some gene circuits with specific functions, they just need to input truth tables and then by employing Espresso algorithms, our software will provide a logic circuit composed of different Boolean gates and function parts. Our library of well-characterized Boolean gates is the basis for the assembly of more complicated gene digital circuits. What is equivalently crucial is that the rational design based on digital circuits will bring about the freedom of designing complicated logic relationships between inputs and outputs, but will no longer be confined to mere single-input-single-output design. In our software, eight inputs are available for users. However, it is worth mentioning that the maximum number of inputs is actually not limited to our algorithm but to the space of the user interface.
It is possible that different schemes may correspond to one expected genetic function. In order to pick"

2) Receptors presenting an extracellular monomeric or single-chain avidin variant.
In presenting avidin on the cell surface, cells are able to interact with a co-injected biotinylated linker peptide. With this linker connected to several cell surface avidins as well as streptavidin in the printing solution, a protein matrix is created that embeds cells and allows precise positioning of cells in a three-dimensional manner.
Our chosen avidin derivates by design allow functional fusion of the otherwise tetrameric avidin molecule with our receptor. Two different variants were used: enhanced monomeric avidin, a single-subunit avidin that is nevertheless able to bind biotin, and single-chain avidin, which resembles the naturally occurring avidin tetramer but consisting of a single polypeptide chain.
All receptors mediate the same function: By interacting with streptavidin in the printing reservoir – either directly by presenting biotin (biotin acceptor peptide) or indirectly via binding to a biotinylated linker (single-chain avidin variants), cells are cross-linked due to polyvalent binding of streptavidin molecules in the printing solution to several cellular biotin groups at once.
The incredible journey: signal peptides and protein targeting
Essential to a protein's function are not only its activity or binding properties, but also its presence at the right time in the right place – the latter in our case being the cell surface. One ubiquitous element for protein targeting is the signal peptide, which enables translocation of proteins to the ER, from where their journey continues to their place of function. Proteins containing a signal peptide include transmembrane proteins, secreted proteins, proteins of the ER itself, proteins of the Golgi apparatus and several more. [1] For our project, signal peptides constituted a crucial part of many constructs, used to target transmembrane proteins to the cell surface (receptors) and proteins to the ER (BirA), and to secrete proteins into the surrounding medium (luciferase assays to quantify expression levels).

These cells were then harvested, lysed and purified using a Ni-NTA resin with standard His-tag purification protocols. Eluates were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1). The darkest bands observed above 100 kDa correspond to the expected dCas9 sizes which suggests the expression and purification was successful.

Amberless Hell Cell
Introduction ● Methods ● Results ● Conclusions
References ● BioBricks
For an application of synthetic biology where live, genetically-modified cells will come in direct contact with the environment, such as biological sensors on a UAV, two concerns must be addressed. First, the cells need to be resistant to widely-varying conditions that may be present in the environment. Second, in order to address ethical concerns about releasing genetically-modified organisms, it is desirable to reduce horizontal gene transfer from the engineered cells into cells naturally present in the environment. In order to solve both of these issues, and therefore to create an ideal chassis for synthetic biology in environmental applications, we will combine two research goals:
1. The ""Hell Cell"" project by the 2012 Stanford-Brown iGEM team isolated genes from extremophile bacterial species and inserted them into Escherichia coli, in order to create bacteria that are resistant to extremes in pH, temperature, and moisture. We sought to further characterize, improve, and search for new resistance genes that would help our chassis survive in earth and space applications.
2. The Church Lab at Harvard Medical School in 2013 created a strain of E. coli (C321.ΔA) in which all 321 instances of the UAG (""Amber"") stop codon in the E. coli genome had been replaced with the UAA stop codon [1]. Release factor 1, which terminates translation at UAG, was also removed. With this system, the Church group incorporated artificial amino acids with a tRNA that recognizes UAG as its codon.
Figure 1. Our approach to the Amberless Hell Cell. By recoding the UAG stop codon to translate into an amino acid, only cells that have a tRNA with the anticodon AUC will produce the complete protein. In our experiment, we used a tRNA that charges with leucine to translate the UAG codon.
We developed a novel approach for preventing horizontal transfer of engineered genes into the environment by inserting a UAG-leucine tRNA, and using UAG for leucine in all of the inserted, engineered genes. The engineered genes will not have any effect in naturally-occurring bacteria in the environment, which lack the ability to translate UAG into leuc"

Design:
Dr. Jiang suggested that we use a combination of multi-genome comparisons and homologous                         evolution                         analysis                         to                         figure out the strategy for the simplification of mitochondrial genomes based on existing gene                         annotation                         files. Dr.                         Cheng, a member in the research group of Dr. Jiang, specifically guided us through the design                         of                         the                         entire                         genome.                         [2]
Prof. Gu suggested that we add a GFP reporting module to this minimal genome for visual                         detection                         of                         new                         mitochondrial genome functions. [5]
During the design of experimental schemes, TACG BioTech suggested that we divide the whole                         genome                         so                         that                         the                         interface sequence between each fragment can be free of these complex sequence regions, which                         would                         facilitate                         subsequent splicing.
We referred to the work report of Researcher Wang Manli when the genome splicing encountered                         difficulties                         [1] and                         timely adjusted the experimental design, adding the plasmid replication stability module and                         the                         plasmid                         copy number control module, through which we ultimately realized the complete genome synthesis.
Execution:
TACG BioTech accorded us with a laboratory to carry out the genome synthesis work and                         complimentary                         support                         for the                         completion of the work. [7] TACG Biotech also helped us finish the synthesis of most of the                         kb-level                         primary                         fragments and specifically guided the subsequent synthesis of the entire genome. [7]
Dr. Jiang gave us the access to his laboratory and provided us with some reagent supplies. [2]
Dr. Jiang answered our questions in the mid-term progress of the experiment and gave feedback                         as                         well                         as                         guidance on                         the progress of the experiment and the achievements of the mid-term experiment.

Name: Soo Kyung Shin
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Soo is a Korean girl. Though she is the only Korean girl in the team, she would never feel lonely due to her adorable personality. Wearing a cheerful smile all the time, she makes everyone want to be close with her. Let me tell you a secret - she is even described as an angel, and I am sure you know the reasons behind.
Name: Steven Shing Yiu Fu
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Steven is a diligent gentleman. He devoted a lot of time in experiments, modeling and designing the Wiki page. He is always very helpful and he never complain. (Don't ask me how he do it.) He might look cool but he is actually friendly when you talk to him.
Name: Tiffany Tze Wing Mak
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Tiffany is a very smart and responsible teammate who actively participates in and helps with planning every aspect of the project. A critical thinker; she's always able to come up with new ways to troubleshoot our experiments. To most people, she appears to be a very serious no-nonsense kind of person. However, once she warms up, she has a pretty silly side too. Her responses to extreme stress can be pretty unpredictable and often hilarious (she'd once thrown her shoe at somebody). Her behaviour changes to suit the situation and people around her. Despite acting like a big sister most of the time, with some people, she can be childish and playful too.

BGIC-Global,2018,Team:BGIC-Global#Integrated Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," and to modulate the ideal equilibrium state for each and every crop.  We accomplish this feat through a novel platform with dual functionality.  First, the platform allows for real-time, biologically-relevant reporting of the environmental oxidative stress via redox-sensitive fluorescent proteins.  Second, it employs an optogenetic circuit to express, with great precision, a panel of enzymes that can regulate oxidative stress through the breakdown of ROS.  Our synthetic biology approach combines the advantages of native ROS-sensing pathways and existing technologies while mitigating their drawbacks; it is a system that is cost-efficient and self-sustaining, while also offering greater sensitivity, versatility, and spatial resolution.
This platform is incomplete without a mechanism that can integrate our real-time reporting signal with the regulatory enzymatic output.  Through extensive collaborations with a startup incubator and with invaluable feedback from hydroponic farmers, we developed a specialized optics-based technology that can accurately interpret oxidative stress reporting and precisely regulate gene transcription on an industrial scale.  This technology shifts power from nature to farmers; we give farmers the tools to monitor each and every crop, as well as the ability to control environmental parameters at leisure and at will.  The farmers benefit from increased crop yields and profits.  The world benefits from economic stimulation and increased food supply.
Climate change, environmental destruction, and resource allocations are imminent threats to a growing population and a deteriorating world, and hydroponics offers a promising path to address those global issues.  At Cornell iGEM, we are committed to engineering innovative, practical solutions to unlock the full potential of hydroponics.  Through hydroponics, we create a future of sustainability that is only possible with synthetic biology.
PROJECT OVERVIEW
OXIDATIVE STRESS
Oxidative stress is defined as a disturbance in the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant defenses [5].  It plays a critical role in many biological processes, the most significant of which (with respect to plants) are pathogen defense [6], programmed cell death [7], and cell to cell signaling [8].  More recent studies have linked ROS to nutrient uptake in a beneficial capacity [2].  In opposition to these benefits, however, too high a level of oxidative stress is lethal to most organisms as it leads to unspecific oxidation of proteins and membrane lipids, as well as DNA injury [10].  Furthermore, tissues exposed to high levels of oxidative stress show an increased production of ethylene [9] which can be detrimental to the plant.
Because of the diversity of roles played by oxidative stress in biological systems, its optimization is a logical choice"

The silk we extruded with the aid of a syringe pump is stretchy, but quite brittle. Optimization of protocols is the next step. We also need to create better controls to better justify our results. We did observe that our recombinant silk, when co-spun with purified Tamura protein, and observed under florescence microscopy, is thicker in diameter than our control.
Protocol
1. Chill a 50mL Falcon tube on ice. Add 2mL of resin slurry.
2. Centrifuge the tube for 2 minutes at 700g. Remove supernatant. NOTE: The speed was increased to 1,000g and then 3,000g to maximize the amount of ethanol supernatant.
3. Add 2 bed volumes (BV) of 1X binding buffer to resin and mix thoroughly on a rotary spinner until buffer is fully suspended in resin.
4. Centrifuge tube for 2 minutes at 700g. Remove buffer.
5. Add protein lysate diluted in 1X binding buffer in 1 to 1 volume ratio to tube. Mix for 30 minutes on an end over end rotation vehicle (rotary spinner).
6. Centrifuge the tube for 2 minutes at 700g. Decant supernatant and collect as Fraction 1.
7. Wash with 2 BV's of 1X wash buffer (20 mM Imidazole). Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 700g. Decant supernatant and collect as Fraction 2.
8. Wash with 2 BV's of 1X wash buffer (50 mM Imidazole). Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 700g. Decant supernatant and collect as Fraction 3.
9. Elute using 1 BV of elution buffer (100 mM Imidazole). Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 700g. Decant supernatant and collect as Fraction 4.
10. Repeat elution with 250 mM imidazole solution. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 700g. Decant supernatant and collect as Fraction 5."

Meet at 1 pm with Richard Bennett, who will be providing us access to a roller drum at 30 degrees C
Miniprep all parts from last night
--------------------------------------------------
Met with Richard Bennett.  He was quite informative.  He convinced us that it might be easier to find two more shuttle vectors than trying to put multiple parts on the same vector.  He put us in touch with the Laney lab to help acquire a yeast strain (W303?) and also to maybe get two more yeast plasmids.  He suggested that we find a vector with a HIS selection marker, and one more with a positive selection marker such as G418.  Another alternative would be to clone separate constructs into different types of haploid strains (e.g. three constructs in 'a', two in 'alpha') and then mate them to form a diploid strain.  This way, we could use the same shuttle vectors that we already have to build our construct.  Unfortunately, however, this process has the effect of making the ratio between all other endogenous genes in the yeast cell and those on our own device 2:1.  We should still consider this possiblity.  He also indicated that it might be possible to visualize how much protein we have using a Western blot, with antibodies for the mCherry region (which four of our constructs will share).  Then, if possible we separate them out on a gel and determine how much there is from that.
Note that for the yeast transformation we will be following the protocol outlined in this paper: http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v2/n1/pdf/nprot.2007.13.pdf

Procedure
PCR for 7 fragments:
Conclusion from today
Inconsistent results from the first PCR where obtained with bands in some of the reactions but not in the duplicates. Even the g-Block was not seen though we have easily amplified that before with very bright bands. Something must have gone wrong and that's why we made the additional 34rxns which will be analyzed on gels tomorrow.

From 2009.igem.org
Module 2 Part ii: Trehalose Production
An important consideration when designing the specifications of the E.ncapsulator was the ability to store the cells for extended periods of time. This could be achieved by dehydrating the cells. However, normally under such conditions there poses a problem to maintaining the integrity of the proteins within the cells. This is problematic for us, as this could lead to breakdown of our protein of interest.
In order to preserve the integrity of our protein of interest during storage of the E.ncapsulator, we decided to incorporate a device for trehalose production within our system. Trehalose is a disaccharide formed from two glucose molecules. Throughout nature, trehalose is associated with  resistance to dessication and cold shock, and is naturally produced in Escherichia Coli. We hope that by upregulating the trehalose production pathways in E.coli we can increase trehalose concentrations within our cell, thereby conferring some resistance to protein degredation in our system. This would allow easy transport and storage of the final product.
The trehalose coding region in E.coli consists of 2 genes, OtsA and OtsB - each coding for a different enzyme required for the conversion of glucose to trehalose.

SDSZ-China,2017,Team:SDSZ-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.
Maybe there are only two factories in China that manufactures this active pharmaceutical                         ingredient (API) officially; one is in Shenzhen and the other is in Suzhou.
……After biliary drainage, it is very likely that bears will suffer from diseases all over their                         body, which is a torture to them. To resolve this problem, researchers and scientists in our                         country wish to convert CDCA in order to receive UDCA. Currently, their methods are deeply                         restrained by the use of sodium due to its danger and difficulty. If you can convert CDCA to                         UDCA successfully using enzymes, you are making a huge contribution.
Also, there are a lot of problems in the production of UDCA in medical industry. For instance, we                         need to consider the safety and profits of this drug. Thus, there are still a lot of aspects                         need to be considered and experiments need to be done when involved in industrial                         production.
Q: Thank you for your suggestions.
Q4: Could you briefly introduce the issue concerning costs and profits?
A: It is complicated because hydrogen needs to be removed. The chemical composition of UDCA needs                         to refine repeatedly, which is tricky. For example, a concentration of 70% of UDCA? require                         three times of refinement at least in order to reach the standard. Also, the raw materials or                         substances need to be recollected and there will be turnovers and other complex factors during                         the process. So the profits is limited. And now the biggest issue is that the danger of                         production overweights its potential profits.

Prof. Xu Jianhe
Prof. Xu Jianhe is a well-respected professor in Biocatalyis and Bioprocessing State Key                         Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering in East China University of Science and Technology.
With many questions regarding to complex bioprocessing and enzyme catalysis, we write to Prof.                         Xu, a very famous professor in China and also expert to get further instructions and                         professional help. At the beginning of our experiment, we decided to employ a two enzyme in one                         pot catalyzed reaction(see figure.1). However, after our initial attempt, we found out that the                         reverse reaction was more prevalent than the forward reaction. Thus because of this, the product                         was actually CDCA, the initial reactant, instead of UDCA, our expected product. This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this"

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#Human Practices#IP_-_-_TEXT.html," to pay more attention to IP issues.  As for the other results, like expected, patents looks to be the most prevalent type of IP that iGEMers applying for IP protection is concerned about.  Now, if we look at the people who answered that they didn't want to consider getting protection, the majority of the people gave moral reasons and lack of effort as the explanation. We're hoping that our IP guide can help address both of these groups.  For the iGEMers who think tackling IP problems are too much work, a centralized collection of information (aka Team UBC's IP guide) may help them out.  As for the ones who don't want to seek IP protection, our guide can provide information for them to make informed decisions.  This aim really applies to everyone, because even people who don't want to get a patent/copyright/trademark themselves, they will still need to work in a world where these things exist.
Evidently, most respondents haven't been affected negatively by IP, or even been too bothered by it in general.  A lot of us also don't know if we have been affected! These two groups might not actually be mutually exclusive.
Opinions
Although 13% of respondents said they had been negatively affected by patents and 9% by other forms of IP, only 7% of respondents indicated they didn't want to protect their own IP. The majority replied that they wanted IP protection, which lets us know that an IP guide is something that would benefit a big part of the iGEM community.
There is a pretty even spread of answers as to whether BioBricks can be patented, but more than half think that we ''shouldn't'' patent them. Despite all of that, 75% of the survey-takers agree that iGEM teams are capable of producing projects that can be patented.  Seeing as how BioBricks play such a big role, to what extent should or can we patent iGEM projects, if half of us think BioBricks shouldn't be IP protected?
Conclusions
With a considerable sample size and responses from both students and advisors, our survey results are fairly representative of the iGEM community.  We've learned from the results that the majority of iGEMers want to learn more about intellectual property and think they will benefit from a custom-tailored guide, especially one on patents.  There were a lot of undecided responses, which indicate that many are probably lacking the background needed to take a stance.  Overall, the survey results show that the iGEM community is interested"

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we attended a workshop based on general molecular biology techniques.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. Also, the team members were assigned in different parts of the project such as TALEs as our detector, Ferritin as our reporter, Linker, Human Practices, Modelling and Business.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
We did our literature search for optimization of TALE binding affinity. There were conflicting results for the optimal truncation of the N and C terminus. On N terminus, 152 (Miller et al., 2011), 147 (Mussolini et al., 2011), 186 (Slovenia’s TALEs), and 158 or 186 (Mercer et al., 2012) residues were retained.

Common Parts
Our project can be divided into two major components, and that's how we are going to present it, but both segments have the following parts in its composition:
BBa_B0034 , which is an RBS taken from Elowitz 1999's repressilator. It is commonly used and has a deffinition of efficiency of 1.0. Note that all RBS in our design is this same one. It was chosen because of its reliability and consistency.
BBa_J23100 , which is a strong constitutive promoter. This part is commonly used and is one of the strongest promoters known. This represents both promoters used. It was chosen with the intent of having the highest yield of products.
Alkanes Complex
BBa_K2149020 . This contains the LuxD gene, which encodes the Fatty Acyl Transferase enzyme. The linked biobrick has an RFP gene added, but the final construct contains just the gene itself.
BBa_K2149016 . This part contains the LuxE gene, which encodes the Fatty Acyl Synthetase enzyme
This enzyme converts the fatty acid substrate into the acyl-protein thioester product.
The LuxE gene together with the LuxC, accounts for the main reactions of the fatty aldehyde synthesis.
LuxC. This part contains the LuxC gene, which encodes the Fatty Acyl Reductase enzyme.
This last unit converts the acyl-protein thioester product into the fatty aldehyde. As mentioned before, it represents the most important step for the fatty aldehyde production.
Together, these 3 parts compose the Fatty Acid Reductase complex, or FAR complex. All the Lux sequences were  retrieved from Photoharbdus Luminescens organisms.
The Lux genes were synthetized in the form of gBlocks, which have a maximum of 2000bp in each sequence. Therefore, all of our Lux sequences were modified to fit the gBlocks. The RBS was included in each sequence for the for the Gibson Assembly. They were then joint in a single piece by using the Gibson Assembly method. The result was the BBa_K2149017 , which is the Lux Operon.

Ensuring Safety
Safety was a significant concern in the design of our project. We wanted to make sure not only that we were safe when working on our project, but that the final system that we designed would be safe to use in the field. We worked to ensure this in a number of ways, which can be outlined below:
Laboratory Personal Safety
Figure 1. Showing off our PPE
All of the students working on the Calgary 2013 team received all of the necessary training as outlined in the University of Calgary’s safety policy. In brief, this included a Biosafety course as well as Workplace Hazardous Materials Information Systems (WHMIS) training. In addition, students took a course introducing them to the necessary laboratory skills where they learned how to perform required techniques both safely and efficiently.
The project that we undertook posed little risk to the students, the only organism used in our project was a commonly used lab-strain of Escherichia coli, which is designated as a biosafety level 1 organism. All necessary chemicals and reagents were handled with care and Material Safety Data Sheets were consulted when dealing with new compounds. Finally, students working in the lab were also supervised at all times by senior lab members, advisors or our lab manager.
Safety in the Design
In addition to the safety of ourselves, the safe design of our system was also a major concern. As our final system will be implemented directly in a feedlot setting, it is very important that we design it not only to be extremely easy and quick to use, but also so that it will be completely safe for the person using"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set"

We were advised the following things by our advisers.
We have to consider the ideas more definitely and precisely.
iGEM is the research by Undergraduates and teachers. So we should think deeply what we should do.
And we talked about the ideas of research again such as:
Making the human disease model with Drosophila melanogaster
Making E. coli which can smell.
Next week we will announce our ideas with each other.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the dxCas9-Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Nickel Affinity Chromatography. 8% SDS PAGE of dxCas9-Tn5 (expected size 214.7kDa). Lane 1 high range molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 whole lysate, lane 3 cell debris, lane 4 clarified lysate, lane 5 flow through, lane 6 wash, lane 7 elution 1, lane 8 elution 2, lane 9 elution 3, lane 10 elution 4, lane 11 elution 5, lane 12 elution 6, lane 13 elution 7, lane 14 elution 8, lane 15 elution 9.
As the figure shows, even with a increasing concentration of Imidazole during elution, the fusion protein breaks down. This can be seen in elution fractions 3-8 (lane 9-14). The conclusion is that another method needs to be thought of to purify the fusion protein.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#Cholera - Enzyme#May-June#Period4#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to only use CV in our biofilm assay stains. The CV has shown to be adequate for the staining of cholera biofilms and should serve our purposes well.
6/21/13
Our research into possible methods for washing the biofilm in our biofilm assays without disturbing the biofilm all indicated that using a round-bottom well plate is the best way to wash wells with non-adherent cells without significantly disturbing the cells. The round-bottom well plates that could be used in our plate reader are too expensive for us to use, so we will continue looking into alternatives.
We re-attempted the washing of the biofilm in the well plate, but were again unsuccessful in washing the wells without disturbing the biofilm
6/22/13
We prepared a new 96-well plate to test whether adding additional media after 24 hours makes a significant difference in the amount of biofilm growth after 48 hours. As our SLB media gives us significantly better biofilm growth, we will only use this media for all future well plates to give us more consistent data. We prepared the well plate according to the tables below.

Today we made Dh5a competent cells as we had run out of our stocks.  Keegan made a Gibson volume calculator which will easily calculate the volumes of each part you need when you input the concentrations of those parts to make sure you have equal molar amounts.  It will be handy for quick calculations of assemblies of up to 10 parts at a time.

Today we transformed the LacI promoter mutants into the screening plasmid Bba_J61002.  We're hoping to see red from the RFP that is built into the screening plasmid.  Ideally we will see shades of red corresponding to differing strengths of the mutant promoters.  Although we're planning on using a fluorescent cell sorter, a cursory screening could be useful just to make sure our error-prone PCR was successful.  We transformed into Dh5a E. coli so we had to induce our plates with IPTG since this particular strain is LacI+"

At first i thought i was terrible with the transformation protocol, but looking better in the registry i saw that the quality control of the part was horrible, so i planned on extracting it from another well, and also from the 2011 distribution kit that Sheref has in his lab.
Week 2 (05/28 – 06/03)
During the weekend I and Guzz go statue hunting: we stop by a few      marble/statues stores and ask for a few samples. We find kind people who      let us take what we want, so we now have what we need to test the      parts we will hopefully build.
I continue to research on the statues project, while developing a Python      script together with Guzz to detect illegal sites from sequences returning their position if they exist, or adding prefix and suffix instead.
I still had problems on extracting the parts from the distribution kit, so i designed primers to PCR-extract it from a composite part.      On day 10 i managed to transform a composite part, the one that i will use for the PCR-extraction. The sample was called “HOPE”, becouse it took so long for me to extract the part, and i was starting to get really disappointed. Getting the transformation done had a huge moral boost.      This week has been the one of the first times: i had my first minipreps, (and i obviously messed them up!) and also my first PCR, where i extracted araC-pBAD both from the composite part and from the E. coli genome supplied by Sheref's Lab.
I purified many plasmids and PCR products, in particular LacI from pET-21 plasmid  and AraCpBAD from E. coli genome and from the Registry.
Week 3 (06/04 – 06/10)
The primers to PCR-extract CysE from the E. coli genome arrive, so I can      now start with it.
My first electrophoresis, obviously, fails. I let it run too much. We now      know that these gels run much faster than the one used during classes.      In my next attempt I manage to see the product on the gel . I proceed with the restriction of CysE and pSB1C3 (the submission vector) with E and P, and then ligation and transformation in Nova Blue cells.
The transformation succeeds, giving both red and white colonies. The      screening of a white one confirms my first construct, and our first Part!

Wageningen_UR,2013,Team:Wageningen UR#Masterclass_-_-_TEXT.html," Abstract ) on last year’s iGEM teams and their way of communicating with the public and politicians. She observed them during  the Discovery Festival and two debates (The Meeting of Young Minds 2011 and 2012 organized by the Rathenau Institute) and analysed the conversations with a special focus on how the iGEM members present or construct themselves in the conversations. The conversations were analysed using Discursive Psychology, a theory that defines talk as the primary arena of human action and tries to find out what actions people achieve in the conversations. The analysis of the conversations resulted in 5 identity constructions that occurred often and she therefore focused on. The identity constructions often observed are: “just normal”, having good will, a solver of global problems, careful and knowledgeable. This summer, Paulien finished her report and this gave us the opportunity to learn about and discuss the results of her study.
Workshop
The expectations of the workshop were quite high because a lot of team-members noticed before, that they were not good at communicating science with for example their parents and friends. Michiel: “In addition the team was curious about Paulien’s interpretation of last year’s human practice efforts. This was because we can learn a lot from this and we can use it to improve our human practice effort, especially the science cafe we were planning to organize in September”.
Paulien started out by a short introduction of her MSc thesis.  Then we got a crash course in discursive psychology, the theory she used to analyse the conversations of iGEM teams in great detail.
Our newly acquired knowledge then was used to analyse four fragments Paulien selected from her data collection.
This is one of the fragments we analysed, recorded at the Discovery Festival.

E. coli cell lysis
Genes from bacteriophages can cause bacterial cell lysis.
Simple lytic phages, such as the single-stranded (ss) DNA phage φX174 and the ssRNA phages, have a single lysis gene (prototypical genes being φX174 E, MS2 L and Qβ A2).  φX174 E seems to be the best characterised at the moment, and encodes a single lysis protein that inhibits a specific step in murein biosynthesis.  Fewer than 500 molecules of E are present at the time of lysis.  Lysis by E requires continued host cell division. (We can't use the system that Paris used to make their ""germline"" non-divisible.)

Furthermore, together with the DNA binding site for the DNA binding domain (DNABD) both fusion proteins form the bacterial two hybrid complex [(d)].   When the complex is built the RNA polymerase gets recruited and transcribes the beta-lactamase.   Just like the fusion proteins the beta-lactamase will be degraded after a while [(e)].   When the beta-lactamase and ampicillin meet in the periplasm the ampicillin will be deactivated and the cell survives.
Based on the reaction sequence the chemical reaction equations can be written down:
(I) kexprP1 stands for the expression rate of plasmid 1, which holds the Evobody-RpoZ sequence [s-1].
kdegEvo stands for the degeneration rate of the Evobody-RpoZ protein [s-1].
(II) kexprP2 stands for the expression rate of plasmid 2, which holds the target-DNA binding domain (DNABD) protein [s-1].
kdegTarget stands for the degeneration of the target-DNABD protein [s-1].
(III) kass stands for the association rate of the bacterial two hybrid complex [(s*M)-1]. kdiss stands for the disassociation rate of the bacterial two hybrid complex [s-1].
(IV) kexprbla stands for the expression rate of beta-lactamase (bla) [s-1].
(V) ktranspbla stands for the transport rate of beta-lactamase from cytoplasm to periplasm [s-1].
(VI) kdegbla stands for the degeneration rate of the beta-lactamase [s-1].
(VII) ktranspamp stands for the transport rate of ampicillin from medium to cytoplasm and back [s-1].
(VIII) kdiff stands for the diffusion rate of beta-lactamase and ampicillin [(s*M)-1].
Differential equations
Next the language of chemistry has to be translated into the language of mathematics. A system of ordinary differential equations is generated. As this system has to be solved numerically, we have chosen a notation the software package MATLAB® understands:
standexpr stands for standard expression [M].
[Evobody] or Evobody stands for Evobody-RpoZ protein [M].

Protocol
Making Chips
prepare 250 ml LB with 2 % Agar (2.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g Peptone/Tryptone, 1.25 g Yeast extract, 5 g Agar)
sterilize the black chip-mold by wiping it with 70 % Ethanol
fill the mold with hot LB and let it cool down for 1-10 minutes
use a sterile (wiped with Ethanol) scalpel to cut along the markings
move agar chips into sterile petri dishes with a spatula
store at 4 °C
Sampling Procedure
using disinfected gloves, slightly press an agar chip onto the surface for 5 seconds
put the chip back into the petri dish and incubate at 37 °C for 24  hours
clean & disinfect the surface
for analysis count the number of:
bacterial colonies
fungal colonies
Results
In cooperation with team Slovenia HS [2] , we took samples from different surfaces in the lab.
Contamination of different surfaces
Multiple samples were taken from different surfaces in the lab. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C the number of bacterial/fungal colonies was counted and averaged.
The average numbers of colonies per agar chip show that keyboards are among the most contaminated surfaces in the lab. Smartphone touchscreens are equally contaminated as the cover of a paper lab notebook. But while it is easy to disinfect a touchscreen, you wouldn't spray disinfectant on your paper notebook. Taking this into consideration with the increased productivity, reproducability and safety, we think that paper-based documentation systems should be replaced by digital documentation methods.

Community labs and containment strategies
Community labs do not undergo stricter monitoring than commercial (industrial, analysis) or institutional laboratories. Although people have a higher suspicion towards community labs.
We invited people from the Technik Garage [3] , a community lab close to Hannover (Beckedorf), to Aachen and discussed via Skype call with the team Paris Saclay [4] about biosafety in general and about strategies against accidentially introduction of GMOs into the environment, which is by far the greatest concern of the public. To address that concern team Paris Saclay developed two containment strategies for GMOs, which could be used by community labs as well.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Project#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html,"l of each dilution was loaded on the SDS-PAGE, either stained via Coomassie solution or visualized in the Western Blot.
Results
During the planning phase two preparatory experiments were run to test the conditions for light induction: Please visit conditions testing to read more about the procedures and results.
The previous idea to set up a quick Flow Cytometry assay for screening LOV photocaging mutants had to be slightly adapted due to lack of time. However, to truly confirm protein splicing SDS-PAGE and Western Blot is the more reliable and definite method. We therefore present these results first.
PVDF membranes were analysed with hexahistidine-antibody. The western blot confirms the expression of all his-tagged constructs, i.e. the mRFP and sfGFP N- and C-terminal halves with their corresponding intein, mRFP and sfGFP coexpression, sfGFP_T65C positive control and the LOV-6 and -12 constructs. The mRFP positive controls are not visible on the anti-His6 blot as they do not include a his-tag.
Figure 4) sfGFP light induction - Western blot with anti-His6
Using the HIS - Antibody, no reconstitution could be observed
For superfolder GFP no intein splicing is shown (Figure 4). In the individually expressed as well as in the coexpressed samples the bands for sfGFPn-DnaXn and DnaXc-sfGFPc are clearly visible at ~23.5 kDa and 22 kDa, respectively. However, in the coexpressed splicing and coexpressed non-splicing samples no band at the expected size of ~27 kDa exists for sfGFP. The evaluation was complicated by the fact that native-sized superfolder GFP runs only little below the size of the N-terminal construct. An additional western blot was therefore performed with GFP antibody.
Figure 5) sfGFP light induction - Western blot with anti-GFP
No reconstituion could be seen in the sfGFP
As suspected, the GFP-antibody's epitope seems to lie in the much larger C-terminal half of split sfGFP (Figure 5). It should thus show the bands in the C-terminal single expression and in both splicing and non-splicing coexpression constructs as well as in the LOV-constructs. Surprisingly, we did not recognise any band in the non-splicing C-half which should theoretically be stained by anti-GFP. However, the band in the sp"

Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity."

This summer, we visited researchers in Institute of Environmental Engineering, NCTU, whose study mainly focus on wastewater treatment. They reviewed our project and provided some suggestion for us.
1. Since enzyme producing technique is not yet mature enough to date, we should reinforce more on detection so that we can increase the efficiency of enzyme usage.
2. Agricultural wastewater has more than an imaginable amount of aerobic particles. Even if the water seems clean, it will still block the filter system in minutes"

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"igation Independent Cloning
In our experience, this method has been only weakly successful. We have seen one correct colony in several attempts.
To attempt the LIC method, simply mix the parts and vector (4 uL of each). Heat a beaker of water to 95 C, and float the reaction tube in it, and allow everything to cool. Afterwards, it may now be necessary to centrifuge the tube briefly to move the liquid back to the bottom.
Colony ""b1"" [blue, yellow] - sequence read is of low quality but things seem correct.
Colony ""y2"" [yellow] - appears to simply be BBa_K216011 , the template for the initial PCR
Colony ""n4"" [plain] - sequence is unreadable.
The y2 colony is probably expressing a template for PCR which made it all the way through the various steps that came afterwards.
BioSandwich with Blunt-End Ligation Independent Cloning
This is expected to fail as Ligation Independent Cloning requires long overhangs at the end of each part, not blunt ends. No correct colonies were seen.
Colony ""bb1"" [blue] - seems to be BBa_J33207 followed by part of E. coli ferrous iron transport gene A.
Colony ""bw2"" [plain] - has spacerT7 followed by the stuffing.
Colony ""bw3"" [plain] - has RFC10 prefix followed by RFC10 suffix, as if XbaI and SpeI sites have joined in a normal vector.
BioSandwich with CPEC: Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning
Colony ""cby"" [blue, yellow] - there is a single-base deletion near the start of the PlacLacZ part, with no obvious cause. It is too early to affect expression. The last few bases of spacer1 are missing, as well as the first few bases of the EYFP part (9 bases total). This is explained by homology of ""tatgg"". Otherwise seems correct.
Colony ""cb"" [blue] - Normal until the end of spacer1, which is followed immediately by spacer2 and the stuffing.
Colony ""cw"" [plain] - spacerT7 is followed immediately by a second copy of spacerT7, after which comes spacer2 and a second copy of spacer2. Then the stuffing.
This gave some of the weirder results.

As Figure.11~ Figure.14 shown, comparing the growth curves of yno1 and yno1-∆yca1 under H2O2 stress with 0mM, 1mM and 2mM, we can see that, the growth of                         strain knocking out yca1 is always better than the strain without knocking out yca1 after overexpressing yno1.
It can be concluded that knocking out yca1 can improve our engineering strain tolerance                         to H2O2.
Conclusions:
Knock out yca1 gene can increase the yeast tolerance to hydrogen peroxide.
Summary of regulator part
To summarize briefly, overexpress ndi1/yno1 can accumulate ROS successfully, also,                         knocking out gene yca1 can improve the tolerance to high level of ROS content.

We visited him to learn about the use of melatonin measurement as a diagnostic marker in different diseases.             We were shocked to hear that the University Hospital Aachen - being one of the largest             clinics in Europe  - does not perform any melatonin measurements.             Samples for melatonin measurement have to be shipped to a medical laboratory 73 km away,             to the Stein Labor in Moenchengladbach.
He explained to us how a melatonin sample is taken: traditionally, saliva samples are used,             since there is a linear correlation of melatonin concentration in serum and saliva.             The melatonin concentration found in saliva is 30% the concentration found in serum.             Patients have to collect the samples themselves at home. At 2 a.m.             they have to interrupt their sleep to give a saliva sample into the tubes they were provided with.
Taking just one sample is very inaccurate to deliver a substantiated diagnosis,             but the financial restrictions are a great barrier for medical professionals for analyzing multiple samples.             As we got to know later from a leading scientist in the field of melatonin research, Dr. Dario Acuña,             for a reliable diagnosis, six samples, given with a two hours break in between each sample, are necessary.             From Prof. Dr. Groezingers point of view, the high cost of an adequate number of melatonin measurements is the reason             for the rare usage of this diagnostic method. Therefore the internal laboratory of the University Hospital             Aachen does not gather a sufficient amount of samples to make melatonin             measurements cost-efficient - the most widely used assay for melatonin             measurement is the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and it is mostly available in 96-well strip plates.
For further infromation on different laboratory methods for melatonin measurement             read our article about Dr. Dario Acuña .

Dan prepared overnights of the LB in the ministat against LB without antibiotic so as to see if the chloramphenicol  was still functioning in our LB media to understand how long the antibiotic remains effective.

Dan's experiment showed that the chloramphenicol was still working after 1 day in the ministat.  However by day 2 all media was contaminated. Again transformations of DNase and Lysozyme were not successful. Three of the flasks were inoculated with KillerOrange and one with control pSB1C3 RFP, OD was measured every hour  using the Tecan and Cuvette reader until optical density reached 0.4. At this OD IPTG was added to flasks B  and C containing KO. The induced flasks were left wrapped in foil for maturation of the protein for 1 hour.  After maturation 200μL of each culture A,B and C were spread plated.The control, induced culture B and non-induced  culture A plates were placed in the light box for 1 hour while induced culture C's plate was left wrapped in foil   on the bench. After the hour all plates were placed in the cold room for testing on Monday. The transformed KR plate was also placed in the cold room to be overnighted on Monday.

The spread plates of KilllerOrange still had live colonies concluding that the kill switch had not worked.  A sample of cultures of KO in flask that had been left over the weekend was taken and the rest was poured into  plates and again left in the light box for the entire day. The sample was tested using the FACS machine,   this showed that the cells were still live and on the non induced culture A,  KillerOrange protein had been produced because the T7 promoter is leaky. KillerRed was overnighted.

I. OUTREACH
Our first challenge was to train traditional engineers (not trained in life-science) in the field of synthetic biology, especially in traditional engineering applications.
Here are some pictures of our SynBio Tour in our university:
I.I SURVEY
Here is the survey:
Here are the results:
I.II COMMUNITY BRICKS
CommunityBricks is an attempt to change the way that we do outreach and address human practices at iGEM. By creating an open source community of lesson plans and activity protocols, we hope to stimulate deeper, more engaging experiences for both sides of the exchange.
I.III ALUMNI iGEM
AlumniGEM is a new platform for connecting past, present and future members of iGEM. It will unite the iGEM community, resurrect old ties, and bring forward inspiring stories from past alumni. It has a forum where users can connect with each other and share every kind of information, especially about SynBio.
I.IV COLLABORATION WITH OTHER TEAMS
We collaborated with Brown-Stanford, Arizona State, Cornell, Panama and UQ-Australia in the development of Community Bricks.
I.V TV INTERVIEW
We were invited to the most popular TV Enterview morning show called ""Tu Mañana"", we had the chance to communicate on national television what is SynBiio and what we did on the iGEM Americas Regional Jamboree.
Here are some photos:
I.VI SURVEY FOR SB UTP 1.0
We made  a virtual survey to know if our program called SB UTP 1.0 (you can find more about it on our page, and you can also try it) really helps the user.
Here are the questions of the survey:

"
Concordia,2016,Team:Concordia#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," school’s community how they felt about a project manipulating cells. And much like us, most members of academic institutions did not have issues with our projects, going as far as calling them cool and innovative. However, asking members of the general public seemed to arise some worries, relating our goals to potential bioterrorism and genetic mutation.
Both of our teams came to an agreement that a grave problem lies in the media, the middleman between science and the common public. The way scientific endeavours are presented by the media and received by the public can help or hinder the trust that people have in any subfield related to biology. iGEM NAWI-Graz’s “The Last Colinator” has potential for future studies in new metabolic pathways and alternatives to antibiotic use. iGEM Concordia’s “Combat Cells” has potential for future studies in bio-nanotechnology and single-cell-to-single-cell interactions on microfluidic chips. Yet, for people without an educational background in biology, the first thought goes to germ warfare, leading to superbugs and a threat to the human race. Even though our team made clear to the public that there are dangers associated with working with nanoparticles (as we’ve addressed in our SOP, LINK HERE), we had to emphasize to people that our work was controlled and disposed of carefully, and there is no chance that our work dangers people outside of the laboratory. For iGEM NAWI-Graz, although their toxin-antitoxin system is a heritable trait, they emphasized that the work is only performed in a lab strain of E. coli that cannot grow outside the lab.
The enlightening ethical discussion with iGEM NAWI-Graz helped Concordia’s iGEM team form a better understanding of topics that biologists do not always care enough to address during their work. It also helped us to shape our SOP in a manner that, we hope, anyone can clearly approach our project in a safe manner.

Experimental Design
Another goal we had set out for our collaboration was to somehow incorporate NAWI-Graz’s toxin-antitoxin battle system into our nanoparticle-coated-cell battle system. After some team brainstorming, we came up with an idea to characterize the efficiency of our nanoparticles protecting E. coli from toxin invasion.  Here is a general layout of the experimental design:
NAWI-Graz had sent us their “Blue plasmid"
