Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  The gBlocks for the new mutants will be amplified.
Procedure:  Nithin ran the PCR to amplify.  See his section for details.
Running on the gel:
The two 50uL reactions were pooled and 20uL from each was mixed with 5uL of 5x loading dye.  The gel was loaded and ran for 20 minutes at 100V.
The results of the gel indicated successful amplification of all mutants.  From left to right:  Ladder, Mutant 1, Mutant 2, Mutant 4, Mutant 13. Media:2015-08-18_PCR_amplification_M1,_M2,_M4,_M13.JPG
PCR clean up was done on the remaining sample from the reaction.
The nanodrop was used to measure protein concentration, 260/230, and 260/280.
Mutant 1:  134.04ng/uL, 1.87, 1.88.
Mutant 2:  145.36ng/uL, 2.00, 1.83.
Mutant 4:  123.45ng/uL, 1.67, 1.91.
Mutant 13:  124.58ng/uL, 1.97, 1.84.
Conclusion:  Digestion, and ligation should be done tomorrow."

These values are derived from the above equation
Solution 3
We also needed to make solution 3 for tomorrow's practical. This involved the following ingredients:
* 5M Potassium acetate: 60ml    * glacial acetic acid: 11.5 ml    * H2O: 28.5 ml
The glacial acetic acid and the water could be added to the 'Solution 3' beaker immediately, but calculations had to be carried out for the 5M potassium acetate to determine the mass of the solid. We decided to make a 200ml stock of 5M solution.
The molecular weight of potassium acetate = 98.15
The desired volume of this solution = 0.2 litres
The desired molarity = 5M
Put this into the equation:
Molecular Weight x Desired Volume (Litres) x Molarity = Weight (grams)
98.15       x        0.2l      x   5M    = 98.15 grams
We then made up the solution and added it to the other ingredients, according to the protocol.
Growing the transformed cultures
Jess obtaining E.coli from a single colony of transformed cells
With the solutions prepared and sent to the autoclaver, we had the task of taking each of the 10 colonies of transformed cells and placing them into 10 tubes containing LB. We labelled the tubes 1-10 and added the colonies to the tubes as follows:
Tube 1 = BioBrick 2 - colony 1
Tube 2 = BioBrick 2 - colony 2
Tube 3 = BioBrick 3 - colony 1
Tube 4 = BioBrick 3 - colony 2
Tube 5 = BioBrick 3 - colony 3
Tube 6 = BioBrick 3 - colony 4
Tube 7 = BioBrick 3 - colony 5
Tube 8 = BioBrick 3 - colony 6
Tube 9 = BioBrick 3 - colony 7
Tube 10 = BioBrick 3 - colony 8
BioBrick 2 = BBa_I13522 in the pSB1AK3 plasmid
BioBrick 3 = BBa_J04450 in the pSB1AT3 plasmid
We then left the cultures to grow overnight.

Collaborations
Let's do something together!
Collaboration in science is one of the most important steps to success. You are very good in your field but still, some piece of a puzzle is missing in order to see the whole picture? It is not a problem at all if you are open and not afraid to ask for help or to offer yours. Meeting other people while working on a science project is also essential. Other people with their fresh mind might easily notice a reason why something is not working properly, suggest solutions or inspire with a new direction. So, let's collaborate!
Team Vilnius-Lithuania Collaboration
We were fortunate to enjoy a productive collaboration with Team Vilnius-Lithuania over the summer. We were able to contribute a mechanistic model of the PURE cell free system which is documented in detail on our modelling collaboration page . Team Vilnius-Lithuania worked with us on wet lab protocols for the characterisation of DNA degrading switch which are outlined here.
DNA Degradation Switch Protocols
1. Introduction
Our DNA Degrading Switch requires the transformation of 2 plasmids prior to maxicell induction in order to function.
Construct pImm contains a coding sequence for DNase Colicin E2’s immunity protein Imm2 and an upstream recognition site for homing endonuclease I-SceI.
Construct pCol contains a coding sequence for DNase Colicin E2.
By transforming pImm into DL2524 (maxicell progenitor strain) culturing successful transformants, transforming construct pCol and carrying out maxicell induction the DNA degrading switch becomes active. By exposing DL2524 to arabinose homing endonuclease I-SceI is induced, this degrades the chromosome of DL2524 and linearises pImm preventing further expression of imm2. With its immunity protein no longer being expressed Colicin E2 should become active around 24 hrs later degrading the DNA remaining within our Maxicell.

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#TestJamboree#SponsorInfomation_-_-_TEXT.html," inform the general public about these technologies in workshops, videos and information in the web. The societal value of projects is therefore not solely based on scientific merit, but also on their social, economic and environmental impact.  The teams consisting mainly of undergraduate students in biology, biochemistry, engineering, informatics and mathematics, carry out different projects at their own universities during the summer. They are advised and assisted by teams of scientists.
Standardized Biology - BioBrick
Synthetic Biology is an emerging research area that applies engineering principles to biological systems. Especially the automated synthesis of genetic material (DNA) up to the size of bacterial chromosomes enables the design of new biological functions.
The basic idea of synthetic biology is to (1) design genetic circuits i.e. sets of interacting genes performing some desired task and to (2) insert the designed circuit into living cells, thus creating cells with new function.  The iGEM organization standard for plasmid construction, the BioBrick specification enables an easy exchange and ligation of coding DNA fragments. iGEM Headquarters harbor a large collection of BioBricks that are available to the teams (distribution plate).
Education
Students participating in the iGEM competition develop skills in creativity, team spirit, communication and organization. The members of the team commonly have very different backgrounds ranging from molecular biology, (bio-)chemistry, physics, informatics, mathematics, social sciences to medicine and pharmacy. Working in such an interdisciplinary team broadens the knowledge and trains the ability to cooperate, explain and teach each other in a complex organization.  For a team to choose an appealing and feasible project, a phase of brainstorming, preparation, analysis, discussions and prioritizing takes place. The students involve specific scientific advisors and instructors from their university.  In many universities iGEM has been embedded in the curriculum. The students can enroll in a dedicated iGEM master course with about 18 ECTS. The students mention as major learning achievements: designing of their own project, planning and decision making, increasing teaching skills, organization of team work, fund raising, presenting of results, use of computational tools and communication with different bodies like industry, press, and the general public.  The universities see a great benefit in participation in the iGEM competition. Students become highly motivated for Synthetic Biology and science in general. They communicate with different instructors and foster the interdisciplinary research at universities. Also, staff members from different faculties build networks for recruiting and supervising iGEM teams, thus facilitating the communication between faculties. Additionally, many of the former iGEM students choose a career in science and start PhD projects. i"
Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," glance at what Tsinghua-A did this fall
    First we made a trial within university. We let the project step out from our discipline. We held a cross-discipline seminar delivering lectures on cutting-edge scientific discovery related to synthetic biology and introduced our project, through which we harvest massive creative ideas and comments. Click to see in detail.
Figure 2: Seminar on campus
    Then we made our way to the public. Before it, under the guidance of biotechnological company’s planning staff, we got fully prepared by making related resources including exhibition boards, leaflets, souvenir stickers and postcards ready. What’s more, to make the activity more interactive and engaging, we took fully advantage of our visualization tool, the two games derived from project idea and modeling results. We optimized their function under the guidance of professional game designers from ‘Perfect World’. Click to see in detail.
Figure 3: A visit to Perfect World
    Finally, we made a hit at China Science and Technology Museum by holding a workshop named “Deciphering Life” that targets both adults and children. We propagated synthetic biology to adults by displaying exhibition and delivering explanation. For children, we had playful workshop activities including engaging art design, DNA model building and web game section with the hope to inspire their affection towards science and research. We got precious feedback from different groups. Staffs from the museum reminded us about the rigorous nature of science and we should balance between rigorousness and joyfulness when we choose the methodology in our activity. We were also inspired by children for more possibility in considering the influence of spatial factors on population interactions that may be helpful for our future work. Click to see in detail.
Figure 4: Exhibition at CSTM
    On campus, we also discussed our project with professors in the field of microbial biology. We finally confirmed three characters (farmer, warrior and beggar) for our project together. We especially want to express our appreciation for Professor Xie and Wang who provided us lots of advice in introducing and completing the character beggar whose prototype in nature is “cheater”.

Reaction Pathways:
It was shown that furfural can be reduced to a less toxic form, furfuryl alcohol, by NAD(P)H dependent oxidoreductases which are transcribed by FucO and YqhD genes                  (Wierckx et al., 2011). The pathways are shown below:
Furfural Reduction Pathway of YqhD
Figure 4:                     Yqhd uses NADPH to reduce furfural and HMF to their less toxic alcohol derivatives.
Enzyme = NADPH Dependent Oxidoreductase:
Furfural + NADPH +  Enzyme → NADP+ + Enzyme + Furfuryl Alcohol
HMF + NADPH + Enzyme → NADP+ + Enzyme + 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furfuryl alcohol
Furfural Reduction Pathway of FucO
Figure 5:                     FucO uses NADH to reduce furfural and HMF to their less toxic alcohol derivatives.
Enzyme = NADH dependent Oxidoreductase:
Furfural + NADH + Enzyme → NAD+ + Enzyme + Furfuryl Alcohol
HMF + NADH + Enzyme → NAD+ + Enzyme + 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furfuryl alcohol
Reaction Kinetics:
The comparison between the reaction rate and Km values of furfural and HMF reductions with different oxidoreductases were done by Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Lineweaver-Burk plot with the data obtained from Miller et al. (2009) and Wang et al. (2011). Matlab’s enzkin function was used to evaluate the results.
Enzyme Reaction Kinetics of FucO
Enzyme Reaction Kinetics of YqhD
Results
It was important to find the appropriate NAD(P)H dependent oxidoreductase that would decrease the harmful effects of furans thus resulting in the improvement on rate of cell mass and bioethanol production (Jarboe et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). Therefore we analyzed the reaction kinetics of both"

Parts
This page provides an overview of all BioBricks that we have created and submitted to the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts. For more detailed information and characterization of these parts, use the links below to reach the Registry page of each BioBrick.
Creation of Our BioBricks
We used different methods for constructing our parts. The laccase enzyme was based on an already existing BioBrick (BBa_K500002 designed by the Tianjin team 2010), where we removed the native secretion signal and added a His-tag via overhang PCR. The mutated version of this laccase (based on our modeling results) was ordered from IDT, making use of their kind sponsorship and saving valuable time. In our process of improving a BioBrick, we utilized a recently developed site-directed mutagenesis technique. In order to test our improved BioBrick, a functional construct including our BioBrick (RBS + fluorescent protein) and a promoter was assembled by restriction and ligation.
Improved BioBrick
In our project, we explored the possibilities of a site-directed mutagenesis technique called SAMURAI . For this purpose, we chose to mutate an already existing BioBrick, the composite part BBa_I13502 designed by the MIT team 2005. This part encodes a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1) and includes a ribosome binding site (RBS). SAMURAI was applied to remove two AgeI restriction sites, making the part compatible with RFC25. We named our improved BioBrick BBa_K2835000 (see table below).

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#KyleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to see which promoters and ribosomal binding sites (RBS) work the best together.
6/6: Monday was our last day of ""boot camp"".  With the comp. team and Wellesley students, we discussed basic synthetic biology and the different procedures/protocols that we would be using in the lab.  We also reviewed a paper from Science magazine, Synthetic Gene Networks that Count by Friedland, et al.  A tour of the lab concluded the day.
6/7:  In the first day in the lab, I did a liquid culture plasmid prep of plated transformations that our Post-Doc mentor Traci had already done.  These would go into the incubator and be ready for mini-prep and plasmid isolation tomorrow.  As a wet lab team, we browsed the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and chose the parts that we would work with over the next couple of weeks.  In all, we chose 3 constitutive promoters, 2 inducible promoters, and 3 RBS, each of varying strength.  We subsequently went through the transformation protocol and inserted the plasmids into competent cells.  These would incubate overnight.
6/8: Today I did mini-prep and plasmid isolation on the liquid cultures from the day before.  The DNA quantification of these samples proved to be poor, with only a few having viable concentrations of DNA for further use.  Additionally, we ran a gel electrophoresis of the plasmid samples.  The gel showed no bands of DNA, thus further confirming the absence of viable plasmid DNA from the samples.  This result is causing some consternation as the exact reason for the problem is still unknown to us.   The transformation plates of our selected parts were successful.  The rest of the day was spent doing liquid culture plasmid preps of these plates that we had transformed on 6/7.
6/9:  Today we did the mini-prep and plasmid isolation of our transformation of selected parts(3 const. promoters, 2 ind. promoters, and 3 RBS).  The DNA quantification of these samples were poor (like our samples the day before) and a gel electrophoresis of the plasmids gave indication of little to no plasmid DNA.  Only one part (UV light promoter) had a viable DNA concentration.  One thing we noticed is that the samples did not grow well in the liquid cultures and there was almost a stringy characteristic to the cells in the tube.  For further investigate,"
Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Team#Cuckoo Clock_-_-_TEXT.html," plant genes for future iGEM competitions. NT cells are a faster, cheaper, and safer model than traditional plant transformation. These cells can therefore be utilized as a quick proof-of-concept test model before moving synthetic constructs into plants of interest. We also aim to produce an iGEM-compatible plant-specific plasmid, several stress-inducible plant promoters, reporter genes containing Kozak sequences (ribosome binding sites) and terminators that conform to BioBrick standards. Lastly, we hope to measure the induction of these stress promoters in real-time by performing a fluorometry assay in which stress will be applied to NT cells and fluorescent output by a reporter (GFP) will be measured to detail induction in real time. This method has a distinct advantage over microarrays since microarrays are only one ‘snapshot’ in time.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," have at least 1 ml of phage supernatant left to analyze. Transfer the same amount of phages used for infection into a phage buffer solution, especially if titer of inoculation phage is unknown. Further, keep 1ml of each culture before infection. They can be used later to calculate propagation efficiency and check contamination.
Grow the cultures for 1 to 24 hours at optimal growth conditions (for E. coli choose 37°C and about 220 rpm). Step 7: Phage supernatant
After incubation, spin down at least 2 ml of cells at 6000 g for 3 min to pellet your cells. Phages in the supernatant are now separated from the bacteria in the pellet. Store phage supernatant at 4°C. Discard the rest of the culture. From now on repeat steps 5 to 7. After one round is completed, you can pause the PREDCEL process and restart later on with the stored supernatant. While PREDCELing, detect and prevent phage washout or phage contamination in your used stocks, media and bacteria cultures. Therefore, perform test PCRs with specific length for your SP.
If contamination or wash out is recognized, take the last sample proven to contain phages and free of contamination to start a new PREDCEL iteration round with a fresh culture. Step 8: Plaque assay
Perform plaque assays of your PREDCEL samples including inoculation phages and culture samples from step 6 (see plaque assay protocol) to calculate phage titers, and to check for washout. Step 9: Check for mutations
Pick several plaques to use them for insert amplification via PCR. Sequence your insert with sequencing primers. Mention that mutations taking place while PREDCEL, it may lead to an inefficient primer annealing. Therefore, order several primers and try to find binding regions in conserved parts of your gene that are unlikely to mutate. Troubleshooting:
As phage propagation rate and mutation efficiency usually varies between different gene circuits and phages, but also due to the achieved changes in activity within a PREDCEL run. Thus, you might have to adapt several parameters to achieve a lower selection pressure (if phages get lost over time), a higher selection pressure (only random mutations occur) or changes in mutation rate (too little/ many mutations). The following parameters can be varied:
the amount of culture volume to be infected and the corresponding flask size
the time of incubation post infection
the amount of phage supernatant transferred

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.

Her answer:
“In the big picture, when your child gets the diagnosis, it's a very hard time for patient and families. You have to keep track of the infections, make sure they eat enough with their enzymes, practice the breathing exercises and make sure they do them correctly and always in the back of your head, you know it's for life. You just have to learn to live with it, knowing that many do not survive over middle age years.”
Ulrica Sterky, a children’s nurse and also the mother to a son with cystic fibrosis.
All the participants addressed GMOs as a medication very positively. They said as long as it’s safe and approved, and of course works, why not?
Additionally, when we asked what device would be the most suitable, the questions were quite similar but with some differences. To summarize, the patients are quite tired of using inhalers and the ones today are quite complicated. If the medication could be given as a pill, that would be the easiest. Although considering side effects and the fact that the pill might not deliver the medication as specific as wished, all of them agreed that an inhaler like a nebulizer would be the best. More specifically, it would be the easiest for the patients if the inhaler was small enough to fit into a pocket.
Amanda and Sonia together with Michael Runold, a pulmonary physician.
Sonia at Karolinska university hospital together with Niclas Johansson, a physician in infectious diseases.
In regards to the possible market of our potential solution, about 40% of the surveyed patients said yes to a medication being a GMO, and the rest stated that maybe would maybe buy it, giving our product a very interesting number of potential customers.
On the physician side, all the participants addressed GMOs as a medication very positively, said that as long as the product is safe and effective, they would not have any problem prescribing it.
Overall, we have been able to understand what the priorities the health care professionals and patients have for the use of PROlung. Additionally, from the surveys and interviews, we were able to identify the different customers, who have stated interest in this solution and would be willing to buy it.

Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
Protocol by Arizona State University
Grow Synechocystis on BG-11 + glucose medium to OD730 = 0.5.
Transfer 1.5 ml of culture to a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
Spin cells at 7000 rpm for 2 minutes in a balanced microcentrifuge.
Remove supernatant by pipetting.
Add 200 µl of fresh BG-11 medium to the cells and resuspend cells.
Add 2 µl of the [our] plasmid and shake the tube several times.
Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Place a sterile filter on top of an agar plate that contains BG-11 + 5 mM glucose (50 ml per plate because it will take a long time for colonies to appear). Plate the cell suspension on the filter, spread it, and let it dry. The plate will be incubated in the light at 30 °C. The filter will be transferred the next day to a BG-11/glucose plate that contains [antibiotic].
Questions
Concentration of plasmid?
Temperature for growth in step 1? Light conditions?
Plate how much cells?
Use how much antibiotic?
Some possible answers from Mermet-Bouvier-CM-1993
Antibiotics added under the agar plates (I don't know why they add under the plate, perhaps some of the antibiotics are too heat sensitive) to a final concentration of: 10ug/mL Chloramphenicol, 50ug/mL Kanamycin, or 5ug/mL streptomycin.

Week 4
Finally our plasmids are already digested and purified, ready to be cloned with the synthetic DNA. The worst part of this process is that during the purifying step, we always lose a great amount of DNA.  we obtain, however, enough linearized plasmids.
This week we tried the transformation. We expected  our transformation to be successful but despite our expectations, we obtained no colonies. Besides, something unusual occurred, our ΔSspB strain was not able to continue  growing when the culture had got a DO = 0.3 (this kept happening every time  we tried to repeat that protocol).  At the end of the week, after some analysis, we concluded that our ΔSspB could be transfected with a phage, so we will execute some assays to determinate it.
Also, we discovered that ΔSspB and ΔClpX have an F’ plasmid. It’s extremely important to remove it since there is a strong LacI gene on it. We think the best way to achieve it would be: first, continue with the deletion protocol; and then we’ll check the loss of F’ plasmid as the plasmid won’t have been selected.
Furthermore, in the middle of the week, a synthetic device arrived, the asRNA device, (hurrah!) and now we are trying to clone it with the plasmid.
Week 5
As we prognosticated before, our ΔSspB is infected with a phage according to our assays (we could see calves!). So we decided to start from the beginning with the ΔSspB strain… Meanwhile we focused on the ΔClpX strain and we carry out the protocol one more time. Thank God (or whoever it is) we acquired some colonies! Now, we have to check it by PCR after holidays (just a couple of weeks to rest).
The ligation of the iGEM vectors and asRNA device was unsuccessful, so that we will try it again in September.

I’ve been interested in diagnostic biotechnology since childhood. iGEM was a great opportunity for me to fulfill this vision. I hope to reach beyond the limits of classroom science and not only learn and develop new ideas, but also help spread our project to the public. In the team I was the main wiki and web developer, a role where I orchestrated the planning, creation, design and development of wiki and computer related parts of the project. I also participated in writing articles, experimentation and  human practices. I’m deeply curious about the universe and have interests in a variety of fields, including computers, biotechnology, and writing. I plan to further study these areas and contribute what I can.

The reason why I participated in IGEM is to broaden my field of observation and to build biological and chemical knowledge through team projects. I hope that I can take a step closer to my desired field-chemical engineering-by making a heart diagnosis kit through IGEM. To fulfill this dream, I actively participated in experiments and human practices with my teammates. Team projects already extremely supported me, but I want to develop myself especially by listening to and embracing the opinions of other participants at the convention hall.

Hi! It is a great pleasure to join in the Jamboree to present our work. I was mainly responsible for coordinating the wiki team project through planning the website design and developing the visualization of the domain via coding with my friends. I was also in charged of creating the entrepreneurship and involved in lab work, human practices, and collaboration. Participating in the iGEM competition encouraged me to have a stronger passion in bioengineering and web-development. Moreover, optimizing the given opportunity to map out the process of commercialization enabled me to strengthen my ability in terms of entrepreneurship: from finding the limits to solving and organizing the business project based on the product"

1.Nitric oxide sensor
We constructed our NO sensor in the pCDFDuet-1 plasmid (Figure 1)
According to the results of the ShanghaiTechChina_B 2016 team, 100μM SNP aqueous solution can                 continuously release NO, and the NO concentration is stable at about 5.5μM. This concentration is the                 concentration of NO in patients with IBD. Therefore, in the subsequent test of the NO sensor, the final                 concentration of the SNP aqueous solution we added was 100 μM.
We transformed the constructed NO sensor plasmid into DH5α, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to                 OD = 0.2. After 1.5 h of growth at 37 ℃, the inducer IPTG and SNP aqueous solution were added. After 6                 h at 37 ℃, 1 mL of the bacterial solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 1 min (Figure 2).
From left to right: control, 0.5mM IPTG without SNP, 1mM IPTG without SNP, 0.5mM IPTG with 100μM SNP,                 1mM IPTG with 100μM SNP.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," experiments were conducted, testing the effects of the increased amounts of $\gamma$-radiation, since $\beta$-radiation and $\alpha$-radiation are fairly easy to block. It was found that the fungus was still able to grow under a level of $\gamma$-radiation , which is comparable to that on the surface of Mars. Controls were prepared, but it is thought that the temperature of the irradiated samples was higher than 20° Celsius, since the controls had grown less than the irradiated samples.

hi
Now that we had faith in our structure based on physics, we could turn our attention to our actual material. Fungus, with their immense biodiversity, holds a wide range of growth conditions that are all affected differently. Unfortunately, our early experiments mostly illustrate that A. oryzae grows at a slower rate, at colder exposure (it showed no growth in the refrigerator over multiple days; we refer to our notebook for further details). We hypothesize that by implementing the choline dehydrogenase and/or betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase from Psychromonas ingrahamii, as was demonstrated by the Stanford-Brown team in 2012 (2), we could surpass this issue.
Due to various phenotypic signals, color changes in the amilCP constructs and MelA constructs , we are optimistic that our system will work on site.
As our project is not necessarily a solution attractive to the general population as most people do not spend their time on considering Mars habitation, we found it difficult to engage with them and troubleshoot our solution outside the circle of specialists. Through our work in human practices , we were able to hear opinions from a wide range of audiences and learn that the topic revolving our project is becoming a more common discussion subject. The biggest issue regarding our project lied with the use of GMO, which around 60% of Denmark do not want (3). It is GMO in food that people hold a negative attitude against and as this is not our goal, we were able to positively influence most opinions.
Our solution compelled to a high percentage and it seemed our solution is encouraged by a meaningful size of the population for a future Mars habitation advancement.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," that uses involves assessing the convulsions of mice in response to injections of increasing concentrations of insulin.

Additional Design Considerations
WB800 Bacillus Strain
One of the challenges that we found in the literature of producing recombinant insulin was its susceptibility to proteolytic decay. So to continue with the theme of maximising expression, it would make sense to reduce the effect of proteolytic decay.
Our idea: knockout proteases from an existing strain such as B. subtilis 168.
Our actual solution: find one that already exists.
And hence we discovered B. subtilis WB800. It is one of the more recent of a long line of protease deficient strains of Bacillus subtilis that have been optimised for recombinant protein secretion (Figure 11).
WB800 specifically has 8 proteases knocked that include both intracellular and membrane bound. The strain was kindly provided to us for experimental use by Professor Sui-Lam Wong of the University of Calgary, Canada.
Figure 11. WB800 protease knockout strain
pUS270
Although pUS258 appeared to work quite well as an expression vector, we noticed that it wasn't the most streamlined process of cloning in our constructs nor transforming into Bacillus subtilis because of an MCS that was incompatible with the BioBrick cloning system, and the extra steps needed to ensure the correct integration of the plasmid into the chromosome.
So we decided to design a new compact, highly efficient replicative expression vector that would serve not just our own future experiments, but the whole iGEM community. Thus, pUS270 was born!
While we were too short on time to construct it ourselves, we are holding onto it for a future project that can be tested and eventually submitted to the registry.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"
Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmid pBQ200 served as a control. Next, we transformed the three strains with the aroE::spc deletion cassette and with chromosomal DNA of strain BP233 (gltT::spc), of which the latter served as the positive control. While we did not get transformants without DNA, many transformants appeared with chromosomal DNA of strain BP233 (Figure 30). Moreover, the chromosomal copy of the aroE gene was only dispensable in strains carrying an extra EPSP synthase gene on a plasmid. To conclude, the aroE EPSP synthase gene is essential in B. subtilis. Moreover, the bacteria seem to require the enzymatic function of the EPSP synthase because also the enzyme from E. coli permits growth of the aroE mutant (Figure 30).
Figure 30. The EPSP synthase is essential in B. subtilis.  Transformation experiment to evaluate the essentiality of the EPSP synthase in B. subtilis. The bacteria were propagated on SP plates supplemented with spectinomycin and incubated for 24 h at 37°C.
6.2. Purification and characterization of EPSP synthases
This year, our team came toghether with the iGEM team of Marburg , to investigate the interaction of the EPSP synthases AroE and AroA from B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively, with glyphosate. Glyphosate targets AroE and AroA in B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively (see Background information). Since the members of the Bange lab , which is hosting the iGEM team of Marburg , are experts in the field of Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we did not hesitate to contact them for support. Our team cloned the aroE and aroA genes of B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively, and the resulting constructs are suitable for overexpression of the  Strep-tagged AroE and AroA enzymes in the E. coli strain BL21. The N-terminally Strep-tagged proteins can be purified by Streptactin:Strep-tag affinity purification system from the IBA , Göttingen. The purified proteins were send to the iGEM team in Marburg (Figure 31). The ITC measurments were performed in Marburg. Unfortunately, not interaction between glyphosate and the EPSP synthases could be detected. Unfortunately, also the"

The species-specific sensitivity of TRPV1 can be ascribed to about eight amino acids in the vicinity of TM3 ( Jordt an Julius 2002 ).
Figure 10: Molecular determinants of species-specific vanilloid sensitivity. Sequence alignment of rat (top), human (middle) and chicken (bottom) VR1 within the TM3-4 region is shown. Conserved residues are indicated by black background. The chimera V3/C contains a minimal segment of rat VR1 that is sufficient to confer vanilloid sensitivity ( Jordt and Julius, 2002 ).
We further aligned the TM3 region of the TRPV1 receptor to the ligand binding region of the native VirA receptor from Agrobacterium by the use of the tool MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation ( Muscle ).

Screening system
Development of a high-troughput screening
The screening of randomly mutagenised genes for a desired function or application is always a very time-consuming procedure ( Beaudry and Joyce, 1992 ). It requires a huge amount of material and might takes several months or even years to result in a promising new version of a gene ( Hanczyc and Dorit, 2000 ). As we faced the challenge to modify the VirA receptor in only a few weeks we designed a strategy for a fast high-throughput screening by using subsequent steps of different read out systems and a strategy with two different plasmids.
In the first step after mutagenesis of virA it is necessary to separate thousands of transformants with minor or unwanted changes in the virA gene, from few bacteria that included interesting virA variants. Thus, we wanted to construct our system to lead in the expression of a kanamycin resistance after the induction of the VirA receptor, enabling the quick exclusion of all unwanted virA variants.
For that purpose a kanamycin resistance cassette should be set under control of the virB promoter, leading in the expression of aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH) that can inactivate kanamycin. The mode of inactivation is the transfer of the y-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group at C3 of the antibiotic ( Wright and Thompson, 1999 ). This phosphorylation results in the loss of binding capacity of the aminoglycoside to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, which would lead to"

Canoe excursion
One of our greatest adventure outside the laboratory: Driving a canoe requires team work and arrangement. Everybody has to paddle synchronously, otherwise there is no chance to stay dry. A must do in team challenges!
Team meeting in the pizzeria
One of the meetings in our numerous row, a comfortable atmosphere to make further project plans is guaranteed.
ScieTalk in Heidelberg
ScieTalk is the student congress of science in Germany giving young scientists and professors the chance to present their innovative ideas without any participation fee. This year, it was the first time that it took place in Heidelberg. A good opportunity to get impressions of poster presentations, to meet interesting people and maybe a potentional sponsor for the own project. We also had the chance to meet Mr. Kleinschmidt from the DKFZ and thanked him for many of the aav plasmids and antibodies against aav we received from him.
Barbecue on the roof
Having a barbecue on the wondeful top of our biology building. To be a good scientist, sometimes there should be a break and something to eat.
Any given Sunday... literature session
Regular brain stormings to complete the needed knowledge for our project. By discussing the literature in small groups it is easier to keep everything in mind.
Get to know the team... in the kitchen
The best way of getting to know each other: working together in the lab kitchen, sharing the same implements and receipts for cooking and finally having a good meal.

UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#Coliguard#Killing_-_-_TEXT.html," a third killing mechanism. The two killing mechanism cited before can be very effective and act to contaminants situated far away from the killing, but these system create a problem: The dilution of the lysozymes in space and consequent reducing of the killing effectiveness.
To solve this problem we focused on the closest relation two different bacteria can have, the conjugation. The conjugation is already being used in our project to detect the contaminants, but we can improve the applicability of it making the conjugation not only to detect the contaminants but also to kill them.
If we insert in the F plasmid a gene that codifies to a lethal protein, after the transfer of DNA the contaminant will produces this protein and kill itself.
Our Killer bacteria must have an antidote to the lethal protein to avoid its suicide and the antidote gene must be in the chromosomal DNA while the lethal gene must be in the F plasmid, otherwise both lethal and antidote gene will be transferred to the contaminant and the entire system will be useless.
As the lethal gene we chose CeaB, which codifies to the colicin E2 that acts as a endonuclease and the antidote we chose CeiB which codifies to a immunity protein against CeaB (5, 6)
This both genes are found in wild populations of E. coli, when a cell harbouring a plasmid with colicin operon dies it releases colicin E2 which is transported inside others neighbors cells. If the cell that receives the colicin has the CeiB immunity protein, no problem, but if it don’t have, the colicin E2 will degrade the cell’s DNA and kill it (7).
In our system, only the contaminant which receive CeaB will transcript and translate this gene leading to its death by the destruction of its own DNA. This system is less metabolic expensive than the Alpha Hemolysin Secreation System and the Kamikaze Sytem, the target will have to afford with the costs of his own killing system.

NOTEBOOK
27th June
Entire team assembled for the first time in the Department of Plant Sciences. Had some fun in building sticky note tower (the tallest one was 2.5 meters, built in one hour without previous preparation!) Various coffees and teas are available in the department, very planty.
In the first week we had lectures and discussion on synthetic biology, photosynthesis, DNA assembly and genetic engineering on plants. We also practiced using Geneious software and visited the botanic garden. Lots of brainstorming creates tonnes of ideas about ways to save the world using plants in 10 weeks.
1st July
By the end of the week we have a long list of ideas but nothing too concrete so that we could assess feasibility. We have made a big progress in getting the team together, communicating biology to engineers, finding the common language. By monday we have a challenge - to everybody come up with a well elaborated idea about what to do.
4th July
Bio-plasters
We got all really excited for bioplasters. Lucie has found two cool articles where they have introduced Chlamydomonas into biomaterials to produce oxygen. It worked nicely and caused no immune reaction but they haven't modifies Chlamy to do something cool. We could do that! The group has elaborated on it further but then we realised it would be hard to find supervisors for that and there might be issues with working with mammalian material. We had a presentation from everybody about our ideas - Geoff about light-producing algae, Mie about environment cleaning and biohouses, Jake about growth facility, etc.
5th July
Finding our biological direction: Homoplasmic transformation
After a meeting with advisors we came to reconsider our idea of establishing a plant toolbox opening the Plant Track and especially chloroplasts to iGEM and science. And we found a very exciting goal - to make a tool which would propagate our constructs into all the plastid DNA copies quickly and efficiently using CRISPR/Cas9. No more tedious selection rounds for 2-3 months!

Experience
We have come a long way since we first met to form a team and discuss possible projects. We learned how to make an idea into something big, that we can really accomplish things with motivation and hard work, how to use a lab without continual instructions and most of all that as a team even disappointments lead to a stronger commitment concerning the project.
We had a great time with iGEM, made new friends, met people from all over Germany and we are looking forward to meet even more in Amsterdam and in the coming years.

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#proves4_-_-_TEXT.html,". We completed the purification in early 1962, obtaining about 5 mg of the lightemitting principle. The substance was found to be a protein with a molecular weight about 20,000, and it emitted light when a trace of Ca2+ was added-whether in the presence or absence of oxygen, to our astonishment. We named the protein “aequorin” after the genus name of the jellyfish. Aequorin is an extraordinary protein containing a large amount of energy that can be released when calcium is added; thus it resembles a charged battery that releases the energy when short-circuited. The system was so unusual that some biochemistry professors expressed their skepticism. After 30 years of discovery, however, the importance of aequorin and its use as a calcium probe are firmly established in biochemistry and physiology. The word “aequorin” now can be found in various common dictionaries.

COLLABORATIONS
USP_UNIFESP Brazil team
USP_UNIFESP team project involves lots of molecular biology manipulations, in order to produce spider silk proteins associated with enzybiotics in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We established a partnership with them, exchanging different types of knowledge from our teams.
We also had a great time in Sao Paulo with them, attended a USP SynBio club meeting and share our iGEM experience from previous years.
Molecular Biology
Since our team has experience in molecular biology, we offered USP_UNIFESP team mentoring during their lab duties. Some Skype meetings were conducted, we discussed issues and gave protocol tips.
Bioprocess
USP_UNIFESP team helped us having some discussions about the implementation of our bioreactor prototype.
3D printing of a bioreactor model
Our prototype bioreactor was constructed in Manaus, but we wanted to show the world what we've done! So, with USP_UNIFESP help, we designed and printed a 3D model of our bioreactor. This model was printed in São Paulo and sent to us in Manaus, so we can take it to 2016 Giant Jamboree in Boston.
University of Buenos Aires
To encourage and startup new teams in Latin America is a noble task which we are totally into. We participate in the TECNOx , a Latin American contest for disruptive technologies (including synthetic biology!) to help to solve the continent problems. We had a great interaction with teams from Argentina, Mexico and Colombia. From this event we also started a network in math modeling with experts from Buenos Aires University. The experience was so positive we brought a student (Denys Bulavka) to give a one-week workshop in modeling at our university. It was there, at the workshop, we learned a lot and we finished up this part of our project.
It's worth to remember the Buenos Aires University was the only one in Latin America who won the Best Math Modeling prize at iGEM (in 2013). So we hook up together and found ways to describe our work in math language as well as worked in prediction systems (link para modeling). We build up our model for RFP production responding to our designed promoters and check its force and also we mode  Phytochelatin production. Our idea now is to keep the partnership and create a new team composed by two universities from different countries in order to propel the Latin America participation in the competitions.

1. Please describe the chassis organism(s) you will be using for this project. If you will be using more than one chassis organism, provide information on each of them:
2. Highest Risk Group Listed:
All organisms we used in this project are in risk group 1.
3. List and describe all new or modified coding regions you will be using in your project. (If you use parts from the 2013 iGEM Distribution without modifying them, you do not need to list those parts.)
4a. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe. a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
The E. coli strain DH10B and BL21 was used throughout our project. Both are Risk Group 1 laboratory strains of E. coli that have a low, but not nonexistent, virulence. Organisms classified as Risk Group 1 are not known to cause disease in healthy adults. Keeping with registration requirements for Risk Group 1 bacteria, all laboratory work was performed in an environment certified for Biosafety Level 1. Hence, they pose low risk to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab.
4b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
These strains of E. coli are generally not resistant to antibiotics. All bacteria were transformed with bacterial plasmids carrying our desired insert gene and antibiotics resistance to antibiotics commonly used in laboratories for selection (ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, etc.), but will not interfere with potential clinical treatment. Neither plasmids nor their insert genes will affect virulence, infectivity, or host range.

Construction of PQ-B-R-OU-B into AC plasmid
Purpose: To construct the signaling circuit by inserting PQ into B-R-OU-B in AC plasmid, as the pCS26 vector has Kan resistance. This was done by (1) cutting the insert (PQ) with EcoRI and SpeI, and cutting the vector with EcoRI and XbaI, as well as (2) attempting a PQ-B-R-OU-B plasmid switch of colony 12 (see July 14) from AK to AC by cutting the insert and AK plasmid both with XbaI and PstI. After this restriction digest, phosphatase and ligation treatment was performed and the plasmid was subsequently transformed into TOP10 competent cells and plated overnight on LB+Chlor.

Insert Intuitiveness
The main goal I made for myself today was to make the activities I am scripting much more intuitive (especially for first-time second-lifers) then they already are since I believe they seem simple to me only because I was the one who made them. To do this, I have started to create instructions for restriction digest that are not contained within a notecard, which some may be inclined to pass over. So now when the instruction label is clicked (just below the writing – Restriction Digest Start) it will now explain what each section of the activity is for and what you can do (It also lights up each section being talked about to draw the eye), but I would like to improve upon this by adding more detail. They will also get a notecard that explains the restriction digest, ligation and phosphatise treatment aspects of the entire molecular cloning activity.
I also completed the script for a general activity for bacterial transformation so now it will quiz you each time you put a certain object into the tube’s inventory and the questions will relate to the item you added. It then keeps track of the number of questions you answer correctly and if you answered all of the questions right, your competent cells were successful in up taking the DNA. I believe I will make this activity a gradient for now so as long as eight or more questions were answered correctly, the competent cells will survive on their respective plates, just at different levels of growth. I am unsure if I should keep track of each avatars score, though I believe it is possible since I have seen this used other places for different reasons, but it would prevent someone taking credit for someone else’s work. Questions include: What temperature do competent cells need"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," false accusations can ruin athlete’s lives. Therefore, we adhere much value to the build-in double verification.  After a prescreen, we use sequence verification to provide athletes with more direct proof. As the Oxford Nanopore MinION device that we use has a misread percentage, we simulated actual read-outs and made sure the separation between gene doping and misread normal DNA is clearly present. In this way we have an accurate and reliable gene doping detection method.
4.4 Privacy in Genomic Data Analysis
From our surveys it appeared that people generally do not care about genomic privacy. Only 22.6% of the general Dutch population thinks we should be utterly careful about the genomic privacy of athletes based on 181 respondents. We however do believe that guaranteeing athletes’ privacy in gene doping detection is one of the most important values to take into consideration within our design.
So, why is genomic privacy important? From one of our initial talks with Professor Dimeo it became apparent that there is not only a threat of hacking attempts on databases. In addition, all the people that work in the regulatory cycle and get to see the results give rise to an opportunity for blackmailing athletes, a real risk that Professor Dimeo is afraid of.
“Whole Genome Analyses are privacy invasive. Not only is there a possibility for hackers, also blackmailing of athletes might ensue by the regulatory personnel. There is a lot of money going on there.”
Prof. Dimeo
The fear of genome database hacking is not fiction. Scandals are already happening. Big companies known for their ancestry analyses for example have their databases hacked, leaving 92 million people with their genetic code up for grabs ( Shaban, June 5 2018 ).
Why should people be afraid of hacking? Apart from the fact that companies can earn much money with your genetic code, in time your genetic information can be used against you. An example is in health and life insurances. If this continues, in many countries only the good risks can still have a cheap insurance once their health insurer knows their genetic disease predispositions. The same applied for job and sponsoring offers and loans and mortgages. This can lead to large social problems and possibly unethical situations that we will then need to find other solutions for. For our method at least it means we highly value athlete privacy.
Current data storage and safety
Recently it became apparent that around the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, the medical information of 250 athletes from 30 countries who have a dispensation to use certain medication was hacked ( NOS, October 5 2018 ). The year"

SYSU-Software,2013,Team:SYSU-Software#model_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic circuits is crucial to understand the design of noise-tolerantand delay-robust gene circuits for synthetic biology[18].A linear stochastic time-delayed model is applied in our software to mimic the realistic dynamic behavior of anetwork[19].
   Where mRNA(t)=[mRNA1(t),…,mRNAn(t)]T, α0and αk denote the real-time and delay-time interactionamong these circuits, respectively, while the delay time τk rests on the specific circuits.
Cascade analysis
   Cascades including tandem and cyclic ones are widely used in synthetic biology for different purposes. In order to get a better understanding of these circuits, we create a new iteration and optimization algorithm to calculate the fold-change in different cascades. Here is our story:
   To begin with,a set of differential equations that represents the character of regulatory network generate an equilibrium solution, which means that the concentration of mRNA and the concentration of protein in the system wouldtend tohave fixed values after periods of time. Therefore, we conclude that the equilibrium solution and the initial conditions in this model are independent to each other and thus the equilibrium solution could be applied to represent the expression level of related circuits.
   The equilibrium solution is also applied to describe the function of activators, repressors, corepressors and inducers at a regulation rate, which is also known as fold-change, between before regulation and after regulation.
         Synthetic Cascades[20]
The First Level
   If any activator or repressor does not bind to the operon, we have the set of differential equations below:
   As the initial concentration of mRNA and the initial concentration of protein have no effect on the equilibrium state, we define the initial values of both concentrations as follow:
   Then, we have
   Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of the targeted portion can be given by the following formula:
   (1)
   In the equilibrium state, there is no rate of change in any variable so the above equilibrium concentration can also be given by the following set of equations:
   Similarly, if the promoter is a positive induced promoter and there is no activator, the equilibrium concentration of the targeted protein is given by:
   (2)
   As same as the above, if the promoter is a negative induced promoter and no repressor is presented, the equilibrium concentration of the targeted protein is given by:
   (3)
The Regulation Rate of Activator and Repressor

For these terms above the groups didn’t display an incidence term higher than two (2), thus the answers were so heterogeneous that their analysis and group comparison  was not feasible.
Discussion
Taking into account the results, in a first analysis we can be led to conclude that BioMech has an impact on the answers given, because the data displays that BioMech player group, in a considerable number of questions, got a higher numbers of terms that are given as sharing answers among the participants of the group itself than the Not BioMech players.
But maybe things are not so simple, we have to consider some other points: (i) as already stated above, before playing BioMech the participants had a little talk with us about BioTROJAN and its concepts. So probably, what the data shows us is the influence of both, BioMech and BioTROJAN talk - which is reinforced by the result of Question 2. (ii) the survey had low amostral number (N) and may it have caused a big bias in the results. We just applied effectively the game at TWB during 4 hours, in a further survey we most to expand our N to achieve greater power of completion. (iii) the target audience of TWB is mostly biologists and probably it inserts bias, since the questions asked are related to biological area, in this way, to overcome this the survey must be done with a wider audience. And finally, (iv) for some terms closer relate to molecular biology and Synbio - “Use of transgenics for the control of insect-borne diseases, GMO, Biosafety and Synthetic Biology” - Group 1 didn’t show a better performance than Group 2.
In conclusion, the survey may be showing us that the combination of BioMech plus BioTROJAN talk had some influence in the answers of Group 1, but because of the problems (ii) and (iii) pointed out we do not have enough confidence to affirm such a thing, even more so if we look at what happened in (iv). Unfortunately we don’t have time until the Wiki Freeze/Giant Jamboree, but we hope be able to redo the survey in order to corroborate what has been raised here or not and more, we would like to see the influence alone of BioMech and how it is going to be assimilated by others audiences"

COLLABORATION
 Our team collaborated with several other iGEM teams this past summer.  In July, our team invited the BU and MIT iGEM teams to our lab where we performed user studies, received feedback on the prototype’s scientific accuracy, and listened to ideas on how to incorporate more of the scientific process into our exhibit.  Users specifically suggested including informational and background videos, adding explicit instructions, and ways to distinguish their own engineered bacteria.  In turn, we observed their iGEM presentations and commented on how each team could improve how they explain concepts in ways that someone with little background in synthetic biology could find interesting and understandable.
 We also communicated with the IONIS iGEM team and, with their permission, incorporated their video introducing synthetic biology and iGEM into our exhibit.

Interaction between the laboratory and the modelling
Lab and Modelling, or Modelling in the Lab?
To save time and work, laboratory work and in silico modelling should interact closely so that the model gives useful insights and the laboratory provides results from experimental set ups to refine the model. Here we want to outline how laboratory work and modelling interacted throughout our project.
Photoinduction
Given the four available light receptors available as BioBricks, LovTAP, Cph8, YcgE/F and Ccas, we wanted to know which one is best suitable for our purpose of detecting sun light. Thus we modeled the activating rates of the different receptors when exposed to sunlight, the photoinduction . This helped us to rule out YcgE/F and Ccas that did not give the desired activation under sunlight. We continued with LovTAP and Cph8 for our decoder.
The photoinduction model was also used to derive the activity of our new fusion protein, UVR8-TeTRDBD to get a grasp on its activation due to sunlight.
Circuit modeling
UVR8 Circuit
We modeled the direct UV-B detection by UVR8-TeTRDBD circuit with the downstream components: the PABA producing enzymes and the pigment to get an idea how much PABA the system can produce at steady state.

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Biotech Bootcamp:
One of our policy team members, along with two of our advisors, attended the Biotech Bootcamp at University of Guelph this past May.
At this event, presentations and panel discussions focused on science policy and communication. There was many valuable discussions about the use of genetically modified (GM) technology, science advocacy, laws and regulations, biotechnology in the developing world, and environmental sustainability. As well, one of our advisors Dr. Trevor Charles spoke about iGEM highlighting the emphasis that the competition puts on human practices as a fundamental aspect of scientific work along with showing Our Video we made during our recruitment process. There also was a public event including the Canadian premier of documentary Food Evolution which was followed by a public discussion on GMOs.
It was really an eye opening experience because the overwhelming message about the importance science communication and how important it is to tell the story of your work before someone else spins it in an undesirable or misconstrued way. This experience drove us to prioritize social media and outreach as one of our main human practices goals for our project.
CSM and Western Conferences:
This year, the University of Waterloo hosted the 67th annual Canadian Society of Microbiologists (CSM) Conference. Dr. Trevor Charles, one of our advisors, was mediating the synthetic biology section of the Conference and invited us to give a presentation during this session. In the presentation, we touched on iGEM, synthetic biology from an undergraduate perspective, our 2016 and 2017 iGEM projects, and the many benefits students receive through undergraduate research experiences.
Our talk was actually so well received that we got an invitation to also speak a the Synthetic Biology Symposium at the Western University later that summer. We were able to bring several members of our team, and we all had a great time hearing about academic and industrial research in synthetic biology, talking to experts in the field, and getting advice on some of the technical issues we were facing in our project. It was also exciting presenting our talk again, and being able to demonstrate the progress we had made since our previous talk at CSM.
A Gem in the Rough
Although we spend a lot of time showing others our final project, we also thought that it might be interesting to show what we do in and out of the lab on a daily basis during our build season: the elusive life of an iGEMer. One of our lab leads Max made a documentary of one 24 hour day during the summer interspersed with interviews from members of all our sub-teams. Check out A Gem in the Rough .

13. Use our app to measure the concentration of mercury ions.
Result
        After we use smart phone application we made to detect its mercury concentration, the result showed that the positive control’s concentration is 0.0160mg/L, when the imitate sample is 0.0158mg/L. The result is close to the real concentration 0.01mg/L. The error may cause by the environmental element.
        What’s important is that this devise can work in the reality water sample while the performance is similar to Mercury standard solution. This demonstrate strongly proved that the devices designed by SCUT-China_A can work in the real world and perform a good performance.

It is important to indicate that although we might have positive results, the use of nisin in a biopatch should be analyzed carefully, mainly because nisin is accepted by the FDA to be used as food preservative. Additionally, we decided to include in our design the signal peptide sequences of the enzyme ChiA74 (spchiA74) and USP45, to secrete the alginate lyase and the microcin in E. coli and the alginate lyase in L. lactis, respectively. Although the spchiA74 is obtained from an enzyme produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, it is useful to secrete ChiA74 in E. coli (Barboza-Corona et al., 2014). In addition, it has been previously reported that the USP45 allows the translocation of proteins in L. lactis ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Groningen ).
Biosensor construction
    Unfortunately, we did not received our Biobricks kit, so we decided to ask for support from the Biosint_Mexico team of the “Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Querétaro”, who provided us with the Biobricks Bba_K1365997, BBa_K649000, Bba_K565004, and Bba_K1365000, for the lasR gene, lasI promoter, microcin and nisin genes, respectively. Because our modules harbor genetic elements not available in the Biobricks collection, i.e. the chiA74p (or BtI-BtIIp), the alginate lyase gene and spchiA74, our efforts are focused on the amplification, cloning and test the functionality of those devices in E. coli previous to the module construction.
Cloning of chiA74 and BtI-BtII promoters (chiA74p, BtI-BtIIp)
    Promoters chiA74p and BtI-BtIIp were amplified obtaining amplicons of ~600 bp and 400 bp, respectively (Figure 1A). Both promoters were cloned into the plasmid pHT3101, which is a shuttle vector with two replication origins, functional in both E. coli and B. thuringiensis (Lereclus et al.). In figure 1B (lane 3)  and 1C (lane 4) we show the release of the chiA74p (~0.6 kbp ) and BtI-BtII (~"

Berkeley,2013,Team:Berkeley#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," for biosynthetic routes for dyeing jeans, we learned that certain species of plants produce indigo under stressed conditions. Below is polygonum tinctorium, an indigo producing plant. In the healthy, green part of the leaf, this plant naturally sequesters a toxic compound produced in plants called indole into a glucosylated form called indican. Indican is soluble and harmlessly stored in the vacuoles of plant cells. However, the plant's behavior changes when it is under stress. The leaf that is turning blue has been sprayed with ethanol, and parts of the plant may have begun to degrade. Though the plant is still producing indican in the vacuoles, a glucosidase enzyme previously isolated away from the indican gains access due to the failure of compartmentalization in the cell, and cleaves the glucose ring off of indican. This produces an unstable intermediate called indoxyl which quickly oxidizes and dimerizes to indigo, turning the leaf blue.
Our Green Pathway to Dye Jeans
Drawing on our knowledge of the indigo chemistry in plants, we believed we could take advantage of the indican production pathway for jeans dyeing. Because indican is soluble, it adheres to jeans and can be mass produced as a dyeing agent. After jeans are coated in the soluble indican, they can then be exposed to a glucosidase similar to the mechanism in stressed plants, producing indigo dyed jeans. This process would circumvent many of the hazardous chemicals used industrially to produce blue jeans.
We aim to establish a pathway in E. coli to use soluble indican to dye jeans. Our pathway begins with indole, a toxic intermediate generated in E. coli as well as plants, and uses a heterologously expressed FMO enzyme to produce indoxyl which would then be taken to indican using a GT or glucosyltransferase enzyme. After using indican to coat cloth as desired, a B-glucosidase enzyme, or GLU, would cleave the sugar from indican and generating indoxyl which oxidizes to blue indigo.

Needed materials: 100 ml TAE buffer, 1gr. agarose, ethidium bromide.
Mix 100 ml. TAE buffer with 1 gr. agarose powder, heat in microwave till the agarose is disolved, let it cool till it can be handled with bare hands, add 10 µl ethidium bromide. Then pour the mixture into a mold containing slots for wells, and let cool.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Set gel into electrophoresis chamber filled with 1X TAE buffer so the wells are covered. 
Mix 5 µl of your PCR reactions/sample with 1 µl 6X loading buffer.
Pipette 5 µl into each well, pour 2-3 µl ladder in some so the size can be seen.
Run at 140 V, for 30-40 min.
Chemocompetent cells
Chemo competens is a way of getting E. coli to be able to take up new DNA, since this cant be done naturally like B. subtilis, then chemocompetent cells have to be made.
Protocol can be found  here
Glycerol stock
Needed materials: a 40% glycerol solution, bacteria of your choice, cryo tubes.
Mix glycerol and bacteria 50/50 in a cryo tube and place in a -80 frezzer till needed.
Making plates
A lot of lab work requires plates in order to produce results, and often you need a special concentration, a unique antibiotic mixed into the plates or a different composition than what is available at the lab you are in. If that is the case, the plate needs to be made from scratch, or somewhat along the way.

After the oxidation ditch, the water moves to the clarifier, which allows remaining solids to settle out of the water and be removed as sludge.
The water finally moves through a UV disinfection chamber to remove any bacteria from the previous treatment steps.  We were particularly interested in this final step of treatment as it meant that any bacteria we added upstream of this step would be removed by the UV disinfection.  Therefore, we felt that our biofilter design would not pose any additional safety threat to the water treatment plant.
The water is then directly released into the Rapidan River, located about 5 miles away from the plant.
Making a Better Biofilter
After touring the plant and talking with Mr. Clements, we felt that our biofilter was a viable solution to the microplastics problem.  We also now knew where best to implement the filter and had gathered parameters for a model-based assessment of our bacteria’s nylon degrading abilities in the plant.
Synthetic Biology Global Awareness and Acceptance Survey Map
As part of our global human practices initiative, we created a survey to gauge knowledge of and sentiment towards synthetic biology. Here's a copy of the survey. We sent this out to every iGEM team, asking them to collect at least 20 responses from the public in exchange for a webbadge.  Fifty-five teams participated, and twenty-one collected 20 results or more.
The main purpose of the survey was to explore the general public’s view of synthetic biology on a regional and demographical basis, as well as to examine and compare their views on specific issues, and how semantics affects these views.  We hope that this information can be used by other iGEM teams, professionals in the field of synthetic biology, and policy makers to help determine more precisely where policy and educational efforts regarding synthetic biology should be targeted
Participants were asked to read the following short paragraph, and then rate their feelings towards synthetic biology:
All living things have genes.  Genes determine how these living things, also known as organisms, look, what they do, and how they function.  In"

When there is nitrate or nitrite, the repression from the Nar system on PyeaR will be relieved due to the binding between the two. On the other hand, some nitrate will be converted into nitric oxide by nitrate reductase. Nitric oxide will bind to the NsrR protein and relieve the repression on PyeaR. As a result, any genes that are downstream of PyeaR will be expressed.

Results
After obtaining the quantitative results of GFP signal intensity using an EnVision® multilabel reader, the fluorescence signal were represented in fluorescence divided by biomass.
Dynamic range Characterization of PyeaR in LB and M9
A. Characterization of PyeaR in LB.
B. Characterization of PyeaR in M9 minimal medium.
*GFP emission measurements were made using an EnVision® multilabel reader. This result was obtained by combining 3 charaterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bars were presented in SEM.
According to A, a plateau was shown starting from the 10 mM concentration point, suggesting that 10 mM nitrate concentration is the saturation point of PyeaR and the dynamic range of PyeaR is shown to be between 0-10 mM in our study. The relative fluorescence level increases 7.21 folds between 0 mM and 10 mM concentrations of nitrate.
According to B, a plateau was shown starting from the 500 μM concentration point, suggesting that 500 μM nitrate concentration is the saturation point of PyeaR and the dynamic range of PyeaR is shown to be between 0-500 μM in our study. The relative fluorescence level increases 3.12 folds from 0 μM and 500 μM nitrate concentrations.

Secondly, because the    means of the $X_1-X_2$ and $Y_1-Y_2$ are not equal to zero, we    need to account for this by calculating the noncentrality    parameter $\lambda$. This is equal to the sum of squares of    the means of the normalized $X_1-X_2$ and $Y_1-Y_2$ variables,    which of course equals (22), corresponding to a scaled    version of the original intercellular distance.
$$     \begin{split}     \lambda & = \Bigg(\frac{x_1-x_2}     {2 \cdot \sqrt{ \mu \cdot \Delta t}}\Bigg)^2     + \Bigg(\frac{y_1-y_2}     {2 \cdot \sqrt{ \mu \cdot \Delta t}}\Bigg)^2     \\ & = \frac{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}     {4 \cdot \mu \cdot \Delta t}     \\ & = \frac{r^{2}_{0}}{4 \cdot \mu \cdot \Delta t} & \;\;\; \text{(22)}     \end{split}     $$
We then    define the standardized variable $\bar{R}^2$ as (23).

Why Use a Worm?
Currently there are effective bacterial systems for the degradation of many toxic by-products, but these bacteria cannot move significant distances in the environment to seek out their bio-degradation substrates.  The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans’ has many advantages:
Chemotaxis Movement-Robust chemotaxis network represents a system that can be engineered for the detection and long-range movement towards environmental toxins
Multi-Cellular=Multiple Processes- As a eukaryote, many processes can be included at the same time in multiple lcoations.
Hardy Organism- Preliminary tests showed C. elegans able to live in pure bitumen (from Oil Sands) for over a week.

Part:BBa_F2620 had been fully characterized with data in partsregistry BBa_F2620 page. It is a composite biobrick with three individual biobricks: pTetR (R0040), LuxR（C0062) and lux pR. Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :
where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four"

The results shows that when the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody was 250                             ng/mL, the optical imaging spot of liquid crystal cell was star-shaped, whose quantity was                             more than that of the non-fixed β2-MG antibody, but the change was not obvious.                             When the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody is above 400 ng/mL, the                             distribution of the optical imaging spot of the liquid crystal cell is similar to the                             phenomena of the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody which is 400 ng/mL.
3. Determination of the concentration of β2-MG nano antibody
Through the experimental results, we could find that as the concentration of antibody                             increased , the crystal molecular orientation is getting more messy, and the bright spots                             gradually enhance in the optical imaging. However, 400ng/mL is the threshold of the                             concentration of β2-MG nano-antibodies. When the concentration of nano-antibodies                             increases again, the bright spots in the liquid crystal imaging did not enhance                             significantly. Therefore, the lowest antibody concentration at 400ng/mL was selected for the                             immobilization of β2-MG on the substrate surface, which could maintain the                             maximum bright spots in the optical imaging background.

General Introduction to Our Projects
This section provides a general background about our projects and highlights our motivation behind them.
What are CRISPR/Cas9 systems?
The CRISPR/Cas9 system was ideated based on bacteria’s defence system. Bacteria capture snippets of invading viruses and create RNA segments to detect and destroy the same or similar viruses. Leveraging on this idea, scientists have devised CRISPR/Cas9 systems to permanently modify genes within organisms.
The CRISPR/Cas9 system involves two main components, the guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 protein. gRNA functions to guide the Cas9 protein to the targeted region whilst the Cas9 protein plays two major roles in gene editing. One is to unzip the DNA at the targeted region to allow the complementary gRNA to bind to it. The other is to generate a double-stranded break at the targeted region of the DNA, which may lead to loss-of-function of a gene.
The region that is cut will then undergo Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR). It is established that NHEJ is more error-prone as compared to HDR. This is because HDR repairs a double-stranded break using a suitable DNA template while NHEJ does not. Thus, in one of our projects, we focused on improving the efficiency of HDR to improve the CRISPR/Cas9 system for specific applications.
This informational video, created by Prof Feng Zhang from McGovern Institute for Brain Research, MIT, clearly explains the principles of CRISPR/Cas9 systems.
Usefulness of CRISPR/Cas9 systems
Why is CRISPR/Cas9 not in clinical practice yet?
The limited efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is arguably the greatest roadblock to the clinical use of CRISPR/Cas9. This can be broadly divided into limitations in the efficacy of cell delivery and the rate of gene editing.
The challenge of delivering the gRNA and Cas9 protein to either all the cells of an organism or a specifically targeted group of cells is a problem that researchers struggle with. The lack of efficient delivery severely restricts the therapeutic effectiveness of CRISPR/Cas9. Similarly, the rate"

Esengul Yildirim
For several years I have been employed at Kluyver laboratory for Biotechnology at the Enzymology section as a supporting staff member on education and research.
To be an integral part of TUDelft’s iGEM supervisor team gives me the unique chance to apply different facets of my own education to this year's interdisciplinary team. Next to this it’s a challenge to use my technical knowledge and distinctive expertise with membrane associated research to support and tutor an inspired group of upcoming synthetic biologists.
In addition, I supervise several Bachelor and Master students that are doing their internship at my department. I'm looking forward to the European Jamboree in Amsterdam and see all the fascinating and challenging work done at iGEM!  See you all there!! ;)
