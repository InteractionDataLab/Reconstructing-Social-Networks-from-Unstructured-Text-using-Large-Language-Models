KU_Leuven,2017,Team:KU Leuven#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," our fourth and final article, we published a quick overview of our scientific results, and future directions.
According to the staff of Eos, every article reached around 1200 readers one week after publication. Therefore, we can conclude that we successfully brought synthetic biology, iGEM, and HEKcite, to a broad public. And that couldn’t make us more proud.
Social Media
Nowadays, we live in a highly connected world, everything is now accessible via the click of a button. In such a scenario, one must mention the power that the internet plays in this equation. The internet is that one tool that facilitates all the magic. Through the internet, one can connect, communicate, buy, sell, reach out, educate, and so much more! However, our focus is not on the internet as a whole, but on Social Media, namely Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These three online platforms have changed the dynamic of interaction and communication between people all over the globe, and have cause an evident impact that could not be denied.
As one of the most important pillars of iGEM is outreach and public engagement, it’s needless to say that social media platforms were our first option going forward! It wasn’t a long wait after our first meeting as a team before we had a Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram page already up and running. News about launching our social media accounts spread like wildfire in the first weeks as we ensured to spread the message all around our family and friends and made sure that they would in turn share our pages! The aim was to get all the people around us, those we know and those we don’t know, to be informed about the amazing iGEM. Over the course of the first weeks since the launch, we introduced the team members, by posting pictures and descriptions so the followers could get a closer glimpse of who we are as a team. As the weeks advance, we would share pictures of our weekly activities, decisions, basically anything worth sharing on our social media accounts.
As we reached July, the real work was about to start. We started posting about our experiments, our daily hours at the office, and most importantly, all of our goofy/fun activities! All throughout the summer, we received tremendous amounts of support and positive feedback from those who followed our journey either through Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. The accounts also helped us connect better with other teams, facilitating communication and collaboration with teams from all over the globe. Lastly, we were contacted by a PhD student, completing his degree in philosophy. He found about iGEM through our Facebook account and has contacted via Facebook"

I am currently a Year 2 student majoring in Biochemistry. I was a amember of HKUST 2012 iGEM team. Joining iGEM when I was a freshman was not easy but I am sure glad that I did because it has given me enriching experiences that I would never get by sitting in lectures. One idea that has been incorporated to me by joining iGEM is that synthetic biology is not something you just see in a blockbuster movie, it is very close by, and with it we can actually do something great to help humanities.

The easiest way to achieve functionality is by just ""training"" the input of the network. By freezing all the weights and allowing only the input to be modyfied iteratively, a optimized sequence is obtained. Results have been disentchanting.
Split Polymerase
Dickinson-PACE:
For implementation of the LuxAB reporter system in the Dickinson strains, golden gate cloning was implemented. The resulting strains had LuxAB integrated directly behind gene III. This should allow us to investigate the phage infection directly correlated to the LuxAB expression. These slightly different versions were transformed into S2060 cells for use in the PACE apparature. Another change of the experimental design was implemented using MP6 instead of MP1. MP6 was transformed into the S2060 used for the Dickinson transformations. This change was made in order to generate more mutations than before. On top of that, MP6 allows to implement less genetic drift, as well as no stepping stones for the evolution. The general design of the PACE experiment itself was held constant, including strain swapping after three and four and a half days. Currently we have no wash out and no phage contamination in the turbidostat according to the phage detection PCR.
Reporter system:
The first testing of the S2060 + MP6 + alternative Dickinson-APs showed only ""special"" results. Generally, we can detect a luminescence signal. However, the signal of the phage supernatant is higher than the signal of the infected cells. Beyond that, the turbidostat displayed an higher luminescence signal in both lagoons. Based on previous results from Jan, we suppose that a phage titer of 10hoch10 is required for a sufficient ""real-time"" readout. Due to that, ""real-time"" PACE will not be possible. Based on other results from different LuxAB testing, where LuxAB was tested under the psp-AR2 promotor, one can suppose that leaky expression of the T7 promotor could be the reason. In contrast to the T7 promotor, the psp-AR2 promotor did not show any background signal. This underlines the previous hypothesis.

iGEM London Boot Camp
Click here to learn more about our introduction week to iGEM
This June University College London, Birkbeck and London Biohackspace attended a jointly organised iGEM boot camp featuring BioBrick making in the lab,     presentations from key iGEM team advisors as well as Skype talks with iGEM Headquarters representatives, DIY spectrophotometers, wiki design and extra lab     skills.
The purpose of this successful week-long event was to kickstart all team projects and bring all members to the same page in our iGEM journey. The knowledge     and experience acquired by everyone enabled the individual teams to start making the most of their summer work which is now underway. All participants     benefited from laboratory induction sessions, and smaller groups divided into specialised tracks.
The DIY track group assembled a functional spectrophotometer at the London Biohackspace using 3D printed components, while the Software track group learnt     the basic progrsmming required in developing the iGEM wiki and submitting BioBricks to the registry. Finally, the extra lab group received insights into     the most efficient cutting edge cloning technologies relevant to iGEM work.
The boot camp culminated in the Mini Jamboree where all different institution teams presented their work over the past week to the rest of the attendants     including highschoolers, and the track groups also presented their specific projects. The networking opportunities throughout the boot camp strengthened     our teams, and wrapped up with a fantatic snacks and drinks sleection after the jamboree!

In a separate experiment, we also attempted to grow Ganoderma lucidum (a strain of fungus) directly on Arthrospira platensis (a species of cyanobacteria). A separate flask of Anabaena provided the oxygen supply. Unfortunately, we have thus far not been successful in showing measurable Ganoderma growth. We believe the Arthrospira culture which was being used as feedstock for the Ganoderma may have had too much water, and the Anabaena culture may also have been too dilute. Future experimentation will hopefully yield more optimal results (one of our mentors, Chris, was indeed successful in growing mycelia on Arthrospira.)

However, because styrene is a thermoplastic, it is easily recycled in case of a stronger market pull. Picchioni was suprised that biological styrene production was feasible.

""If you can make me a few kilo's, you can come back to me!""
Prof. Dr. A. J. M. Driessen
In order to gain more insight into strain optimization, we met with professor Driessen, head of the molecular microbiology department at the University of Groningen. We discussed the best ways to implement and optimize our design. Driessen provided us with many helpful suggestions. For example, we went from the concept of two separate coexisting yeast strains (one cellulolytic, one producing styrene), to one yeast strain doing both processes simultaneously. Furthermore, we discussed metabolic engineering to gain higher yields, for example multiple knock-outs which we could implement. Finally, Driessen proposed to use the CRISPR-Cas9 technique to genomically integrate our genes of interest, instead of using several plasmids. Moreover, Driessen connected us to important contacts as well as providing us with additional laboratory space.
His advice brought us from two seperate yeast strains to one yeast strain performing both processes.
Prof. Dr. B. Poolman (1st June 2018)
One of our team members visited professor Poolman of the Enzymology research group to discuss the possible effects of styrene toxicity in our design. During literature study we discovered the existence of styrene exporters and we wanted to discuss whether expression of such an exporter in S. cerevisiae would be beneficial for our design and styrene yield. Poolman pointed out that expressing prokaryotic proteins in eukaryotes is extremely difficult, but pointed towards the Pdr5 export protein and ABC transporters. Furthermore he suggested performing an evolution experiment in S. cerevisiae to decrease the sensitivity of our yeast towards styrene.

Week 1
Bioinformatics brain storming week: During this fist summer week of work, during the summer, I asked wet labs colleagues about their needs and ideas with the aim of making (to make) a list of useful bioinformatics analyses.
I also worked in the development of a Perl program to meet the need of the V sublab of searching on E.coli's proteome, before starting their wet work.
Week 2
I met with my supervisor (Antonio J. Pérez) and we worked in selecting what ideas, from the wet labs’, were more interesting. Moreover, we decided to perform other parallel studies which could be helpful, always keeping in mind the two-months time we had before the European Jamboree.
I also started a bibliographic research to check all the reported information which was related to the issues we were determined to work on.
Week 3
Understanding the Tn7 system. I downloaded sequences and looked for useful software to start getting results. I found several problems when downloading genetic sequences and managing them. My supervisor helped me to deal with all genetic databases in an efficient way.
Week 4
Once, several multi sequence alignments were done, I started with all the project dockings. I ran a lot of them and I selected the best results. Before running all dockings, I needed pdf files of all the proteins under study so I had to run lots of times a homology modelling server. I ended up with a bunch of results which I analysed before starting to perform dockings. I asked my supervisor for help on how to deal with so many results.
Week 5
I chose a molecule viewer and learned how to use the command line. At first, I started working with RasMol viewer but I changed to Jmol due to the fact that Ras"

Figure 2. Optical Densities were analysed each hour after culture inoculation.
As we can see, the growth is much lower in M63 than in LB medium.
✵ For LB medium, we obtained 0.8 OD after 5h.
✵ For M63 medium, 0.8 OD is obtained much later.
→ So, entire process of production goes on 2 days in LB medium and 3 days in M63 medium.

LABORATORY WORK
1.Cloning
To achieve our Curdlan production by Escherichia coli, it was necessary to integrate our interest gene crdS controlled by the promoter OsmY in two types of plasmids:
✵ in pSB1C3 plasmid for the characterization of our biobricks
• OsmY promoter only
• crdS gene only
• promoter and gene
✵ in pUC for production steps
• promoter and gene
3.Curdlan production
The production is done on two steps (in two Erlenmeyer flasks) in order to scale up bacterial biomass and then, to obtain a lot of Curdlan.
In stationary phase, we proceed to a temperature change in order to minimize the persistent bacterial growth, the Curdlan being a secondary metabolite.
2.Transformation
These plasmids are then transferred into competent bacteria E. coli DH5α by transformation. The selection of transformed bacteria is done by chloramphenicol resistance for pSB1C3 plasmid and by ampicillin resistance for pUC plasmid.
To check that cloning work, plasmids are digested with EcoR1 and Pst1 restriction enzymes.
Figure 3:Agarose electrophoresis gel
Figure 3. As we can see, the band corresponding to the piece of linearized plasmid containing OsmY promoter and crdS gene is a bit higher than the band corresponding to the piece of linearized plasmid containing crdS gene only.
4.Purification and Quantitative analysis
To obtain Curdlan, cells were chemically destroyed by NaOH and many centrifugations.
Curdlan purification was performed by neutralization after adding acetic acid.
Quantitative analysis was done before and after purification to compare and eliminate non significant measures (background signal).
N.B. Also, we use a polarimeter to characterize our Curdlan molecule"

Apoptosis
We used Part BBa_K124017, Bacteriophage Lysis Cassette, created by the Brown'08 iGEM team. The bacteriophage cassette includes the S105 protein (Holin), R protein (Endolysin), and Rz protein, all of which act in combination to lyse the cell. We attached the cassette to a promoter for it to be activated to produce proteins for cell lysis.
Holin is a small membrane protein that produces holes in the membrane. This particular Holin protein contains the mutant S gene. Part BBa_K124014, Bacteriophage Holin Gene pS105, was also made by the Brown'08 iGEM team. The S105 gene has the initial 6 base pairs at the beginning of the wild type S gene sequence removed, which causes cell lysis to be induced at a faster rate than the wild type.
R protein is an endolysin that degrades the peptidoglycan cell wall, resulting in lysis of the cell by cleavage of the cell wall.
Rz protein, a periplasmic protein, carries out the final step of the cell lysis. The mechanism still has yet to be elucidated. However, it is clear that it is crucial to the function of the cassette.
When the Bacteriophage Lysis Cassette is activated, it will lyse the cell walls to release chitin that is produced via a slow mechanism.

Wiki Workshop
We collaborated with iGEM Team Linkoping Sweden in their Dear Diary initiative. We recorded interesting and fun things happened inside and outside the lab. We then sent it to Team Linkoping Sweden, who collected the diaries from each team and compiled them into a book/document. Through this initiative, we were able to showcase our excitement and interesting work for iGEM with the wider public.
We collaborated with iGEM Team IlT-Madras in their Language Project Initiative, aiding them in creating several synthetic biology educational videos in various languages. We received the English script of the video from IlT-Madras, translated in into different languages, as well as recording the audio of the script. Due to the diversity of our team, we were able to help them with 6 different language versions of the videos, namely, “Introduction to Synthetic Biology” in Mandarin, Bosnian, Korean, and “DNA and RNA” in Arabic.
Mandarin: Introduction to Synthetic Biology
Bosnian: Introduction to Synthetic Biology
Korean: Introduction to Synthetic Biology
We held a Wiki Workshop for our iGEM team that covers the basics of web development from HTML and CSS to Javascript. We also covered the basics of a good design, a good website, and a good visual identity. In addition to that, we went over the iGEM Wiki rules and resources.
All of our iGEM team were in attendance of this workshops in addition to a few members from iGEM VIT both over skype and in real life. Here are the contents of the workshop, that we want to make available to all iGEM teams in the future to make use of when creating their Wiki’s:

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," syringe pumps were used to gradually push a syringe to dispense at a constant rate in Neptune’s project, they were able to demonstrate a high degree of control with their hardware platform. This gave us the confidence to reuse their hardware platform for our control syringe system in TERRA.
The control syringes are used to actuate valves on the TERRA Adapter, a predesigned chip for our system, enabling the system to selectively dispense outputs onto the vessel. The control syringe system can be broken down to units, with each unit containing a servo motor, 12mL syringe, 3D printed piston, and mounting board. These units can then be combined together in a modular fashion depending on how many are required for your experiment. Every output from your microfluidic chip requires 2 control syringe units, one for dispensing and the other for waste. For example, a 3 output microfluidic chip experiment requires 6 control syringe units. Its recommended to setup a multi-unit system when first setting up TERRA in order to eliminate to need to add further control syringe units for future experiments.

Controlling Our Hardware
To control the syringe pumps and the XY translational stage, we designed a back-end software framework in which actuates the servo and stepper motors responsible for movement of the pumps and XY-stage.
The XY translational stage moves through a set of timing belts and pulleys, where the pulleys are attached to the shafts of stepper motors. The timing belts are connected to horizontal and vertical 3D printed components of the plate support, so when the motors actuate, the pulleys rotate and the attached components move along their respective axes. The motors are also controlled by a motor driver, which allows for microstepping. Microstepping divides the motion, or steps, of a stepper motor into smaller divisions, allowing smoother and more accurate actuation. We incorporate DRV8825 motor drivers to our XY-stage system.
The syringe pumps exist in three states: origin, open, and closed. Each of these states are associated with a specific pulse-width-modulation (PWM) values, which dictates angle the arm of the servo motor. The servo motor is connected to a 3D printed arm, which then moves the piston of the syringe. This then actuates a valve on a microfluidic chip.
The stepper and servo motors are controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560, which is connected in the configuration shown below:

SCU_China,2015,Team:SCU China#Test_-_-_TEXT.html,"3) Sequence Targeting
Considered that E. pangu will produce acetyl-CoA when taking CO2 as substrate, we chose pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex as knockout target in case that the natural process of acetyl-CoA producing will affect the reliability of our project. After PDH knockout, if the microbe are still alive, it is demonstrated that they have gained the ability to fix CO2 like autotrophs. Because without PDH, the normal metabolic pathway from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is cut off, the prokaryotic cell can only utilize the acetyl-CoA comes from carbon fixation to finish citric acid cycle. However, it’s quite difficult to regulate metabolism in microbe since there are huge amounts of pathways related with each other. After searching for papers about metabolism, we found that we can not exactly foretell any influence of PDH knockout before hands on experiments.
In order to knock out PDH efficiently, we targeted two conserved domains of this complex: the 5’ terminal of subunit E1 (oligo1)(Fig. 6), and a crucial motif DHRXXDG of subunit E2 (oligo76) which plays a key role in constructing the complex. We also chose oligo64 randomly as control to appraise the efficiency of targeting. The target oligos are designed by 2013 iGEM team Freiburg.
Fig. 6. Structure of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 component  from Escherichia coli at 1.85 A resolution.
4. PDH Knockout
According to our project, we will detect if we have successfully knocked out the gene of subunits E1 and E2 by comparing the length of the PCR results of pre-knockout bacteria and after-knockout bacteria. First we found out the proper annealing temperature for E1 and E2 PCR (64 oC). The E1 and E2 PCR results of pre-knockout bacteria are shown as follows:
FFig. 7. E1 and E2 PCR results of pre-knockout bacteria. the length of E1 and E2 are 1718bp and 1878bp, respectively.
Unfortunately, the gene circuit for Cas9 expression was not constructed successfully. As a consequence, we didn’t get the PCR result of after-knockout bacteria. We hope we could finish this in our future work.

We also transformed E. coli with the synthesized parts, this time done properly with IPTG and X-gal on the agar plates - only few blue colonies were shown indicating that transformation was highly successful. Colonies were selected, used to make overnight cultures, from which plasmid DNA was isolated via the plasmid miniprep protocol. The C2-P22 repressor was ligated with  the Pveg_C1-lambda_consensusRBS construct, using both single-operator and triple-operator variants. Likewise the RFP reporter was ligated with the Pveg_C2-P22_consensusRBS construct with both single- and triple-operator variants. The RFP-ligation allows for straightforward visual screening as successful ligations are indicated by red colonies. The repressor-ligations are being screened via colony-PCR.
We used the isothermal PCR kit for the first time and discovered a new problem - the PCR product contains protein-bound DNA which prevents visualization on agarose gels, and may pose a problem for transformation if DNA is not free. DNA purification is required, however, fortunately dissociation of protein-bound DNA may be induced via 1/10 dilution of the PCR product. This is promising as we would expect a similar dilution in our final prototype, we expect that the strong association between DNA and protein will not pose a problem.
The TwistDx RPA isothermal PCR kit was originally designed for rapidly amplifying short (<400bp) amplicons, unfortunately for our purposes we require amplification products to be closer to 1kbp in size.  According to literature (Piepenburg et al. 2006) it is possible to amplify sequences of up to 1.5kbp using RPA. We are attempting to optimize conditions so that we obtain longer amplicons. We may adjust parameters such as the concentration of primers, magnesium-acetate, dNTP, and ATP, as well as incubation temperature - with the aim of increasing the elongation time while providing enough resources (i.e. ATP) to allow for a longer reaction time"

We decided to locate TEV Protease gene sequence into pET45-b because our essential want to control protein is TEV Protease. And we decided clonning DAMP-Pexiganan gene sequence into pColA vector.  For clonning DAMP-Pexiganan protein sequence into pColA vector we toke out our gene with NotI enzyme from PSB1C3-DAMP-Pexiganan plasmid. We did ligation with pET45-b vector which digested the same enzyme. Following ligation, the resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 competent bacteria.
We did colony PCR in order to check the accuracy of cloning with using pColA forward and pColA reverse primers. If the clonning resulted negative expecting band would be 192 bp. On the other hand if we succesfully clonned these part, expected band would be 908 bp.
After colony PCR consequences we have put the positive resulted clonnings 16 hours liquid culture  after that we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep plasmid izolation method. We make cutcheck to our attained plasmid DNAs for put a second control step. Our restriction enzymes those we used are XbaI and SpeI.
pColA- DAMP-PEXIGANAN/pET45-TEV PROTEASE COTRANSFORMATION
After we clonning DAMP-Pexiganan gene sequence into pColA plasmid and TEV Protease gene sequence into pET45-b for transformate these both two plasmids into same BL21 bacteria we did cotransformation. After cotransformation process we put bacterias at 37C for 16 hours incubation. End of 16 hours as a result we did not see any bacteria colony over agar plate.
We retried several times this cotransformation process but with these tryings we havent seen any bacteria colony on our agar plates.
TEV protease Activity Control:
After the negative results obtained from cotransformation experiements we designed a new experimental apparatus to demonstrate TEV Protease's breaking or separator effect to DAMP-Pexiganan molecules linker site. We  firstly make broth culture secondly put incubation at 37C for 13 hours bacterias which contain pET45-DAMP-Pexiganan and pET45-TEV Protease plasmids. For inducing protein production we added 1mM IPTG into medium at 13rd hour. Next we left these incubation"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," in the chromatographic column. In this case, different systems are in use, for example the highly specific and strong streptavidin-biotin-bond or the interaction between chitin-binding domains and chitin. When the cell lysate is loaded onto the column, the target protein will bind to the beads and all other proteins and cell fragments etc. will flow through the column. Afterwards, the target protein has to be eluted. For this, different methods can be used, for example by protease cleavage sides between the target protein and the tag or by loading a ligand onto the column which has a higher binding affinity than the tag itself. Also, harsh changes of the buffer condition like pH or salt concentration are used to elute proteins from affinity purification columns.
Workflow of the common procedure of an affinity purification process.
For purification overall it is desirable to have as few purification steps as possible because in every step a certain amount of the target protein gets lost, so that the yield of the purification system decreases dramatically (Mersha and England, 1997). Additionally, the tag has to be removed from the target, which might also need conditions harmful for the target or lead to a loss of the target.
Biotinylation of Silicon
The biotinylation of different surfaces is an important step in the production of materials useful for streptavidin-affinity-tags. One way is the biotinylation of proteins like BSA on their free amine-residues by covalent bond of the hydroxysuccinimide ester group of N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimide-Biotin. Alternately it is possible to biotinylate other surfaces like silicon oxide or glass with biotin if they contain free amine-residues on the surface. For this purpose, it is necessary to hydroxylate the surface for example with piranha acid (3:1 H2SO4:H2O2) and then treat the hydroxylated surface with APTES (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) (Acres et al., 2012).
Hydroxylation of a silicon surface with piranha acid and treatment with APTES do get free amine-residues on the surface, followed by biotinylation with NHS-biotin.
The APTES contains silicon oxide residues that can bind covalently to the silicon hydroxide. The APTES also contains the amine-residues on which the NHS-biotin can bind to biotin"

A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Human Practice#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," food production since generating genetically modified crops can provide protection from pathogens. Besides fewer insecticides and other chemicals are needed. Another aspect in generating GM food is to modify the nutritional value of the food. One example is the so called “Golden Rice” that has a higher concentration of vitamin A than normal rice.
Green genetic engineering is not only a scientific issue, but also a political, social and commercial one. That is why our project addresses the populace. It is an important issue for almost everybody in the population and it is a really present and much debated topic.  In Germany a lot of research is done in the field of green genetic engineering. However, the step to the application of GM food is still difficult. That is why the iGEM TU Munich Team wants to inform people about genetic engineering in general and to moderate the concerns about it. Besides we want to lay the foundations for a new generation of functional food by producing iGEM’s first and finest SynBio Beer.
School Visit
On July 24th, two of us visited the Joseph-Bernahrt-Gymnasium to give exciting talks about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. In addition students could get their hands dirty trying to reveal some of the genetic secrets of bananas, pineapples and ""gummi bears"".
Public Relations
Throughout the entire project we used different media channels to inform the general public. Our cooperation partner was Laborwelt.de. In addition we kept our followers up to date using a variety of social media.

USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#ConceptualFramework#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," activator of D, and repressor of B. B is a repressor of C. C is a repressor of D. D is a repressor of A and activator of B. But we also have repressor and activator molecules in the system. A has a repressor, B has an activator, C has both, but if the repressor is stronger than the activator, that is, in presence of both C is repressed. D doesn’t have an outside input.
So what are the states of the system? What if the A activator is present? And if all inducers and repressors are present? If we wanted to represent these with differential equations there would be so many parameters and variables, with so many equations that analysing or simulating would be true hell, even if it’s possible. A boolean model is easier to represent and can even give you a way to simplify your system.
Stochastic Models
Stochastic models are a little bit different in comparison with the deterministic models. The systems here are described by a function of probabilities, so their variables have a wide range variability considering one same input. A good example of this kind of model is the 2016 ETH Zurich team . For this kind of model, we will briefly adress two approaches: Thermodynamics and kinetics.
In the thermodynamic approach in stochastic models the focus is not the variation of a variable in terms of others, but describing the relations between the activators and repressors of the circuit. Then there’s a biophysical description of the system, where you use a stochastic model to determine the expression in each state (With the repressors/activators connected or not). To build this model, the first step, as always, is to design a good representation of your system, evidencing every state of the circuit with its inducers/repressors. Each state has its probability and level of expression, where the sum of the probabilities is 1 and the sum of the product of probability and expression is the total expression in the system. It can give you the expression of your whole system, considering a quasi-equilibrium state.
The other approach is using kinetic models, where you describe your system in terms of reactions, used to form mass balance equations for you to simulate your system. Differently from thermodynamical models, kinetic models can be described in terms of variables, like time.
Stochastic modeling can be very helpful to make you better understand the behaviour of your system, since most of times biological systems have stochastic behaviours. However, it's harder to work with a complex problem, where you"

PROOF OF CONCEPT
Neptune (feat. HEK 293)
Putting Biology in Our Chips: Part 1
On our first visit to the MIT iGEM team's lab, we were testing a device with an input, and output, and a pair of valves surrounding cell traps in between. The design and fabrication of this device utilized our Neptune user interface, and proves it is capable of designing and manufacturing microfluidic devices for lab use. In the experiment (as further detailed on the collaborations page), we pulled ethanol solution, buffer solution, and cells through our microfluidic chip. In order to flow these liquids, we opened the (by default closed) valves with our servo-syringe combination pumps, utilizing our hardware and firmware in the process. The successful valve operation proves the proper functioning of our fluid controlling hardware, and the firmware which controls. After flowing cells through, we detached the microfluidic device from the control hardware (shutting the valves), and were able to see masses of HEK293 cells moving inside the valved off segment of the chip. Unfortunately, this evidence was only caught by eye and not on camera. However, we did capture images of the device under the microscope seen below.
Putting Biology in Our Chips: Part 2
Our second visit with the MIT iGEM team occurred within a week of the first and iterated on the previous design, highlighting the rapid prototyping made possible with the Neptune microfluidic workflow. This prototyping could have occurred even faster, as Neptune's the design and fabrication procedures take less than half a workday to complete, but both team's busy iGEM schedules were not that flexible. This design removed the controlling valves and pumps from the previous design, and replaced the cell traps with a diamond chamber meant to slow fluid flow at it's relatively wide center, allowing the HEK293 to attach to our device. Seen below, we captured evidence of the cells surviving and starting to multiple inside of our device."

In einem Essay, das auf einer Umfrage in der Heidelberger Fußgängerzone fußt und zum Erfolg des Heidelberger iGEM-Projekts beitragen soll, versuchen sie, den amerikanischen und japanischen Studenten zu erläutern, weshalb es in Deutschland mit der Akzeptanz für Gentechnik noch immer so holprig vorangeht.
Die Heidelberger Nachwuchswissenschaftler wollen sich also keineswegs nur im Erfolg ihrer Forschung sonnen. Nicht nur, dass sie die biotechnischen Dinge mit ihren selbstgewählten Begriffen wie ""Killerbakterien"" und ""Beutestamm"" beim Namen nennen, sie beweisen mit ihrer ethischen Reflexion am Ende auch den grundsätzlichen Willen zur Verantwortungsübernahme. Von welcher Elite sonst könnte man das heute schon uneingeschränkt behaupten?

06.06.2015 2 Slides were prepared (new iRIf slide [i4], slide 287): Each with 2 stamps: 1 stamp 40ug/ml bBSA (antibody stamp), 1 stamp 50ug/ml His-GFP (Dia Chip stamp without antibody). Slides were only plasmaactivated and then stamped. Blocked for a few hours: pipetted 1 ml BSA(125ug/ml) on each slide and put on rotator. They were stored in PBS at 4° to be measured on next day.
07.06.2015
Slide 287 was measured. When chamber was flooded airbubbles stuck at the end of the stamps. Slide was additionally blocked with the backside of a pdms flowcell. After this no air bubbles occured (but probably the pdms flowcell pulled of some (or a lot) of the stamped protein). No iRIf signal for the StrepCy5 to bBSA stamp binding could be observed. Signal for anti-GFP/GFP binding (DIA-Chip stamp) was good. Plate reader after the measurement confirmed that StrepCy5 bound only slightly to the (probably largely pulled off) bBSA stamp. Plate reader showed very little unspecific binding of StrepCy5 to the GFP/antiGFP stamp.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," Conference is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Quorum Sensing
For our Mosiacoli project, we were looking for molecular systems that allow orthogonal cell-to-cell communication in order to implement connected XOR logic gates . We decided to exploit the quorum sensing systems LuxI/LuxR, LasI/LasR, and RhlI/RhlR in order to achieve the required orthogonal cell-to-cell communication. We developed a model for these cellular information processing. Even though the corresponding inducer molecules are commercially available and the systems often used, in particular in iGEM projects (e.g. pLux (BBa_R0062) , ' Top 10 Most used promoters ' with 246 uses), potential crosstalk activity between the different systems may be a severe problem (e. g. Tokyo_Tech 2013 , Peking University 2011 ).
In order to address this challenge, we measured a) a given promoter with its corresponding regulator and a different inducer molecule, b) a given promoter with an unspecific regulator and a particular inducer, c) a given promoter with both regulator and inducer being unspecific, and always included the correct combination of inducer molecule, regulator and promoter as a positive control. This gives in total 27 possible combinations. The output was assessed via sfGFP and measured in terms of fluorescence on microtiter-plate scale.
Figure 1 Each quorum sensing system is based on three components: a signaling molecule, a regulatory protein and a promoter. These elements are here ordered into three layers. Cross-talk evaluation can be done by comparing all combinations of those three elements. After collecting the experimental data of all possible pathways, we modeled their influence.
Summary of experimental results regarding quorum sensing
The following matrices serve as an overview summarizing the most significant results of our experiments to characterize crosstalk on different levels.  On the horizontal top row we see the three different inducer molecules (3OC12-HSL, 3OC6-HSL, C4-HSL). In the top left corner we see the quorum sensing promoter used for all the experiments summarized in this matrix. On the vertical axis we see the three regulators ( LuxR, LasR, RhlR ).  These matrices are giving an overview of the experimental results conducted in relation with quorum sensing and crosstalk. The graph shown in each matrix on the very top left describes the situation where the correct autoinducer molecule has bound the corresponding regulator and"

What do you think of humanity?
This is a common question that human beings have long sought to answer. And answer may vary.  According to LONGMAN dictionary, humanity refers to,
“the state of being human rather than an animal or machine. For example, kindness, respect and sympathy towards others.”
In the age of science and technology, people are getting more and more involved in their own business. Meanwhile, the society they are connected with is becoming limited to only a small group of people consisting their family and work partners. Moreover, their concerns are becoming more personal and less global.
In other words, humanity is losing its position in human life.
Tokyo_Tech team has put its effort on producing E.coli with humanity,
hoping this to be awakening call for all of those who are forgetting their state of being human….

Fig.4 Highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation with Spychatcher and Spytag.
We used this feature of Spytag and Spycatcher to design a handy tool for protein purification. In the magnetic bacterium AMB-1, Spycatcher-Mms13 fusion protein is expressed and the Mms13 part can tightly associate with the Magnetosome. As a result, the Spycatcher in the fusion protein is anchored in the Magnetosome, which can be isolated from AMB-1 bacterial through sonication and centrifugation. Due to fast growing and easy genetic engineering of E. coli we utilize it to produce recombinant proteins of interest with a Spytag at either the N- or C- terminus. To easily release a captured recombinant protein, we add a cleaving site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease between the protein of interest and Spytag. Now the isolated magnetosome linked by Spycatcher can be used to specifically bind to the Spytag tagged recombinant protein in bacterial lysate of E. coli. After Spytag and Spycatcher form an irreversible covalent bond via spontaneous isopeptide linkage, they can be brought down together with the Magnetosome in a magnetic field. Extensive and stringent washing can be applied to remove proteins of nonspecific binding and the protein of interest can be released by cleavage of TEV protease.
Fig.5 Steps to purify protein in a new way
One caveat in the design above is that the TEV protease is still present in the final elution of the recombinant protein. The following two strategies can be used to circumvent this problem.
First, in the design shown above, we can express a TEV protease-Mms13 fusion protein in AMB-1; thus, the TEV protease can be easily removed after it fulfills its task. Second, we can use a self-cleavable sequence, intein, to replace the TEV site. In this case, the recombinant protein can be released by DTT(DL-Dithiothreitol)-mediated cleavage.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria present in open wounds, were examined. Genes encoding the bacteriocins were found and codon optimized, in order to create a BioBrick part containing only the bacteriocin gene. We also created hybrid bacteriocins in order to test if the hybrid showed similar, inhibited or better effect when combined. The use of bacteriocins as new antimicrobial components are of great interest when used in local treatment. In addition it seems like resistance is rarely developed towards bacteriocins. This idea is supported by professor Frank Møller Arrestrup .

The Purification of Bacteriocins
To purify our bacteriocins, we used the IMPACT method (Intein Mediated Purification with an Affinity Chitin-binding Tag). The IMPACT method has the ability to purify native proteins in a single chromatographic step without the use of proteases. We use the IMPACT vector pTXB1 in order to fuse our bacteriocin gene with an intein tag embedded in the pTXB1 plasmid that allow affinity purification. We add IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) to induce the expression of our intein-bacteriocin fusion. The intein-bacteriocin protein is then extracted by use of French press that disrupt the bacterial cell"

SUSTC-Shenzhen-B,2012,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-B#week 5#8_-_-_TEXT.html," can’t promise the efficiency of both enzymes are high enough. So we probably should spend more time on digestion next time.
After the discussion, we did the ligament（connection）again. We ligase GFP, RFP and the plasmid together with the system we used before. Two sets of ligaments were conducted: 1. connecting GFP and the plasmid at first, then connecting the product with RFP (mentioned as 2-fragments scheme later); 2. Connecting GFP, RFP, and the plasmid at the same time (mentioned as 3-fragments scheme).
8.28.2012
We’ve already did the 2-fragments and 3-fragments schemes yesterday. We need to transfer the artificial plasmid into the body of bacteria and let the E.coli grow.
8.29.2012
This morning, we took the petri dish out to see the colonies. There are many colonies growing on all the dishes which is not good news to us because it means this colonies doesn’t contain the vector we wanted. The plasmid may not contain GFP and RFP at all. We don’t know why the experiment failed again. So we decided to check whether the problem came from those two different kinds of enzymes we used.
This time, we also did the 2-fragments and 3-fragments scheme connections at the same time. In order to ensure the efficiency of the restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase, we used only one kind of enzyme to digest and make sure the reaction time is long enough. We also did a control experiment to see whether the connection is successful. If the negative control grows well, the digestion is not successful.
8.30.2012
Today’s work is transformation. The process itself is not very difficult, but there are a lot of details we have to pay attention to. We did yesterday’s connection again and repeated the transformation.
All of us dreamed that the petri dish will give us hope.
8.31.2012
Biology laboratory is a place where strange things always happen.
We did two parallel experiments with the same condition and reaction system, but we get totally different results.
We are confused by the results and can’t find an acceptable explanation. It is doubtful what should be done next. So we only did a PCR experiment to check the results.
As we predicted, it’s failed again!

Marcos Garcia-Ojeda, a professor for the School of Natural Sciences has provided us with his insight and intellectual knowledge throughout the whole project. He has graciously provided his lab space to the team and taught us proper lab techniques and protocols. He stressed communication between each other is necessary to make sure the project is running smoothly. Finally, he has helped us in finalizing our project idea to make sure we had decided on a project that we would enjoy, as well as ensure we were trained properly in lab procedures.
Wei-Chun Chin, a bioengineering professor for the School of Engineering, who has helped us in developing the project ideas and process during the brainstorming sessions early in our project considerations. During the brainstorming sessions his knowledge has guided us towards a project that would be appealing to the mass.
Financials
We want to thank School of Engineering and School of Natural Sciences. They have graciously helped us out in funding for our laboratory supplies. We want to specifically like to thank Dean Hirleman and Dean Meza for giving us the opportunity recalling from last semester that we had to pitch the idea of forming a UC Merced iGEM team. Without their help and the help of the school now of the experiments we done in the laboratory would be possible.
The registration for both the team registration and the team members regional jamboree attendance fee has been funded by the Associated Students of the University of California Merced (ASUCM). ASUCM is here to help the students by promoting the enhancement of the academic benefits and opportunities offered for the  continues of students at UC Merced.

The Departement of Microbiology at Oregon State University, specifically the Giovannoni Lab has provided us with Methylophilales bacterium HTCC2181.It is an Isolate of OM43, a cluster of one of the most abundant beta-Proteobacteria in coastal marine 16S clone libraries. Amy Carter has been the logistics person whom we have spoken to about receiving the bacteria and deserves a special thanks.
UC Davis iGEM team has helped us by providing a lot of insightful knowledge as they are an experienced team. They also pointed us towards the Gibson Assembly Method and said because we are are a rookie team, we should establish little milestones to characterize success.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and"

Rationale and Aim
Biosensors, synthetic systems designed to detect and respond to a target analyte, are a common application of synthetic biology. However, the production and screening of multiple biosensor system variants is hindered by the inefficiency and specificity of the gene assembly techniques used. The production of circuit variants is important in biosensor production, as sensitivity to target molecules must be tuned.
Aim: To develop a multicellular biosensor development platform which utilises cell-mixing, as opposed to genetic re-engineering, to construct biosensor variants.
Background Information
Human Practices Quotes:
""Modularity would be a really useful aspect"" - Dr Karen Polizzi, Imperial college - London “Each generation of scientists keep reinventing the wheel” - Dr Martin Peacock, biosensors developer
Biosensor Development. When developing biosensors, it would be useful to test multiple variants of a circuit. This is especially important in the fine-tuning of biosensor behaviour as this requires the screening of many variants to find appropriate activation thresholds for a system. Apart from the initial detection unit, many constructs used in synthetic biology based biosensors are reusable between different biosensor systems, such as fluorescent protein coding sequences or devices which amplify signals. However, these parts rarely get reused. For example, the Cambridge iGEM team (2009) developed a library of sensitivity tuners which were able to convert polymerase per second inputs to a desired polymerase per second output, allowing a biosensor developer control over the sensitivity of their systems to various target analyte concentrations. This project was impressive enough to win the competition. However, despite the parts' clear usefulness, there is no documentation that the parts have ever been successfully reused within the iGEM competition. We suggest that this is due to the difficulties"

Abstract：Heat shock proteins (Hsps) have been known as a class of proteins that perform a fundamental role in protecting plants against abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity, extremely low and high temperatures. However, rare Hsps have been reported and little consideration has been given to the role of Hsps in rice in response to abiotic stress. Therefore, we conducted this research to identify heat shock proteins and reveal the role of sHsps in rice in response to abiotic stresses.
First, we combined an orthology-based approach with expression association data to screen rice Hsps, the expression patterns of which strongly correlate with those of heat responsive probe-sets. Twenty-seven Hsp candidates"

Repressilator
The repressilator is a synthetic genetic regulatory network designed to exhibit a stable oscillation shown via expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein). The work is reported by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in their work at 2000. They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CI"

It should be noted that dcas9 and the RNA guiding sequence will both need their own unique promoters since plants have a tendency to destroy multiple promoter regions.
Further Study
Due to limitations resulting from the lack of previous synthetic biology application within plants, we were unable to obtain any results. We have successfully isolated the desired parts needed for assembly of the plasmid and have the backbone with the 35s promoter left border and Nos terminator right border.  Successful construct assembly of these parts is still needed for bacterial and plant transformation. Following promising transformation, fluorescence testing and characterization must be done.

Environmental applications: Using synthetic biology to protect against synthetic biology
One of the potential dangers of synthetic biology is that potentially harmful cells are released in the environment and can not be extracted as easily. We can use our system to detect these harmful cells and excrete them from the environment.
Note: Our cell does not pose a threat to the environment itself
More applications are given here .
The mechanism
A gene is expressed when certain requirements are met, which we call a 'sensor'. In our proof of concept that we are trying to achieve, we use a lactose sensor. In order to methylate our target restriction site we need to express a gene that translates into a methylase protein. We achieve this by replacing the gene activated by the sensor with a gene that expresses the methylase. Because we want to make sure that only the right site is methylated we also express a zinc finger in our gene, creating a zinc-finger and methylase fusion protein. By putting the site recognized by our zinc finger close to the restriction site that is recognized by our methyltransferase, we make sure it is much more likely that our methylates the right spot.
When we expose our cell to lactose it will methylate the restriction site associated to our fusion protein. If we then expose our cell to the restriction enzyme associated to our restriction site, the DNA will not be cut, where it would be cut if lactose would not be sensed. Using 'gel electrophoresis'[4] or an other method that is able to visualize the size and amount of DNA bands, we can identify if lactose has been sensed or not.
Definitions
Sensor: A piece of DNA that recognizes (directly or indirectly) a variable (molecule, protein, etc. etc.). Often a sensor is a switch for gene expression.
Gene: A piece of DNA that often can be transcripted and translated to a protein.
Plasmid: DNA that lives in a host cell, but is not part of the cells core DNA
Restriction enzyme: A protein that cuts DNA at its associated restriction site
Restriction site: A specific DNA sequence that can be cut by its associated restriction enzyme
Methyltransferase: A protein that methylates a specific DNA sequence
Methylase: A molecule that is the result of the methyltransferase. It sits on top of a methylated DNA sequence, making it inaccessible to other molecules and proteins. A restriction enzyme can not access a restriction site if it is methylated.
Zinc-finger: A protein that recognizes a specific sequence of DNA and binds to it"

Collaborations with OUC-China
With the ambition to make a better software tool for Synthetic Biology, we collaborate with OUC-China team to make our product truly helpful.
For the simulator, OUC-China is interested in a automative simulation tool to test their design, and we collaborate in BioDesigner Simulator. OUC-China provided us a complete explanation about the process and method they used in modeling. They also provided us their modeling results. By comparing those information with BioDesigner simulator, problems can be found and corrected.
For the recommendation in BioDesigner, the most important thing is to make sure our recommendations are truly helpful to Synthetic Biologist in their works. OUC-China provides us their gene circuit design, which can be used in the test of recommendation.
For a software, user experience is always of great value. OUC-China joined the alpha test and give us lots of valuable suggestions which is important in improving our product."

Summary
Our team is an interdisciplinary group composed of biology and mathematics subgroups collaborating between two different campuses, Missouri Western State University (MO) and Davidson College (NC). Missouri Western State University (MWSU) and Davidson College are 1,032 miles/1,660 km apart, so our collaboration involves cyber meetings, wiki postings, Wiggio shared space, Skype communication, and two campus site-visits.
During the first week of our 10 week project, MWSU traveled to Davidson for 5 days to determine what our project would be. During week 10, Davidson traveled to MWSU to produce the wiki, PPT and poster.
Our campuses have no graduate students or postdocs. Our team is composed of 1 high school student and 13 undergraduates majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, art, psychology, secondary mathematics education as well as some who have not declared their majors yet. We have sophomores, juniors, and seniors on our team.

HYPE-IT Software
Data Processing Software
We have developed a web application with the aim of being a powerful tool as part of our project. It has been designed as a networking and affordable space that complement the objective of our project.
HYPE-IT Software gather many sections where users could take advantage of all the tools that integrate it. Those sections are a forum, a blog, a news feed, a complete targets database, our scoring system, a gene viewer and a hierarchy of groups. Therefore, we could say we have created a  complete social network.
We have used MEAN framework (mongo, express, angular, node) to carry out the web development. We have chosen this technology and a BLL logic (Business Logic Layer), because it gathers the four most web development innovative technologies, such as Angular, that has the support of Alphabet, the Google searcher owner, or mongoDB, a NoSQL database no relational scalable database benchmark . This framework set up in 2013 and has overtaken his main rivals, as php o .net.
The business logic layer facilitates implementation of the tool in different environments. You just need to change a file to modify the persistence of the software, you can persist in oracle, in mongo or whatever you want.
Another bonus that makes our software greater than others is the use of NPM (node package manager) and Bower web package manager. Both are package managers that allow us to install code packages and certificate tools by a console that make easier the activity of development. Programming an application by components as a puzzle allows us to outsource any developed function. In our case, an example could be the scoring system, that could be shared with the developer community as a certificated package.
As a future line, we would create a package that integrates scoring system code"

We are the first one to introduce cell coculture of mammalian cells in microfluidic system. As a proof-of-principle, we knockout several genes whose functions are known in Wnt secretion. We verified the performance of our microfluidic system with both Wnt donor cells and reporters. We also build mathematical models for characterization of Wnt secretion, Wnt signaling and fluidic engineering.
Our microfluidic system is flexible to adjust to the biological application. And the system will be set up for many other scientific uses. Our aim of the project is more or less building a microfluidic platform for biologists. Some achievements are reached in our projects:
1. Developed double emulsion system for cell coculture
2. Design a novel micro-well microfluidic system for cell coculture
3. Optimize a reporter cell line in Wnt signaling pathway
4. Build several donor cell lines in Wnt secretion
5. Modeling the Wnt signaling pathway from normal tissue
6. Introduce a new type of integrated research in Human Practices

Even though we did not sign up for the track “Measurement” of the iGEM competition and therefore were not obliged to participate in this Interlab Measurement Study, we voluntarily took part as one of 45 teams worldwide. In addition to the general requirements we also completed the second “extra credit” assignment by building and testing all three devices expressing RFP instead of GFP and compared the fluorescence of both fluorescence proteins.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."
IIT_Delhi,2015,Team:IIT Delhi#project_-_-_TEXT.html," Suspended Particulate Matter:
NOx
SOx
CO2
CO
All these emissions are responsible for causing harmful health impacts on living beings, and deteriorate the environmental conditions of planet earth.
RSPM and NOx when combined, form a deadly combination which drastically affects human health.
RSPM when inhaled acts like an abrasive and wears the lining of respiratory tract exposing soft spots where NOx reacts and causes severe issues. So we decided to eliminate soot and NOx as the primary objective.
Analysis of soot:
Soot is of two types: hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic. Hydrophilic soot dissolves in water, whereas hydrophobic soot dissolves in organic solvents like alcohol. To get rid of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, we decided to use a solution of acetic acid in water as the solvent. Acetic acid, being an organic solvent, dissolves the hydrophobic part, and water, dissolves the hydrophobic soot. Using acetic acid, however, offers an added advantage as well. Being an acid, it reduces the PH of the medium and hence decreases the solubility of acidic NOx and SOx, from the exhaust into this solvent. Thus, the tank containing this solvent dissolves soot and NOx, Sox gases move out with the exhaust. The exhaust out of this tank is now passed into the desooter tank. The desooter tank has the following main design components:
Water tank
Fresh water inlet
Exit of tar
Level meter
Sparger
The exhaust gases enter the desooter tank at high temperature(200-250 C), and hence they cause the water in the tank to evaporate when they pass through it. Hence, a level meter is required to keep a check on the water level left in the tank, and hence supply fresh water accordingly through the fresh water inlet.
A provision of tar exit is needed to remove this tar slurry continuously out of the tank. Spargers are needed to form bubbles of exhaust gas in the mixture. Blowers are also attached to the system to compensate for the back pressure generated in the system at each step.
Now, we needed to condense the water vapor which flow along with exhaust gases out of this tank. This was required so that these excess water vapor do not clog the silica gel at the outlet of the tank. For this, we attach a heat exchanger at the outlet of the tank. It’s a cross flow type heat exchanger, with which we did some slight innovations to increase the efficiency of"

We can conclude that the three toehold switch pairs are working as intended and show little to no cross-interaction. These switch pairs can further be used in CAT-Seq in order to measure the orthogonality and strength of these pairs in a high throughput manner, and therefore assess the accuracy and precision of Catalytic Activity Sequencing.
3. Library encapsulation into droplets
Pico-liter volume droplets, housing In vitro transcription and translation reagents, DNA template and substrate nucleotides are produced by perpendicular excising the constant flow of water phase with fluorinated carrier oil.
Movie 1. 10 pL biomolecule synthesis droplet generation. Movie shows considerably slowed down generation of 10 pL water in oil emulsion. Horizontally arriving water phase housing In vitro transcription and translation reagents, DNA template, substrate nucleotides are excised by perpendicular flow of fluorinated carrier oil at a rate of 20 x 106 droplets per hour.
The formed emulsion is collected into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and incubated off chip in 37oC incubator for 4 hours to synthesize the biomolecule which catalyses the conversion of substrate nucleotides.
4. Catalytic biomolecule production
The effect of DNA circularization
In-vitro protein expression kits, encapsulated in the droplets together with only a single DNA template per droplet show extremely poor protein synthesis efficiency, as the template DNA concentration is very low. The DNA template was circularized without and omitted of any transcriptional terminators in order to initiate the rolling cycle transcription described by literature (Diegelman and Kool, 1998). Please read more about the rolling cycle transcription in the design section of the CAT-Seq project. The effect of DNA circularization on transcription and thus translation rate was measured by employing In vitro transcription and translation kit with two different DNA templates. Both of the templates encode an esterase gene flanked by T7 RNA promoter and RBS, however one of them was circularized and had no terminator sequence. Two differently synthesized biomolecules (one linear, and one circularized) were mixed with N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphates - the Substrate Nucleotides. The hydrolysis rate of substrate nucleotide was tracked by measuring the decay of absorbance with spectrophotometer. As seen from data showed in 7 Fig., the"
