SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," “Basic information” included participants' age, sex, and blood uric acid concentration; “The basic living and treatment condition” included the degree of understanding for the harm of hyperuricemia, the degree of paying attention to hyperuricemia in daily life, whether on a diet, the feelings after the diet, reasons for the diet, whether use of drugs to control blood uric acid concentration, what drugs have been used and why to use them, etc. “Views and opinions on new drugs or therapies” were mainly to investigate the aspects of participants' attention on new drugs or new therapies.
We have widely disseminated through the Internet media, and received nearly 100 valid questionnaires. We conducted a statistical analysis of the questionnaire results, and we have got a lot of valuable information. The information worth discussing included the following four items:
Firstly, in the investigation of the degree of understanding for the harm of hyperuricemia, nearly fifty percent were not aware of it. Secondly, in the investigation of the degree of paying attention to hyperuricemia in daily life, nearly fifty percent of the participants did not pay attention to it. Integrated the previous two points, we found that the understanding degree and attention degree of the disease in patients with hyperuricemia were very scarce, which is the reason why we have published the Handbook of Hyperuricemia and held the Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library.
Thirdly, in the investigation of how they felt about dietary control in patients with hyperuricemia, over fifty percent of them felt painful, which also reflected dietary control had a great impact on the quality of life of patients, and reducing dietary control will be more appropriate to the needs of patients.
Fourthly, in the investigation of views and opinions on new drugs or new therapies for hyperuricemia patients that they were most concerned about, more than half of the patients believed that efficacy and safety were the most important. We attached great importance to these points, and we integrated the needs of patients into the improvement of our project. We will seriously consider the importance of improving the consuming efficiency of uric acid by engineering bacteria, prolonging the time of colonization, and reducing the adverse reactions such as immune rejection caused by engineering bacteria, so as to strengthen the efficacy and safety of intestinal part of our project.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#10 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,"Summary
Preparation for test transformation in Bacillus subtilis 168 with GFP-rrnB plasmid DNA
This afternoon we prepared 40 ml MM competence media and equally distributed it into four 15ml falcon tubes. To three of the tubes (one tube for each of the three teams), Bacillus subtilis 168 was added and to the fourth tube, nothing was added - this would serve as contamination control. They were then left in the shaking incubator at 37ºC overnight for the transformation process tomorrow.
Protocol
This is what pGFP-rrnb looks like in E.coli
For the preparation of the 40ml MM competence media (10ml in each of 4 falcon tubes), please refer to the solutions list . For the steps regarding preparations of overnight cultures, please refer to the 'Evening before transformations day' section . The only changes to the protocol were: 4 falcon tubes were used instead of just 2 - three tubes contained Bacillus subtilis innoculated MM competence media (for the three sub-teams in our project) and the fourth tube contained MM competence media alone (contamination control)
Results
3 x 15ml falcon tubes containing 10ml MM competence media along with Bacillus subtilis cells and 1 x 15ml falcon tube containing just 10ml MM competence media. All four tubes placed in shaking incubator for overnight growth.

Q: Aber wenn wir jetzt annehmen wir zeigen erhebliche Vorteile und klären die Probleme mit der Koexistenz, dann müssten wir doch aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Freiheit sagen, dass Gentech erlaubt werden soll.
A: Es ist natürlich ein Trend. Wenn 135 Nationalräte Nein sagen zu Gentech, dann ist das ein Trend. Und je weiter nach unten man geht, desto grösser wird dieser. Ja-Sager sind da auf dem Holzweg. Auf der anderen Seite hatten wir Anträge im Parlament, die Gentech vollständig verbieten wollten, inklusive Forschung. Und da bin ich auf der Seite, dass die Forschung frei sein soll und warte auf Ergebnisse, die den Mehrwert nachweisen können. Und Freisetzungsversuche sind doch viel wichtiger in grossen Agrarstaaten nicht hier in der Schweiz. Hier ist der Forschungsplatz wichtig und den wollen wir erhalten.
Q: Wie erklären sie sich das Paradoxon, dass der medizinische Nutzen von GMOs akzeptiert wird aber mit gentechnisch veränderten Pflanzen sieht das ganze anders aus?
A: Wir müssen unterscheiden zwischen ausserordentlichen Situationen, in diesen ist der Mensch zu vielem bereit, und normalen Situationen. Das wichtigste ist für Leute hier in der Schweiz gesund zu bleiben und dazu gehören gesunde Nahrungsmittel. Niemand möchte Risiken eingehen, und bisher kann niemand belegen wie und wo diese Risiken liegen, auch nicht in der Gentechnik.
Q: Würden Sie sagen, dass der Bauernverband eine oder sogar „die“ treibende Kraft war die diesen Gentechnik-Stopp voran gebracht hat?
A: Ja, das kann man wahrscheinlich so sagen. Dem Bauernverband wird ein grosses Vertrauen entgegengebracht und wir haben daher eine hohe Verantwortung. Und die Landwirtschaft trägt einen hohen Beitrag bei, zur Standort-Attraktivität der Schweiz. Leute kommen in die Schweiz auch wegen der Lebensqualität die sicher durch die Natur definiert ist und dort hat die Landwirtschaft einen grossen Einfluss."
Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," is often late because it can't change as fast as science. Thus, we believe RRI is a good framework for the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology in our research, because written law did not already ruled on this brand new technology.
While working on the concept of Responsible Research and Innovation we had the idea to create a RRI Test, which works as a feed-back for the projects. The principles of Responsible Research and Innovation guided our research, and the RRI test helped us to reshape it to build a more responsible project. We thus integrated all our human practices on the CRISPR-Cas9 technology by the bias of responsibility and the RRI worked as a tool to integrate our human practices in our project. Indeed, this tool helped us to have a better decision making, more rational and guided towards societal needs. To see the RRI test, click here .
While we were already working on our project and RRI, we discovered that we followed the same idea as the European Union, which launched their RRI Toolkit this year, after two years working on it. This RRI Toolkit helps researchers to lead a responsible research by a wide range of tools. RRI is a strong idea that European Union tries to spread for 2020 for european researchers. Our test follows the same path for iGEM, an iGEM sized test.
We filled our test to see how we responded to the principles we wanted to follow. This test is divided in the four parts of RRI : Reflexivity, Anticipation, Inclusiveness/Deliberation, Responsiveness.  We believe iGEM could be a great laboratory for these principles. Following this idea we share the test with several teams, most of them filled it and we tried to see how the four axes of RRI (Reflexivity, Anticipation, Inclusiveness, Responsiveness) are integrated by the teams.
The four axis of our reflexion on RRI:
Reflexivity: The reflexivity leads the team to think about the choices that have been made, the motivation and potential impacts of the project. The question of reflexivity happens at the first step of the project. Reflexivity tries to find how the team thought about the purpose of the innovation.
Anticipation: Anticipation requires to describe and analyze possible impacts, and create the appropriate solutions and policies. Every scientific project includes impacts. Even though all the impacts can’t be predictable at the beginning of the project, a lot of them can be seen. This anticipation is scientific but also juridical (decide about the best legal framework).

From left to right, ""red"" colony: DH5a with pSB4A5_J04450 (non-conjugated recipient), ""blue"" colony: S17-1 with pK18mob (donor) and ""purple"" colony: DH5a with pSB4A5_J04450 and pK18mob (recipient having conjugated).
After 2 hours of conjugation on solid LB medium, the cells are collected and diluted in PBS 1X before being spread on LB/Xgal/IPTG plate per 100µl. Colony counts are carried out three times for each dilution.
Table 1: Count after conjugation (transfer of mobilizable plasmid pK18mob).
The ratio of donor (D) to recipient (R) is 0.172, i. e. D:R ≈ 1:6. The effectiveness of the conjugation is calculated by the ratio between the number of conjugated recipients (R+) divided by the total number of recipients (R+ and R-),           i.e. 61% effectiveness, of recipient bacteria having received the mobilizable plasmid.

To verify the efficiency of Crispr/Cas9 system of our plasmid, we have transformed the killer plasmid in a DH5ɑ strain carrying the RFP reporter plasmid (pSB4A5_J04450). If our CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid system work well, it will cut the RFP gene         and the recipient bacteria (red and fluorescent) will appear white.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

Introduction
Cancer is one of the most common and lethal disease in the world and it is always highlighted that early diagnosis is crucial in terms of cancer treatment. It is often invasive and painful to diagnose cancer with the existing methods. At this point, breath test appears as a promising non-invasive and real-time technique which allows the monitoring of metabolic status.
Cancer and VOCs
Metabolic changes due to diseases can be monitored also on volatile organic compound (VOC) levels in patient’s breath. These VOCs have different profile for each disease. The motives of VOCs for each disease have been observed via different spectrometry methods, such as mass and gas spectrometry. The collected data have been narrowed to select the very specific biomarkers for this project. The aim is to produce bacteria that have circuits and logic gates at DNA level which is going to be able to either diagnose or detect the types of cancer by sensing specific VOCs in the exhaled breath of the patients mentioned before in literature.
DiagNOSE
For our sensors pMimA/MimR, pFor/Hxlr, pAlkM/AlkR, Pu/XylR and pChnB/ChnR promoter/transcription factor duplets have been selected, which recognize acetone, formaldehyde, octane, cyclohexanone and o-xylene presence, respectively.
Transcription factor MimR binds to pMimA in the presence of acetone and isopropanol, HxlR binds to pFor in the presence of formaldehyde and AlkR binds to pAlkM in the presence of octane which activates the transcription of the down stream genes. For cyclohexanone sensor, pChnB (promoter of ChnB gene) has been selected since it binds transcription factor ChnR in the presence of cyclohexanone and for o-xylene sensor Pu (promoter of XylR gene) has been selected since it binds to the transcription factor XylR in the presence of o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene and toluene; so that transcription on this promoter is activated.
After achieving getting the signal for a particular VOC, we aim to construct logical gates and circuits by using CRISPRi system on plasmids to create well accout"

Tried extrusion, this time with PEEK tubing (0.005 inch inner diameter) cut with the tubing cutter
tube length was 10 mm
dope was 20% w/v cellulose acetate with a few drops of blue food coloring
extrusion rate of 6 uL/min
fibers still don't form. Rather, the dope blobs up upon coming into contact with the water
some observations:
the syringe pump inevitably reaches a point where it stops pushing. The motor is still working, but the drive screw is clearly not moving at all (and hence, the drive block isn't moving). Curiously, dope still comes out of the tubing when the motor is stalled
periodically, an air bubble comes out from the tube -- is this an indication that there is air in the tubing? Air is something that might be providing huge back pressure against the motor's force
speaking of air bubbles, I'm not able to load a syringe with dope without there being air bubbles in the dope.
I tried removing the plunger and pipetting dope in. But when inserting the plunger back in, bubbles are formed at the plunger/dope interface.
I tried using a large diameter needle to draw dope up. But there is inevitably dead space in the needle that is introduced into the syringe as bubbles.
a thin stream can be observed rising from the tip of the tube to the surface of the water. I think that this is acetone leaving the dope. The question is, is acetone leaving the dope that's already in the coagulation bath, or leaving the dope that's inside of the tube? If it's the latter, then that may explain why the motor stops being able to push out the dope.
At the end of the day, I just removed the water bath and wiped down the tip of the tubing with acetone. I'll try again tomorrow and see what happens.

UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#Interlab_-_-_TEXT.html," NEB's primer design guidelines toward the assembly of the promoter::GFP constructs in the pSB1C3 backbone. In each case, two PCR products would be combined in a Gibson assembly to form the desired plasmid. The pSB1C3 backbone containing each promoter was amplified using the standard forward primer and a promoter-specific reverse primer. In a second PCR, rbs::GFP (I13504) was amplified with a forward primer that would introduce part of the specific promoter sequence, as well as a standard reverse primer. This allowed for sufficient overlap between the the backbone::promoter and RBS::GFP amplification products for Gibson assemblies.
The PCR cycling conditions and annealing temperatures for each reaction were designed following NEB's standard PCR protocol for Q5 polymerase. The PCR products were purified with Qiagen's PCR clean-up kit and the size of the products verified on an agarose gel. The linear promoter::backbone constructs were then each combined with the amplified I13504 using the Gibson assembly protocol from NEB. The Gibson products were then transformed into BL21 and the constructs were isolated and insert size confirmed as per above, with additional verification through gene sequencing by Genewiz. However, our team was unable to assemble the third device of the J23117 promoter and GFP. Thankfully, this DNA construct was graciously donated to us with iGEM approval from the William and Mary 2015 iGEM team. The controls for this experiment were transformed directly onto BL21. The plasmids were miniprepped and verified through gene sequencing as well.
Testing the Devices
Our team followed the 2015 InterLab protocol for testing that was posted by iGEM for this study. Three separate biological replicates for the verified constructs and controls were grown in 10 mL culture tubes with loose caps in an incubator overnight for 16-18 hours. We recorded the OD500 of the cells and the samples were diluted to within 5% of 0.5. 150 microliters of three biological replicates of each diluted sample and three technical replicates were transferred to a 96 well plate using a p-200 pipette. The fluorescence of the samples was then quantified using the SpectraMax M2 microplate reader, at an excitation wavelength of 498 nm and an emission recorded at 541 nm with the auto cutoff setting on. We are also very thankful to Dr. Bentley's lab on campus for allowing us to use their plate reader for testing. The results of the experiments were processed are reported below in arbitrary units.

"
Washington,2016,Team:Washington#Project1_-_-_TEXT.html," on the sequence and its twin we believe it to be mislabeled and that it is instead the CupI CDS.
We acquired our starting sequence from the Vicker’s Lab at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology via Addgene , subsequently removed or altered bases corresponding to illegal cut sites, added a biobrick prefix and suffix, and finally ordered the unit as a geneblock from IDT.
BBa_K2165002 : pCup1 + VioC (codon optimized) + ADH1
This biobrick utilizes our Cup1 promoter. Following the binding of a heavy metal to the Cup1 promoter then VioC transcription is upregulated. The effects on the transcription of the VioC protein can be seen above in the VioC section. The biobrick ends with the ADH1 terminator BBa_K801012 for yeast that was submitted by the TU Munich team in 2012.
This biobrick was designed to characterize the codon optimized version of VioC. The codon optimized VioC should have higher translation rates than the previously made VioC, and this plasmid construct will be used to determine the change in the expression levels for the pathway. For more information on the role of VioC in the violacein pathway see the above VioC.
BBa_K2165003 : Gal1 + VioD + Terminator
The promoter for the biobrick uses the Gal1 promoter sequence, which is activated in the presence of galactose but repressed in the presence of glucose. The sequence for the Gal1 promoter that was used for this biobrick is the 2006 Silver lab’s BBa_J63006 . The effect on the transcription of the VioD protein can be seen above in the VioC section. The biobrick ends with the ADH1 terminator BBa_K801012 for yeast that was submitted by the TU Munich team in 2012.
This biobrick was designed to characterize the codon optimized version of VioD. The codon optimized VioD should have higher translation rates than the previously made VioD, and this plasmid construct will be used to determine the change in the expression levels for the pathway.  For more information on the role of VioD in the violacein pathway see the above VioD.

To fix this, we tried changing setting on the liquid class such as z-max offset and 'liquid detection enabled'. Unfamiliarity with the errors as well as the slowness of the wetlab computer made debugging very frustrating and slow. I had to leave at 6pm and I believe Viktor and Swapnil stayed a while longer to fix the error.
Wednesday 6/29
We had that brief iGem Comp Team meeting today where everyone gave Doug a update on what they have been doing so far. So today I spent most of my time solving the plate allocation issue by implementing the 3 pass approach. During the first pass, Viktor calculates and allocates all resources needed on the deck, during the second pass, RM records down during what steps are each plates accessed, and during the third pass, we actually run Puppeteer live on the robot and the RM now knows how to make room on the deck by looking at each plate's access time acquired during the 2nd pass.
Thursday 6/30
Today was our scheduled protocol test on the robot with real samples and enzymes. We went over to the lab at around 12:30pm and get things setup. We ran the robot once pipetting water first to make sure everything is still working. We then printed out the init instructions from RM which we gave to Evelyn so she can set up the deck with the plates and samples that RM instructed the user. After everything is set up, we started the robot and recorded the entire pipetting process with Viktor's camera. Everything seems to have worked fine. Evelyn then put the samples the robot made along with the samples she made into the PCR machine. Now I anxiously await the result of our execution, hopefully the result is comparable with the result of the handmade sample.

Plate allocation verification. The top shows the printout for the plate access times. The bottom shows how RM make room on the deck based on what timestep you are at and the access times.
So the results for the Restriction Digest is out and we are victorious! Judging from the image of the gels, the samples, enzymes, and buffers mixed correctly to cut out the desired part from the restriction sites.  Aaron came in today to talk to us about our progress since last week and we gave"

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," how well they put together their XY-plane.
When designing the XY-stage, we decided that we would like the default, starting position of the plate holder to be in the bottom right of the plane. During the first iteration, we brought the holder to position by traveling the span of the plane fully every time, which caused it to jam into the sides and also stall the motors. From there, we realized that we needed a method for the plane to communicate to the Arduinos in order to stop the motors when it has reached the correct position.
Below are clips of a Creo assembly demonstrating how the XY-stage should be and the first physical iteration of the XY-plane.
Refining Our Design
For the final design of the XY-stage, our team decided to 3D-print all of our supports in order to increase accessibility and decrease to cost of the hardware components of TERRA. All parts were printed using the UPrint SE with ivory ABS stock material. Previously, the holes of the 3D-printed parts were too small, mostly due to the relative inaccuracy of this fabrication method, so the new iteration of the supports include clearance holes rather than tight fit holes.
We also chose to choose standard, close-loop timing belts in order to minimize the problems we were encountering with ensuring the tension in the timing belts were correct and that the belt would not slip over the pulleys. Using closed timing belts also eliminates the problems with gluing together ends of the timing belt.
In order to send our plate holder to the correct position, or its home position, we needed a technical and reliable solution. Our team decided to integrate contact switches to the plane, allowing us to consistently and accurately home our system every time we run a new protocol, ensuring that the output from the microfluidic device dispenses to the correct wells of a microtiter plate. This also allows us to further remove human error from our system. This was done by creating negative features on some of the 3D-printed supports to hold the sensors in place.
The CAD and STL files are available on our GitHub in order to allow users to easily recreate our system.

Toward Synthetic Biology, Toward A Better Life. ----To Combat Antimicrobial Resistance
To make a better influence to the public with our project, we did many efforts to popularize the concepts of synthetic biology, the antimicrobial resistance and the safety with these new technologies.
Achievements
1.We popularized synthetic biology combined with our project. We made antimicrobial resistance the theme of our policy & practices to let more people know about the safety of the synthetic biology.
2.We set our own assemble to provide synthetic biology information for the general public with a exhibition.
3.We built our own assemble to evaluate our policy & practices on the internet with a biological media
4.We sent group emails to life science community to popularize the safety and application in antimicrobial resistance of synthetic biology, and we got the percentages of people who successfully know about our propaganda by telephone visit.
Please visit our exhibition video
Campus Activity
Public Outreach
Evaluation
As college student, the first step of our popularization was in the campus. We choose the students as our target objects and held a series of campus activities like delivering a lecture, visiting high school students, introducing synthetic biology in our campus open day.
In order to make the safety and application of synthetic biology accepted by more people, we did amount of efforts in the public outreach. The most influential we did is the synthetic biology exhibition in the Guangdong science center which let the public have a better understand of our theme, antimicrobial resistance.
We evaluated our method with the feedback from different people and analysis through our different filed of content.
Social Media
Life Science Community
The most efficient way to popularize the synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance is through the media. There are many reports about what we did in public during the year, and we also published some articles in the journal of our school.
The ones who own the knowledge of skills to turn Synthetic Biology into real products are gathered in research labs of universities and companies. So we"

The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.

By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.

After choosing the inhibition method, we started to find a ROS sensor with low sensitivity to                         ROS, since we hoped the sensor would only work under high level of ROS. But it didn’t exist,                         the only thing we could find in literature was protein Yap1, a basic leucine zipper (bZip)                         transcription factor from yeast. [9]
Fig. 4 How dose Yap1 work
Yap1 can sense the cytoplasmic H2O2 produced in mitochondria, which is a                         kind of signal meaning cells were at a high oxidant condition through an intramolecular                         disulfide bond generation. There two methionine closed to each other locates on the surface of                         protein, so when the ROS concentration increases significantly, the two thiol would be oxidized                         and generate an intramolecular disulfide bond generation leading change of protein structure.                         Then it will entry the nucleus to active some antioxidants enzymes transcription. Yap1 responds                         rapidly to cytoplasmic H2O2 due to a enzyme, Gpx3 (Orp1), a kind of                         catalase which can identify hydrogen peroxide efficiently, through the transformation of                         intermolecular disulfide bond. [10]
Fig. 5 gene circuit of Feedback part
Thus instead of using a sensor that is less sensitive to ROS, we tried to find some weak                         downstream promoters so that the ligated dCas9 protein would only have significant inhibitory                         effect when ROS accumulation is forcing yeast into death.
Output
As a ROS detector, our system should not only sense the intracellular ROS content, but be able                         to output signal, so that we know what happen exactly in the little tiny cells.                         Time to select a signal output substance. Like what we mentioned in description , we considered glutathione, which could sense ROS in vivo, but could not output, so it’s                         incompetent. Chemical fluorescent probe was not good enough either since its toxicity and long                         processing time, we preferred to find something existing in intracellular environment as a                         signal output. Eventually we found roGFP2---a kind of green fluorescent protein sensitive to                         redox in the Registry.
Fig. 6 How roGFP works.
The process of roGFP sensing ROS is similar to Yap1. RoGFP is a variant of GFP. Compared with                         the later one, roGFP has 8 amino acid mutations. Point of its sensitivity of redox states is                         two Mets which locate in the surface of protein. Once the"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a fluorescent agent. Since our aim is to produce a fully biological laser, fluorescent proteins are favourable. To this end, we initially selected four fluorophores with different emission wavelengths: GFP, mVenus, mKate and mCerulean. These fluorophores were reported to have an increased fluorescent intensity compared to their wildtype (Cormack et al., 1996; Nagai et al., 2002; Shcherboo et al., 2007; Rizzo et al., 2004) .
Since mVenus, mKate and mCerulean did not exist in the iGEM registry yet, we constructed a brand new part for each of these fluorophores including strong constitutive promoter and RBS (parts K1890010 and K1890011 ). GFP, on the other hand, was present in a whole range of biobricks. However, to our knowledge, there was no single biobrick available containing promoter, RBS and terminators. Hence, we constructed a new biobrick containing all of the above using the existing part E0840 , consisting of RBS, coding sequence and terminators. By means of PCR we amplified this biobrick with primers designed to add a promoter while mainaining the biobrick prefix and suffix. Not only did we express GFP under the strong promoter J23100 , but also under less strong promoters J23113 , J23117 , J23105 , and J23108 . This way we were able to see the influence of promoter strength on fluorescent output (parts K1890020 to K1890024 .
Experiments and Results
In order to characterize these biobricks before further use, the emission spectra of the fluorophores were measured. Additionally, their effect on cell growth was investigated.
Emission spectra of different fluorophores
Introduction
To assure the fluorophores were functional, the emission spectra were recorded at the given excitation wavelength.
Methods
Parts encoding the four different fluorophores, including promoter, RBS and terminators, were expressed in E. coli BL21 strain. GFP, mVenus, mKate and mCerulean were all expressed under the same strong constitutive promoter, J23100. Additionally, parts were constructed with GFP under control of promoters with different strengths, in order to investigate the influence of different fluorophore concentrations.
All of the mentioned biobricks were expressed in E. coli BL21. After growing in LB medium to an OD600 of ~1, the cells were washed and resuspended in the same volume of PBS. Ali"
UNebraska-Lincoln,2017,Team:UNebraska-Lincoln#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," et al., 2011).
As a team, we decided to pursue the two most plausible options for our project . The first solution we decided on was biosynthesis of bromoform to inhibit methanogenesis (Kinley & Fredeen, 2014). The second solution involves aiding the facilitation of nitrite reduction to ammonia (Yang et al., 2016). Additionally, the specific enzymes we selected function at the pH (6-7) of ruminal fluid and even more so under anaerobic conditions.
Experimental Stage
We successfully cloned and transformed E.coli to carry the gene for the enzymes nitrite reductase and vanadium dependent bromoperoxidase. Before moving on to the next step we made sure to fully sequence our composite parts. Upon sequencing we found that there were no mutations so we decided to began the characterization of our various parts. To characterize nitrite reductase we performed the Nessler’s test. More information on the Nessler's test can be found on our Experiments page . To characterize the bromoperoxidase we used the monochlorodimedone assay which is commonly used to determine the rate at which the enzyme brominates hydrocarbons. More detailed information on these steps can be found in the lab notebook and results sections. Although we made plans to go further with the experimental design, at this point we ran out of time.
Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda
Unfortunately we were not able to carry out our full experimental design.
The next step that should be taken is to see if our E. coli can grow in filtered ruminal fluid.
If it could survive in anaerobic conditions similar to the rumen of a cow (anaerobic, same temp, same pH) while growing in filtered ruminal fluid then the assays should be reperformed for each enzyme while the bacteria is in filtered ruminal fluid.
Next the assays need to be repeated while the bacteria is growing in unfiltered ruminal fluid.
If the bacteria can grow in the unfiltered ruminal fluid then we would test if the methanogens within the ruminal fluid were still able to produce as much methane.
If the last few steps were successful, the kill switch would be ligated into our plasmid. If the kill switch works then begin to recharacterize the parts to make sure that they still work with the addition of the kill switch.
After this create the delivery system for feeding the E. coli to cattle. In the spirit of iGEM we wished to continue applications of the work done by the Oxford 2016 iGEM team making"

Figure 6 Max OD reached by Test 2 over 24 h in (A) LB and (B) SOC media adjusted to varying pH levels.
Fluorescence was affected by pH particularly in SOC where an increase was seen with an increase in pH; In LB there was less of a pattern seen; increases can be seen at 31C and 37C with increases in pH, however at 43C the max FL is reduced dramatically. The combination of high temperature/pH may have been toxic to the cells.
Figure 7 Max FL reached by Test 2 over 24 h in (A) LB and (B) SOC media adjusted to varying pH levels
Despite clear correlations in both growth and fluorescence, there appears to be no distinct pattern in the increase of pH and the overall FL:OD (Figure 8).
Figure 8 Max FL:OD reached by Test 2 over 24 h in (A) LB and (B) SOC media adjusted to varying pH levels
Overall, it is clear pH and temperature have an impact on the growth and fluorescence of the devices, and this raises the importance of maintaining conditions specified in InterLab instructions. It is difficult to draw definite conclusions without more thorough experimentation. It should also be noted that whilst each replicate of isolates was added to the plate using a robot for maximum accuracy, there was still a degree of variability. These variances will have increased over time, and the InterLab method of taking samples at specific time points may be more laborious, but will yield a more accurate result of overall culture behaviour.
Standard Assembly Methods
We investigated whether different assembly methods influenced performance and the expression of downstream products. This was done by designing and assembling the same GFP reporter device (promoter (BBa_B0032) and RBS (BBa_B0034) driving expression of a GFP (BBa_I746916) using the iGEM standards RFC10 and MoClo-based Phytobricks and the non-standard, scarless Gibson assembly method. The Biobrick method was unsuccessful in assembly the desired devices, and we therefore compared the Gibson (Figure 9) and Phytobrick (Figure 10) assembled constructs.
During growth in LB media it was found that the presence of sequence ‘scars’ introduced by Phytobrick assembly impacted strongly on the device operation; the constructs containing sequence ‘scars’ had a significantly lower expression of the reporter GFP gene compared to the constructs containing no scars.

Biological replicates were considered together and error bar shows the standard                                     error of all the eight replicates.
      According to these figures, we can conclude that in the aspect of                                 promoter strength, J23101 is greater than J23106 and J23106 is greater than J23117, and                                 in the aspect of RBS strength, B0034 is greater than J364100 (Figure 3, 4). Difference                                 in RBS strength may be related to the length of spacer between SD sequence in RBS and                                 start codon. We can also see that the growth of D1 and D4 were relatively influenced                                 (Figure 2), suggesting J23101 may have a negative effect on bacterial growth, though the                                 protein expression is relatively high.

      Caused by our carelessness, we put the Ludox in the -20 degrees                                 centigrade and all of them precipitated. Here we sincerely acknowledge team                                 “SiCAU-China” to provide us extra Ludox.       We sincerely gratitude the work done by some freshmen, Caiqin Wang, Tian Liu, Chenming                                 Zhang, Yuanhan Yang, Yanling Zhong, Changhe Li (names listed in no particular order), in                                 InterLab study.       We helped Team SCU-WestChina by giving them some of our bacterial glycerol stocks, and                                 their feedback showed that our transformation was successful.       When we plotted the standard curve, we found that the fluorescent strength seemed lower                                 than expected when fluorescence concentration is very high. Thus, we described this                                 phenomenon in the WeChat group of iSWU for some suggestion. Thankfully, student leader                                 of team “SiCAU-China” told us that that may be caused by the inner filter effect; that                                 is to say, when the concentration of fluorescence is very high, the excitation light                                 cannot fully excited all of them, causing the decrease of fluorescent strength. We also                                 shared this point in CCiC (Central China iGEM Consortium).

To Future iGEM Teams
Hello future iGEM’er and congratulations on starting your iGEM journey! You are going to have an amazing time with plenty of wonderful experiences, new friendships, and an extensive amounts of obtained knowledge. In this section some ideas for improvement and further development of our project, the PowerLeaf, will be presented.
Further Development of Our Project
For those of you that are interested in our project and would like to improve upon it, this is the section you have been looking for. We have listed the systems and the related information needed for the fulfillment of the device we envisioned. Nonetheless, you should not feel restricted by these suggestions. You shall be more than welcome to contact any of us regarding questions about the project. You can find each of our team members contact informations in the Team section in the credits.
Investigated and Researched Systems
Dormancy System
Utilised by the energy storing unit, the dormancy system can reduce metabolism during times of the day with no solar energy available, e.g. at nighttime. We encountered a few challenges during the assembly and optimisation of the dormancy system. However, through modeling we obtained vital knowledge on how to regulate the system. If you are interested, you can read more about the work performed on the light-dependent dormancy system .
Carbon Fixation
We received the required parts from the Bielefeld 2014 iGEM team and began assembling the parts into one fully functional BioBrick.  However, we encountered some trouble cloning these parts. You can give it a go anyways, or maybe even try to redo the carbon fixation by using a system from a different organism. Regrettably, we eventually had to let go of this system, so we could focus on other components of the PowerLeaf. If you are interested, you can read more about the work we did regarding the carbon fixation .
Cellulose Biosynthesis and Secretion
These parts were retrieved from the 2014 Imperial College iGEM team . Assembly of these long BioBricks emerged to be troublesome, which regularly occurs when cloning long sequences of DNA. Thus, this part could be the very thing to improve, as it is a rather central part of the system. If you are interested, you can read more about our work on the cellulose biosynthesis and secretion .

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-P"

A mucus degrading lung probiotic
Product Development
Our Approach
We, iGEM Stockholm 2017, believe that lung probiotics are the future, and we want to be at the forefront of this field together with PROlung.
To prepare PROlung to become a possible start-up in the future, we have conducted different parts of a theoretical product development strategy with the help of the book BIODESIGN The Process of Innovating Medical Technologies.
Pharmaceutical and biotechnological development are usually characterized by the development of a product looking for an uncertain market. In our opinion, the final customer should be always in the center of the development process and, because of this, we have used the product development strategy of the MedTech industry as our baseline, as we search for a way to provide a high-value solution for the patients.
In order to develop our product, having the final customer always in the center, we have included a section concerning this in the analysis of the disease state fundamentals, the existing solutions, the stakeholders involved in this area and the landscape of market for a treatment to respiratory diseases related to high mucus production. But most importantly, we have found the need behind our product, by listening to the opinions of different stakeholders.
Through the background analysis we performed and studies of customers’ needs, we were able to successfully develop the product design. For the product we had designed we made a theoretical study of the regulations it would be subjected to, the ethical concerns it may raise and the intellectual property protection we could apply for, and the product could interfere with. At the end of the process, we were also able to determine how the product could be reimbursed in healthcare and a possible business model for it. We believe that conducting all this would give PROlung a head start in becoming a company.
Since we know the target audience for this document has a very varied background, we have included, in the beginning of each segment, a short description of its purpose. We hope that this description of and"

The same ratio and ligation with the program of 22℃ 2min, 40℃ 30,25 repeats.
The motivation to debug 2012 Freiburg’s parts
Unfortunately, all of our attempts failed. We didn’t manage to make a complete TALE, or even make two of them together. However, what is important for us is that when we try the 5th protocol, we notice an unexpected result. When we analyze the sequence result, we find that our left adaptor, 1st part and right adaptor connect together. Why do we get this result? We notice that their sticky end is TGAC, GCTC, and ACTC. That is to say, GCTC and ACTC connect with each other by mistake. In another word, if the sticky ends are very similar, they probably connect with each other. Although we failed again, the result gives us confidence to debug 2012 Freiburg's parts.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

In order to eliminate the public's fear, our team decided to proceed from two aspects. The first thing to do is to give the public an appropriate science popularization education to eliminate subjective fear, and in the meantime, to use the means closest to people's lives to eliminate people's potential fear. Finally, we broadened our project and designed convenient and feasible software for enterprises to select metabolic plans in biochemical plants.

Collaboration
During the project, of course, it is indispensable to communicate with other iGEM teams. Therefore, we exchanged opinions with many other iGEM teams to solve the problems we encountered together. Among them, we have carried out further cooperation and communication with the two iGEM teams: Sun Yat-sen University and South China Agricultural University. We finished an indispensable part of each other’s projects and made critical work.
SYSU-software is a friendly and open team. We had a meetup and exchange our project. With a presentation, they introduced their software to us, a multi-functional collaboration platform. Their software amazed us and we thought it can be useful in genetic circuit collaboration design. However, they ignored a fact that experimental protocol was also an important element in collaboration. So, in the meetup, we came up with this idea. They took much amount of it and verified their software based on our suggestion, adding a new function of editing protocol.
The team from South China Agricultural University is also friendly and accommodating. In our project, they helped us determine differences in yeast growth and tested for its activity. At the same time, we helped them extract the Acetobacter xylinum genome. Both of us have made a contribution that cannot be ignored to each other.
Self-enhancement
As scientific researchers, we must have a scientific basis for all our work, and repeatedly verify the arisen, upcoming and potential problems. Therefore, we need experts from different fields to help answer our questions in various fields. To learn about the latest research trends and enrich our project, we came to the 4th Seminar on Synthetic Biology Young Scholars.
Safety
Although Yarrowia lipolytica has undergone many tests and is a relatively mature engineered strain, but if we still have to ensure that they are always within safe limits through good laboratory practices and careful awareness. In addition, we understand environmental and personal protective measures and strictly comply with the requirements in the laboratory to prevent leakage or contamination risks.
Education
Although more and more people are paying attention to synthetic biology and molecular biology, there are still many people who have misunderstandings about biology or fear of biological tools such as transgenic technology and gene editing"

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," overnight. GFP fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Safire 2 Multi-Mode Plate Reader. Error bars represent the SD of 4 technical repeats of 3 biological replicates per condition. The statistical significance of **** P < 0.0001 was calculated using the Tukey's multiple comparisons test.
This construct allowed us to test whether the promoter Pblind has any significant leakage. We wanted to show that GFP cannot be expressed in the absence of EL222. This is of particular interest as the aim of LIT is to demonstrate the versatility and high precision of light control. As shown in Figure 1, only J23151-GFP (positive control) had a significant difference in fluorescence compared to R0040-GFP (negative control), Pblind-GFP, WT cells and the Luria Broth (LB) in both dark and Blue-light conditions. Pblind-GFP had no significantly different fluorescence level compared to the LB baseline, negative control or WT cells in either condition. This is expected, as the EL222 protein is required for blue-light inducible transcriptional activation.
Cell-cell adhesion
We also simulated the bacterial chemical adhesion between SpyTag and SpyCatcher, by testing the adhesion between Biotin and Avadin. Similar to SpyTag and SpyCatcher, Biotin and Avadin form a covalent bond when in close proximity to each other. As time passed a greater number of cells aggregated to each other, and sedimented to the bottom of the eppendorf tubes, a lower concentration of un-adhered cells remained in the supernatant stream.
The video above shows 8 eppendorf tubes, each representing the                 different experimental conditions tested. We performed a series of experiments with competent cells.                     From left to right: DMF solvent and Avadin, DMF solvent and PBS solvent,                 PBS solvent and Avadin, PBS solvent, 125 µMBiothin and Avadin, 125 µM Biotin and PBS, 1000µM Biotin and Avadin,                 1000µM Biotin and PBS.
This experimental data allowed us to determine the optimum concentration of surface proteins needed to achieve binding at the fastest rate, which was utilised by our modelling team to develop the GOLIT model.
Our guidance system for mammalian tissue engineering uses light activated proteins and genes that control cellular behaviour - an approach that can replace common tissue engineering approaches by overcoming current challenges.
To use optogenetics in controlling cellular behaviour, several challenges need to be addressed. We analysed natural mechanisms of tissue development and found"

Dr. Tim Setter
If the E. coli weren’t going to be in direct contact with the plant, we needed to know the optimal place to put them. We spoke to Dr. Tim Setter, a professor and the chair of the section of soil and crop science. He studies the mechanisms of drought stress response in plants. While drought is not a problem in hydroponics, flooding is. The major consequence of flooding is reduced oxygen levels around the roots, thus leading to an oxidative stress response. He informed us that oxidants may leak out from the plant roots if there is high enough stress, which informed our decision to place the bacteria around the roots of the plants.
AUGUST 2, 2017
Dr. Jed Sparks
After meeting with professors to discuss the foundational advance aspects of our project, we wanted to learn more about the bigger picture - the ecological context in which oxidative stress functions. For this reason, we met with Dr. Jed Sparks of the Department of Evolution and Ecological Biology, He told us that soils and the environment in general are usually very effective at quenching exogenous ROS, but this advantage disappears in a hydroponic setting, where the roots of the plant are no longer in soil, but in an aqueous solution. This showed us that quantifying and responding to ROS may be beneficial to the health of the plants. However, optimization is necessary to prevent interference with plant metabolic and signaling pathways that involve ROS. Once again, this led to our decision to have antioxidant expression controlled by a light sensitive promoter that could be activated or deactivated on demand to maintain a certain level of ROS.
Additionally, Dr. Sparks showed us hydroponic setups that he uses to test genetically modified potatoes. These potatoes are able to scavenge nitrogen based pollutants in the atmosphere. Dr. Sparks also gave us pointers on how to grow using a hydroponic system.
Plant Biologists
Overview
We sought out research on the core of hydroponics: the plants. We spoke to plant biologists in a number of specialties to ask whether controlling oxidative stress could benefit plant growth. Their input gave us the necessary knowledge to safely alter the reactive oxygen species level in the environment without harming the plants we are trying to grow. Through these professors we not only gained effective understanding of plant physiology but also built upon the literature we had read to gain background on oxidative stress’ effects on plants. Moreover, experts who focused specifically on hydroponic systems, helped us gain a new perspective on common problems at hydroponic farms. These insights helped us develop a concept"

I majored in Biochemical Sciences at Harvard and went on to get my Ph.D. in Chemistry at Stanford, where I studied how enzymes speed up chemical reactions that are otherwise incredibly slow. My current research at UCSF is focused on cell signaling, where enzymes play an important role. I am trying to understand how signaling enzymes maintain specificity for the correct targets and avoid signaling mixups. Being introduced to science research in high school inspired me to pursue science in college and beyond, and I got involved with the iGEM team to help share that experience with new students.

Before coming to UCSF, I was a Research Associate at a Medical Device company performing immunohistochemisty, histology, and thermal imaging. This is the first time I’ve encountered the iGEM program, and it was a great experience to see these young people work so hard as a team to accomplish a meaningful project. During the course of the summer, I gave a lecture to the Team on Tissue Culture and relevant Biosafety concerns, trained some of the students individually to do tissue culture work, and assisted with their use of the Flow Cytometer. I was really impressed with their commitment and diligence during the summer, and enjoyed having so many upbeat and energetic people in the lab.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook )."

The diagram below is the outline of achievments we already made and next plan in future.
As we known, carbon sequestration using algea or micro seaweads is a hot field with great difficulties and challenges. Our project aims to build an ideal algae with increased ability of carbon dioxide fixation and decreased the recyle of fixed bioproducts. It is a big and long-time project with lots of work to do and with great challenges.
Inspiringly we have already moved forword with several critical and important steps in the past one year:
1. Fisrt of all, our team successfully cultured two of single-cell micro seaweeds selected from several candidates. One is an eukaryotic algae of dunaliella salina, and the other one is a prokaryotic alges of synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 that finally used in this project. Sequentially we did some basic characterizations for them like growth curve measurements and tests of antibiotic sensitivity.
2.Most importantly we constructed a modularized basic expression vector and prepared a series of biobrick compatible parts like promoters, terminators and cassettes of selectable markers. On base of these works, we can easily make compatible expression vectors and test different regulation parts in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic alges or even in other chassis. And we made a workable expression vector for synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.
3.We tried several commonly used transformation methods like electroporation, natural transformation and biolistic transformation, and succesfully transformed and expressed a reporter gene of EGFP and two carbon fixation genes which may help to promote the carbon fixation efficiency of this algae.
4.In order to increase the density help the alga to sink as designed, we should express metal binding proteins at the surface for absorption of metal irons. Because of the lag of some fundamental works, we fisrt use Escherichia coli as a model instead of synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 to test our assumptions. We quickly validated most of our design"

Plant Synthetic Biology
Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

However, it exists few case where a drug can be sold with no AMM:
The Temporary Authorization of Use (ATU): if a drug doesn’t have any AMM and has significant positive result in the clinical trials, doctors can be authorized to prescribe the drug. But this is only possible if the disease concerned is sufficiently rare or severe.
The Temporary Recommendation of Use (RTU): grant the possibility for a doctor to prescribe a drug if there is no other possibility of treatments, with conditions ruled by the ANSM
Doing further analyse on how our box and the protein It produces could be used in the market, we thought that we could produce protein or hormone used in the livestock industry.
Maxime has then given us insight on how such molecules could be authorized: In France, and on the European scale, the companies that want to sell a new molecule on the European market, must get their products assess buy the European Food Safety Agency (ENSA). They will go through a process where they must produce a study the risk of their molecule, and the result will be analyzed by the ENSA, which will allow the molecule if it doesn’t present any harmful effect for the human and animal health and doesn’t show any unacceptable risk for the environment. If allowed the molecule will be registered in the list of authorized molecules. To be then authorized in France the molecule will be analyzed by the French regulating agency for food and sanitary security (ANSES). The ANSES will verify if the molecule registered has the right composition, and basically, do a similar work as the ENSA.
This whole process is much shorter than the AMM and can take up to 3 to 5 years.
Pools Harvard
The survey reached thirty students from different teams and from several countries. The majority of participants come from academia (53.33%) and industry (30.00%).
Overall, this study shows a very positive opinion on biomanufacturing. Indeed, even if more than half of students do not feel sufficiently informed or trained on biomanufactring, the vast majority of students think that biomanufacturing presents a sustainable alternative to traditional manufacturing techniques. The survey reveals that most of the participants value that, with further research, biomanufacturing technologies will outperform traditional manufacturing techniques in terms of financial efficiency.
Though, many students deplore the facts that the connection between academia and industry in biomanufacturing research is still pretty weak and that negative public perception deters investment in biomanufacturing.
When analyzing these data, you should keep in mind that all respondents participate in iGEM competition"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," We attempted to use an Agilent Quick change multi site-directed mutagenesis kit to   remove the illegal sites. Unfortunately, this kit was also unsuccessful. We then learned that the strains of E.   coli that we had available would not be able to replicate the pKD4 plasmid and this was the reason for our failed   transformations.
DNA degradation
We had hoped to develop a CRISPR based kill switch building on the work of Caliando and Voigt (2015).  We designed the spacer array to target three essential genes polA, rpoC and topA using the deskgen platform. We selected three protospacers within the CDS of each essential gene. The cleavage sites were   designed to be in the first third, the centre third and the final third of the CDS. The spacer array was designed  to be carried on the pSB1C3 plasmid under the control of a constituitive promoter (BBa_J23100). Our aim was to   investigate how many essential genes would be needed for the kill switch to be effective, whether some genes   were more effective targets than others and whether targeting multiple protospacers simultaneously was more  effective than a single cleavage site. We designed primers to obtain the Cas9 and tracr RNA sequence from BBa_K1218011  provided in the distribution kit. After several attempts transformations remained unsuccessful. The spacer array could   also not be produced as a G-block due to the high number of repeating sequences. A CRISPR based kill switch was shown   by Caliando and Voigt (2015) to be stable for many months when integrated into the genome at multiple loci. Making this   system available to iGEM teams could greatly improve on the short comings we have shown in the stability of toxic protein   based switches carried on plasmids. If a system of this kind were to target just the synthetic DNA that had been introduced into the organism, the system would prevent release of synthetic DNA into the environment without the high selection pressure of death. This would potentially allow the switch to be retained for longer.
Ministat
The modularity of the ministat allows several environmental conditions to be tested simultaneously.  Future studies that would build on the work started in this project should include the testing of different  media types, growth over different temperature ranges and cultures grown at a range of dilution rates.

September 8th
Today: ticking off things to do: Doing microscopy and taking photos for the project „Odeur Cuisine“ and the Image Video. Creating an animation video about bacteria movements. Preparing the photo session for “AphrodiTec”.
September 9th
In the very early morning we had the chance to make the session in the photo studio. Afterwards we had to choose one from more than 150 portraits that becomes the cover picture of “AphrodiTec”. Meanwhile in the project room sodium alginate and calcium chloride were mixed to take some more microscopy photographies afterwards that will end up in the “Odeur Cuisine” Images. Defining the script of the image video. Now the filming must start.
September 10th
The movie from the ""sustainable luminous advertising"" got finished and uploaded to Vimeo.
September 14th
The Product ""AphrodiTec"" gets visible - today we worked on a series of photos that tell stories around that product. Our project room became a photo studio and with some requisites and models we created the pictures atmosphere. Afterwards the first ""pit crisps"" grew in the armpit - product visualisations on the assembly line.
September 15th
The final 3D visualisation of the bacteria stadion for the bacteria game were presented after long and hard architectual construction and many briefings. Ongoing we´re animating an real bacterial struggle in the middle of the stadion.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html,"-383) (Figure 3.1). For PEX26 we use the truncated version published in Halbach et al. (Halbach et al, 2006) .
Figure 3.2 Concept of secreting peroxisomal contents to the supernatant. For the secretion, the membrane anchor Pex15 or Pex26 is used. This anchor is used to decorate peroxisomes or our modified compartments with the v-SNARE Snc1. For the secretion Snc1 interacts with the t-SNAREs in the cell membrane. Induced from this interaction the vesicle and cell membrane fuse and the content of the compartment is secreted to the supernatant.
We verified our secretion using beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter protein. In 2012 Stock and colleagues described the GUS reporter assay for unconventional secretion (Stock et al, 2012) . With it, it is possible to determine whether a protein is secreted conventional and is N-glycosylated or secreted unconventional and not N-glycosylated. GUS is a bacterial protein with an N-glycosylation-site, which is active only if the protein is not N-glycosylated. The GUS-activity can be measured with different reagents in plate or liquid assays. Liquid assays can be applied qualitatively as well as quantitatively to measure differences in activity. If GUS is secreted by the conventional pathway the N-glycosylation leads to inactivation of the enzyme (Stock et al, 2012) (Fig 3.2).
Figure 3.3 The GUS Assay. GUS secreted with an unconventional secreted protein like Cts1 from Ustilago maydis active in the supernatant. GUS secreted with a conventional Signal peptide (Sp) inactive in the supernatant. If GUS is in the cytoplasm there is also no activity (Lysis control) (Feldbrügge et al, 2013) .
GUS will be imported to the peroxisome with the PTS1 sequence and measured quantitatively in the supernatant. We will use a coexpression of GUS-PTS1 and Snc1-Pex15 or Snc1-PEX26 to identify the secretion of the compounds. Furthermore, we will use GUS-PTS1 expressed in S. cerevisiae without Snc1 fused to a membrane anchor for a control. We will measure the active GUS in the supernatant"
TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#project#chitin synthase_-_-_TEXT.html," domains of NodC. The NodC protein has strongly hydrophobic domains which indicate that it is an integral or transmembrane protein. The plot shows three transmembrane sequences. The plot was made with the TMHMM website. [8]
The NodC protein has strongly hydrophobic domains which indicate that it is an integral or transmembrane protein (Figure 3). Interestingly it is only found in the inner but not outer membrane of Rhizobium leguminosarum [10] . In contrast to most eukaryotic chitin synthases, NodC does not have a translocation domain for chitin. Therefore, the chitin synthesis is accomplished in the cytoplasm. NodC belongs to the class of glycosyltransferases which catalyze the transfer of sugar components from an activated donor molecule to a specific acceptor molecule [11] .
Mechanism
NodC is involved in the synthesis of chitin oligosaccharides, but only with a polymerization degree up to five. In earlier studies it was shown that investigating this CHS in E. coli is possible and leads to good results [12] .
NodC uses UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as a sugar donor, which is a precursor for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and therefore present in growing bacterial cells.
Another advantage is the unique property of the NodC which allows it to produce chitin pentamers in living E. coli without exogenous acceptors [3] . If an acceptor molecule and the substrate are added to the purified enzyme, the reaction can also be done in vitro.
The mechanism of elongation proceeds by a successive nucleophilic substitution reaction at C1 of the UDP-GlcNAc – molecule (Figure 4). UDP departs when the O4 atom of the growing sugar chain attacks as a nucleophile [11] .
With a low concentration of UDP-GlcNAc NodC produces a mixture of trimers, tetramers and pentamers and with high concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc it produces pentamers solely. It almost exclusively directs the formation of pentasaccharides [3] .

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," is normalized on the bioluminescence intensity of the corresponding negative control. Mann whitney statistical test was performed (ns : non significant, * : significant, ** : very significant, *** : extremely significant)
The bioluminescence intensity of all our samples was compared to the bioluminescence intensity of the negative control for each time after toluene injection. Mann Whitney statistics test were realized to determine whether the bioluminescence intensity of the sample was significantly higher than the bioluminescence intensity of the negative control.
On the graphics we can notice that the bioluminescence intensity increase as the time after toluene injection increase. However, for the highest concentration (10 mg/L), a decrease in the bioluminescence intensity can be notice 5h30 after toluene injection. It is due to the accumulation of gaussia luciferase and the impact of toluene on the cell metabolism and especially protein synthesis (for more information click here ).
Therefore, it is essential to realize our bioluminescence test at a precise time after sampling. As we want to detect environmental toluene concentration (less than 20ng/L), it is to be suitable to wait 5h30 before proceeding to the bioluminescence test. We did not incubate our bacteria with toluene for a longer time because of the effect of toluene on E.coli cells. We though that this effect will decrease our biosensor sensitivity and precision.
Investigation of detectable concentration 5h30 after toluene addition to the cells medium
As we determined that it was preferable to wait 5h30 before realizing the bioluminescence assay, we decided to focus on the results obtain for this time after toluene addition in the cells medium. We studied the evolution of the bioluminescence intensity according to the toluene concentration added in the cells medium 5h30 before. Those tests were realize in triplicates.
First of all, we wanted to ensure that the OD of the different samples is the same 5h30 after bacteria inoculation in presence of toluene. As shown on the Figure 11, the sample’s ODs are quite similar going from 1.464 to 1.61.
Figure 11: Sample's ODs depending on the toluene concentration added 5h30 before.
The bioluminescence intensity of each samples was then determined and shown depending on the toluene concentration. As we are dealing with extremely different toluene concentration, it was preferable to give our results in function of the logarith"

Collaborations with Team:BIT
The Background of Collaboration
It was in the NCKU IGEM Conference that we met BIT team. At first, we were just interested in the project they worked hard for. They built two separate circuits to produce two kinds of integrase. The integrase Bxb1 and FimE are seemed like two keys to open the “lock” which is referred to the terminators. Furthermore, their functions are series-wound. It was a coincidence that we have studied the modeling part of ETH:Zurich 2014 IGEM Team in the survey and investigate at the beginning of our modeling assignment. In the past studying, we had learned a lot of techniques of modeling from theirs and we were convinced that the project of BIT are very similar with that of ETH:Zurich 2014 IGEM Team. As we thought that we had known about some parts intheir ciucuits before, we proposed that we would like to assume some of their modeling work. And they accepted, also expressing that they would like to help our USTC Team with our device. Figure 1：The Circuits of 2016 BIT IGEM Team’s Project
Method
In the modeling for BIT, as the two circuits are nearly the same, we choose one of these two circuits to model. We applied mass-action law to the whole biology process, and acquired several differential equations. We used MATLAB R2014a to solve these equations and we got the relationship between the rate of flipping the terminator from on state to another and the GFP final concentration.
Figure 2：The Relationship of kt and The Concentration of GFP
Also, we got the relationship between the Kmlac and the Proportion of terminators turned off.

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.
Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain"

SYSU-Software,2014,Team:SYSU-Software#meetup_-_-_TEXT.html," USTC-Software iGEM team
From Aug.14th to Aug.17th, 4 members of our team went to Hefei, China and take part in the iGem software track meet up arranged by USTC. In these 4 days, we not only had parties with students from different schools, but also went mount climbing with those guys which is super exciting. Yet the most crucial part and the main purpose of our coming to Hefei is of course the idea exchanging section during this meet up. USTC set up 2 rounds of presentation for all of us, one in Mandarin and the other in English. In that way, we could show our work to other members, inspire them, give them ideas of improvement, and practice our oral English at the same time.
Moreover, judges from USTC also gave us precious advises about how we could make our work and presentation better and be more competent to the final prize.
Members of SYSU finished the task smoothly. We articulated our work and ideas and our team leader Nie Peng also shared his experience with the audience about how to make iGem software professionally, which brought the whole meet up to an end perfectly.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," Dichroic filter is made of organic dyes and other chemicals. It absorbs light at certain wavelength. Again, it is more accurate than the coloured gel filter, but significantly more expensive. We looked more into interference filters and rough calculations show that if we want a wavelength of 609 nm to pass, the material in the middle of the filter will need to have an index of refraction (n) = 1.35 and the thickness would be 225.55555 nm. Possible materials include  10 percent glucose solution in water ( n = 1.3477), 20 percent glucose solution in water (n = 1.3635), Teflon ( n = 1.35 – 1.38), and ethanol (n = 1.361).
We wanted to commence testing as soon as possible and therefore have put in several purchase orders for products so we have our required materials.  After more research into light sensors and potential filters we were able to locate affordable and applicable materials that we will be able to use to build our device.  Firstly we bought an Arduino Uno microcontroller for the team as the one we have currently been programming belongs to a member of our modelling sub-team. We also ordered an educational kit for Arduino Uno that includes instruction manuals and materials as well as useful parts for the construction of our future circuits such as resistors, capacitors, sensors, and LED lights.  Additionally we have purchased a Parallax ColorPAL-Color and Light Sensor instead of a simple light sensor as we came to the realization that it would be difficult with only one sensor to differentiate between multiple diseases if all of them use RFP as the reporter. Initially, our idea was to excite RFP with yellow light (or UV light is another option) and detect the emitted light (609 nm wavelength) using a light sensor and a filter. However, if the reporters indicating the presence of different diseases were that of different colours, then a colour sensor would be able to directly differentiate between them. We also ordered two temperature sensors so we can keep our device at constant ideal temperature dictated by the requirements of isothermal PCR and an 3W LED light if we need to excite the RFP. Our team is planning on formally drafting an initial design of the device after the meeting with our microfluidics expert to determine the features that this technology could impact the appearance and logistics of our project.  We found an bandpass filter  that allows light of wavelengths between 604 and 616 nm to pass through (the emission wavelength of RFP is 609 nm). The filter could be used in"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," the supernatants there was a colour change from clear to yellow in all of the tubes, even the control.  For a negative control catechol was added to M9-MM and this solution became pink.   The tubes were incubated on the bench and checked regularly.  The colour changed from yellow to pink to brown when they were left on the bench overnight.
Week 15 (August 7 - August 10)
Desulfurization
Sequencing results for J13002/hpaC returned negative, so a 3-way ligation method was used to retry the construction. The following parts were ligated with the restriction enzymes indicated in brackets after each: J13002(E/S) + HpaC (X/P) + PSB1K3 (E/P). Also, the more conventional construction of J13002(S/P) + HpaC(X/P) was reattempted. Furthermore, 3-way ligations were also attempted for B0034+KatGLAA+PSB1K3, and R0011+B0034+PSB1C3, as well as the two-way contruction of just KatGLAA after the B0034. After plating these transformations, colony PCRs were carried out on selected colonies and various samples that gave an indication on the gels  of being successful were used to prepare O/N cultures then subsequently miniprepped.(insert gel images!) With regards to the site-directed mutagenesis side of the experimentation, dszA-PstI1 (the first PstI cut site in dszA) , dszB-PstI and dszC(PstI2 mutated)-PstI1 mutagenesis were performed following the procedure explained in the previous week. The gel below shows the successful result of digest confirmation.  Multisite mutagenesis was repeated again using the modified buffer (half Taq ligase buffer and half Kappa buffer). However it was not successful again. We also tried doing multisite mutagenesis using pfu Turbo polymerase and following the Knight procedure without any modifications. No successful results were observed.
Decarboxylation
We ran the gel on the CAR and NPT colony PCRs from last week, but unfortunately these gels were blank. Another colony PCR was performed, with 12 colonies from each of the following plates: CAR/PET, NPT(X/P), NPT(E/P). Both NPT plates did not look very promising, as they were completely covered by red colonies, with only a few white ones. Many of the white colonies from the"

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM visited the Ithaca Farmers’ Market as well as the Ithaca Commons during our annual Apple Harvest Festival to collect survey responses. We also visited the Great New York State Fair in Syracuse to gather responses from people across the state of New York. Stony Brook collected responses at their campus and online. Altogether, we had 92 survey participants. Our survey questions can be found here . We hope that other iGEM teams will follow our lead and conduct similar analysis in their communities.
Key Takeaways
A larger percentage of people in Stony Brook claim they know what synthetic biology is compared to people in Ithaca. This relationship is statistically significant (p = 0.01).
A larger percentage of people in both Stony Brook and Ithaca believe that synthetic biology/genetic engineering has a positive impact on the world.
However, many people still believe that synthetic biology should be limited to certain areas in future science.
There is a negative perception of the term GMO compared to the term synthetic biology. This reveals that there is a stigma against the phrase “genetically modified organism” even if the idea of synthetic biology is actually not opposed.
Demographics do not significantly affect perceptions of synthetic biology.
Regional Differences
When we started this survey, we wanted to know if people’s perceptions of synthetic biology changed depending on where they lived. Would people be more accepting of synthetic biology in New York City or Ithaca? What do they foresee in the future for genetic engineering? We had lots of questions, but few answers. Our survey allowed us to see the bigger picture.
We first asked, “how would you rate your understanding of synthetic biology?”. A summary of their answers can be found below:
Figure 1: Frequency count of people describing their understanding of synthetic biology
While the graphs of both locations have the same shape, it is clear that in Stony Brook, a larger percentage of people in their sample claim that they know what synthetic biology is compared to the percentage of people in Ithaca. After running a T-test, this was confirmed to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.01. This is an interesting result, since Cornell is a larger institution with easy access to events, seminars, and programs. However, perhaps it shows how segregated Cornell’s student body is to our community, and how we need to interact with our town more.
We also wanted to know how people felt about synthetic biology, so we asked “how do you feel about the impact of synthetic biology on the world?”.

Mr. Oertel (translated): We think the need to fight malaria is getting more relevant. There are about 500.000 deaths and 200 million[malaria infections and 80 percent of these deaths are children below an age of five. That is mainly due to too strong medication needed for proper treatment of malaria. The new therapy we develop focusses on a fosmidomycin, a medication that can be used for treatment of children. That is why we thought our ideas fit together and I thought about something like a virtual net. Bill Gates contributed thousands of nets across Africa to fight malaria, but unfortunately these nets ended up in the environment e.g. used as fishing nets and due to their size also fished way to young fishes. They help a lot if used properly, but a virtual net, which would be my spontaneous idea, that consists of a triplet of approaches could work.
Oda (translated): But also, we need to test the reach of the traps. There are just some things we can not anticipate yet.
Mr. Oertel (translated): No, no but this would be something you could work towards. For me the title should be virtual net, but I do not know if that fits your ideas.
Alex (translated): This is the potential. The deciding tests will be carried out at the Bernhard Nocht Institute and depending on the results we will develop our project.
Bjarne (translated): Also, we hope to contribute to the fight against malaria like you mentioned in your vision. One can easily forget, that there are so many lives on the line and you can really make a change, save lives, change lives.
Mr. Oertel (translated): We also like the practical approach. You can always research more and spend more money like the Bill Gates Foundation does, but in the end, they spend a lot money on artemisinin and similar therapies. The big danger are upcoming resistances in Africa. That already happened in Asia, even in London three people died coming back from their travels and they could not be saved using special artemisinin based therapies. If that happens in Africa, the results would be devastating. Now there are Chinese workers coming over, as the Chinese have invested a lot in Africa and build up infrastructure and they could bring along the resistant malaria strains. This problem has not been a topic in the public, but it is there. Now the people start to think what is next, what do we do now to fight malaria. Fosmidomycin can"

Abstract
South China University of Technology (SCUT) is one of China's key universities operating under the direct leadership of the State Ministry of Education. The university, which has a total area of 294 hectares, is situated in Guangzhou, a southern metropolitan in China. The university has two campuses: The Wushan Campus and Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center Campus.
History
South China University of Technology (SCUT), formerly known as the South China Institute of Technology, was established in 1952. In 1960, SCUT was awarded ranked among the key universities of China. In 1981, it was authorized by the State Council to confer doctor degrees and master degrees, and was among the first universities in the country to do so. In 1995, it was selected as one of the universities into which China will make significant investment in the 21st century. In 1999, it wasrated ""excellent"" during the Undergraduate Teaching Assessment, and was among the first ""Excellent Universities of Undergraduate Education"" in the country. In the same year, a national science park was established with the authorization of State Ministry of Technology and State Ministry of Education. In 2000, Graduate School was authorized to be established. In 2001, the new cooperative construction of State Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province was implemented in SCUT and it was listed among the top universities in the country. After 60 years of development, SCUT has become a multidisciplinary university focusing on engineering, combined with science, also promoting well coordinated development of management, economics,humanities and law.

LifeStraw:
When thinking about how we could package our E. coli, we came across LifeStraw UK. They make a plastic straw, designed with a filter inside that stops bacteria from getting through when you use it to drink water. We thought - by using this structure - we’d have a good way of storing our bacteria, as they could be placed in a casing within the pre-existing filter; it would allow the spiRNA to pass through due to their small size, but not the E. coli. This filter could be placed in any container of water.
Army:
In order to gain more of an insight into the difficulties of accessing clean water and keeping up good sanitation in less developed countries, we got in touch with our local army medical squadron (‘225 Medical Regiment’). They were able to tell us about what measures have to be taken in order to prevent any spread of illness when out on duty, including with cases of cholera and shigellosis. This really helped us understand how our idea could fit into becoming a prevention in the real world. After talking to them some more we found out the army like to transport goods from charities to where it’s needed such as mosquito nets, and we thought perhaps this could be one solution to our distribution problem. However, there was a problem that we hadn't though of; a high percentage of the goods given away are either sold at markets or just left unused. So we had to come up with a way of stopping this from potentially happening to our prevention - what could we make that would be unimposing, ethical, and of little resale value?
We discussed this further, and the people we were speaking to suggested a water bottle would be a great way of solving this, as they are needed by many in order to store and carry water – they’re even fought over. So, if we were to put our filter design and the water bottle idea together, we would create a product the people in developing countries would use: a water bottle with a removable filter that could be placed onto any other bottle. Whilst the original bottle may potentially be resold"

During this cross-discipline seminar, we delivered lectures on cutting-edge scientific discovery related to synthetic biology and introduced our project. We enlightened audience about biological design by organizing hypothetical iGEM brainstorms and eventually, student representatives from audience shared their thoughts with the crowds, whose ideas impressed us with their imaginative designs. They then received souvenirs for their courage and good exhibition.

D What does the game tell us?
     After we further explored the game we created by ourselves, we find something more than just having fun. In fact, our game E.coli War has many deep meanings for us to explore. We have found it really interesting when we compare our game theories with typical historical events, which expands our games’ meaning to a historical and strategic level. Our smart team member Li Siting did such innovative work, which makes it possible for us broaden the usage of synthetic biology to social science and history research in the future. It is a brand new way for science advocating as it strengthens the story-telling ability of science and makes the public more interested in science. Therefore, it is very likely that we have made a huge step forward in the efforts to create science culture in our community. Click here for more details .

Safety
For iGEM 2009 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. Therefore we should consider the following four questions:
1) Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety
public safety
environmental safety
In our opinion none of our BioBricks or ideas raise any safety issues as mentioned here.
2) Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is in our Department, Department of Biotechnology, indeed a Biological Safety Officer(BSO) who is responsible for the safety in the labs. In general in the Netherlands there is a very strict regulation about biosafety and working with genetically modified organisms.
The lab we work in is an ML1 lab. Each lab within the department has a person responsible for checking whether or not the rules are followed. The persons who are allowed to work in the labs should pass a Biosafety test first. In case someone want to visit our lab we should ask permission form the BSO.
3) What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
We spoke to the BSO about our project. We had to provide the BSO a table containing the micro-organisms, plasmids and genes we used for our project. As long we do not infringe the rules the BSO is satisfied.
The Dutch ministry of Housing, Spatial planning and the environment made an overview of micro-organisms and vectores which we are allowed to use for genetic engineering, we are also able to use derivatives of these vectors. We had to check the list of micro organisms and plasmids we used with the overview made by ministry of Housing, Spatial planning and the environment in order to see we do not infringe the rules.
4) Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
We do not infringe the rules with our new made BioBrick parts and our BioBricks do not raise any safety issues. We are"

Troubleshooting different enzymes showed a non-functional XbaI
Digest of parts using slow XbaI
We began this week trying to ligate the pENTCUP2 promoter, NosT terminator, and NosT terminator plus stop codon into the V0120 vector.  We ran into several problems during this process.
We had previously digested the three inserts as well as the promoter with XbaI and PstI fast digest enzymes, ligated, and transformed the ligated vectors into e. coli.  Unfortunately, we did not find any colonies of cells after over 14 hours of incubation.  Furthermore, on Friday June 18th, after digesting all three inserts and vector and running them on a gel, we did not see any NosT + stop DNA.  Therefore, on"

UTI-INSPIRED, BIOFILM-TARGETED MICROBIAL WEAPONRY
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious human diseases in the world, with some 150 million cases occurring globally per year. It is also the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections in the developed world, accounting for approximately 40% of documented cases in the United States in 2009. On average, UTI accounts for more than 1 million hospitalisations and $1.6 billion in medical expenses each year in the USA alone.
Uropathogenic E. coli is the leading cause of UTIs. It is responsible for 80-85% of community-acquired UTIs, whereas for hospital-acquired UTIs, other bacteria such as P. aeruginosa also play a significant role. Among the UTIs acquired in the hospital, about 75% are associated with the use of urinary catheters, tubes inserted into the bladded through the urethra to drain urine which in 1 in 4 hospitalised patients end up receiving.
Bacteria like to live as sessile communities adhered to surfaces instead of isolated planktonic individuals. These immobilised bacterial communities protect themselves by creating biofilms (what we typically call bacterial slime), jelly-like coatings comprising a mixture of long carbohydrates, proteins, and DNA molecules. In the context of UTIs, such biofilms are responsible for causing inflammation as well as providing a safe haven in which the bacteria can replicate and mature. Biofilms have accumulated within their matrix enzymes that destroy antimicrobials; this helps protect embedded bacteria against our immune system as well as administered antibiotics. Biofilms associated with UTIs can form readily on both the surface of our living cells and that of the inserted catheters, and result in infections that are largely recurrent and chronic, even after antibiotic administration.
Given that antibiotic resistance in UTI-causing bacteria is such a significant problem that it warrants even multiple specific mentions in WHO's recent antimicrobial resistance global report, the administration of prolonged-courses of antibiotics in attempt to treat biofilm-protected UTIs would of course be ill-advised. Clinical resistance towards even last-resort antibiotics like carbapenems and tigecyclines have surfaced, and at present there has yet to be any antibiotics capable of degrading and destroying bacterial biofilms released for clinical use.
Inspired by how UTIs, both their own clinical significance and with respect to the bigger picture of modern"

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"25] . If the antibiotic waste contains other chemicals or organisms it must be disposed accordingly. Guidelines and regulations can vary among institutes and nations, so it is important to learn the routines where you are working.
The following table shows how to dispose some of the most common antibiotics, based on degradability. For a more extensive list, see reference [23]
Degradability
Disposal
Antibiotics
Easily degradable
In the sink*
Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Penicillin
Inactivated by heat
Autoclaving before disposal in the sink
Gentamycin, Tetracyklin, Erytromycin
Withstands heat / autoclaving
Hazardous, disposal as toxic waste
Kanamycin, Ciprofloxacin, Vankomycin
*Some institutes recommend to autoclave before disposal [26]
The management of antibiotics and other drugs in the society is complex. In every handling step there is a risk of spread to the environment; during the production, transportation, usage (both clinically and in research) and waste treatment [27] . To minimize waste hazards, the antibiotic should be degraded on site or be put in sealed containers and sent straight for incineration in specific facilities.
The largest usage of antibiotics however, occurs in regular households and a smaller fraction, about 10 %, in hospitals. Drugs that are not broken down in the body are excreted through urine of feces and end up in treatment plants [28] . In the treatment plants the drugs can face three destinies: degraded, disposed into the water, or disposed in the sludge. There are different techniques to clear the water including ozone, active carbon, and UV-light combined with oxidants [28] . It would be of great benefit to reduce the amount of antibiotics. A concept derived from the SMITe treatment is that, after the biofilm has been dispersed, smaller doses of antibiotics will be required to treat infected wounds. This would thus reduce the amount of disposed antibiotics into our ecosystem.
From person, to population responsibility for antibiotic resistance
Through our in depth research into the problem of increasing antibiotic resistance, we became highly concerned at the scope of the problem and the threats resistance entails.
We considered it essential to spread the knowledge and understanding (as well as a little fear) on the subject to our peers, friends, relatives and beyond and have worked on several university- level ways of achieving this. Part of this effort is the creation of physical cards that serve as quick and easy reference for students and researchers.
Introducing the concept early"

I like the enthusiasm and dedication of the Vilnius-iGEM team. It started as a grassroots movement and quickly developed into an excellent team. Students learned quickly how to generate ideas, communicate and raise funding. I believe they started the iGEM generation in Lithuania. I wish I was a student again.
