Most of the work was made by the team but we would not come as far as we reached now without some help. We have formed mostly from junior Molecular Biology and Genetics students and we will not be able to achieve that process without assisting. We are glad to take the opportunity to acknowledge, learned to look from different perspectives and troubleshooting with the assistance of the people who formed us. We want to thank them all!
Principle Investigators

Urartu Şeker is a principal investigator at Institute of Material Science and Nanotechnology in the Synthetic Biosystems Lab Group. His main research is the synthetic biology at the Bio-Nano interface. We thank to our main supervisor Asst. Prof. Şeker because of his team spirit to bond us together and always available for our questions. He have made such effort to build that team and has a huge influence on young brains to get involved in scientific projects.
Işık Yuluğ
Işık Yuluğ is a principal investigator at department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in the tumor suppressor genes. Her main research is transcriptional mapping of human chromosomes and molecular genetics and biology of inherited cancers. Assoc. Prof. Işık Yuluğ is the secondary supervisor and was always available for questions and help throughout the project.
Advisor
Musa Efe Işılak
Efe Işılak is a previous iGEM competitor and now doing  a master’s degree at UNAM. We thank to him for listening to us patiently  in our long meetings. He always comes up with solutions and his perspective enables us to learn doing trouble shooting.
Other Teams
Our team is inspired  from 2014 WHU China iGEM team when we are developing our biosensor. They designed the construct, one of the constructs we used. HxlR - pFor duplet to sense formaldehyde which has part number BBa_K1334002. However, when we built our construct from the kit we could not manage to obtain precise induction data. We designed our own HxlR - pFor duplet with a few differences and at the end we obtained positive induction datum. We thank to 2014 WHU China Team in order to improve our project and make us learn how to do troubleshooting.

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," local biosafety group think about your project?
We met the chair of the ethic committee of Paris Descartes, and they advice us to keep thinking of the human practice part, while providing us some interesting thoughts.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
We created a Biosafety page on the part registry that should list all the safety mechanisms and systems available on the part registry, with the links to their description and experimental characterization. We would like to suggest next generations of iGEM teams to consult this page, to find a system that would be useful to increase the safety of their project. We also collaborated with the iGEM Grenoble team, who proposed an additional section to the description of Biobricks™ which would explain their potential danger, and the ways to assess the risk.

Tom Burkett
Thomas Burkett is the founder, past executive director (2012-2018), and current board chair of the Baltimore Under Ground Science Space (BUGSS). Tom is also a Professor of Biology at the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC), where he started and managed the schools biotechnology and biomanufacturing program until its demise in 2012. Currently he teaches introductory biology with a strong emphasis on biotechnology -although he is really looking forward to his upcoming retirement from CCBC.
Tom survived physical and analytical chemistry to earn a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Chemistry and Biology at Western Washington University. He came to Maryland in 1986, expecting to stay two years to earn his Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Molecular Biology at University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC 74-54!). A classmate, Susan (who is now his wife), convinced him to stay and heâ€™s been a resident of the Free State ever since. Along the way he managed to convince a dissertation committee at the University of Maryland, College Park to award him a Ph.D. degree in Microbiology for his work at the Frederick Cancer Research Facility on suppressors of insertional mutations in the yeast S. cerevisiae under the guidance of David Garfinkel.
Tom bounced around for a few years after graduate school sailing (thatâ€™s another story), researching the use of Ubiquitin fusions for protein expression at IGEN, Inc., and conducting research on the oyster pathogen Perkinsis spp. In 2000 he joined the faculty of CCBC to start the schools new Biotechnology"

Hudson Lee is a New York City native currently on the   Pre-med track in his third year at Columbia College as   a Biology major with a Psychology concentration.  He   was a member of the 2015 Columbia NYC iGEM team and   hopes to attend medical school upon graduation.  His   Myers Briggs personality result is INFP and emoji of   choice is :trollface: as he enjoys messing with his   friends in his spare time.  Other pastimes include   several styles of dance including hip-hop, multiple   styles of ballroom, and long walks on the beach.
Vincent “Venti” Liu is originally from Beijing, China   and moved to Walnut, California five years ago. He is   a sophomore at Columbia Engineering majoring in   Computer Science and also pursuing a minor in   Statistics. Previously, he had worked in two molecular   biology laboratories while in high school and spent a   year in a biomaterials laboratory at Columbia. He   boasts a Meyers-Briggs personality of ESTJ “The   Executive”, which he thinks is the best of all. As a   consequence of his altruistic personality and   muscular, 6’3 physique, lab members respectfully refer   to him as The Spotter, and not surprisingly his emoji   of choice is, which really isn’t even a choice of   his; it just makes sense. In his pastime, Vincent   enjoys photography, bartending (exclusively for his   friends, sorry), practicing Krav Maga, and getting   swole. Though very cool, Vincent is actually chill and   friendly, unlike the ostentatious and self-obsessed   James.
Theresa Mensah is a rising junior from Accra,   Ghana. She is a Biochemistry major with research   experience working with the Immunology Department of   the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical   Research. Upon graduation, she plans to either   immediately pursue a PhD in either Pharmacology or   Immunology, or take a year off to intern with WHO or   L’Oreal. Her Myers Briggs personality is INTJ, The   Architect.  and her fave emoji is ^0^, because it can   portray amusement, alarm, gloating, excitement and   shock all at the same time; an amalgam of emotions,   that is of course, necessary to portray at   times. Theresa's leisure activities include learning   languages (speak 5 fluently, and 3 like a   kindergartener, hey, I'm trying!), volunteering to   teach high schoolers"

Transformation Results
After carrying out the transformation protocol on 20/8/2018, the plates were left for overnight incubation. After ~14-18hr incubation, the following results were observed:
All colonies on X-gal plates were white, possibly suggesting that LacZ was disrupted and kanR is present in the cell. However, to exclude false positives, a crucial control is required: BL21DE3 on LB+X-Gal+IPTG, to reassure that the parental strain has intact lacZ in the first place.

NPU-China,2018,Team:NPU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our achievements of these four aspects that we have learned                         from                         the                         above                         exchanges and activities:
1.Bigger Picture of Safety:
We learned about China's genetically modified regulatory system, evaluation system and the laws                         and                         regulations                         pertaining to the research or commercial promotion of genetically modified gene from the speech                         by                         Mr.                         Zhang Xianfa,                         Deputy Secretary General of the National Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety                         Management                         Standardization Technical Committee and Deputy Director of the Department of Genetically                         Modified                         Biosafety                         and                         Intellectual Property of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of                         Agriculture.                         [1]
We confirmed that our researches are highly in compliance with relevant national laws and                         regulations.                         Also, we have                         strictly reported the safety-related project information in accordance with the requirements of                         the                         iGEM                         Organizing                         Committee and participated in the safety training of the laboratories. No safety incidents have                         occurred                         since the                         project was launched. (see Safety for details)
We resorted to Jiang Huifeng, a researcher specializing in biocomponent design and chassis                         modification,                         for his                         views on the safety issues of “artificial life”. [2]
Additionally, we were delighted that we happened to learn the GMP standard for medical Oligos                         synthesis                         from TSINKE                         BIOTECH and learned about their work on the strict control of medical primer safety. [3]
2.Bigger Picture of Project Importance：
From the speech by Academician Zhao Guoping, we learned that the “convergence technology” that                         combines                         bioinformatics, big data and synthetic biology is the future direction of development of life                         sciences.                         Being an                         innovative exploration, our project is intricately entwined with bioinformatics and synthetic                         biology.                         [4]
Our project has been unanimously affirmed and encouraged by Researcher Jiang Huifeng [2],                         Professor                         Gu                         Zhenglong                         [5], Researcher Dai Junyi [4], Dr. Du [6], etc. They maintain that our work is a brave                         scientific                         exploration that                         can provide empirical reference and research basis for artificial life research, mitochondrial                         research,                         and gene                         synthesis. Professor Gu Zhenglong [5] even directly proposed his willingness to cooperate with                         us                         for a                         longer time,                         hoping to further expand the research based on our work.
Dr. Xue Xiaoli [1] has set up a positive example for us to create a single-chromosome genome of                         Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae, inspiring us to challenge the"

Description
Synthetic cell-cell communication systems
Cell-cell communication is critical for the physiological functions of diverse organisms. Even in bacteria, populations can monitor their own density and achieve coordinated expression of target genes. From the engineering perspective, cell-cell communication serves as a versatile regulatory module that enables coordination among cells in and between populations. Synthetic communication systems are required for the engineering of microbial consortia, which is an important new frontier in synthetic biology. Without synthetic communication systems, members of the microbial consortia can not communicate with each other, thus the division of labor in the microbial consortia can not be achieved. Synthetic communication systems can be used to enable dynamic gene regulation and facilitates the generation of reliable dynamics at the community level. Challenges in the area of synthetic communication systems remain the limited number of independent communication modules, crosstalk between signals, and interspecies communication. The development of new communication modules is needed to address each of these challenges.

Synthetic communication systems using AHL-based Quorum sensing systems from Gram negative bacteria
The most popular tools for engineering communication systems are based on quorum-sensing (QS) systems used by bacteria to sense and respond to changes in their local population density. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to monitor their population density for the purpose of controlling various group activities such as virulence or luminescence. By coordinating group behaviors, bacterial communities can enhance their ability to adapt to nutrient-limited conditions, defend against assaults from competing microorganisms or host immune systems, and improve their ability to acquire new genetic material that could potentially lead to antibiotic resistance.
The acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-based QS systems from Gram-negative organisms have been engineered extensively. Take the LuxI-LuxR system as an example, the AHL molecules are synthesized by the LuxI protein. The extracellular AHL molecules are imported into the cytoplasm to activate the transcription factor LuxR, which controls the expression of genes. The Natural LuxI-LuxR system can be split into signal Sender cell and signal Receiver cell. Synthetic AHL-based communication systems have been used for a variety of applications including triggering biofilm formation, constructing synchronized oscillators, generating patterns, sensing pathogens, developing synthetic ecosystems.

During one of the courses our team participated in during our second year of the bachelor, our current advisors introduced us to the iGEM competition. From this moment on they helped us with brainstorming about a suitable topic, advising us how to set up a research properly, and answering all our questions, sometimes with more questions. We are really grateful for all the time and faith they have put in our team! Please find a short profile for each of our advisors below .
prof.dr.ir. L. (Luc) Brunsveld
Prof. dr. ir. Luc Brunsveld is a professor at our university. During our bachelor, all our team members have attended his courses, mainly concerning chemical biology, like Biochemistry or Molecular Cell Biology. Now he also advises us during our iGEM project, which we are more than happy with! For a more extensive biography, click on the arrow:
Luc (Lucas) Brunsveld (1975) received his PhD degree in 2001 under supervision of prof. Bert Meijer at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Topic of the thesis was the self-assembly of designed molecules into helical architectures in water. Subsequently, he moved as a Humboldt fellow to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, to work on the protein semi-synthesis and evaluation of lipidated Ras GTPases in the group of prof. Herbert Waldmann. From 2003-2004 he worked as a group leader in the medicinal chemistry department of Organon (now Schering-Plough) in Oss, on nuclear receptor medicinal chemistry.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Iodine Test on Transformed Bacillus subtilis with gfp-rrnb
After plating out single colonies from the transformed plates and incubating them overnight, the starch test, which consists of placing the incubated single colonies over some iodine crystals was performed the next day , to confirm that the transformed B.subtilis can break down starch.
The single colonies before going through the iodine test.
From the picture below, it can be seen that two of the single colonies plated out has halos around it, suggesting that it has not transformed properly.

York,2017,Team:York#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," some unknown or unnoticed error, it was made consistently in every one of the co-cultures with 100 μL inoculation. No relevant conclusions can be drawn from this. However, considerations such as the growth limiting factor of the TP.Maltose may work in our interest as to avoid culture saturation with LW06.
An obvious error, in hindsight, is the issue of the 10 μL inoculation. It is likely that a much higher volume added to the culture would have improved the results. This would have provided a high enough cell density, should growth have not be great enough during co-culturing with the modified C. reinhardtii in TP media. Overall co-cultures with these two organisms are possible, but higher OD/volume of inoculant may be needed.
Constructs
We constructed several plasmids to attempt the introduction of MEX-1 into the outer membrane of C. reinhardtii. The figures, below, show maps of these plasmids and our evidence that we correctly made the constructs.
Plasmid Maps
Figure 16: Backbone pLM005
Figure 17: pLM005 + MEX-1
Figure 18: pLM005 + MEX-1 + Signal Peptide
Results: We used plasmid pLM005 as our vector (see figure 16), which is designed specifically for the expression of eukaryotic ORFs and incorporates a YFP fusion at the C terminal end of the recombinant protein, so we could detect localisation of our edited MEX-1 to the outer membrane.
Cutting of the plasmid at the two HpaI sites removes a small fragment of the plasmid and provides the insertion site for the recombinant gene. Once amplified, the vector is cut again at the eco-RV sites (not shown) to produce a cassette for transformation directly into the C. reinhardtii genome.
We successfully cloned and inserted the MEX-1 gene into the pLM005 vector (see figure 17, gel electrophoresis and fluorescent microscopy images below). Our strategy for relocation of MEX-1 (which is a chloroplast membrane protein [5]) was to remove the signal peptide of MEX-1 by PCR cloning and assemble the truncated MEX-1 gene with the signal peptide sequence of known outer membrane protein ACA3 (see figure 18). We were able to successfully assemble this construct (see gel electrophoresis), however we did not manage to successfully transform it into C. reinhardtii.

NCTU_Formosa,2015,Team:NCTU Formosa#more details_-_-_TEXT.html," designed a lecture to teach them synthetic biology with simple concept. What’s more, we promoted iGEM to them with introducing different iGEM projects, and conveying the essence and values of iGEM that we have realized during the processes. At last we also share our project with them specifically, the main idea of our biobricks and goals. After the lecture, we received some great response from them. All of them were fascinated by the idea of using enzymes and different assemblies of biobricks to create new functions, and interested in participating in iGEM. Hope all of them have the opportunity to become an iGEMer, enjoying the processes just like us

Doctors visit
Thursday, July 16th An oncologist visited our university, we grasped the opportunity and we talked to the doctor and elaborated our project. We were wondering how we will help patients with our project and if we really provide a better way to prediagnose. After a long discussion about the practical use of our project and the advantages. The doctors aid he was pretty amazed by our intelligent idea that we just use ecoli to prediagnose. That simplified the procedure and rose the efficiency. We were so excited that our project could also be applied well in practical use. It could really help people!
1.  Can the antigen concentration of after treatment of targeted drug be detected by serum?
Ans: Yes, not only serum test but also through biopsy.
2. In our project, we use the antibodies directly from targeted drug, is there anyone else who use the same method?
Ans: Yes, people have been using antibodies directly from targeted drug to test if the patient is suitable for this kind of therapy. That’s why the department of pathology not only uses biopsy but also detects all kinds of markers before using targeted drug therapy.
3. Has anyone tested EGFR, VEGF and HER2 markers?
Ans: Yes, these 3 markers are all detectable through serum test and biopsy.
4. Is Elisa use in hospitals?
Ans: Yes, the elisa technology has become more and more mature. It’s accuracy is higher and the quantization of the result is also improving.
5. Which part of cancer therapy is Elisa used?
Ans: Elisa is used before and after treatment.
6. Besides of IHC and FISH, are there other detection methods before breast cancer treatment?
Ans: There’s a lot of other methods, but IHC and FISH is the two most common methods.
7. Is there an unclear detection limits when using cell staining"
TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Orange_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to degrade itself after receiving the destructing signal.
3) Delay device
It is important that there is a time delay between the moment of passing the SDP and the destructing of it. If the SDP is degraded to fast after conjugation, the degradation of the SDP will not be detected. Therefore we construct a device in this system which delays expression of the endonuclease.
Some potential applications for this project are
Grasping of bacterial communication - the communication between bacteria using DNA can advance through bacterial networks, and in this sense our project would allow to send multiple messages in a single DNA, thereby to better understand those bacterial communication networks.
Understanding of bacterial antibiotic resistance - these days, bacterial infections are often treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, bacteria have the tendancy to pass antibiotic resistance to other bacteria through the process of conjugation , thus making the antibiotics useless. Using our project, it might be possible for future researchers to better understand the mechanism by which antibiotic resistance passes among bacterial colonies, and perhaps even inhibit it
The Team
This is the second year, TUDelft participates in the iGEM competition.  The group consists of 7 students, 3 instructors and a lot of advisors from TUDelft willing to help out and think with us when it is necessary. An overview of the people involved and our competences can be found on the team page. With our 7 participants and 3 instructors, we are enthusiastic to start working on our project: Cell to cell communication with re-engineered plasmids.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," biological interested students to choose a scientific direction. Even though the pilot scheme has gone well and the trial period has been expanded a couple of times, the law still restricts the possibilities of working with genetically modified organisms. One of the guidelines that the law prescribes is that only plasmids approved by the Danish Ministry for Children, Education and Gender Equality can be used for transformation in Danish high schools and therefore it is time consuming, expensive and difficult for teachers to be innovative in their classes.
New tools that are easy to use and contribute to a high quality level of education in biotechnology are needed to get more students interested in science so Denmark’s position as an innovative country can remain.
The Idea
Last year’s iGEM team from DTU initiated an exciting project that would allow high school students to be innovative in solving national and global problems in medicine, food and environment overcoming the troubles with money, time or the law. The project originates from the BioBrick standard and is called Biosensor. The project is about designing and creating biosensors by choosing a detection gene and a response gene, ligate them and transform it into an approved E. coli strain. The first idea was a simple free exercise for high school students, but the project has developed over the year and now has three elements: a lab kit, a website and competition.
Figure 1:The general idea of assembling genes as one assembles LEGO® bricks.
×
DESCRIPTION
The Biosensor Exercise
The exercise consists of three parts and a test:
Digestion of selected genes (2 hours)
Ligation of genes (1 hour)
Transformation of biosensor (3 hours)
Test of biosensors
The smart thing about this schedule is that each part takes between 1-3 hours and can be paused by freezing the DNA after each part, so it fits into classes. Examples for biosensors that can be made from the kit:
A biosensor that can detect when lactose is present and produce lactase to break down the lactose, so lactose intolerant people can drink milk
A biosensor that can detect light, and when no light is detected produce luciferase that makes light
Or just a simple biosensor that can detect mercury in cans with tuna and respond by turning red
Like the Danish company LEGO® there are many different combinations and they can solve many different types of problems.

Team description from the early days
We are a very ambitious group of 9 students from five different disciplines: medicine, biomedicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, mathematics and chemical engineering. Because we didn’t know each other before the team was formed, we expected to evolve as a group and learn to use our differences - both professionally and personally - to achieve a synergetic teamwork. We have big expectations for the team, the competition and ourselves. We are prepared to use our holidays (and the only sunny months in Denmark) to work hard on a meaningful project that will, hopefully, be of use to someone. We want to do"
BIT,2014,Team:BIT-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," express normally the sRNA which inhibit the target gene in the box2.So we could measure the enzyme activity of the β-galactosidase which expressed by the lacZ gene to explore the inhibition efficiency of the sRNA we designed.
According to the Michaelis-Menten equation of the enzyme kinetics, we found the best training time of the second seed is 5.5 hours and the best reactivity time after adding ONPG is 30 min in the process of the β-galactosidase assay.
As you see, the inhibition efficiency of the sRNA-ipgC is about 60% and the sRNA-sicA is about 35%. Apparently, the sRNA-ipgC has better function than the sRNA-sicA.But both of them have function of inhibition. Next step, we will continue to explore their structure to get better results.

3. MIN SYSTEM
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Min system consists of MinC, MinD and MinE. MinC protein is the real division inhibitor. And MinD, as a kind of ATPase, is believed to function by activating a MinC-dependent division inhibition mechanism [1]. Additionally, MinE is a topological factor.
Under normal conditions, MinC and MinD act in concert to form an inhibitor of cell division (Fig.3-1(a)). When combined with MinC, MinD increases the activity of MinC by 25~50 times [2]. The MinC and MinD division inhibitor is required to prevent separation at the potential division sites at the cell poles by preventing formation of the FtsZ ring [3]. However, the MinC and MinD division inhibitor lacks site specificity without MinE, for it prevents separation at all division sites——both polar and central (Fig.3-1(b)). The role of MinE is to give topological specificity to the MinC and MinD division inhibitor [4]. It suppresses the action of the division inhibitor at mid of the cell, allowing FtsZ ring assembly at this site, but not at the cell poles.
3.2 IDEA AND DESIGN

Safety
Please visit the Safety Hub to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.
On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can go beyond the questions on the safety forms, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an ""induced lethality"" or ""kill-switch"" device
Safe Lab Work
What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!
Safe Shipment
Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?"

They will add it to their interface and make a working search function. In addition, I made an executable of my crawler for Linda - I learned how to make a console application and have it accept a search query in the command prompt. In the afternoon, I began a new project: the primer designer. I attained some of last year's code (the Optimus Primer) to read over and understand the project.
July 10: Beginning the Primer Designer Backend
I actually began working on the back end of the primer designer today. I made several methods - one to generate the hairpin possibilities when given a primer sequence, one to eliminate the first and last possibilities, and other methods that run various tests on the sequence to determine if it can be used or not.
July 11: Continuing the Primer Designer Backend
Coding with our intern Madeleine
Today, I continued to work on the primer designer logic. I added more methods, including one to calculate Gibbs' Free Energy and one to return the worst case of Gibbs Free Energy. These methods are used to conduct three tests: the hairpin test, the self-dimer test, and the hetero-dimer test, all of which return the worst case scenario.
July 12: Finishing the backend
I spent the morning fixing bugs, and by noon, the backend was working very well. When a sequence is put in, the system runs through the tests and returns a primer with all the alignments shown. In the afternoon, I began designing the primer designer user interface - I followed our paper prototype and coded on Microsoft Visual C# 2010.
July 13: Working on the UI
First page of the Primer Designer UI so far!
Second page of the Primer Designer UI
I dedicated the entire day to the primer designer UI - the appearance is mostly done, with text labels, buttons and textfields. The SurfaceListBox does not have items in it yet. I followed several tutorials throughout the day to get the hang of the syntax and styling.
July 16-17: Problem with touch
I used a majority of both days to figure out how to drag and drop from the SurfaceListBox to a ScatterView. I tried several scenarios, changing ScatterViews to SurfaceListBoxes and StackPanels, but was unsuccessful in getting it to work. I was stuck for a long time because the touch did not seem to register at all on the SurfaceListBoxItems, so I went back to my methods and went through them many times.

It was a game based on simple color change reactions called colorimetric reactions is used in laboratories to find many different types of proteins in samples such as blood, saliva, sweat etc. We had 96-well plates with some of the wells including protein and some without protein. Every player had a chance to learn how to use automatic pipette and try to find hidden proteins from the well.
We also helped Heureka to set up Pipetting by Numbers activity where visitors were again able to use pipette and create together an art piece. We created one platform for this activity and from Bio Festival came another we also took care of. It was fun to watch how patiently some of the visitors were coloring the pictures really neatly. Some of our team members were also enjoining a lot of this relaxing activity which was really close to mindfulness practices, if you had a stable hand!
March For Science
We attended a peaceful march - March For Science, in order to make the point that in this, cynically named, ""post-factual"" era, science is not highly valued. It is important to tell people that science is the way of acquiring knowledge - even if it is based on probabilities. The trending other opinion, trusting individual experiences, is far more likely to be dangerous for both the individual and our environment. Science is incredibly difficult to grasp, if you are not a scientist, and that is exactly where Public Outreach comes in. Let us help people understand science!

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

There was a significant difference in the GFP expression between the Golden Gate and Gibson Assembly constructs (Mann-Whitney, U=483, n=25.25, p<0.05).
Figure 1 The mean expression levels of a synthetic GFP reporter gene, taken from 5 replicates, constructed by Gibson assembly and Golden Gate assembly in a TOP10 Escherichia coli chassis, measured as Arbitrary Fluorescence Units/OD600. The GFP expression levels were compared in LB media and measured every hour over a period of 24 hours. The GFP expression levels were compared to a synthetic GFP construct in an E. coli chassis as a positive control and a non-fluorescing E. coli device as a negative control. The E. coli cells were grown at a neutral pH over 24 hours, at 37ᵒC and 220 rpm. Error bars represent standard error.

The 5-alpha strain containing the synthetic reporter construct which was grown in LB media, at 37ᵒC and a neutral pH, had a higher final GFP expression level, at 6.18x105 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 1.69x105 AFU/OD600, compared to when grown in SOC media which was 4.08x104 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 1.76x104 AFU/OD600 at 24 hours (Figure 2.1). There was a significant difference in 5-alpha GFP expression between LB media and SOC media over 24 hours (Mann-Whitney, U=854, n=25,25, p<0.001). The GFP expression of the 5-alpha strains grown in both LB and SOC media decreased during the initial 4 hours of incubation, during the lag phase of growth followed by a substantial increase in expression in LB media over the remaining 20 hours and relatively constant expression level for the final 20 hours in SOC media.

To help us, USYD heard our woes about being unable to express our parts, and stepped up by cloning BBa_2022000 and BBa_2022010 into their pET expression vector. Interestingly, upon using a Western Blot to detect expression, we found that our although their cells expressed our RFP-fusion part, they weren't turning red, which was the first hint that there was an issue with our part...
To help USYD, we performed a Western Blot on induced cells (supposedly) expressing EtnR1 and  EtnR2, the two proteins that underpin their project. We determined that they were in fact expressing, and were delighted to let them know that!
Outside of the lab, we attended a STEM presentation together with the USYD iGEM team, where we opened the eyes of school students to the possibilities of having a career in the STEM field.
We also attended an evening event hosted by the University of Sydney, for Australian iGEM teams to practice their presentations before the Giant Jamboree.
Paris-Bettencourt
The Paris-Bettencourt iGEM team reached out to us early on in the iGEM season, due to our team’s proximity to a wine-growing region. Paris Betterncourt’s project focused on wine-fermenting bacteria, and thus required biological samples from wineries (such as soil, branches, leaves and grapes).
Our team made the road trip to a wine valley in upper NSW, and collected some samples for Paris Bettencourt. We posted these to Paris Bettencourt, who graciously received them. We hope this small contribution on our part helped their project as much as it could!"

All strains were grown overnight and the next day they were diluted to an OD of 0.05 in the afternoon. At the end of the afternoon at an OD of 0.4-0.6, all cultures were induced with a final concentration of 0.01% arabinose. All induced cultures were put back into the incubator (37C 220 rpm) and grown overnight. The next morning, the OD of all cultures was measured and diluted to an OD of 0.2 in LB (in final volume of 1mL). The OD and GFP (470/510) of all samples were measured in a plate reader in quadruplicate.
The data obtained from the fluorescence measurement were converted to relative fluorescence and are shown in figure 5. To convert the fluorescence to relative fluorescence we first divided all measured fluorescence values and divided them by the measured OD's. Next the fluorescence/OD of the negative controls (samples without pSB1C3) was subtracted from the other samples. Next, all normalized fluorescence/OD values were divided by that of the positive control (no pBad:pSB3C5 without gRNA).
From figure 5 it can be seen that all fluorescence values are quite similar for the samples without gRNA. Further we can see a clear decrease in the relative fluorescence of dCas9 in combination with gRNA 2 and 3. For gRNA's 1 and 4 the relative fluorescence of the dCas9 is similar to that of the samples without the pBad vector. For dCas9VRER we showed CRISPR interference in combination with gRNA's 1,2"

Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Thankfully, with the tips from Mr. Chen, we can get closer with the students step by step. First step, we divided the students into group of four or five. Second             step, we told them if they answer the question they can get a point, the team with most team can get a prize at the end of the class. This news really make all of them go crazy.
We started the lesson with a lot of questions, and they are all trying their best for the prize. Later, we will talk about the answer of the question.
Followed by the lessons are some experiments. For example, after we talked about the blindspot we taught them the blindspot experiment.
However, WEEK ONE highlight is definitely when we talk about the persistence of vision. We start this topic by asking them their favorite animation which make them really excited. After that we asked them whether they know how to make             animation, which we got a lot of funny answer, children’s imagination is really beyond our imagination. Finally, we gave them the last lecture of WEEK ONE, and it is time for the last experiment, the animation stick. The kids are really excited             about the experiment, and make every effort to draw it pretty.
Their final work are all amazing and really surprised us. Some of them even begged for one more chopstick because it is too much fun, they want to do one more time.

What to do if you accidentally drink the strong acid or base?             How to prevent the accident happened?
Experiments
The Electrocyte Experiment
Materials:
a LED light bulb(traditional light bulb is alright but the LED one is brighter), wires, batteries, three beakers filled with strong electrolyte, weak electrolyte and non-electrolyte respectively (we use salt solution, pure water and sugar solution)
Steps:
Ask the children which solution can light the lightbulb.
Put in the batteries, put the end of the wire in the solution, if the solution is electrolyte, the circuit can be complete, thus the lightbulb will light.
The groups that guess it right win.
Let the children compare three solution.

Potential future applications, ethical considerations, such as that of GMO crops, synthetic organisms and human enhancement, and the responsibility of scientists to communicate their findings in an unbiased and effective manner was broached to give a more holistic view of the discipline. We strongly question the idea that all ethical questions in synthetic biology can be answered by applying the classic normative ethics schemes such as those of deontology or teleology. Thus, we encouraged the listeners to form their own opinion by presenting them with a multitude of different approaches to ethical analysis.
At pre-allocated times during the seminar, the floor was open for discussions. Many listeners approached us to discuss their angles in regards to the discussed topics. A general trend in the exchanges was a prevailing worry of ecosystem disturbance as a result of GMO crops and the use of synthetic biology to produce bioweaponry. To our surprise, the idea of unnaturalness was not a topic that people seemed terribly invested in, which caused us to review our previous conclusion - based on available literature - as to what the public would find troublesome. Thus, it helped us improve our strategy of communicating our project to society by guiding us to what aspects were perceived as more important to elaborate on.
We want to thank iGEM Chalmers Gothenburg for investing a lot of time and effort into making sure that the seminar was the best it could be.
IKEA
Throughout the year, we have evaluated different strategies on how to raise awareness on the continuously growing microplastic problem. While connecting with the public through news media and by hosting lectures enabled us to have a personal dialogue with our local community, we realized that to facilitate change on a larger scale we had to collaborate with an established ecoconscious organization with international ties.
As a world leading enterprise promoting environmental sustainability through a socio-economic conscious perspective, IKEA has made impressive strides toward redefining corporate social responsibility for the modern world. With the implementation of IWAY, the IKEA way of purchasing products, materials and services, IKEA has set a new standard for good business ethics in multinational corporations. Among the things that have been incorporated into the business model are the use of completely renewable or recycled materials, environmentally focused streamlining of their supply-chain and product development and promotion of social equality and fair wages, with a constant search for opportunities to expand their efforts [4].
With this in mind, we contacted and met with their sustainability department to discuss IKEAs proactive and reactive strategies of combating microplastic pollution, in particular with regards to their use of synthetic textiles in their"

 Best therapeutic project
Our approach aims at being simple, targeted and precise, but at the same time it can have a global impact and touch also the poorest countries. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is the the future of medicine as it is highly customizable and efficient. We focused our project on one particular problem although our proof of concept can be extended to basically any pathogenic bacteria able to accept the plasmid we engineered!
At first, our project was designed to neutralize bacteria that multiply in stagnant water. We have conceived this work for a first test on Salmonella. We could then consider targeting other pathogenic bacteria the same way like V. cholerae and multi-resistant nosocomial bacteria. Apart from this situation, we could make a prototype to render inactive the nosocomial bacteria that become resistant in the hospital environment. Similarly, we could create a protective film for the prostheses before their implantation.
Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest problems in today’s medical world. With our technique, we offer a potential new treatment against these multiresistant pathogens. This idea represents a new hope… by provoking a war between bacteria… or, if you prefer, a BactWars.
Our therapeutic project is not static, it is dynamic and it opens up the way for new improvements, ideas, applications. We created a therapeutic tool, now it is time to use it the best way possible! It is a new idea, but it is made of bacterial tools that we already use. It is very specific but it can have a global impact and touch a large number of people, especially in the poorest areas and it can be effective in a short time.
It would be the ideal solution in Cholera Outbreaks which are normally sudden and very widespread! The low cost of our solution would make it interesting for those areas, and could be a great alternative to chlorine tablets currently used for water purification. Even though their cost is low, they are often used the wrong way and their effects don’t last enough time.
Our main goal was to fight Antibiotic Resistance, but the plasmidic CRISPR"

Lethbridge,2012,Team:Lethbridge#projectbackground_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymes phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and acetate kinase (ACK) produce acetic acid as a part of normal metabolic processes13,14. The acetic acid efflux protein Aata from Acetobacter aceti pumps acetic acid out of the cell and helps confer acetic acid resistance15. Optimizing production and secretion of acetic acid by E. coli can provide an inexpensive method for generating large amounts of acetic acid for MEOR.
Biosurfactants for MEOR:  Chemically synthesized surfactants have previously been used successfully for EOR. Biosurfactants are currently costly to produce but have higher biodegradability and lower toxicity16,17. Rhamnolipid produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been extensively studied as a biosurfactant and causes significant reduction in interfacial surface tension between oil and water to enhance oil recovery16. One of the major costs associated with biosurfactant production is sustaining culture growth, which can be overcome by using sugars produced through carbon fixation or through the use of inexpensive sugars in the culture media, such as molasses17. Increasing the commercial viability of rhamnolipid production with engineered E. coli can be a beneficial addition to using acetic acid for MEOR.
Preventing environmental contamination:  Safety measures will be taken to eliminate any risk of environmental contamination by genetically modified organisms used in MEOR. Enzymes called proteases act to degrade proteins in the cell, preventing cell proliferation. Incorporating proteases into the bacterial genome will allow us to control growth with specific culture conditions. Using a light-repressible system, the expression of the proteases will be repressed under a specific wavelength of light that can be supplied in controlled growth conditions. Any bacteria released into the environment and no longer exposed to the required wavelength of light will begin to express the proteases and will be rendered inert.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content3_-_-_TEXT.html," later, scientists from MIT used less than 3 gene devices to do the digital operation in division, logarithmic and square root. Thus, constructing gene circuits as electronic devices have become possible. From their research, their cellular calculator which uses analog computation has more advantages in computing efficiency in part count, speed and energy consumption compared with digital computation[7].
Figure 1: Different kinds of log-domain analog computation.
Due to the fact that our circuits can generate a steady oscillation, it is possible that using our circuits as a sinusoidal signal generator.
Signal generators, such as function generator (including sinusoidal signal generator), are electronic devices that generate repeating or non-repeating electronic signals. As an important part of basic circuit studies, they are generally used in designing, testing, troubleshooting, and repairing electronic or electroacoustic devices.
What's more, Li Guang-bi from TUST reported that they have constructed two kinds of electronic circuits which well simulated the gene oscillator. This indicates that our circuit can develop to a new kind of gene sinusoidal signal generator[8].
Figure 2.This picture shows a kind of electronic circuit generating the oscillation wave.
Figure 3.This graph shows the generated oscillation wave.
Future Version Trilogy
We blueprint our next step developing oscillatory gene circuits in following steps:
Step One
Complete our project by cleaning every obstacle on our way to oscillation.
Confirm that every part is functioning as expected;
Amplify the effect of different copy numbers;
Complete the comparison of different strains' effect on oscillation;
Complete the comparison of different EGFP & sfGFP effect on oscillation;
Confirm most suitable microfluidic parameters for oscillation;
Optimize our model
Step Two
We will make our oscillation a controllable one by integrating the catalase gene into the circuit.
Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen. It catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since our lab is studying Shewanella oneidensis, and its catalase protein has showed outstanding performance in catalyzing H2O2. So we thought we could integrate the catalase gene into our circuit and under an artificial inducible promoter, by which we can decide when to start this catalase gene and stop the oscillation.
Step Three
Realize everything we imagined in APPLICATION!
Make our circuit function as biosensor, cancer cell killer and gene sinusoidal signal generator.

Also, Caleb has always found it curious that he can't remember not existing, and has thus concluded that he must be immortal. Lately, he's considered the possibility that the universe is merely a product of his mind, and that we'd all cease to exist if he were to die. After cogitating on whether such a view would commit him to solipsism, he's concluded that other minds can exist within the gestalt of a greater, emergent consciousness – viz., his own.

UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools#Notebook#Doug's Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," as well as a feature list spreadsheet. Anne joined the team this week.
Week of June 15th, 2008
We met with Prof. Anderson to demo Clotho and begin to talk about advanced features for the project.
We have decided that Clotho will be composed of the following four areas:
Connectivity
Algorithms/Tools
""Lim"" support
Unique design entry and views
The optimal assembly algorithms were discussed and Anne will be implementing the infrastructure to support them this week. Chris Batten and Will will be working with her to get started and to make sure that Clotho allows for the implementation of multiple algorithms and user input and output.
Here are some screenshots of interest. They display the sequence view in Clotho as well as the ability of the tool to connect to and query mySQL based databases for parts.
First pass at Clotho's sequence view
The sequence view shows the sequence for the current design. It is based on ApE's interface currently.
First pass at Clotho's interfaces to mySQL connections and a preliminary parts navigator
These windows show how mySQL database connections can be specified. This stores multiple connections with one currently active connection. The user can select from any previously created connection to be active. Upon connection, the available fields are shown. The user then can select the primary field used for organization.
In the navigator, the parts for the various connections are shown. If a part is double clicked, the part information comes up. These connections can be searched, as well as have parts added, removed, or modified.
Week of June 22th, 2008
Now that I am back from my wedding, I ""finished"" the mySQL connection pieces. There are a number of new features including:
Much more robust part information window. This includes the ability to export selected fields to any connection in the system, an icon associated with each part, and the ability to edit and recognize modified parts. Editing is unified across all parts info screens in that if editing is selected in one, then it toggles across them all. This is more of a safety thing and allows a global variable to control editing.
The parts navigator now allows you to delete roots (connections). Basically this ""un""populates items.
Dialog boxes and option panes now are present at all critical decision points.
You can save, load, and set to default mySQL configurations
You can remove previously created connections as well as store them
Search is implemented. This works on any connection available in the system and dynamically details which fields are available for search.
Here is a snap shot of the new pieces

Integrate findings of Human Practices investigation into design and execution of project:
Our team member Donnchadh went to Malawi for 6 weeks. He thoroughly explained the concept to the Medical Laboratory    Scientists in the hospital, they also filled out a survey. He spoke to the local people about science and our aims    with the iGEM project. He also spoke to a witchdoctor about modern science and the medicine it is capable of producing.
Donnchadh discovered in his survey of hospital workers in Malawi that there is a need for more rapid testing of certain    diseases which can be done cheaply and simply. He found that running machinery in these countries can be expensive so a    low cost alternative such as BaseHunter is favourable.
In our talks with experienced biomedical scientist, Dr. Brigid Lucey, we found that a niche exists even in developed labs    for a rapid diagnostic for TB. As Mycobacterium tuberculosis is slow growing, it is difficult to culture. For this reason,    lab results are often delayed even weeks for a confirmation of results. Basehunter could provide a simple and rapid method    to identify M. tuberculosis in samples. For this reason we designed a Mycobacterium tuberculosis detector and began to verify    that it functions as well as the other detectors. In this way,"

The coming week, we did new ligations with BBa_J23100 and BBa_R0040.  The robot did two trials and I did one manually.  However, this time we checked for bubbles before we continued on.  When the ligations were done we noticed that there was a huge bubble in both samples.  I had to pop each bubble by using a pipet tip.  This time however, the volumes were consistent and though they were still off it was not by much.  The first robot trial had a total volume of 16.8 ul and trial two had a total volume of 14.9ul.  I then transformed them onto ampicillin plates.  The next morning there was an obvious difference between the amounts of colonies on each plate.  There were about 365 colonies on the manual plate while there were only 27 colonies on the first robot trial and 5 colonies on the second robot trial.  The lack of colonies could have been due to pipetting errors and not having the ligase and buffer on ice.  Therefore, I tried to do a master mix with the ligase and buffer so pipetting 1 ul would not be so difficult for the robot.  Everything continued well until transforming.  While transforming I added the 25ul of alpha cells into the ligation pcr tube instead of the 1.5ml empty tube.  I still ligated the parts but the likely hood of it working was very low.  Surprisingly, some colonies actually grew but the trial was pointless as we could not test it properly.  The nanodrop concentrations for the manual and robot rials were the following:

NCTU_Formosa: Project Improvement
Improvement - Finding more pest-resistant candidates for former NCTU_Formosa
- Using the same method SCM to build pest-resistant peptide prediction system
     To improve the project of NCTU_Formosa 2016, we applied SCM to make an insecticidal peptide prediction system, using a quicker way to search for their target peptides and leaving them a group of potential target peptides.
Content:
Datasets
Results and the candidates we suggested
     The way we use SCM to cure fungal diseases is just a part of its ability. In fact, the peptide prediction system based on the SCM can be specialized in different cases of evaluating sequences.
     We decided to apply the method to NCTU_Formosa 2016, which utilized spider toxin to kill the pests. We introduced the scoring card to the insecticidal protein to see whether we could"
Hong_Kong-CUHK,2012,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#SAFETY APPROACH_-_-_TEXT.html,"3], we obtained several repeat sequences of E. coli strain K-12. Although repeat sequences from different sources may not be exactly identical, similar characteristics can be found.
We also tried other tools for repeat design. An online CRISPR database CRISPRdb (http://crispr.u-psud.fr/) as recommended by 2011 USC iGEM team provides repeat consensus of different strains [4].  
(b) Spacer Design
PAM (Proto-spacer Adjacent Motif) is located adjacent to the proto-spacer, upstream for a sense strand or downstream for an antisense strand. This 3-bp motif is essential for the proto-spacer recognition by Cascade complex. In E. coli, Cascade tolerates at least four PAMs, CTT, CAT, CTC and CCT in an antisense strand [5].
Seed sequence, as indicated in the graph, is another essential for spacer design. Mutants on seed sequence may lead to “escape”. Thus for these 7 base pairs, the crRNA must complement to the target DNA. In our design, we have the whole spacer to be completely complementary to the protospacer, so does the crRNA. Therefore, the problem of ""escape"" due to the mismatch in seed sequence is not crucial.
The designed length of spacer in our CRISPR system should be 32bp.  The spacer is specially desigened to target on the genomic DNA of a typical strain of E. coli, K12 MG1655. It is a non-coding DNA sequence since it is important to confirm that the factor causing the death of E. coli is due to the cleavage of its genomic DNA but not the malfunction of the gene being targeted, so a non-coding DNA sequence is preferred than a coding DNA sequence. The selection of the non-coding DNA sequence of E. coli K12 MG1655 is random, and the 32 bp is taken from 121595-121626 (GenBank: U00096.2 )
Back To Top
III. Expected Result
Firstly, we need to test if the proposed system present in the E. coli. We Used primers to amplify the Cas3 and cascade proteins from E. coli K12 genome DNA. Expected band size of cas3 2.7kbp and cascade 4.4kbp are shown in the gel photo, and sequencing has be done, which proves the existence of these proteins in its genome, thus we can utilize this CRISPR/Cas3 system as a tool for our new safety approach.

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
The sequencing results for isolated plasmids xccl(T7)_His, bpul(T7)_His and ecol(T7)_His came. The results showed that only the xccl(T7)_His was ok – our first finished biobrick *yeha*. We proudly name it <partinfo>BBa_K863015</partinfo>. The sequence of 'ecol(T7)_His showed that there are missing 4 bases in the promoter region  and the bpul(T7)_His sequence showed a mutation which leads to another amino acid in protein sequence.
Again we did PCRs on T. thermophilus laccase and B. halodurans laccase with B.halo_FW_T7 / B.halo_FW_HIS and T.thermo_LAC_FW_T7 / T.thermo_LAC_RV_HIS primers and purified the product,this time with enough material for a restriction.
Team Activity Tests:
After testing the T. versicolor laccase under conditions that are optimal (pH 5, 25°C ) according to the literature we now started further characterization under different pHs. We analyzed the laccases behavior when working in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 1, 3, 7 an 9. Result: We agree with the literature that pH 5 seems to make the laccase happy. Since not all waste waters (especially those here in Germany) are not as warm as 25°C we now wonder what our laccase might do when exposed to lower temperaturers. Stay tuned.

EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," in your estimation It should be regulated - now we are balancing public safety and community engagement.
Do you mean like bioterrorism, or things like this?
Not specifically, also that an interesting thing to talk about. Imagine I have a small lab in my garage, because it is something I am interested in. Of course these places would have to have an autoclave, for example. Does the government have or do we have a responsibility to make sure that people that run those sorts of experiments have certain equipment? Or is that something that we should trust people to follow?
Trust is usually not enough, I guess. It depends on what thing you do. Even in a real lab, there are different levels of safety. I don’t think anyone would mind you doing a miniprep in your garage.
But for your research you need the approval of a safety committee. So I don’t think there should be a different regulation if you are doing this in a company or in your garage. The same rules should apply. But then it is really hard to check everything.
A follow up question to that is “do you or other scientist you work with have to find yourself taking supplementary steps to make sure you are following safety and ethical guidelines?”
For example, do you insert kill switches into networks? Or do you screen the DNA sequence you use to be sure that they aren’t compatible with human DNA or such things?
First of all, if you apply for a grant for funding there is always a form to fill in for all safety and ethical issues. If they see that your project is dangerous or not ethical, it would not be approved.
And then, if you order DNA from companies they have to check that there aren’t belonging to certain genes. Like we mention before bioterrorism that is actually checked at this level so you can’t order some bird flu virus…
Those are standardized in the process. It is not in the responsibility of the researcher.
And it depends on the application. If you want to release synthetically modified organisms into the environment, I think you should make sure it does only what you want and it doesn’t mutate. It might be necessary that you insert a kill switch. Or maybe the modified organisms can only live if you supply a modified amino acid that doesn’t occur in nature. Imagine, modified cells are injected into your body for some medical application. You really don’t want them to go wild on you. If modified bacteria stay in a fermenter for drug production you probably mind less.
When we talk about medical uses, it’s the epitome of the conflict between safety and benefit. So you"

Killing h.p.
Our main goal is in this, eradicating from the body Helicobacter pylori that lives as the pathogen with pexiganan, which a powerful new antimicrobial peptide. In our project we use pexiganan to eradicate Helicobacter pylori because the pexiganan molecule has a powerful effect on the pathogen. Furthermore, it doesn't have a toxic effect  on our natural body cells. Pexiganan molecules’ dose for destroying erythrocytes is 250 ng/ml, the other dose for  destroying H.pylori is 16 ng/ml.
In gastric fluid acidic pH conditions, the peptide degradation speed is very high; Pepsine, the stomach’s main digestion enzyme, crushes all of the peptide structure molecules; the drug taken for gastric fluid has a very short lifetime. These are all reasons that make it difficult to set an effective dose.
Because of this reason, in our project we aim to start pexiganan synthesis only with the maximum closest reach.
We also aim to produce enough pexiganan molecules to eradicate all of the h. pylori population in the stomach.
In line with our aims;
1. With the parts described previously, our synthetic bacteria will enter into the mucosa layer where the h.pylori is in stomach.
2. We use E.coli in our treatment to continuously product DAMP-Pexiganan molecules. These continuously produce and accumulate proteins that don't have any lethal effects to the cells. Hence, DAMP-Pexiganan molecule’s active site is shut down by DAMP.( TEV protease recognition site located between the DAMP and Pexiganan molecules.) Thus, it goes to the area where Helicobacter pylori is in the stomach until the pathogen detects pexigan molecules  created by E.coli and that allow E.coli's ability to remain alive until producing enough pexiganan.
3. Due to the presence of H. pylori in the environment, extremely high concentrations of NH3 and Al2 molecules induce AND GATE the system.

iGEM Cambridge
At the European Jamboree we got in contact with the Cambridge team. Since they work on Bacillus subtilis too, we have quite a few things in common. Cambridge uses the magnificient ability of our favourite bacterium to form spores to store their sensor system.
Since the Cambridge team had trouble with their sporulation protocol, we provided the Cambridge team with our protocols and some tips & tricks for sporulation. Luckily this gave them higher yielding spores in the last weeks! We also were really happy to discuss the topic of germination with them.
Characterization of B.subtilis plasmid backbone created by iGEM LMU Munich 2012
The iGEM team LMU Munich 2012 has developed a plasmid backbone that is suitable for gene expression in B. subtilis (BBa_K823023).     This plasmid backbone contains an integration locus in amyE, which means that after being transformed into B. subtilis,     the cloned insert will be integrated with the B. subtilis genome at the amyE locus. B. subtilis is known for its     starch degrading ability and amyE is a gene responsible for the starch degradation phenotype in B.subtilis by regulating a-amylase production.
We characterized this plasmid backbone by doing a growth experiment on a starch agar plate. B. subtilis strains (168 wildtype, pSac-Cm, and K823023, clockwise respectively) were inoculated in LB agar+0.4% starch and incubated overnight     in 37oC (left picture). After the addition of 0.1% iodine, a clear zone was formed around B. subtilis wildtype and B. subtilis strain containing p"

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," is long gone and identification of such snake species is not the specialty of the medical personnel at the clinics.
Hence, if the clinic does carry antivenoms, in the majority of cases, these are polyvalent antivenoms. These broad spectrum antivenoms, which are often necessary due to unknown source of venom, must be administered at very high doses to cover the many potential venom components. This increases the vials needed, sometimes up to 10 vials amounting to $1,000 during the course of the treatment in certain cases. Making this course of treatment a hard sell for a victim without financial means or adequate national health coverage.
In addition to that, administration of antivenom comes with a high risk of side effects. Acute reactions to the treatment cause problems of equal clinical importance as the envenomings themselves. Up to 40% of the victims can exhibit severe systemic anaphylaxis, including hypotension and cyanosis. Short term sickness of pyrogenic endotoxin nature and serum sickness in the long term are common type reactions [4].
Hence, antivenom should only be used in patients where the risk of envenoming is higher than the risk of the antidote. This assessment should be carried out by competent medical personnel and ideally at a specialized hospital. Realistically at the rural clinic, where the patient is treated first.
Since time is of the essence in proper care of snake envenomation, we have endeavoured to develop a rapid diagnostic tool for the identification of the type of snake responsible in order to provide optimal clinical care.
Current Detection Methods
Numerous venom detection methods have been developed, or modified from already existing molecular biology techniques to suit the needs of the problem throughout the years[3].
In order to determine which snake is responsible for the envenoming, clinical tests or laboratory tests can be conducted. For the clinical diagnosis, the symptoms of the patient are important. Those include swelling, blistering and necrosis at the sight of the bite. Depending on the snake species, symptoms such as haemorrhage, incoagulable blood, and hypovolaemic shock are more common in viper bites, while neurotoxic symptoms are caused mainly by elapid bites.
Laboratory diagnosis depends on tests that can be carried out in the laboratory and are mainly blood tests and immunologically-based assays [5].
An agar-stabilized precipitation test was first used to detect cobra venom in bite site tissue and later, gel immunodiffusion was used to detect venoms from common Nigerian snakes. The system was not sensitive enough to"

To see whether micronutrients can be produced by our chosen system, we transformed a plasmid encoding the four necessary genes (crtY, crtE, crtI and crtB) for the biosynthesis of β-carotene into the TB43 strain. β-carotene is a vital compound, which is necessary for the production of vitamin A in the human body. A lack can lead to a weak immune system or blindness which is still common in many developing countries.
After successful production of this nutrient, we thought of a way to make this non-living chassis suitable for as many applications as possible. For this purpose, we needed to knock down one part of the Min-system.  So, we designed a modular sRNA-encoding construct to target the minC-mRNA to generate the needed knock down strain.
Results
Proof of non-propagating minicell production
Figure 2: Two populations of cells shown in a size scatter plot
We proved, that the TB43 strain that has a deleted Min operon is producing minicells and that these minicells are not propagating. Further more, we show the round small phenotype of the minicells. This leads us to the conclusion that minicells reach all our set aims for a shuttle system.
By flow cytometry and by fluorescence microscopy we can show that minicells are produced (Fig. 2,3). The minicells can be seen as a separated population in the side scatter that shows the complexity of the cells. Minicells have a lower complexity as they don’t contain any chromosomal DNA. To determine their shape and to get a better understanding of their phenotype, we additionally examined the minicells by scanning electron microscopy (Fig.4). Using strains with a fusion of HU, a histone-like protein, with the fluorescence protein GFP, we can show that the minicells indeed do not contain any chromosomal DNA (Fig.3).  Performing microscopic time-laps experiments we can confirm on the one hand the expression of fluorescent proteins and on the other hand that minicells do not propagate anymore. This is a crucial aspect for the establishment of minicells as a tool with an application in the human gut.

It can be seen that the pSB1A2 in lanes 4 and 5 have been successfully linearised by EcoRI and PstI respectively as they appear to have taken longer in the gel than the uncut plasmid (lane 3). It can also be seen that after 2 restriction enzymes have been applied, the plasmid in lane 6 has been cut into the proportions predicted in the Parts Registry.
The backbone fragment (the clearest fragment in lane 6) lies between the 2322bp and the 4361bp band which is expected (2079bp is the predicted plasmid backbone size) whereas the BioBrick fragment (fainter and just below the plasmid backbone) lies between the 564bp and the 2027bp bands which is also expected (956bp is the expected BioBrick size).
So we know that Chris French's version of the BBa_J33206 BioBrick in pSB1A2 plasmid DNA is the correct version. This DNA will probably be used further.
There are a few things that can be improved the next time we carry out DNA gel electrophoresis:
Make up some more HindIII DNA ladder - the DNA in lane 1 is the remainder of the ladder we have used for a while, the ladder in lane 7 has been made quite recently and has proven useless.
Add more DNA to the samples - the bands are quite faint (especially the BioBrick fragement) - in future we should add more

Our iGEM project gets high attention and positive responses from all life sciences teachers and even directors of the Academic Affairs Division Office at Jilin University.
To support our project and spread the influence of iGEM, our Jilin University News Network interviewed our Jilin_China 2016 iGEM Team early in 2016. Through this educational TV exhibition, we shared our project idea as well as basic synthetic biology concepts with the public. We are informed that the interview about us reached a vast audience throughout the whole University.
11.iGEM Alliance
The construction of iGEMUnion was initialized this year with the aim of providing the stage for different groups from all over China to communicate with each other. There were five teams in the iGEMUnion (BIT-China, Tianjin, Jilin_China, CGU and BIT teams), and gradually teams including Peking, NCTU-Formosa and UCAS also participated in the iGEMUnion. We constructed a WeChat group number (iGEM-Union) together and updated our progress and results in it. We also propagandized synthetic biology and iGEM. Through iGEMUnion, all teams are able to communicate their own problems and it is a good stage for teams to collaborate with each other.
12.Youth Education
We always care about the young generation, and we hope our project will have a positive influence on high school students. Therefore, we introduced our project to students at the High School Affiliated to Jilin University. They do not know much about the Synthetic Biology, so we gave a brief introduction about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition at the beginning. Then we gave a detailed description about our project. The possibility of using bacteriotherapy to cure cancer was the major topic of our talk, as the major approaches to treat cancer have been radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. We told the students how we designed our genes and how we electrotransfered them into bifidobacteriums. We also explained how our system worked. We also invited them to visit our lab. Not many students showed much interests in our presentation at the beginning of our presentation. However, more and more students showed great interest about our project during our presentation. After we finished our speech, we gave them the e-mail address of our team. Those who are interested in our project could contact our team and get more detailed information about our project and synthetic biology.

Many undergraduates who have interest in research would participant in this program and apply for projects they found attractive, which can help them get exercised in the related academic field. Since there are a large amount of students taking part in the program, experience sharing meetings are held every year to invite students doing research to share their ideas, designs, defenses, and implements. This year, we took part in the Training Program with our project of iGEM and finally got the sponsorship of the national fund. Under this situation, we are privileged to be invited as the sharer in the 2017 Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Experience Sharing Meeting held by West China Medical School, and spread our iGEM project to the audience in this meeting.
We have two purposes in this meeting, one is to introduce our project to the medical students of West-China Medical School, answer their questions and collect their advices, because we think opinions from medical students are valuable for us. After the meeting we communicated with some students having great interest in our project and expressed their concerns about the risk of immunoreaction caused by bacteria in hemodialysis device. We interpreted our plans trying to avoid this problem and decided to thoroughly and systematically think about the solution to immunoreaction.
Another purpose of us in this experience sharing meeting is to propagandize synthetic biology and iGEM to medical students. We introduced the concept of synthetic biology, the research contents of synthetic biology, the recent research progress in synthetic biology, the connotation of iGEM, our iGEM team, what we had done, etc. Many students are fascinated by synthetic biology and iGEM, and asked a lot of questions such as detailed research contents of synthetic biology and requirements for going in for iGEM. We answered their questions carefully and encouraged them to join us. Medical students with abundant accumulation of biological knowledge and further potential in research are the ideal audiences for our promotion of synthetic biology and iGEM, By this chance of sharing, we try to call on more people to join us and we hope they can fall in love with synthetic biology and iGEM.
